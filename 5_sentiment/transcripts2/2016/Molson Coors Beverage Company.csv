On the call today, David and I will take you through the highlights of our fourth quarter and full year 2015 results for the Molson Coors Brewing Company along with some perspectives on 2016. The most strategic -- important strategic development for Molson Coors in 2015 was the definitive agreement reached late in the year to purchase 58% [ph] of MillerCoors that we do not currently own, along with the international rates for the Miller brands, which is a game changing transaction for our company that's compelling both financially and strategically. Last month, we conducted a common stock offering that will fund about 20% of the total purchase price and helps us to maintain investment grade ratings on our debt. We plan to fund the balance of the purchase price with new debt and cash on hand. We have a dedicated team working towards completion of the pending transaction, which is currently expected in the second half of 2016. Meanwhile, the rest of our organization remains absolutely focused on growing our existing business and brands as well as delivering total returns to our shareholders. 
With regards to business performance, the financial results released this morning are in line with the preliminary fourth quarter financial results and updated 2015 free cash flow guidance ranges that we issued 2 weeks ago. Overall, we are pleased with the progress our company made in 2015. We exceeded our targets for cash generation and cost savings and expanded underlying growth and pretax margins globally. We grew our Above Premium business globally, including craft, flavored malt beverages and cider, we gained share of the key premium Light segment in the U.S. and accelerated the growth of for International business including an acquisition in the fast-growing India market. We continue to focus on building our stronger brand portfolio, delivering value-added innovation, strengthening our core brand positions through incremental marketing investments and continuing to premiumize our portfolio. We began to see the benefits flow through our top line performance as the year progressed. For example, Coors Light and Miller Lite both gained share in the premium light segment in the U.S. in the last 3 quarters of 2015, and Coors Light grew 0.3% globally and more than 15% in our Europe and international markets for the full year. In constant currency, we achieved positive net pricing globally as well as in multiple major markets. And these achievements are against the backdrop of a continued difficult Economy and competitive pressures along with significant unfavorable foreign currency and the termination of major business contracts as we highlighted through last year.
Our focus on growing our Above Premium segment continued in 2015 as we completed the acquisition of Saint Archer in the U.S. with a quarterly brand distribution rate in the U.K. and Ireland and repatriated the rights of Staropramen in the U.K. We also expanded our global footprint and accelerated the growth of our International business with the acquisition of Mount Shivalik Breweries in India and our recent entrance into the Colombian beer market. Our craft portfolio drove growth for Doom Bar in the U.K., Granville Island  in Canada and Blue Moon in the U.S. and also the U.K. And our American cider portfolio delivered strong growth led by Carling cider in Europe, Molson Canadian Cider and Hard Cider in the U.S.
We also used gross after capital charge as a key driver for our cash and capital allocation decisions. As a result, we drove additional working capital improvements and delivered underlying free cash flow of $704 million for the year, which exceeded our original guidance by more than $150 million or nearly 30%. [indiscernible] the approach the MillerCoors acquisition along with the Mount Shivalik, Staropramen U.K. and record transaction and the substantial restructure of our China business last year.
Additionally, we continue to transform and strengthen our business through improvements in our sales execution and revenue management capabilities. We increased the efficiency of our operations, and we implemented common global systems. To ensure that our supply chain we closed 2 bottling lines and completed our plans to close 4 breweries across our company along with the planned recapitalization of our Vancouver brewery.
We exceeded our cost reduction goal of $40 million to $60 million in Molson Coors by delivering almost $65 million of savings in 2015. And in addition, MillerCoors achieved $88 million of cost reductions in 2015, of which our share is $37 million.
In performance headlines for the full year in 2015, we delivered $1.33 billion of underlying EBITDA and $700.4 million of underlying after-tax income or $3.76 per diluted share. Underlying after-tax income declined 9% from a year ago. Foreign currency movements and terminated contracts drove the entire decline in both underlying pretax and post-tax income from 2015. Foreign currency impacted earnings by more than $64 million in 2015, while the termination of our Miller brands contract in Canada and our Modelo brands and Heineken brewing contracts in the U.K. drove an additional negative impact of approximately $40 million.
We exceeded our cash generation role in a challenging year by delivering more than $704 million of underlying free cash flow. And we expanded our path model deeper into our company. Use less, earn more and invest wisely is a common mantra throughout Molson Coors.
Net sales for the year declines 2.2% in constant currency, driven by the effect of terminated contracts. Strong volume performance in Europe and international helped to grow overall worldwide Coors Light volumes for the year. Our overall profit and cash performance along with the potential of the MillerCoors transaction helped to drive a positive total shareholder return such as tax stop plus dividends of nearly 29% in 2015, which is well above the 1% increase in the total return for the S&P 500 index last year.
Regional highlights for 2015 are as follows. In the U.S, underlying pretax earnings in 2015 were unchanged from the year before as positive net pricing, sales mix and cost savings were offset by lower volume and increased investments in marketing and information technology. We grew revenue per hectoliter and increased our percent of sales in Above Premium, and we grew our share of the premium light segment with both Coors Light and Miller Lite, driven by continued improvements with the packaging and consumer messaging. For Coors Light and consumer communication rooted in and cold refreshment is more aspirational and reaches the legal drinking age for men and women alike, while Miller Lite continues to focus as the original light beer. We began running for Coors Light 2 weeks ago, while Miller Lite benefited most with from the Limited edition Steinie bottle. Additionally, Coors Banquet grew volumes for the ninth consecutive year. And in the higher-margin Above Premium segment, we grew F&B and and craft volume with Redd's, Blue Moon, Leinenkugel's and Smith and Hard Cider brands.
In Canada, underlying pretax income decreased 5.8% in constant currency, primarily due to the negative impact of terminating our Miller brands agreement last year, along with the higher marketing and distribution costs and fixed cost deleverage due to lower volume. These factors, which partially -- were partially offset by substantial cost savings and positive pricing, which along with positive mix, drove constant currency revenue per hectoliter 2.5% higher in 2015. Canada sales to retailer STRs declined 6.3%, primarily due to the termination of the Miller contract. Excluding the impact of the loss of the Miller brands, STRs declined 2.6%. In core brands, Coors Light and Molson Canadian volumes declined due largely to increased competitor trade spend and pricing activities in regions, while we continue to invest by new advertising and commercial executions. Encouragingly, Coors Banquet delivered strong volume and share growth as the #1 new brand introduction in Canada in the past 5 years. Also in Above Premium and craft, Mad Jack Apple Lager, Molson Strongbow Cider also grew volume and share in 2015 along with our Six Pints craft brands.
In Europe, 2015 underlying pretax income decreased 5.7% of constant currency, driven by the termination of the Modelo brands and Heineken brewing contracts in the U.K. Excluding the impact of the contract termination, Europe's ongoing business grew volume, sales mix, gross margins and underlying pretax income in constant currency. Sales volume increased in 7 of 11 countries and for 6 of our 11 lead brands in the region. Carling grew share of its segment in 2015, and trends continue to improve as the year progressed while Bergenbier grew volume and segment share in their core markets. And Above Premium portfolio performed well with Coors Light, the Sharp's Brewery portfolio led by Doom Bar and our lighter craft portfolio including achieving strong growth in the year as did Staropramen out of the Czech Republic. Our Europe cider portfolio grew at double-digit rate in 2015. And the integration of the Rekorderlig cider business into our U.K. and Ireland portfolio went well in the second half of the year as did the repatriation of the Staropramen brand into our U.K. portfolio at the start of 2016.
Our International business delivered double-digit volume growth in 2015, driven by very strong volume growth in India, primarily due to our acquisition of Mount Shivalik Breweries early in 2015, along with double-digit growth of Coors Light in Latin America, including launching the brand in Colombia. We ended the year with a $5.1 million increase in international's underlying pretax loss versus a year ago, primarily due to foreign currency movements and a substantial restructure of our China business. In constant currency, underlying pretax loss increased by $0.8 million.
Now I'll turn over to David to give fourth quarter financial highlights and perspective on 2016. David?"

As we consistently communicated throughout last year, foreign currency and the termination of business contracts, were a drag on our financial performance, including in the fourth quarter. Worldwide beer volume for M",1194,"Thank you, Mark, and hello, everybody. As we consistently communicated throughout last year, foreign currency and the termination of business contracts, were a drag on our financial performance, including in the fourth quarter. Worldwide beer volume for Molson Coors decreased 1.7%, but Coors Light grew nearly 1% globally and more than 13% in Europe and international.
Headline net sales were down approximately 13% [ph] in U.S. dollars. However, excluding the previously reference strengths, net sales increased from the strength of positive pricing along with higher volume in Europe and international.
Our underlying pretax income decreased by 21.1% with more than half of this decline driven by foreign currency and termination business contracts. The balance was due to a planned increase in brandying investments in the quarter in the U.S. and Canada.
Underlying after-tax income decreased by 11.3% to $90.6 million or $0.49 per share. On a U.S. GAAP basis, we reported income from continuing operations attributable to Molson Coors of $33.4 million, which is 64.2% lower than in the prior year. In addition to the factors that drove lower underlying income, other noncore charges, primarily related to supply chain restructuring in the MillerCoors acquisition financing drove the decrease.
Our underlying EBITDA was $227.3 million in the fourth quarter, 17% lower than a year ago, driven by inflatable foreign currency, the impact of terminated business contracts and higher marketing investments in the U.S. and Canada.
Please see the earnings release we distributed earlier this morning for a detailed review of our business unit financial results in the quarter. In the area of cost savings, we exceeded our 2015 goal by achieving almost $65 million of in year cost reductions across the company, driven by Canada and Europe. These cost savings exclude MillerCoors, of which our share is another [ph] $37 million. We now expect cost savings over the next 2 years to be in the range of $50 million to $70 million, slightly higher than our previous guidance of $40 million to $60 million. This fee excludes cost synergies resulting from the pending MillerCoors acquisition, which we expect to be $200 million by year 4 post [ph] transaction close.
We were pleased to generate more than $704 million of underlying free cash flow in 2015 and exceed our cash flow guidance by more than $150 million. A strong fourth quarter working capital performance was further enhanced by higher-than-anticipated distributions for MillerCoors, lower cash taxes and capital expenditures. Whilst there were some onetime impacts, we do not believe these were significant.
A detailed reconciliation of our 2015 and 2014 underlying free cash flow is available in our earnings release this morning.
Total debt at the end of the fourth quarter was just over $2.9 billion. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $431 million, resulting in a net debt of $2.5 billion. This is $55 million lower than prior year, primarily due to foreign currency movements. 
So looking forward to 2016. All of the following matrix exclude any effects of the MillerCoors transaction, the timing of which will have a big impact on virtually all guidance measures. Currently, we expect cash contributions to our defined benefit pension plans to be in the range of $45 million to $65 million in 2016, down approximately $250 million from last year, including our 42% of MillerCoors contributions.
We anticipate 2016 pension expense of approximately $17 million, down from $40 million last year. Note that all these numbers include our 42% of MillerCoors. The overall status of the defined-benefit pension plans including MillerCoors improved about 7 percentage points from a year ago to approximately 97% at the end of 2015. This increase was driven primarily by the launch additional voluntary contribution of $227 million to the U.K. plan in 2015.
Our 2016 capital spending outlook is approximately $300 million, up from $269 million last year, largely due to supply chain projects in Canada.
We expect our 2016 MG&A expense in corporate to be approximately $120 million, including additional investments behind our global commercial assets but excluding any cost related to the MillerCoors transaction. Our consolidated net interest expense and outlook for 2016 is approximately $110 million, excluding any interest costs related to the MillerCoors acquisition. We expect our 2016 underlying effective tax rate to be in the range of 18% to 22%, assuming no further changes in tax loss, settlement of tax audits or certain tax provisions. If the MillerCoors deal closes in the second half of this year, we expect our long-term tax rate to be in the range of 25% to 28%, also assuming no changes in tax loss or audit resolutions. We expect our cash tax rate to be significantly lower than this range due to the more than $250 million of cash tax benefits stemming from the asset nature of the MillerCoors transaction.
In 2016, we anticipate modestly higher investments in our brands globally. The impact of terminated contracts are now largely behind us. We anticipate foreign currency will continue to be a headwind of note, primarily as a result of the weakening Canadian dollar. To provide a sense of the challenge, if we were to apply foreign exchange rates at the end of last month to our 2015 results, it would reduce last year's underlying pretax earnings and the free cash flow by approximately $35 million with most of this impact in Canada. Regarding underlying free cash flow guidance, we are pleased with our free cash flow track record and our performance over the last couple of years, in particular, as we have further embedded our tax methodology, which is ensuring a strong focus of cash management across our business. You will also see some significant upside volatility to our guidance in 2014 and 2015. As we come into 2016, we have a number of large dynamic factors in play in relation to cash use and cash deployment, in part due to the pending MillerCoors transaction and, therefore, we'll issue specific 2016 free cash flow guidance later in the year with the goal of removing some of the recent volatility to guidance that has occurred.
As far as our cost outlook is concerned, we expect the cost of goods sold per hectoliter in MillerCoors, Canada, Europe and our International business in local currency to increase at a low single-digit rate for the full year 2016. In each of our businesses, we anticipate higher costs related to product and packaging innovation.
Finally, here are the most recent volume trends for each of our businesses early in the first quarter. In the U.S. through the first 5 weeks of the year, STRs decreased to low single-digit rate. In Canada, for January, STRs were down low double digits. Excluding the Miller brands last year, our Canada STRs in January decreased at a high single-digit rate. In Europe, volume through February 8 decreased low single digits, and our international sales volume, including royalty volume, decreased at mid-single-digit rate in January. As ever, please keep in mind these numbers represent only a portion of the current quarter and trends could change in the weeks ahead.
At this point, I'll turn it back over to Mark for outlook, wrap-up and the Q&A. Mark?"

We will continue to drive our strategy of bringing a stronger brand portfolio, thus delivering value-added innovation strengthening our brand positions and increasing our share in about premium SNBs, craft and ciders segments. We will do this while ensuring that we have a cost base and deeply embedded capital allocation approach.
Regionally, in the U.S., MillerCoors began to drive substantial changes to the business in the latter half of 2015 that were necessary to create a foundation for volume growth we aim to achieve by 2019. In addition to Gavin taking over as CEO, new commercial leadership and the appointment of agencies to difficult decisions also made to close the brewery. In American light lagers, the revitalization of our 2 largest brands is progressing well, and we're seeing segment share growth for both Coors Light and Miller Lite for the first time since MillerCoors was formed nearly 8 years ago. In Above Premium, we continue to focus in higher-margin offerings with scale and stick including fronted expansions from Leinenkugel's and Blue Moon In cider, we are broadening the Smith & Forge Hard Cider by adding a bottle package to our line. In early January this trend in our SMB portfolio or launched Henry's hard soda, which has been met with great enthusiasm from our distributors and retail partners. And our U.S. team is also developing new strategies to improve the performance of our Economy brands, which have been a drag on our volume trends. We'll continue to build first choice customer partnerships working with our distributors to bring more resources to the on premise with our building retail strategy, which leverages the higher velocity and broad appeal of American light lagers. In Canada, we've just launched the newest chapter in our Molson Canadian Anything For Hockey campaign, generating 80 million media impressions in the first week. In Coors Light, we will significantly increase programming and further evolve our communication with a new campaign building on learnings from 2015. In Above Premium, consumer demand remains strong from Coors Banquet, Belgian moon Molson Canadian Cider and Mad Jack Lager. And building on that momentum, we introduced new variants in the successful and rapidly growing Mad Jack branded ciders, which have been exceeding growth expectations. Finally, in addition to Heineken, Strongbow and Heineken's other top 4 brands such as and so for the start of this year we also pick up a distribution of all Heineken trading brands in Canada as well. In 2016, we'll also continue to restructure our business to ensure we including the sale of our Vancouver brewery, which allows to build a more efficient and flexible brewery over the next few years. In Europe, the termination of Heineken contracts in the U.K. will continue to present headwinds in the first quarter as will the new amortization expense for the brands that we impaired in the third quarter of last year and moved to We will continue to invest on our core brand portfolio across Europe to grow share of segment, and we'll also continue to premiumize our portfolio. And starting in 2016, we expect the Hard Cider and Staropramen in the U.K. to contribute more than 350,000 hectoliters of Above Premium volume in our Europe business and to provide attractive growth potential of the future. In combination with the integration of the Franciscan well craft brands in Ireland and the acquisition of the brewing and kegging operations of Thomas brew in England, we now have a broad range of consumer and customer offerings and Above Premium, craft and cider segments across the U.K. and Ireland. Additionally, we're implementing significant new initiatives to further improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our European operations to provide more resources to invest in driving top line and bottom line growth. As the 2 most recent examples, we closed one of our breweries in Bulgaria in November 2015, and we've entered into a consultation process in the U.K. regarding our proposal to close our brewery and consolidate production within our recently modernized brewery by the end of 2017. Our International business is focused on attaining profitability in 2016 on a constant currency basis versus 2013 when we made this commitment and continuing to accelerate our overall growth and expansion in new and existing markets. Upon closing of the MillerCoors transaction, we are planning to integrate the Miller brands into our international portfolio and leverage our footprint that complements our growth strategy and allows us to gain entrance into high-priority markets while increasing our business scale in current markets. We'll also continue to drive rapid growth for Coors Light in Latin America, including the high-potential Colombia market where we launched in the fourth quarter. Going forward Coors, Miller and Staropramen will form the backbone of our international brand portfolio.
So to summarize our discussion today, the most important strategic development for Molson Coors in 2015 was the definitive agreement we reached late in the year to purchase 58% of MillerCoors that we do not currently own, along with the international rights of the Miller brands. Beyond this game-changing transaction for our company, we were pleased with the overall progress of our company in 2015. We exceeded our targets for cash generation and cost savings and expanded gross margins in underlying pretax margins globally. We grew our Above Premium craft and cider business globally, gained share of the key Premium Light segment in the U.S. and accelerated the growth of our International business, including our bolt-on acquisition in the fast-growing India market. In 2016, we'll continue to focus on building our stronger brand portfolio delivering value-added innovation investing and buying the strength of our core brand positions and continuing to premiumize our portfolio, all driven through our PACC lines.

Despite the loss of Miller, our portfolio is much stronger, and we've driven out cost savings, which have allowed us to stabilize the earnings performance. I think the context then puts the business in a much stronger strategic position. So now let me go to what's going on in the consumer world. I don't have a corresponding analog that you can look to for guidance. But in this past quarter, we saw food prices up by around 4%, and I think 4.5% in that range as CPI was lower because of the lower fuel cost. But the way it's manifesting itself across the country is that in the oil-rich province is those provinces are being very heavily hit. So we saw big shift in volume between premium and economy brands in Saskatchewan and in Alberta. We saw falling volumes in Newfoundland, Saskatchewan and Alberta, so the consumers are under pressure I think you had to that the fact that consumer debt in Canada an all-time high so it's made for quite a difficult risk in some of those provinces."

Let's talk about where the portfolio has gone first. You really look at the way we build out the portfolio. It's been all of the Above Premium, and pushing hard against the growth craft brands, Mad Jack Apple and all of those things have been addressing the up brand of the portfolio. When I look back at the fourth quarter, our Above Premium portfolio grew share, so I feel good about that. If you talk about the mainstream part of the portfolio, that part of the portfolio has been under pressure some things that industry-related and some things where places where we made some choices. From an industry perspective, the pressure on mainstream has been primarily in the provinces that I called out earlier. In terms of choices we made, we made profit positive choices in Québec to adjust the pricing of Coors Light, and it's been a good thing for our P&L, and it's been the right decision for our brand. We held Chairman total in Québec but we lost share with Coors Light. That was about 1/3 of the Coors Light lost. I think in the last impact on Coors Light specifically has been cannibalization from Banquet. When you go beyond Coors Light, Molson Canadian actually held shares segment during the quarter so the pressure point for us is Coors Light. We feel great about where the portfolio in total we feel good about the strategy of Coors Light, and we're focused against 2016 to execute that what are the places where we feel good? Our advertising is scoring very well. Our activation, if you look at what we did in the back half of 2015 and what we got planned for 2016 is, significantly better than what we saw in the 2 years prior to that, and it's the kind of activation that we expect will attract our target audience of and as you mentioned of course, Mark, we have put more money behind the brand. So I think that covers the portfolio and the region question. Perhaps we could just talk to mix for a second. We did see down trading from consumers into Economy. We also felt the mix of pressures on COGS is certainly from our U.S. sourced products. From an overall perspective on price, I'd look at the full year. Against the full year, we got 2.5% of price against 2.5% of COGS."

So I'm going to start with the deal. If you look at the MillerCoors transaction, assuming that, that goes ahead as anticipated, and then if you take the long-range plans to reach the individual segment in the business units. So if you layer on top of that the $200 [ph] million of synergies and the cash tax benefits, it's clearly strategically and financially compelling, and we'll deliver strong return for our shareholders. Anything we can do to either increase that synergy number, organic synergy numbers faster will make a great deal, almost that's the work on quite some time. As we moved into a broader and bigger business, we start really with 2 priorities. One is what's it going to take for us to be first choice from a consumer and customer perspective; and secondly, how do we ensure that were bribing an appropriate than expected total shareholder return. And when it comes to reinvestment synergies, I will always guard flexibility that we required to really look at these things across the areas. One is in a volatile world how do we offset inflation challenges faced in our business and obviously transactional FX as part of that note, something we've got to consider. Secondly, we are can we invest the highest return across the brand portfolio? we've got pretty sophisticated return on marketing investment model in the U.S., and that's something we are rolling out more broadly in our business. And then thirdly, we can flow some of those savings straight through the bottom line. So there are 3 principal areas of opportunities. I'm not going to give you guidance as to how we will prioritize that will be real tight dependent competitive pressures, and it will depend on economic environment within which we're trading. And as you rightly said, that's a difficult to second guess and quite volatile at this point in time. I think important thing is we will have options, and those options give us the flexibility to give us our business in a way which is right and there should first choice in shareholder return perspective that's a good place to be.

With me on the call this morning from Molson Coors, we have David Heede, our interim global CFO; Gavin Hattersley, our CEO of MillerCoors; Stewart Glendinning, our Canada CEO; Simon Cox, our CEO of our European business; Kandy Anand, our International CEO; Sam Walker; our Global Chief legal and People Officer; Brian Tabolt, our Global Controller; and Dave Dunnewald, VP of Investor Relations. 
On the call today, David and I will take you through the highlights of our full year and fourth quarter 2015 results from the Molson Coors Brewing Company, along with some perspectives on 2016. The most strategic -- important strategic development for Molson Coors in 2015 was the definitive agreement we reached late in the year to purchase 58% of MillerCoors that we do not currently own, along with the international rates for the Miller brands, which is a game-changing transaction for our company that's compelling, both financially and strategically. 
Last month, we conducted a common stock offering that will fund about 20% of the total purchase price and helps us to maintain investment-grade ratings on our debt. We plan to fund the balance of the purchase price with new debt and cash on hand. We have a dedicated team working towards completion of the pending transaction, which is currently expected in the second half of 2016. Meanwhile, the rest of our organization remains absolutely focused on growing our existing business and brands as well as delivering total returns to our shareholders. 
With regard to business performance, the financial results we released this morning are in line with the preliminary fourth quarter financial results and updated 2015 free cash flow guidance ranges that we issued 2 weeks ago. Overall, we are pleased with the progress our company made in 2015. We exceeded our targets for cash generation and cost savings and expanded underlying gross and pretax margins globally. We grew our Above Premium business globally, including craft, flavored malt beverages and cider. We gained share of the key Premium Light segment in the U.S. and accelerated the growth of our International business, including a bolt-on acquisition in the fast-growing India market. 
We continue to focus on building a stronger brand portfolio, delivering value-added innovation, strengthening our core brand positions through incremental marketing investments and continuing to premiumize our portfolio. We began to see the benefits flow to our top line performance as the year progressed. And for example, Coors Light and Miller Lite both gained share of the Premium Light segment in the U.S. in the last 3 quarters of 2015, and Coors Light grew 0.3% globally and more than 15% in our Europe and international markets for the full year. In constant currency, we achieved positive net pricing globally as well as in most of our major markets. And these achievements are against the backdrop of a continued difficult economy and competitive pressures, along with significant unfavorable foreign currency and the termination of major business contracts, as we highlighted through last year.
Our focus on growing our Above Premium segment continued in 2015 as we completed the acquisition of Saint Archer in the U.S. with a quarterly [indiscernible] brand distribution rates in the U.K. and Ireland and repatriated the rights of Staropramen in the U.K. We also expanded our global footprint and accelerated the growth of our International business through the acquisition of Mount Shivalik Breweries in India and our recent entrance into the Colombian beer market. 
Our craft portfolio drove growth from Doom Bar in the U.K., Granville Island in Canada and Blue Moon in the U.S. and also the U.K. And our emerging cider portfolio delivered strong growth, led by Carling British cider in Europe, Molson Canadian Cider and Strongbow in Canada and Smith & Forge Hard Cider in the U.S.
We also used our profit after capital charge, our patent model, as a key driver for our cash and capital allocation decisions. As a result, we drove additional working capital improvements and delivered underlying free cash flow of $704 million for the year, which exceeded our original guidance by more than $150 million or nearly 30%. PACC informed our approach to the MillerCoors acquisition, along with the Mount Shivalik, Staropramen in U.K. and Rekorderlig transactions and the substantial restructure of our China business last year.
Additionally, we continue to transform and strengthen our business through improvements in our sales execution and revenue management capabilities. We increased the efficiency of our operations, and we implemented common global systems. To ensure that our supply chain is fit for future, we closed 2 bottling lines and completed our [indiscernible] plans to close 4 breweries across our company, along with the planned recapitalization of our Vancouver brewery.
We exceeded our cost reduction goal of $40 million to $60 million in Molson Coors by delivering almost $65 million of savings in 2015. And in addition, MillerCoors achieved $88 million of cost reductions in 2015, of which our share is $37 million.
In performance headlines for the full year in 2015, we delivered $1.33 billion of underlying EBITDA and $700.4 million of underlying after-tax income or $3.76 per diluted share. Underlying after-tax income declined 9% from a year ago. 
Foreign currency movements and terminated contracts drove the entire decline in both underlying pretax and post-tax income in 2015. Foreign currency impacted earnings by more than $64 million in 2015, while the termination of our Miller brands contract in Canada and our Modelo brands and Heineken brewing contracts in the U.K. drove an additional negative impact of approximately $40 million.
We exceeded our cash generation goal in a challenging year by delivering more than $704 million of underlying free cash flow. And we expanded our PACC model deeper into our company. Use less, earn more and invest wisely is now a common mantra throughout Molson Coors.
Net sales for the year declined 2.2% in constant currency, driven by the effect of terminated contracts. Strong volume performance in Europe and international helped to grow overall worldwide Coors Light volumes for the year. Our overall profit and cash performance, along with the potential of the MillerCoors transaction, helped to drive a positive total shareholder return, such as tap stock price plus dividends of nearly 29% in 2015, which is well above the 1% increase in the total return for the S&P 500 index last year.
Regional highlights for 2015 are as follows. In the U.S., underlying pretax earnings in 2015 were unchanged from the year before, as positive net pricing, sales mix and cost savings were offset by lower volume and increased investments in marketing and information technology. We grew revenue per hectoliter and increased our percent of sales in Above Premium, and we grew our share of the Premium Light segment with both Coors Light and Miller Lite, driven by continued improvements to their packaging and consumer messaging. For Coors Light, the consumer communication rooted in Rocky Mountain Cold Refreshment is more aspirational and reaches legal drinking age men and women alike, while Miller Lite continues to focus authenticity as the original light beer. The new ads began running for Coors Light 2 weeks ago, while Miller Lite benefited most recently from their Limited edition Steinie Bottle. Additionally, Coors Banquet grew volume for the ninth consecutive year. And in the higher-margin Above Premium segment, we grew FMB and craft volume with Redd's, Blue Moon, Leinenkugel's and Smith & Forge Hard Cider brands.
In Canada, underlying pretax income decreased 5.8% in constant currency, primarily due to the negative impact of terminating our Miller brands agreement last year, along with higher marketing and distribution costs and fixed cost deleverage due to lower volume. These factors, which partially -- were partially offset by substantial cost savings and positive pricing, which, along with positive mix, drove constant currency revenue per hectoliter 2.5% higher in 2015. Canada sales to retailer STRs declined 6.3%, primarily due to the termination of the Miller contract. Excluding the impact of the loss of the Miller brands, STRs declined 2.6%. In core brands, Coors Light and Molson Canadian volumes declined, due largely to increased competitor trade spend and pricing activities in key regions, while we continue to invest by new advertising and commercial executions for both brands. Encouragingly, Coors Banquet delivered strong volume and share growth as the #1 new brand introduction in Canada in the past 5 years. Also, in Above Premium and craft, Mad Jack Apple Lager, Molson Canadian Cider and Strongbow Cider also grew volume and share in 2015, along with our Six Pints craft brands.
In Europe, 2015 underlying pretax income decreased 5.7% in constant currency, driven by the termination of the Modelo brands and Heineken brewing contracts in the U.K. Excluding the impact of the contract termination, Europe's ongoing business grew volume, sales mix, gross margins and underlying pretax income in constant currency. Sales volume increased in 7 of 11 countries and for 6 of our 11 lead brands in the region. Carling grew share of its segment in 2015, and trends continue to improve as the year progressed, while [indiscernible] and Bergenbier grew volume and segment share in their core markets. And Above Premium portfolio performed well with Coors Light, Sharp's Brewery portfolio, led by Doom Bar and our lighter craft portfolio, including Franciscan Well, achieving strong growth in the year, as did Staropramen outside of the Czech Republic. Our Europe cider portfolio grew at double-digit rate in 2015. And the integration of the Rekorderlig cider business into our U.K. and Ireland portfolio went well in the second half of the year, as did the ramp-up for the repatriation of the Staropramen brand into our U.K. portfolio at the start of 2016.
Our International business delivered double-digit volume growth in 2015, driven by very strong volume growth in India, primarily due to our acquisition of Mount Shivalik Breweries early in 2015, along with double-digit growth of our Coors Light in Latin America, including launching the brand in Colombia. We ended the year with a $5.1 million increase in International's underlying pretax loss versus a year ago, primarily due to foreign currency movements and the substantial restructure of our China business. In constant currency, underlying pretax loss increased by $0.8 million.
Now I'll turn over to David to give fourth quarter financial highlights and perspective on 2016. David?"

As we consistently communicated throughout last year, foreign currency and the termination of business contracts were a drag on our financial performance, including in the fourth quarter. Worldwide beer volume for Mo",1201,"Thank you, Mark, and hello, everybody. As we consistently communicated throughout last year, foreign currency and the termination of business contracts were a drag on our financial performance, including in the fourth quarter. Worldwide beer volume for Molson Coors decreased 1.7%, but Coors Light grew nearly 1% globally and more than 13% in Europe and International.
Headline net sales were down approximately 13% in U.S. dollars. However, excluding the previously referenced strengths, net sales increased on the strength of positive pricing, along with higher volume in Europe and International.
Our underlying pretax income decreased by 21.1%, with more than half of this decline driven by foreign currency and termination of business contracts. The balance was due to a planned increase in brand investments in the quarter in the U.S. and Canada. Underlying after-tax income decreased by 11.3% to $90.6 million or $0.49 per share. 
On a U.S. GAAP basis, we reported income from continuing operations attributable to Molson Coors of $33.4 million, which is 64.2% lower than in the prior year. In addition to the factors that drove lower underlying income, higher special and other noncore charges, primarily related to supply chain restructuring and MillerCoors acquisition financing drove the decrease.
Our underlying EBITDA was $227.3 million in the fourth quarter, 17% lower than the year ago, driven by unfavorable foreign currency, the impact of terminated business contracts and higher marketing investments in the U.S. and Canada. Please see the earnings release we distributed earlier this morning for a detailed review of our business unit financial results in the quarter. 
In the area of cost savings, we exceeded our 2015 goal by achieving almost $65 million of in-year cost reductions across our company, driven by Canada and Europe. These cost savings exclude MillerCoors, of which our share is another $37 million. We now expect cost savings over the next 2 years to be in the range of $50 million to $70 million, slightly higher than our previous guidance of $40 million to $60 million. This view excludes cost synergies resulting from the pending MillerCoors acquisition, which we expect to be $200 million by year 4 following the transaction's close.
We were pleased to generate more than $704 million of underlying free cash flow in 2015 and exceed our cash flow guidance by more than $150 million. A strong fourth quarter working capital performance was further enhanced by higher-than-anticipated distributions from MillerCoors, lower cash taxes and capital expenditures. Whilst there were some onetime impacts, we do not believe these were significant. A detailed reconciliation of our 2015 and 2014 underlying free cash flow is available in our earnings release this morning.
Total debt at the end of the fourth quarter was just over $2.9 billion. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $431 million, resulting in a net debt of $2.5 billion. This is $55 million lower than prior year, primarily due to foreign currency movements. 
So looking forward to 2016. All of the following matrix exclude any effects of the MillerCoors transaction, the timing of which will have a big impact on virtually all guidance measures. Currently, we expect cash contributions to our defined benefit pension plans to be in the range of $45 million to $65 million in 2016, down approximately $250 million from last year, including our 42% of MillerCoors contributions. We anticipate 2016 pension expense of approximately $17 million, down from $40 million last year. Note that all of these numbers include our 42% of MillerCoors. 
The overall funded status of the defined-benefit pension plans, including MillerCoors, improved about 7 percentage points from a year ago to approximately 97% at the end of 2015. This increase was driven primarily by the large additional voluntary contribution of $227 million to the U.K. plant in 2015.
Our 2016 capital spending outlook is approximately $300 million, up from $269 million last year, largely due to planned supply chain projects in Canada.
We expect our 2016 MG&A expense in corporate to be approximately $120 million, including additional investments behind our global commercial efforts, but excluding any costs related to the MillerCoors transaction. 
Our consolidated net interest expense outlook for 2016 is approximately $110 million, excluding any interest costs related to the MillerCoors acquisition. We expect our 2016 underlying effective tax rate to be in the range of 18% to 22%, assuming no further changes in tax laws, settlement of tax audits or adjustments to our own certain tax provisions. If the MillerCoors deal closes in the second half of this year, we expect our long-term tax rate to be in the range of 25% to 28%, also assuming no changes in tax laws or audit resolutions. We expect our cash tax rate to be significantly lower than this range due to the more than $250 million of cash tax benefits stemming from the asset nature of the MillerCoors transaction.
In 2016, we anticipate moderately higher investments in our brands globally. The impact of terminated contracts are now largely behind us. We anticipate foreign currency will continue to be a headwind of note, primarily as a result of the weakening Canadian dollar. To provide a sense of the challenge, if we were to apply foreign exchange rates at the end of last month to our 2015 results, it would reduce last year's underlying pretax earnings and free cash flow by approximately $35 million, with most of this impact in Canada. 
Regarding underlying free cash flow guidance, we are pleased with our free cash flow track record and our performance over the last couple of years in particular, as we have further embedded our PACC methodology, which is ensuring a strong focus of cash management across our business. You will also have seen some significant upside volatility to our guidance in 2014 and 2015. As we come into 2016, we have a number of large dynamic factors in play in relation to cash use and cash deployment, in part due to the pending MillerCoors transaction. And therefore, we'll issue specific 2016 free cash flow guidance later in the year with the goal of removing some of the recent volatility to guidance that has occurred.
As far as our cost outlook is concerned, we expect the cost of goods sold per hectoliter in MillerCoors, Canada, Europe and our International business in local currency to increase at a low single-digit rate for the full year 2016. In each of our businesses, we anticipate higher costs related to product and packaging innovation.
Finally, here are the most recent volume trends for each of our businesses early in the first quarter. In the U.S. through the first 5 weeks of the year, STRs decreased to low single-digit rate. In Canada for January, STRs were down low double digits. Excluding the Miller brands last year, our Canada STRs in January decreased at a high single-digit rate. In Europe, volume through to February 8 decreased low single digits. And our International sales volume, including royalty volume, decreased at mid-single-digit rate in January. As ever, please keep in mind these numbers represent only a portion of the current quarter and trends could change in the weeks ahead.
At this point, I'll turn it back over to Mark for outlook, wrap-up and the Q&A. Mark?"

In 2016, we will have a relentless focus on delighting our consumers and our customers to ensure we are the first-choice brewer in the geographies and segments where we choose to play. We will continue to drive our strategy of building a stronger brand portfolio, thus delivering value-added innovation, strengthening our core brand positions and increasing our share in Above Premium, FMBs, craft and ciders segments. We will do this while ensuring that we have a fit-for-purpose cost base and a deeply embedded PACC-led capital allocation approach.
Regionally, in the U.S., MillerCoors began to drive substantial changes to the business in the latter half of 2015 that were necessary to create a foundation for volume growth we aim to achieve by 2019. In addition to Gavin taking over as CEO, new commercial leadership and the appointment of new ad agencies, the difficult decision was also made to close the Eden brewery. 
In American light lagers, the revitalization of our 2 largest brands is progressing well, and we are seeing segment share growth for both Coors Light and Miller Lite for the first time since MillerCoors was formed nearly 8 years ago. In Above Premium, we continue to focus in higher-margin offerings that can scale and stick, including further extensions from Leinenkugel's and Blue Moon. And in cider, we're broadening the appeal of Smith & Forge Hard Cider by adding a bottle package to our lineup. 
In early January, to strengthen our FMB portfolio, we launched Henry's Hard Soda, which has been met with great enthusiasm from our distributors and retail partners. And our U.S. team is also developing new strategies to improve the performance of our economy brands, which have been a drag on our volume trends. We'll continue to build first-choice customer partnerships, working with our distributors to bring more resources to the on-premise with our building material retail strategy, which leverages the higher velocity and broad appeal of American light lagers. 
In Canada, we've just launched the newest chapter in our Molson Canadian Anything For Hockey campaign, generating 80 million media impressions in the first week. In Coors Light, we will significantly increase programming and further evolve our communications with a new campaign building on learnings from 2015. In Above Premium, consumer demand remains strong for Coors Banquet, Belgian Moon, Molson Canadian Cider and Mad Jack Lager. And building on that momentum, we will introduce new variants in the successful and rapidly growing Mad Jack brand and also our ciders, which have been exceeding growth expectations. Finally, in addition to Heineken, Strongbow and Heineken's other top 4 brands, such as Dos Equis and Sol, with the start of this year, we also picked up the distribution of all Heineken trading brands in Canada as well. In 2016, we'll also continue to restructure our business to ensure we are fit for future, including the sale of our Vancouver brewery, which will allow us to build a more efficient and flexible brewery over the next few years. 
In Europe, the terminated Heineken contracts in the U.K. will continue to present a headwind in the first quarter, as will the new amortization expense for the brands that we impaired in the third quarter of last year and moved to definite light. We will continue to invest in our core brand portfolio across Europe to grow share of segment, and we'll also continue to premiumize our portfolio. And starting in 2016, we expect Rekorderlig Cider and Staropramen in the U.K. to contribute more than 350,000 hectoliters of Above Premium volume annually to our Europe business and to provide attractive growth potential for the future. 
In combination with the integration of the Franciscan Well craft brands in Ireland and the acquisition of the brewing and kegging operations of Thomas Hardy's Burtonwood brew in England, we now have a broad range of consumer and customer offerings in the Above Premium, craft and cider segments across the U.K. and Ireland. Additionally, we're implementing significant new initiatives to further improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our European operations and provide more resources to invest in driving top line and bottom line growth. As the 2 most recent examples, we closed one of our breweries in Bulgaria in November 2015, and we've entered into a consultation process in the U.K. regarding our proposal to close our Burton South Brewery and consolidate production within our recently modernized Burton North brewery by the end of 2017. 
Our International business is focused on attaining profitability in 2016 on a constant currency basis versus 2013 when we made this commitment and continuing to accelerate our overall growth and expansion in new and existing markets. Upon closing of the MillerCoors transaction, we are planning to integrate the Miller brands into our International portfolio and leverage our footprint that complements our growth strategy and allows us to gain entrance into high-priority markets while increasing our business scale in current markets. We'll also continue to drive rapid growth for Coors Light in Latin America, including the high-potential Colombia market, where we launched in the fourth quarter. Going forward Coors, Miller and Staropramen will form the backbone of our International brand portfolio.
So to summarize our discussion today, the most important strategic development for Molson Coors in 2015 was the definitive agreement we reached late in the year to purchase 58% of MillerCoors that we do not currently own, along with the international rights to the Miller brands. Beyond this game-changing transaction for our company, we were pleased with the overall progress our company made in 2015. We exceeded our targets for cash generation and cost savings and expanded gross margins and underlying pretax margins globally. We grew our Above Premium craft, FMB and cider business globally; gained share of the key Premium Light segment in the U.S.; and accelerated the growth of our International business, including a bolt-on acquisition in the fast-growing India market. 
In 2016, we will continue to focus on building a stronger brand portfolio, delivering value-added innovation, investing by the strength of our core brand positions and continuing to premiumize our portfolio, all driven through a PACC lens. 
Now before we start the Q&A portion of the call, just a quick comment. As usual, our prepared remarks will be on our website for your reference within a couple of hours this afternoon.

And what I don't want to do is offer guidance, which then has to change materially. So if you will just indulge us and be a little bit patient with us and give it a little bit of time, I'd like to offer free cash flow guidance a lot later in the year, which I think removes some of the volatility that we've seen over the course of the last couple of years and make sense of some of the moving parts.

Well, why don't I offer Vivien a bit of context about the business, and I'll come directly to your question. And I think if you look at it, the strategy we set out 3 years ago, we've overhauled the design of our supply chain network, and we've reduced the G&A cost structures in our business and improved our commercial capabilities. Despite the loss of Corona and Miller, our portfolio is much stronger, and we've driven out cost savings, which have allowed us to stabilize the earnings performance. I think the context then puts the business in a much stronger strategic position. So now let me go to what's going on in the consumer world. I don't have a corresponding analog that you can look to for guidance. But in this past quarter, we saw food prices up by around 4%, and I think 4.5% in that range as CPI was lower because of the lower fuel cost. But the way it's manifesting itself across the country is that in the oil-rich provinces, those provinces are being very heavily hit. So we saw a big shift in volume between premium and economy brands in Saskatchewan -- in Alberta. We saw falling volumes in Newfoundland, Saskatchewan and Alberta, so the consumer is under pressure. And I think if you had to that the fact that consumer debt in Canada is at an all-time high, it just -- it's made for quite a difficult risk to be in some of those provinces."

Generally speaking, the environment is as it has been for many, many years [indiscernible]. Slight migration from on-tray to off-trays and a fairly difficult market in terms of getting pricing away, which is why we want to continue the journey we've had in terms of premiumizing our portfolio because we think that's the way to create value in the U.K. in the long term. We've demonstrated a real ability to do that because Coors Light, as we mentioned earlier, is growing at double digits. Our craft portfolio is growing through Doom Bar in shops at double digits, as is outside the portfolio. So we'll withstand whatever macro difficulties there may be in the market on pricing by making sure that we're actually adjusting our portfolio towards the premium end, which we've done very successfully in recent history.

If you really look at the way we built out the portfolio, it's been all of the Above Premium end. We've been pushing hard against the growth in our craft brands, launched the Mad Jack, Banquet. All of those things had been addressing the up brand of our portfolio. When I look back at the fourth quarter, our Above Premium portfolio grew share, so I feel good about that. If you talk about the mainstream part of the portfolio, that part of the portfolio has been under pressure, some things that are industry-related and some things where -- some places where we've made some choices. From an industry perspective, the pressure on mainstream has been primarily in the -- some of the provinces that I called out earlier. In terms of choices we'd made, we made profit-positive choices in Québec to adjust the pricing of Coors Light, and that's been a good thing for our P&L, and it's been the right decision for the -- for our brand. We held share in total in Québec, but we lost share with Coors Light. That was about 1/3 of the Coors Light loss. I think the last impact on Coors Light specifically has been cannibalization from Banquet. When you go beyond Coors Light, Molson Canadian actually held share of segment during the quarter. So the pressure point for us is Coors Light. We feel great about where the portfolio is in total. We feel good about the strategy on Coors Light, and we're focused against 2016 to execute that. What are the places where we feel good? Our advertising is scoring very well. Our activation, if you looked at what we did in the back half of 2015 and what we've got planned for 2016, is significantly better than what we saw in the 2 years prior to that, and it's the kind of activation that we expect will attract our target audience of young millennials. And as you mentioned, of course, Mark, we have put more money behind the brand. So I think that covers sort of portfolio and the region question. Perhaps I could just talk to mix for a second.

Mark, let me give you just a little bit of context and some guidance as to how to think about the Miller International business. So there are 3 kind of volume and value platforms that come with the Miller International business. And clearly, we've got a lot of integration planning work that we're in the throes of dealing with at this point in time. The first big platform of volume and value, and you're right to call this out, relates to Canada and also the U.K. and Ireland. So that will be rolled into our existing business. The second platform are those markets where we already have a route-to-market solution. The best example I can give you is Panama, where we have a strong partner there, and Miller would be a step-up in terms of our scale in that market place. And then thirdly, there's a platform of volume and value, which is in markets where we currently do not have a route-to-market effect to market. It's Argentina and South Africa. Clearly, there's consumer and customer demand in those markets. Kandy and his team are now working through what our route-to-market options will be. Assuming that we land an appropriate route-to-market option for the Miller brands, we can then use that to then, over time, introduce other Molson Coors brands. So that's as simple as I can make it. And I wouldn't -- beyond that one again, just specific markets and their relative importance, I think that's something -- I'm looking at Kandy here. He can probably share once we've done the detailed planning."

Over the next -- assuming the MillerCoors transaction closes over the next couple of years, between what you've talked about today about your incremental savings potential and the underlying businesses and then the cost savings that you expect or the synergy you expect to extract as a result of the MillerCoors merger, you're going to have a significant amount of cost savings sort of at your disposal. And the market's pretty volatile, right? I mean, there's a lot of dynamics and a lot of things changing in the beer industry and certainly, in terms of the economy. So can you just maybe talk a little bit about how you're thinking about that reinvestment decision in the context of the world, how volatile the world is, payback, how quickly you're expecting it to pay back and maybe just a little color on how much of that reinvestment is in things like products and advertising and marketing as opposed to, I don't know, things that are more hard, like infrastructure or salespeople? And maybe the last piece to that is just where you think that stacks up relative to your competitors in your major markets. So you've got savings. You can lean into these markets and spend more. Do you think that that's -- as a competitive position, you'll be able to have basically -- be in a position to spend more than your competitors are?"

Let me try and chunk it up a little bit, Bryan. So I mean, I'm going to start with the deal. If you look at the MillerCoors transaction, assuming that, that goes ahead as anticipated, then if you take the long-range plans to reach the individual segment, each of the business units, if you layer on top of that the $200 million of synergies and the cash tax benefits, it's clearly both strategically and financially compelling and will deliver a strong return for our shareholders. Anything we can do to either increase that synergy number or get the synergy numbers faster will make a great deal, almost a stunning deal. So that's the work we're on at this point in time. As we move into a broader and bigger business, we start really with 2 priorities: one is, what's it going to take for us to be first choice from a consumer and a customer perspective; and secondly, how do we ensure that we're driving an appropriate and expected total shareholder return? And when it comes to our reinvestment decisions, I will always guard the flexibility that we require to really look at these things across the areas. One is, in a volatile world, how do we offset inflation challenges we may face in our business? And obviously, transactional FX is part of that note, something we've got to consider. Secondly, where can we invest for the highest return across our brand portfolio? And we've got a pretty sophisticated return on marketing investment model in the U.S., and that's something we are now rolling out more broadly in our business. And then, thirdly, we can flow some of those savings straight through to the bottom line. So there are 3 principal areas of opportunity, but I'm not going to give you guidance as to how we will prioritize those because that will be real tight. That will depend on competitive pressures. That will depend on the economic environment within which we're trading. And as you rightly said, that's difficult to second guess and quite volatile at this point in time. I think the important thing is we will have options, and those options then give us the flexibility to build our business in a way which is right from both the first-choice and a shareholder return perspective. And that's a good place to be, so I probably wouldn't comment beyond that in terms of the specifics."

Robert, thanks for that. Probably the way I would comment on this is to start from a perspective that both Coors and Miller, when you think about their positioning, are quite distinctive, and both of them have got a safe place in the story behind what you think is compelling from a consumer perspective. And Gavin and David and the team in the U.S. have demonstrated that both brands can live in a market in a complementary fashion, and I think that can be true at other international markets as well. Coors Light's positioning is very much our own Rocky Mountain Cold Refreshment. The Miller positioning, if you think MGDs, much more urban. And I think on different occasions for different consumers, then they can act in a very complementary fashion. And the opportunity with the Miller International brands transaction is it gives us the opportunity for a step-change scale difference in our international markets and getting both of those brands working in a complementary fashion, along with Staropramen, which, clearly, again, is very unique and distinctive.

On the call today, David and I will take you through the highlights of our full year and fourth quarter 2015 results from the Molson Coors Brewing Company, along with some perspectives on 2016. The most strategic -- important strategic development for Molson Coors in 2015 was the definitive agreement we reached late in the year to purchase 58% of MillerCoors that we do not currently own, along with the international rates for the Miller brands, which is a game-changing transaction for our company that's compelling, both financially and strategically. 
Last month, we conducted a common stock offering that will fund about 20% of the total purchase price and helps us to maintain investment-grade ratings on our debt. We plan to fund the balance of the purchase price with new debt and cash on hand. We have a dedicated team working towards completion of the pending transaction, which is currently expected in the second half of 2016. Meanwhile, the rest of our organization remains absolutely focused on growing our existing business and brands as well as delivering total returns to our shareholders. 
With regard to business performance, the financial results we released this morning are in line with the preliminary fourth quarter financial results and updated 2015 free cash flow guidance ranges that we issued 2 weeks ago. Overall, we are pleased with the progress our company made in 2015. We exceeded our targets for cash generation and cost savings and expanded underlying gross and pretax margins globally. We grew our Above Premium business globally, including craft, flavored malt beverages and cider. We gained share of the key Premium Light segment in the U.S. and accelerated the growth of our International business, including a bolt-on acquisition in the fast-growing India market. 
We continue to focus on building a stronger brand portfolio, delivering value-added innovation, strengthening our core brand positions through incremental marketing investments and continuing to premiumize our portfolio. We began to see the benefits flow to our top line performance as the year progressed. And for example, Coors Light and Miller Lite both gained share of the Premium Light segment in the U.S. in the last 3 quarters of 2015, and Coors Light grew 0.3% globally and more than 15% in our Europe and international markets for the full year. In constant currency, we achieved positive net pricing globally as well as in most of our major markets. And these achievements are against the backdrop of a continued difficult economy and competitive pressures, along with significant unfavorable foreign currency and the termination of major business contracts, as we highlighted through last year.
Our focus on growing our Above Premium segment continued in 2015 as we completed the acquisition of Saint Archer in the U.S. with a quarterly cider [ph] brand distribution rates in the U.K. and Ireland and repatriated the rights of Staropramen in the U.K. We also expanded our global footprint and accelerated the growth of our International business through the acquisition of Mount Shivalik Breweries in India and our recent entrance into the Colombian beer market. 
Our craft portfolio drove growth from Doom Bar in the U.K., Granville Island in Canada and Blue Moon in the U.S. and also the U.K. And our American cider portfolio delivered strong growth, led by Carling British cider in Europe, Molson Canadian Cider and Strongbow in Canada and Smith & Forge Hard Cider in the U.S.
We also used our profit after capital charge, our patent model, as a key driver for our cash and capital allocation decisions. As a result, we drove additional working capital improvements and delivered underlying free cash flow of $704 million for the year, which exceeded our original guidance by more than $150 million or nearly 30%. PACC informed our approach to the MillerCoors acquisition, along with the Mount Shivalik, Staropramen in U.K. and Rekorderlig transactions and the substantial restructure of our China business last year.
Additionally, we continue to transform and strengthen our business through improvements in our sales execution and revenue management capabilities. We increased the efficiency of our operations, and we implemented common global systems. To ensure that our supply chain is fit for future, we closed 2 bottling lines and completed our announced plans to close 4 breweries across our company, along with the planned recapitalization of our Vancouver brewery.
We exceeded our cost reduction goal of $40 million to $60 million in Molson Coors by delivering almost $65 million of savings in 2015. And in addition, MillerCoors achieved $88 million of cost reductions in 2015, of which our share is $37 million.
In performance headlines for the full year in 2015, we delivered $1.33 billion of underlying EBITDA and $700.4 million of underlying after-tax income or $3.76 per diluted share. Underlying after-tax income declined 9% from a year ago. 
Foreign currency movements and terminated contracts drove the entire decline in both underlying pretax and post-tax income in 2015. Foreign currency impacted earnings by more than $64 million in 2015, while the termination of our Miller brands contract in Canada and our Modelo brands and Heineken brewing contracts in the U.K. drove an additional negative impact of approximately $40 million.
We exceeded our cash generation goal in a challenging year by delivering more than $704 million of underlying free cash flow. And we expanded our PACC model deeper into our company. Use less, earn more and invest wisely is now a common mantra throughout Molson Coors.
Net sales for the year declined 2.2% in constant currency, driven by the effect of terminated contracts. Strong volume performance in Europe and international helped to grow overall worldwide Coors Light volumes for the year. Our overall profit and cash performance, along with the potential of the MillerCoors transaction, helped to drive a positive total shareholder return, such as tap stock price plus dividends of nearly 29% in 2015, which is well above the 1% increase in the total return for the S&P 500 index last year.
Regional highlights for 2015 are as follows. In the U.S., underlying pretax earnings in 2015 were unchanged from the year before, as positive net pricing, sales mix and cost savings were offset by lower volume and increased investments in marketing and information technology. We grew revenue per hectoliter and increased our percent of sales in Above Premium, and we grew our share of the Premium Light segment with both Coors Light and Miller Lite, driven by continued improvements to their packaging and consumer messaging. For Coors Light, the consumer communication rooted in Rocky Mountain Cold Refreshment is more aspirational and reaches legal drinking age men and women alike, while Miller Lite continues to focus authenticity as the original light beer. The new ads began running for Coors Light 2 weeks ago, while Miller Lite benefited most recently from their Limited edition Steinie Bottle. Additionally, Coors Banquet grew volume for the ninth consecutive year. And in the higher-margin Above Premium segment, we grew FMB and craft volume with Redd's, Blue Moon, Leinenkugel's and Smith & Forge Hard Cider brands.
In Canada, underlying pretax income decreased 5.8% in constant currency, primarily due to the negative impact of terminating our Miller brands agreement last year, along with higher marketing and distribution costs and fixed cost deleverage due to lower volume. These factors, which partially -- were partially offset by substantial cost savings and positive pricing, which, along with positive mix, drove constant currency revenue per hectoliter 2.5% higher in 2015. Canada sales to retailer STRs declined 6.3%, primarily due to the termination of the Miller contract. Excluding the impact of the loss of the Miller brands, STRs declined 2.6%. In core brands, Coors Light and Molson Canadian volumes declined, due largely to increased competitor trade spend and pricing activities in key regions, while we continue to invest by new advertising and commercial executions for both brands. Encouragingly, Coors Banquet delivered strong volume and share growth as the #1 new brand introduction in Canada in the past 5 years. Also, in Above Premium and craft, Mad Jack Apple Lager, Molson Canadian Cider and Strongbow Cider also grew volume and share in 2015, along with our Six Pints craft brands.
In Europe, 2015 underlying pretax income decreased 5.7% in constant currency, driven by the termination of the Modelo brands and Heineken brewing contracts in the U.K. Excluding the impact of the contract termination, Europe's ongoing business grew volume, sales mix, gross margins and underlying pretax income in constant currency. Sales volume increased in 7 of 11 countries and for 6 of our 11 lead brands in the region. Carling grew share of its segment in 2015, and trends continue to improve as the year progressed, while Shishko [ph] and Bergenbier grew volume and segment share in their core markets. And Above Premium portfolio performed well with Coors Light, Sharp's Brewery portfolio, led by Doom Bar and our lighter craft portfolio, including Franciscan Well, achieving strong growth in the year, as did Staropramen outside of the Czech Republic. Our Europe cider portfolio grew at double-digit rate in 2015. And the integration of the Rekorderlig cider business into our U.K. and Ireland portfolio went well in the second half of the year, as did the ramp-up for the full repatriation of the Staropramen brand into our U.K. portfolio at the start of 2016.
Our International business delivered double-digit volume growth in 2015, driven by very strong volume growth in India, primarily due to our acquisition of Mount Shivalik Breweries early in 2015, along with double-digit growth of our Coors Light in Latin America, including launching the brand in Colombia. We ended the year with a $5.1 million increase in International's underlying pretax loss versus a year ago, primarily due to foreign currency movements and the substantial restructure of our China business. In constant currency, underlying pretax loss increased by $0.8 million.
Now I'll turn over to David to give fourth quarter financial highlights and perspective on 2016. David?"
263765,248335814,932337,"Molson Coors Brewing Company, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 11, 2016",2016-02-11,"Earnings Calls","Molson Coors Beverage Company","Executives","Thank you, Mark, and hello, everybody. As we consistently communicated throughout last year, foreign currency and the termination of business contracts were a drag on our financial performance, including in the fourth quarter. Worldwide beer volume for Mo",1201,"Thank you, Mark, and hello, everybody. As we consistently communicated throughout last year, foreign currency and the termination of business contracts were a drag on our financial performance, including in the fourth quarter. Worldwide beer volume for Molson Coors decreased 1.7%, but Coors Light grew nearly 1% globally and more than 13% in Europe and International.
Headline net sales were down approximately 13% in U.S. dollars. However, excluding the previously referenced strengths, net sales increased on the strength of positive pricing, along with higher volume in Europe and International.
Our underlying pretax income decreased by 21.1%, with more than half of this decline driven by foreign currency and termination of business contracts. The balance was due to a planned increase in brand investments in the quarter in the U.S. and Canada. Underlying after-tax income decreased by 11.3% to $90.6 million or $0.49 per share. 
On a U.S. GAAP basis, we reported income from continuing operations attributable to Molson Coors of $33.4 million, which is 64.2% lower than in the prior year. In addition to the factors that drove lower underlying income, higher special and other noncore charges, primarily related to supply chain restructuring and MillerCoors acquisition financing drove the decrease.
Our underlying EBITDA was $227.3 million in the fourth quarter, 17% lower than the year ago, driven by unfavorable foreign currency, the impact of terminated business contracts and higher marketing investments in the U.S. and Canada. Please see the earnings release we distributed earlier this morning for a detailed review of our business unit financial results in the quarter. 
In the area of cost savings, we exceeded our 2015 goal by achieving almost $65 million of in-year cost reductions across our company, driven by Canada and Europe. These cost savings exclude MillerCoors, of which our share is another $37 million. We now expect cost savings over the next 2 years to be in the range of $50 million to $70 million, slightly higher than our previous guidance of $40 million to $60 million. This view excludes cost synergies resulting from the pending MillerCoors acquisition, which we expect to be $200 million by year 4 following the transaction's close.
We were pleased to generate more than $704 million of underlying free cash flow in 2015 and exceed our cash flow guidance by more than $150 million. A strong fourth quarter working capital performance was further enhanced by higher-than-anticipated distributions from MillerCoors, lower cash taxes and capital expenditures. Whilst there were some onetime impacts, we do not believe these were significant. A detailed reconciliation of our 2015 and 2014 underlying free cash flow is available in our earnings release this morning.
Total debt at the end of the fourth quarter was just over $2.9 billion. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $431 million, resulting in a net debt of $2.5 billion. This is $55 million lower than prior year, primarily due to foreign currency movements. 
So looking forward to 2016. All of the following matrix exclude any effects of the MillerCoors transaction, the timing of which will have a big impact on virtually all guidance measures. Currently, we expect cash contributions to our defined benefit pension plans to be in the range of $45 million to $65 million in 2016, down approximately $250 million from last year, including our 42% of MillerCoors contributions. We anticipate 2016 pension expense of approximately $17 million, down from $40 million last year. Note that all of these numbers include our 42% of MillerCoors. 
The overall funded status of the defined-benefit pension plans, including MillerCoors, improved about 7 percentage points from a year ago to approximately 97% at the end of 2015. This increase was driven primarily by the large additional voluntary contribution of $227 million to the U.K. plan in 2015.
Our 2016 capital spending outlook is approximately $300 million, up from $269 million last year, largely due to planned supply chain projects in Canada.
We expect our 2016 MG&A expense in corporate to be approximately $120 million, including additional investments behind our global commercial efforts, but excluding any costs related to the MillerCoors transaction. 
Our consolidated net interest expense outlook for 2016 is approximately $110 million, excluding any interest costs related to the MillerCoors acquisition. We expect our 2016 underlying effective tax rate to be in the range of 18% to 22%, assuming no further changes in tax laws, settlement of tax audits or adjustments to our own certain tax provisions. If the MillerCoors deal closes in the second half of this year, we expect our long-term tax rate to be in the range of 25% to 28%, also assuming no changes in tax laws or audit resolutions. We expect our cash tax rate to be significantly lower than this range due to the more than $250 million of cash tax benefits stemming from the asset nature of the MillerCoors transaction.
In 2016, we anticipate moderately higher investments in our brands globally. The impact of terminated contracts are now largely behind us. We anticipate foreign currency will continue to be a headwind of note, primarily as a result of the weakening Canadian dollar. To provide a sense of the challenge, if we were to apply foreign exchange rates at the end of last month to our 2015 results, it would reduce last year's underlying pretax earnings and free cash flow by approximately $35 million, with most of this impact in Canada. 
Regarding underlying free cash flow guidance, we are pleased with our free cash flow track record and our performance over the last couple of years in particular, as we have further embedded our PACC methodology, which is ensuring a strong focus of cash management across our business. You will also have seen some significant upside volatility to our guidance in 2014 and 2015. As we come into 2016, we have a number of large dynamic factors in play in relation to cash use and cash deployment, in part due to the pending MillerCoors transaction. And therefore, we'll issue specific 2016 free cash flow guidance later in the year with the goal of removing some of the recent volatility to guidance that has occurred.
As far as our cost outlook is concerned, we expect the cost of goods sold per hectoliter in MillerCoors, Canada, Europe and our International business in local currency to increase at a low single-digit rate for the full year 2016. In each of our businesses, we anticipate higher costs related to product and packaging innovation.
Finally, here are the most recent volume trends for each of our businesses early in the first quarter. In the U.S. through the first 5 weeks of the year, STRs decreased to low single-digit rate. In Canada for January, STRs were down low double digits. Excluding the Miller brands last year, our Canada STRs in January decreased at a high single-digit rate. In Europe, volume through to February 8 decreased low single digits. And our International sales volume, including royalty volume, decreased at mid-single-digit rate in January. As ever, please keep in mind these numbers represent only a proportion of the current quarter and trends could change in the weeks ahead.
At this point, I'll turn it back over to Mark for outlook, wrap-up and the Q&A. Mark?"

In 2016, we will have a relentless focus on delighting our consumers and our customers to ensure we are the first-choice brewer in the geographies and segments where we choose to play. We will continue to drive our strategy of building a stronger brand portfolio, thus delivering value-added innovation, strengthening our core brand positions and increasing our share in Above Premium, FMBs, craft and ciders segments. We will do this while ensuring that we have a fit-for-purpose cost base and a deeply embedded PACC-led capital allocation approach.
Regionally, in the U.S., MillerCoors began to drive substantial changes to the business in the latter half of 2015 that were necessary to create a foundation for volume growth we aim to achieve by 2019. In addition to Gavin taking over as CEO, new commercial leadership and the appointment of new ad agencies, the difficult decision was also made to close the Eden brewery. 
In American light lagers, the revitalization of our 2 largest brands is progressing well, and we are seeing segment share growth for both Coors Light and Miller Lite for the first time since MillerCoors was formed nearly 8 years ago. In Above Premium, we continue to focus in higher-margin offerings that can scale and stick, including further extensions from Leinenkugel's and Blue Moon. And in cider, we're broadening the appeal of Smith & Forge Hard Cider by adding a bottle package to our lineup. 
In early January, to strengthen our FMB portfolio, we launched Henry's Hard Soda, which has been met with great enthusiasm from our distributors and retail partners. And our U.S. team is also developing new strategies to improve the performance of our economy brands, which have been a drag on our volume trends. We'll continue to build first-choice customer partnerships, working with our distributors to bring more resources to the on-premise with our building material retail strategy, which leverages the higher velocity and broad appeal of American light lagers. 
In Canada, we've just launched the newest chapter in our Molson Canadian Anything For Hockey campaign, generating 80 million media impressions in the first week. In Coors Light, we will significantly increase programming and further evolve our communications with a new campaign building on learnings from 2015. In Above Premium, consumer demand remains strong for Coors Banquet, Belgian Moon, Molson Canadian Cider and Mad Jack Lager. And building on that momentum, we will introduce new variants in the successful and rapidly growing Mad Jack brand and also our ciders, which have been exceeding growth expectations. Finally, in addition to Heineken, Strongbow and Heineken's other top end import brands, such as Dos Equis and Sol, with the start of this year, we also picked up the distribution of all Heineken trading brands in Canada as well. In 2016, we'll also continue to restructure our business to ensure we are fit for future, including the sale of our Vancouver brewery, which will allow us to build a more efficient and flexible brewery over the next few years. 
In Europe, the terminated Heineken contracts in the U.K. will continue to present a headwind in the first quarter, as will the new amortization expense for the brands that we impaired in the third quarter of last year and moved to definite light. We will continue to invest in our core brand portfolio across Europe to grow share of segment, and we'll also continue to premiumize our portfolio. And starting in 2016, we expect Rekorderlig Cider and Staropramen in the U.K. to contribute more than 350,000 hectoliters of Above Premium volume annually to our Europe business and to provide attractive growth potential for the future. 
In combination with the integration of the Franciscan Well craft brands in Ireland and the acquisition of the brewing and kegging operations of Thomas Hardy's Burtonwood brew in England, we now have a broad range of consumer and customer offerings in the Above Premium, craft and cider segments across the U.K. and Ireland. Additionally, we're implementing significant new initiatives to further improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our European operations and provide more resources to invest in driving top line and bottom line growth. As the 2 most recent examples, we closed one of our breweries in Bulgaria in November 2015, and we've entered into a consultation process in the U.K. regarding our proposal to close our Burton South Brewery and consolidate production within our recently modernized Burton North brewery by the end of 2017. 
Our International business is focused on attaining profitability in 2016 on a constant currency basis versus 2013 when we made this commitment and continuing to accelerate our overall growth and expansion in new and existing markets. Upon closing of the MillerCoors transaction, we are planning to integrate the Miller brands into our International portfolio and leverage our footprint that complements our growth strategy and allows us to gain entrance into high-priority markets while increasing our business scale in current markets. We'll also continue to drive rapid growth for Coors Light in Latin America, including the high-potential Colombia market, where we launched in the fourth quarter. Going forward Coors, Miller and Staropramen will form the backbone of our International brand portfolio.
So to summarize our discussion today, the most important strategic development for Molson Coors in 2015 was the definitive agreement we reached late in the year to purchase 58% of MillerCoors that we do not currently own, along with the international rights to the Miller brands. Beyond this game-changing transaction for our company, we were pleased with the overall progress our company made in 2015. We exceeded our targets for cash generation and cost savings and expanded gross margins and underlying pretax margins globally. We grew our Above Premium craft, FMB and cider business globally; gained share of the key Premium Light segment in the U.S.; and accelerated the growth of our International business, including a bolt-on acquisition in the fast-growing India market. 
In 2016, we will continue to focus on building a stronger brand portfolio, delivering value-added innovation, investing behind the strength of our core brand positions and continuing to premiumize our portfolio, all driven through a PACC lens.

So if you will just indulge us and be a little bit patient with us and give it a little bit of time, I'd like to offer free cash flow guidance a lot later in the year, which I think removes some of the volatility that we've seen over the course of the last couple of years and make sense of some of the moving parts.

Well, why don't I offer Vivien a bit of context about the business, and I'll come directly to your question. And I think if you look at it, the strategy we set out 3 years ago, we've overhauled the design of our supply chain network, and we've reduced the G&A cost structures in our business and improved our commercial capabilities. Despite the loss of Corona and Miller, our portfolio is much stronger, and we've driven out cost savings, which have allowed us to stabilize the earnings performance. I think the context then puts the business in a much stronger strategic position. So now let me go to what's going on in the consumer world. I don't have a corresponding analog that you can look to for guidance. But in this past quarter, we saw food prices up by around 4%, and I think 4.5% in that range as CPI was lower because of the lower fuel cost. But the way it's manifesting itself across the country is that in the oil-rich provinces, those provinces are being very heavily hit. So we saw a big shift in volume between premium and economy brands in Saskatchewan -- in Alberta. We saw falling volumes in Newfoundland, Saskatchewan and Alberta, so the consumer is under pressure. And I think if you add to that the fact that consumer debt in Canada is at an all-time high, it just -- it's made for quite a difficult recipe in some of those provinces."

Generally speaking, the environment is as it has been for many, many years [indiscernible]. Slight migration from on-trade to off-trade and a fairly difficult market in terms of getting pricing away, which is why we want to continue the journey we've had in terms of premiumizing our portfolio because we think that's the way to create value in the U.K. in the long term. We've demonstrated a real ability to do that because Coors Light, as we mentioned earlier, is growing at double digits. Our craft portfolio is growing through Doom Bar and Sharp's at double digits, as is our cider portfolio. So we'll withstand whatever macro difficulties there may be in the market on pricing by making sure that we're actually adjusting our portfolio towards the premium end, which we've done very successfully in recent history.

If you really look at the way we built out the portfolio, it's been all of the Above Premium end. We've been pushing hard against the growth in our craft brands, launched the Mad Jack, Banquet. All of those things had been addressed in the upper end of our portfolio. When I look back at the fourth quarter, our Above Premium portfolio grew share, so I feel good about that. If you talk about the mainstream part of the portfolio, that part of the portfolio has been under pressure, some things that are industry-related and some things where -- some places where we've made some choices. From an industry perspective, the pressure on mainstream has been primarily in the -- some of the provinces that I called out earlier. In terms of choices we'd made, we made profit-positive choices in Québec to adjust the pricing of Coors Light, and that's been a good thing for our P&L, and it's been the right decision for the -- for our brand. We held share in total in Québec, but we lost share with Coors Light. That was about 1/3 of the Coors Light loss. I think the last impact on Coors Light specifically has been cannibalization from Banquet. When you go beyond Coors Light, Molson Canadian actually held share of segment during the quarter. So the pressure point for us is Coors Light. We feel great about where the portfolio is in total. We feel good about the strategy on Coors Light, and we're focused against 2016 to execute that. What are the places where we feel good? Our advertising is scoring very well. Our activation, if you looked at what we did in the back half of 2015 and what we've got planned for 2016, is significantly better than what we saw in the 2 years prior to that, and it's the kind of activation that we expect will attract our target audience of young millennials. And as you mentioned, of course, Mark, we have put more money behind the brand. So I think that covers sort of portfolio and the region question. Perhaps I could just talk to mix for a second. We did see down-trading from consumers into economy. We also felt the mix pressures on COGS certainly from our U.S.-sourced products. From an overall perspective on price, I'd look to the full year. Against the full year, we got 2.5% of price against 2.5% of COGS."

The first big platform of volume and value, and you're right to call this out, relates to Canada and also the U.K. and Ireland. So that will be rolled into our existing business. The second platform are those markets where we already have a route-to-market solution. The best example I can give you is Panama, where we have a strong partner there, and Miller would be a step-up in terms of our scale in that market place. And then thirdly, there's a platform of volume and value, which is in markets where we currently do not have a route-to-market effect to market. It's Argentina and South Africa. Clearly, there's consumer and customer demand in those markets. Kandy and his team are now working through what our route-to-market options will be. Assuming that we land an appropriate route-to-market option for the Miller brands, we can then use that to then, over time, introduce other Molson Coors brands. So that's as simple as I can make it.

Over the next -- assuming the MillerCoors transaction closes over the next couple of years, between what you've talked about today about your incremental savings potential in the underlying businesses and then the cost savings that you expect or the synergy you expect to extract as a result of the MillerCoors merger, you're going to have a significant amount of cost savings sort of at your disposal. And the market's pretty volatile, right? I mean, there's a lot of dynamics and a lot of things changing in the beer industry and certainly, in terms of the economy. So can you just maybe talk a little bit about how you're thinking about that reinvestment decision in the context of the world, how volatile the world is, payback, how quickly you're expecting it to pay back and maybe just a little color on how much of that reinvestment is in things like products and advertising and marketing as opposed to, I don't know, things that are more hard, like infrastructure or salespeople? And maybe the last piece to that is just where you think that stacks up relative to your competitors in your major markets. So you've got savings. You can lean into these markets and spend more.

Let me try and chunk it up a little bit, Bryan. So I mean, I'm going to start with the deal. If you look at the MillerCoors transaction, assuming that, that goes ahead as anticipated, then if you take the long-range plans for each individual segment, each of the business units, if you layer on top of that the $200 million of synergies and the cash tax benefits, it's clearly both strategically and financially compelling and will deliver a strong return for our shareholders. Anything we can do to either increase that synergy number or get the synergy numbers faster will make a great deal, almost a stunning deal. So that's the work we're on at this point in time. As we move into a broader and bigger business, we start really with 2 priorities: one is, what's it going to take for us to be first choice from a consumer and a customer perspective; and secondly, how do we ensure that we're driving an appropriate and expected total shareholder return? And when it comes to our reinvestment decisions, I will always guard the flexibility that we require to really look at these things across the areas. One is, in a volatile world, how do we offset inflation challenges we may face in our business? And obviously, transactional FX is part of that note, something we've got to consider. Secondly, where can we invest for the highest return across our brand portfolio? And we've got a pretty sophisticated return on marketing investment model in the U.S., and that's something we are now rolling out more broadly in our business. And then, thirdly, we can flow some of those savings straight through to the bottom line. So there are 3 principal areas of opportunity, but I'm not going to give you guidance as to how we will prioritize those because that will be real tight. That will depend on competitive pressures. That will depend on the economic environment within which we're trading. And as you rightly said, that's difficult to second guess and quite volatile at this point in time. I think the important thing is we will have options, and those options then give us the flexibility to build our business in a way which is right from both the first-choice and a shareholder return perspective. And that's a good place to be, so I probably wouldn't comment beyond that in terms of the specifics."

And the opportunity with the Miller International brands transaction is it gives us the opportunity for a step-change scale difference in our international markets and getting both of those brands working in a complementary fashion, along with Staropramen, which, clearly, again, is very unique and distinctive. And then with -- it can have a second-tier opportunity around our global craft portfolio. I think it sets us up for some really significant potential as we look out into the future with our International business."

And my understanding is most of that is in Canada this year and next. You then are bringing in MillerCoors, and you've talked about the $200 million of cost synergies there. Can you just help me think through how you're talking about those 2 work streams, if you will, and how you can kind of think separately about the legacy cost savings in the context of the fact that you're now going to be having the opportunity to run a total North American cost structure, which presumably would change some of the calculus in terms of your legacy programs? Or is it such that you're actually just going to be running the U.S. and Canada very separately so that's not so much of an issue?"

But the simple way to think about this is that the business case for the MillerCoors transaction assumes that our ongoing organic cost saving programs, which we've now signaled as $50 million to $70 million, are embedded in our long-range plans. The $200 million of synergies, which clearly we're now stress testing both from a quantum and a pace perspective, will set us at an overlay to that. And we are very clear on our business about what I describe as, let's call it, organic or day job cost programs and then the opportunity associated with the transaction and the aggregation of our businesses. And we're working very hard to keep those separate. So once we've done the work through the integration planning, we'll go to update on both quantum and timing of synergies.

David is now transitioning back to his role as our Europe CFO as we welcome our new Global CFO, Mauricio who joined Molson Coors yesterday and is here with us this morning. 
Before our earnings call today, David and I will take you through the highlights of our first quarter 2016 results for the Molson Coors Brewing Company, along with some perspective on the balance of 2016. 
In the first quarter, we continue to focus in our First Choice ambition and on building a stronger brand portfolio delivering value-added innovation, strengthening our core brand positioning through incremental marketing investments and continuing to premiumize our portfolio. We began to see the benefits to our top line performance as we grew worldwide volume, improved core brand momentum in key markets, introduced fast-growing innovations in all of our businesses and achieved strong Above Premium growth globally, including in craft, flavored malt beverages and cider. We also significantly expanded gross operating and pretax margins globally and increased total company underlying after-tax earnings more than 28% while growing underlying EBITDA more than 15% versus a year ago.
At the same time, we completed a common stock offering in January to fund about 20% of the pending MillerCoors transaction, and we made solid progress in our planning for the integration of MillerCoors and the Miller global brand portfolio. Completion of this game-changing transaction is still expected in the second half of this year, and we intend to be ready to go on day 1 following the close. 
In brands, Coors Light grew volume 3.5% globally, including strong double-digit growth in the U.K. and Ireland and high-single digit growth in Latin America. In Above Premium, our craft portfolio drove from Doom Bar and broader shops portfolio in the U.K. and in Canada, Blue Moon Belgian White in the U.S. and in the U.K. and its sister brand, Belgian Moon in Canada and also the newly acquires in the U.S. In ciders, we grew volume of Rekorderlig in Europe and in Strongbow in Canada. In flavored malt beverages, the introduction of soda is proceeding well expectations and driving incremental Above Premium volume for us in the U.S. We continue to strengthen our business through improvements to our sales execution and revenue management capabilities. We increased efficiency of our operations, and we implemented common global systems. To ensure that our supply chain is fit for future, we completed the sale of our Vancouver brewery in Canada for CAD 185 million and we'll lease the brewery back from the buyer as we build a new, more efficient and flexible brewery. We also gained agreement to the closure of Burton South Brewery in the U.K., allowing us to further consolidate U.K. brewing operations. 
Regional highlights for the first quarter are as follows. In the U.S., underlying equity income increased 22.1% from a year ago, driven by higher net pricing, positive sales mix, timing of shipments and lower cost of goods sold. Coors Light and Miller Lite each gained share in the U.S. premium light segment for the fourth consecutive quarter, with both brands achieving flat sales-to-retail volume for the first time in MillerCoors history. Improved momentum for these 2 brands was driven by ongoing improvements to our consumer communications, which appears to our broad cross-section of men and women, millennials and multicultural consumers.
Coors Banquet remains the only national premium beer in category that continues to grow. In the higher margin Above Premium segment, craft brand Blue Moon Belgian White delivered another quarter of growth as the Leinenkugel's great for Shandy and a newly acquired Saint Archer brands. In FMBs, we achieved strong initial results from introduction of Henry's Hard Sodas in the first quarter. According to Nielsen, Henry's hard orange soda has the best velocity of any hard soda since the fourth week of its launch, and Henry's Hard ginger ale soda is the #1 ginger ale in this fast-growing segment. 
In Canada, we delivered strong earnings growth with our top line performance was lower in both volume and revenue per hectoliter. And brands Coors Light and Molson Canadian both had the challenging quarter, and we're taking additional concrete steps to improve performance in the balance of the year, which I'll discuss in a few minutes. In Above Premium and craft, Coors Banquet, Belgian Moon, Mad Jack Apple Lager, Heineken and Strongbow Cider all grew volume and share in the quarter along with our and craft brands. 
In headline financial results for the quarter, Canada underlying pretax income increased 25.2% in constant currency, primarily due to a timing-led reduction in distribution costs, lower pension expenses and results of our ongoing cost saving initiatives.
These factors were partially offset by the impact of lower volume and higher brand investments. Excluding the impact of the loss of the Miller brands, Canada STRs declined 1.6%. Including the Miller brands STRs declined 5.2%. Increased competitor trade spend and pricing activities, especially in Québec in the west region, led to overall softer volume.
In Europe, earnings were lower in the quarter, primarily due to higher brand investments and amortization expenses, lower net pension benefit and the termination of the Heineken contract brewing arrangement in the U.K. Notwithstanding our business, our business and our brands performed well across the region. We increased market share, and we continue to premiumize our portfolio and reduce costs. We grew our volume in 7 of 11 countries and for [ph] 7 of our lead core and premium brands in the region. In core brands, Carling, Bergenbier beer and increased share of segment in their primary markets. Above Premium portfolio increased momentum with strong double-digit growth by Coors Light on the craft portfolio, including Doom Bar and other Sharp's brands. Additionally, our cider portfolio achieved strong growth with the inclusion of Rekorderlig since the middle of 2015, and the full repatriation of the Staropramen brand in the U.K. also added to the solid progress made in premiumizing our Europe portfolio. 
Our International business improved pretax performance in the first quarter, driven by continued volume growth in Latin America, India and Japan as well as lower marketing and overhead expenses due to substantial restructure of our China business last year. Coors Light grew a high single-digit rate in international markets due to launch in Colombia as well as growth in our existing Latin America markets.
Now I'll turn over to David to give our first quarter financial highlights and perspective for the balance of 2016. David?"

Headline net sales increased 0.1% on a constant currency basis, driven by 1.2% growth in worldwide volume. Including foreign currency movements, net sales were down approximately 6% in U.S. dollars. Our net sales per hectoliter decreased 1.9% in constant currency due to negative mix in Canada and lower Heineken contract brewing volume in Europe. Underlying after-tax income increased 28.1% to $110.3 million or $0.54 per share, driven by worldwide volume growth and lower cost of goods sold.
On a U.S. GAAP basis, we reported income from continuing operations attributable to Molson Coors of $159.3 million, which is nearly double the prior year results. In addition to the factors that drove underlying income, this increase was primarily due to $110.4 million gain on the sale of the Vancouver brewery at the end of the first quarter, partially offset by special charges related to brewery closures. Please note that we received the cash from the Vancouver brewery sale on the first day of the second quarter.
Underlying EBITDA in the quarter is $263.4 million, a 15.2% increase from a year ago. We issued 29.9 million shares of Class B common stock from our equity offering in January for approximately $2.5 billion of net proceeds, which will fund about 20% of the $12 billion pending MillerCoors transaction.
Please see the earnings release we distributed earlier this morning for a detailed review of our business unit financial results in the quarter. Total debt at the end of the first quarter was $3 billion, and cash and cash equivalents totaled $2.6 billion, resulting in a net debt of just over $400 million, which is significantly lower than prior year due to the proceeds received from our equity offering earlier this year.
Looking forward to the remainder of 2016, our strong first quarter results were aided by the timing of Easter holiday and the additional days sales as a result of 2016 being a leap year along with relatively favorable cost compression in the U.S. and lower Canada distribution costs. We anticipate that the results will not benefit from most of these factors in the balance of this year. Other trends to consider for the last 3 quarters of this year include higher investments in our brands this year including a double-digit increase globally in the second quarter leading into peak season in the U.S, Canada and Europe. Incremental Europe expense with an annualized impact of approximately $15 [ph] million, which began in the fourth quarter of 2015 along with lower net pension benefit in Europe this year. A total prohibition on the sale of alcohol and expected the implemented by the state government in India in early April. We don't know how long this ban will be in place, and we expect this development to present headwind for International business results as this is our largest state of operation in India. Note, however, that this prohibition of has no impact on the business in India that we purchased last year. The impact of terminated contracts, which are now nearly all behind us and, finally, foreign currency translation, which at current exchange rates would not be a significant factor in our underlying pretax results of this year. This appears improved significantly since our February earnings call because of the recent strengthening of the Canadian dollar to the U.S. dollars. Given the recent volatility of our key foreign currencies, however, it is important to watch these rates closely.
Regarding 2016 guidance, all of the following matrix exclude any effects of the MillerCoors and Miller global brands transaction, the timing of which will have a big impact on virtually all guidance measures. For the full year, we expect cash contributions to our defined pension plan to be in the range of $45 million to $65 million in 2016 and pension expense of approximately $17 [ph] million including our 42% of MillerCoors contributions and expense. Capital spending of approximately $300 million, MG&A expense and corporate of approximately $120 million as we invest more behind innovation and commercial excellence this year. Consolidated net interest expense of approximately $110 million and underlying effective tax rate in the range of 18% to 22%, assuming no further changes in tax laws, settlement of tax audits or uncertain tax provisions.
Regarding free cash flow guidance, we still have a large number of dynamic factors in play in relation to cash use and capital deployment, principally due to the pending MillerCoors transaction and, therefore, we plan to issue 2016 underlying free cash flow guidance later in the year with the goal of removing some of the recent volatility to guidance that has occurred. As far as cost outlook is concerned, we continue to expect cost of goods sold per hectoliter in Canada and Europe in local currency to increase at low single-digit rate for full year 2016. We now expect 2016 MillerCoors COGS per hectoliter to be approximately in line with prior year. Lower-than-expected prices of the diesel, aluminum and as well as acceleration of summer our cost savings initiatives drove the change from previous guidance above the low single digits.
We now expect our international COGS per hectoliter and local currency to increase at the high single-digit rate for 2016. This is up from low single digits previously due to geographic mix changes.
We continue to expect cost savings for the next 2 years to be in the range of $50 million to $70 million. This excludes cost savings from MillerCoors as well as synergies resulting from the pending MillerCoors acquisition, which we expect to be $200 million by the year following the transaction close. Finally, here are the most recent volume trends for each of the businesses early in the second quarter, which are impacted by the early timing of the Easter this year. In the U.S. and Canada for the 3 weeks through April 23, sales to retail decreased at [ph] mid-single-digit rates. In Europe, volume through April 25 decreased low single digits. And our international sales volume, including royalty volume through to April 23 decreased our double-digit rate, partially due to the alcohol prohibition in being all, India. As ever, please keep in mind these numbers represent only a portion of the current quarter, and trends could change in the weeks ahead. Also, note that although we closed the pending MillerCoors transaction, we plan to discontinue providing early next quarter volumes.
At this point, I'll turn it back over to Mark for outlook, wrap-up and the Q&A. Mark?"

In 2016, we will continue to drive our First Choice for consumer and customer agenda in the geographies and segments where we choose to play. As we move into peak season this year, we are seeing additional competitive pricing pressure and we intend to step up our brand investment significantly, particularly in the second quarter. In the U.S, there has been a great deal of change in MillerCoors over the past 10 months. Those changes were necessary to create the foundation for the volume growth we aim to achieve by 2019. As we work to close a transaction, MillerCoors remains discipline, decisive and accountable for growing the business and transforming its portfolio and driving value for our shareholders. In American Life lagers gladness, we continue to gain momentum by the revitalization of our 2 largest brands, Coors Light and Miller Red Light in above. We continue to develop higher-margin offerings that can scale including strong early results in the launch of Henry's hard orange and ginger ale sodas and will introduce a cherry cola flavor later this year. We've also made a decision to offer our fastest growing line and Google's extension, great for handy in a year-round basis to strengthen the line in Google's brand family, which alongside Blue Moon and Belgian White forms the base of a formidable craft portfolio. In cider, we're broadening the Smith and Hard Cider, Smith & Forge Hard Cider by adding a bottle package to our lineup. We continue to deliver First Choice customer partnerships with our building with retail strategy, which leverages the higher velocity and broad appeal of American light lagers. We plan to expand this valuable tool beyond on-premise additional channels in the balance of this year.
In Canada, the restructuring of our brand portfolio was largely complete and gaining traction. In the first quarter, we achieved strong volume growth behind Coors Banquet and Pilsner. We also continue to see strong momentum for our craft brands and Granville Island as well as in our Mexican portfolio with and and the flavored malt beverages with Mad Jack. At the end of the quarter, we launched Mad Jack root beer and ginger ale, the first major hard soda increase in Canada. We continue to focus on accelerating growth for our core brands, Coors Light and Molson Canadian, as our biggest opportunity and challenge. Coors Light brands helped us improve behind our North American packaging update, which continue to roll out in first quarter along with high impact retail execution such as positive momentum and social engagement. For Molson Canadian, following another successful for hockey company in the first quarter will continue into peak season with strong programming and new communication that celebrates all of the rich qualities of our beer and our Canadian identity. Operationally, we continue on our mission to first choice for consumers and customers focusing on our sales management program to deliver brilliant store level execution across space assortment and pricing. In 2016, we will also continue to restructure our supply chain to ensure we are fit for the future. The sale of our Vancouver brewery for CAD 185 million at the end of the first quarter was a significant first step towards allowing us to build a more efficient and flexible brewery over the next few years.
In Europe, we achieved solid top line performance in the first quarter on the strength of our core brands and the addition of the Rekorderlig cider and Staropramen brands in the U.K. Our load increased brand amortization expense will present ahead and for the next couple of quarters will continue to invest in our core brand portfolio across Europe to grow share of segment. In fact, earlier today, we announced the signing of a global Carling sponsorship as the official beer partner of the English premier league. This sponsorship reaches well beyond Carling in the U.K. It allows us to leverage any branded any market with the most sports properties globally. We also continue to premiumize our portfolio with Coors Light, Sharp's portfolio led by Doom Bar. Ireland's leading craft brand consistent well COBRA, Rekorderlig and Staropramen and to ensure that our supply chain is fit for future, the plant closure of our broken site brew in the U.K. is progressing well along with the transition of production to a recently modernized Burton month brewery by the end of 2017. Our International business is focused on attaining profitability in 2016. On a cost and currency basis, versus 2015 foreign exchange rates when we originally made this commitment and continuing to accelerate our overall growth and existing in select new markets. Upon closing of the MillerCoors and Miller global brands transaction, we will integrate the Miller international brands into our portfolio and leverage a footprint in the complement our growth strategy and allows us to gain entrance into priority markets while increasing our business, scale and current markets. We also intend to continue to drive rapid growth for Coors Light in Latin America, including the high potential market where we launched the end of last year. Going forward, we expect the course Miller and Staropramen brands to form the backbone of our international portfolio. In India, we'll continue to add skill through our Mount Shivalik business, which we acquired last year as we developed contingency plan related to the BR alcohol prohibition. 
To wrap up. In the balance of 2016, we'll continue to focus on our First Choice for consumers and customer -- customers' ambition, all driven through our lens and with intent to drive total shareholder returns.

But actually, just Mark, step back one second and just say that as we look at our strategic plan 3 years ago, we really built out 3 big blocks. One was redoing our supply chain footprint. The other was lowering our G&A cost base, and the third was improving our commercial capability and portfolio. So -- and those are relevant. Why? Because on the cost base and the supply chain the savings that we're getting from that have allowed us to start to feed the investments required to get the brands going. On the brand side, we're really focused on making sure that we had the portfolio that was right for consumers. And on the Above Premium, which is where we built up all the brands, we're performing well, and we're really happy with those brands. On Molson Canadian and on Coors Light, those brands sit in the mainstream. That is the part of the market that is under the most pressure. And if you looked at this past quarter, Canadian health share segment, our Coors Light did not. Coors Light is where our real challenge is. I've been pretty clear about calling out where the challenges are for Coors Light. Those being our need to improve our brand scores, our need to reach out to millennials and to engage those consumers more actively in our brands. I think when you look at the first quarter from a cost standpoint, our G&A cost went down. We spent some of that money back in the brands. So that's living our strategy. I think, against the brand itself, we saw finally the introduction of some marketing that is working. Our advertising is scoring better than any of the campaigns we've seen over the last 3 or 4 years. That's a positive, and then we're seeing an uptick in our brand equity. So those are positives. I think if you look at the activity that we have for the second quarter and the callout that we made in the earnings release and the script this morning, we pointed to the fact that we expect to put more money behind the brands, and that is because we have a pretty full activation agenda. We've got a full advertising agenda, and they know that we need to spend some money to get the energy going on these brands. So that's where we are, and I think you'll be in a position in June to hear more from us and to see some of that work when we meet in New York."

So what we've seen very, very strong performance as we take the brand outside of North America. Tremendous traction and velocity and growth in Central and South America, and so a brand, which has become our second largest brand in our U.K. and Ireland portfolio and has grown to well over 1 million hectoliters across the U.K. and Ireland. So it's in a number of international markets. I wouldn't describe as having a global footprint center gravity outside of North America, Central and South America, now U.K. and Ireland business and strong and growing momentum behind Coors Light brand. Alongside that, we've introduced Coors 1873 in a couple of market just to introduce the brand of Coors Banquet. And again, we've seen that perform strongly so we're looking to build up the Coors trademark and the proof-of-concept in Coors at 1873, I think, it gives us some signal as to how we can build that trademark more broadly going forward."

Robert, we've got a great clear bottle offering and green bottle offering, but that's me probably getting out of my depth in my marketing skills. But the overall positionings of the brand are very complementary it gives us more skill in the number of existing MCI markets, and that gives us an entry points into a number of new markets as well. So our International business will scale up very significantly on the back off of this addition of our portfolio.

It has given a stable digit growth almost universally across those markets. So there are always some puts and takes from the timing perspective in individual markets, but the general strategy of investing behind our core brands and investing in premiumization is working at the aggregate level in Europe.

Your second question around breaking out the 80 basis points between the various subsegments is we just simply don't do that publicly. And from a Miller High Life point of view, we do think you got any proposition year as the champagne appears and then we intend to continue to enlist quite strongly behind that brand.

On behalf of Molson Coors Brewing Company, thank you for joining us today for our first quarter 2016 follow-up earnings conference call. Our goal on this call is to address as many additional earnings-related questions as possible following our regular earnings conference call with Mark Hunter, David [indiscernible], Mauricio Restrepo, and our business unit CEOs earlier today. We will use the standard Q&A format, and we anticipate that the call will last less than an hour. 
Before we begin, I will paraphrase the company's safe harbor language. Some of the discussions today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from what the company projects today, so please refer to its most recent 10-K and 10-Q filings for a more complete description of factors that could affect these projections. The company does not undertake to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. 
Regarding any non-U.S. GAAP measures that may be discussed during the call and from time-to-time by our company's executives in discussing the company's performance, please visit our website, www.molsoncoors.com, and click on the Financial Reporting tab at the Investor Relations page for reconciliation of these measures to the nearest U.S. GAAP results. 
Also unless otherwise indicated, all financial results the company discusses are versus the comparable prior-year period and in U.S. dollars. We also encourage investors and analysts to read SAB Miller plc news releases and trading statements that include financial and other information relating to the MillerCoors joint venture. 
So let's get started with an introduction of the team with me on this call. We have Kevin Kim, Investor Relations Senior Manager; Ashley [indiscernible] Finance Forecasting Senior Manager; Briant Tabolt, Controller; and Steve Mack, Director of Tax. 
Regarding quarterly results, as Mark Hunter mentioned on our regular earnings call earlier this morning, in the first quarter we continued to focus on our First Choice ambition and on building a stronger brand portfolio, delivering value-added innovation, strengthening our core brand positions through incremental marketing investments and continuing to premiumize our portfolio. We began to see the benefits flow to our top line performance as we grew worldwide volume, improved core brand momentum in key markets, introduced fast-growing innovations in all of our businesses and achieved strong Above Premium growth globally, including in craft, flavored malt beverages and cider. 
We also continued to strengthen our business through improvements to our sales execution and revenue management capabilities, increased efficiency of our operations and implementation of global systems on a common basis. 
As a result, Molson Coors reported significantly expanded gross, operating and pretax margins globally, along with growth more than 28% in total company underlying after-tax earnings and more than 15% growth in underlying EBITDA versus a year ago. 
At the same time, we completed a stock offering, a common stock offering in January, to fund about 20% of the pending MillerCoors transaction. And we made solid progress in our planning for the integration of MillerCoors and the Miller global brand portfolio. Completion of this game-changing transaction is still expected in the second half of this year, and we intend to be ready to go on day one following the close. 
In the balance of 2016, we will continue to focus on our First Choice for consumers and customers ambition, all driven through our Profit After Capital Charge lens and with the intent to drive total shareholder returns. 
So with, Jonathan, we'd now like to open it up for questions. Over to you."

I recognized there's some disconnect between on premise and off premise, but I'm seeing, on a trailing 12-week basis, for instance, Coors Light volumes up 1.1% but Miller Lite down 2.6%. There's some really notable divergences in terms of price mix. So is there anything kind of going on in terms of price back architecture or promotion in the off-premise that would drive some of that divergence in terms of the syndicated data?"

To be quite frank, I don't spend a lot of time on the standard data. But I guess what I would say is there's let say a few things come to mind. It's 12-week data and so, in some cases, you'll see what I would call sample error or call it divergence versus the population, if you're a statistician. And so that's one thing. Particularly, for example, you can see differences between Nielsen data and the IRI data for exactly the same periods, and that could be explained by what I call sample error. Also as we talked about on the earlier call, there are channel differences. So you are missing the liquor store and on premise. We already talked about that. Miller Lite does skew toward the on premise, but I don't think that's -- other factors are really important, along with geography, which I think is probably a important factor. For example, Miller Lite would skew more heavily toward the Midwest, where there's divergent call it total industry volume trends as obviously brand trend differences by geography. And whereas Coors Light would skew more toward to the Northeast and the West. And then also another difference between the scanner data and our sales to retail data in the first quarter would be an extra trading day, except we did for the number the numbers that we provided to we did adjust for that trading day. So it would show up in the reported numbers, but not in the ones we provided for you. So there you go. Sample error, geography and channel, primarily, is the way I would look at it."

And at the same time, we want to emphasize that the second quarter is a significant piece of that in that we anticipate double-digit increase in brand investments, which that is an unusually large increase. But no, we didn't put dimensions around the full year or the subsequent quarters. There was some timing, how do you say, phasing of marketing that's worth remembering from last year, where MillerCoors was quite light on marketing and brand spend in the first half of the year for a variety of reasons. And then really, how do you say, raised the bar in the sense that more than 3/4 of the increase in brand spend for MillerCoors last year was actually in the fourth quarter, because we had ad properties and brand communications that we really wanted to invest behind. 
This year, in the first half of the year, we also have the introduction of Henry's Hard Soda and we have great ad creative behind Coors Light leading into peak season. And I think great ad created behind Miller Lite in the U.S. as well. So the earlier question about Henry's margins, if you look on Nielsen, you'll see an index vis a vis to consumers of 1 67 versus call it mainstream maybe Coors Light of 100.

Just make sure you got that number, pension expense of approximately $17 million, and that includes 42% of our -- our 42% ownership interest in MillerCoors. Upon close of the transaction, we would be like -- we would essentially revalue the plan as if we'd had a curtailment. And sometimes when you have a plan change, a pension plan change, depending on how much changes, you can have a curtailment. And therefore, you do revaluation. And on the close of the transaction, Brian informs me, yes, we would revalue the pension plans. But it wouldn't change -- any way, let's leave it at that. We feel good about where our pensions are at this point. And some are even actually fully funded at this point, particularly in the U.K. and in Canada, overall, on a U.S. GAAP basis. So I don't know, you've probably seen that come through the filings where the funded status has improved from being down like a little let's call it a year and a half ago being close to $0.5 billion short. And at the end of this last year, we were only $162 million short as far as funded status for the overall plan, including 42% of   MillerCoors."

And I was just wondering if you can frame this a little bit more in terms of what you're doing in Europe? Is it like particular opportunities that you see that, obviously, are passing your pack model and look very exciting and is somewhat tactical? Or is it a large concerted effort, just you're going to gain market share and just increase spending and keep on taking it up? I mean, how should we get a sense and comfort in terms of the higher marketing spend that you're budgeting this year and going forward?"

In this case, though, we did want to help people a little bit with their call it phasing, if you will. And so we actually said including a double-digit increase globally in the second quarter. And particularly, that's because we see great opportunities leading into peak season in not only the U.S. and Canada, but also in Europe. And we just wanted to make sure that people model that in. As far as specifics on balance of the year, I don't think I'd provide anything at this point, but it is about having more opportunities this year leading into peak season than we had last year as far as what we could invest behind to really drive our brands and drive value for our shareholders."

So we think about brand investment similarly to all of our other, call it, cash usage, capital allocation and what have you, and that means pack model. So probably that's a capital charge. Where do we think we can get a great return on our investment dollars? We do have a bias to invest behind our brands, but that's actually nothing new, we have that for over a decade at least in that range. And then so PACC model matters. Mark Hunter said a number of times, it's the quality of the spend, not the amount or tonnage. It's not about tonnage. In other words, we could have spent more behind our brands last year in Canada when and actually in the U.S., when we had in say the first and second quarter when we had some pretty rough trends behind the Coors Light brand. But that would not have been high-value use of our shareholders cash. So we did not do that, because we frankly didn't have the ad creative or the promotional properties to invest behind to get a great return. So we didn't do that. This year, we got Henry's Hard Soda. We've got great ad opportunities and call it consumer communication in Mark Hunter's words around Coors Light and Miller Lite. We've got the English Premier league in Europe now, although I would hasten to add to that, that's something that we would generally when we pick new your promotional properties, we fund them with sort of within an existing sort of reasonable budget, if you will."

On behalf of Molson Coors Brewing Company, thank you for joining us today for our first quarter 2016 follow-up earnings conference call. 
Our goal on this call is to address as many additional earnings-related questions as possible following our regular earnings conference call with Mark Hunter, David Heede, Mauricio Restrepo and our business unit CEOs earlier today. We will use standard's Q&A format, and we anticipate that the call will last less than an hour. 
Before we begin, I will paraphrase the company's safe harbor language. Some of the discussion today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from what the company projects today, so please refer to its most recent 10-K and 10-Q filings for a more complete description of factors that could affect these projections. 
The company does not undertake to publicly update forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. 
Regarding any non-U.S. GAAP measures that may be discussed during the call and from time to time by our company's executives in discussing the company's performance, please visit our website, www.molsoncoors.com, and click on the Financial Reporting tab at the Investor Relations page for a reconciliation of these measures to the nearest U.S. GAAP results. 
Also, unless otherwise indicated, all financial results the company discusses are versus the comparable prior year period and in U.S. dollars. We also encourage investors and analysts to read SABMiller plc news releases and trading statements that include financial and other information relating to the MillerCoors joint venture. 
So let's get started with an introduction of the team. With me on this call, we have Kevin Kim, Investor Relations Senior Manager; Ashley Dunlop, Finance Forecasting Senior Manager; Brian Tabolt, Controller; and Steve Mack, Director of Tax. 
Regarding quarterly results, as Mark Hunter mentioned on our regular earnings call earlier this morning, in the first quarter, we continued to focus on our First Choice ambition and on building a stronger brand portfolio, delivering value-added innovation, strengthening our core brand positions through incremental marketing investments and continuing to premiumize our portfolio. 
We began to see the benefits flow to our top line performance as we grew worldwide volume, improved core brand momentum in key markets, introduced fast-growing innovations in all of our businesses and achieved strong Above Premium growth globally, including in craft, flavored malt beverages and cider. 
We also continued to strengthen our business through improvements to our sales execution and revenue management capabilities, increased efficiency of our operations and implementation of global systems on a common basis. 
As a result, Molson Coors reported significantly expanded gross, operating and pretax margins globally, along with growth of more than 28% in total company underlying after-tax earnings and more than 15% growth in underlying EBITDA versus a year ago. 
At the same time, we completed a stock offering, a common stock offering in January to fund about 20% of the pending MillerCoors transaction. And we made solid progress in our planning for the integration of MillerCoors and the Miller global brand portfolio. Completion of this game-changing transaction is still expected in the second half of this year, and we intend to be ready to go on day 1 following the close. 
In the balance of 2016, we will continue to focus on our First Choice for consumers and customers ambition, all driven through our Profit After Capital Charge lens and with the intent to drive total shareholder returns. 
So with that, Jonathan, we'd now like to open it up for questions. Over to you."

But I'm having a hard time, Dave, reconciling what I'm seeing in the Nielsen data for Miller Lite and Coors Light specifically. I recognize there's some disconnect between on-premise and off-premise, but I'm seeing, on a trailing 12-week basis, for instance, Coors Light volumes up 1.1% but Miller Lite down 2.6%. There's some really notable divergences in terms of price mix. So is there anything kind of going on in terms of price/pack architecture or promotion in the off-premise that would drive some of that divergence in terms of the syndicated data?"

To be quite frank, I don't spend a lot of time on the scanner data. But I guess what I would say is there -- let's say a few things come to mind. It's 12-week data, and so in some cases, you'll see what I would call sample error or call it divergence versus the population if you're a statistician. And so that's one thing. Particularly, for example, you can see differences between the Nielsen data and the IRI data for exactly the same periods, and that could be explained by what I call sample error. Also, as we talked about on the earlier call, there are channel differences. So you are missing the liquor store and on-premise. We already talked about that. Miller Lite does skew toward the on-premise, but I don't think that's the -- I think those other factors are really important, along with geography, which I think is probably a very important factor. For example, Miller Lite would skew more heavily toward the Midwest where there's divergent, call it, total industry volume trends as obviously brand trend differences by geography, and whereas Coors Light would skew more toward, say, the Northeast and the West. And then also, another difference between the scanner data and our sales to retail data in the first quarter would be an extra trading day except we did, for the number that we -- the numbers that we provided to -- we did adjust for that trading day. So it would show up in the reported numbers but not in the ones we provided for you. So there you go. Sample error, geography and channel primarily is the way I would look at it."

This year in the first half of the year, we also have the introduction of Henry's Hard Soda, and we have great ad creative behind Coors Light leading into peak season and I think great ad creative behind Miller Lite in the U.S. as well.

Let me give you some headlines, and then let's see whether there's anything we need to add to that. As far as options creep goes, unlike past times, call it 10 to 20 years ago, we gave out relatively few options. They really only go to the top, say, 8 or 10 people in the entire company. So we've had -- in some of those options, the last ones that were provided to a more broader employee group were actually 11 years ago. So if you look in more recent times, I think you'll see relatively modest option exercise. Our comp plans tend to lean more toward performance shares and restricted shares at this point, which, call it, less dilution overhang, if you will. MillerCoors compensation, essentially, we'd be adding or we'd be doubling the size of the company, and we would be including those team members as appropriate or as the plans are designed on our compensation plans.

Upon close of the transaction, we would -- it'd be like a -- well, anyway, we would essentially revalue the plan as if we'd had a curtailment. And sometimes when you have a plan change, a pension plan change, depending on how much changes, you can have a curtailment, and therefore, you do a revaluation. And on the close of the transaction, Brian informs me that, yes, we would revalue the pension plans. But it wouldn't change -- anyway, let's leave it at that. We feel good about where our pensions are at this point. And some of them are even actually fully funded at this point in -- particularly in the U.K. and in Canada overall on a U.S. GAAP basis. So and you -- I don't know, you've probably seen that come through the filings where the funded status has improved from being down like a little, let's call it, 1.5 years ago being close to $0.5 billion short.

And particularly, that's because we see great opportunities leading into peak season in not only the U.S. and Canada but also in Europe, and we just wanted to make sure that people model that in. As far as specifics on balance of the year, I don't think I'd provide anything at this point, but it is about having more opportunities this year leading into peak season than we had last year as far as what we could invest behind to really drive our brands and drive value for our shareholders."

So we think about brand investments similarly to all of our other, call it, cash uses, capital allocation or what have you, and that means PACC model. So probably that's a capital charge. Where do we think we can get a great return on our investment dollars? We do have a bias to invest behind our brands, but that's actually nothing new. We've had that for over a decade at least in that range. And then so PACC model matters. Mark Hunter said a number of times, it's the quality of the spend, not the amount or tonnage. It's not about tonnage. In other words, we could have spent more behind our brands last year in Canada when -- and actually in the U.S. when we had in, say, the first and second quarter when we had some pretty rough trends behind the Coors Light brand. But that would not have been a high-value use of our shareholders' cash. So we did not do that because we frankly didn't have the ad creative or the promotional properties to invest behind to get a great return. So we didn't do that. This year, we've got Henry's Hard Soda. We've got great ad opportunities and, call it, consumer communication, in Mark Hunter's words, around Coors Light and Miller Lite. We've got the English Premier League in Europe now, although I would hasten to add that that's something that we would -- generally, when we pick out new promotional properties, we fund them with a -- sort of within an existing sort of reasonable budget, if you will."

On behalf of Molson Coors Brewing Company, thank you for joining us today for our first quarter 2016 follow-up earnings conference call. 
Our goal on this call is to address as many additional earnings-related questions as possible following our regular earnings conference call with Mark Hunter, David Heede, Mauricio Restrepo and our business unit CEOs earlier today. We will use a standard Q&A format, and we anticipate that the call will last less than an hour. 
Before we begin, I will paraphrase the company's safe harbor language. Some of the discussion today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from what the company projects today, so please refer to its most recent 10-K and 10-Q filings for a more complete description of factors that could affect these projections. 
The company does not undertake to publicly update forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. 
Regarding any non-U.S. GAAP measures that may be discussed during the call and from time to time by our company's executives in discussing the company's performance, please visit our website, www.molsoncoors.com, and click on the Financial Reporting tab at the Investor Relations page for a reconciliation of these measures to the nearest U.S. GAAP results. 
Also, unless otherwise indicated, all financial results the company discusses are versus the comparable prior year period and in U.S. dollars. We also encourage investors and analysts to read SABMiller plc news releases and trading statements that include financial and other information relating to the MillerCoors joint venture. 
So let's get started with an introduction of the team. With me on this call, we have Kevin Kim, Investor Relations Senior Manager; Ashley Dunlop, Finance Forecasting Senior Manager; Brian Tabolt, Controller; and Steve Mack, Director of Tax. 
Regarding quarterly results, as Mark Hunter mentioned on our regular earnings call earlier this morning, in the first quarter, we continued to focus on our First Choice ambition and on building a stronger brand portfolio, delivering value-added innovation, strengthening our core brand positions through incremental marketing investments and continuing to premiumize our portfolio. 
We began to see the benefits flow to our top line performance as we grew worldwide volume, improved core brand momentum in key markets, introduced fast-growing innovations in all of our businesses and achieved strong Above Premium growth globally, including in craft, flavored malt beverages and cider. 
We also continued to strengthen our business through improvements to our sales execution and revenue management capabilities, increased efficiency of our operations and implementation of global systems on a common basis. 
As a result, Molson Coors reported significantly expanded gross, operating and pretax margins globally, along with growth of more than 28% in total company underlying after-tax earnings and more than 15% growth in underlying EBITDA versus a year ago. 
At the same time, we completed a stock offering, a common stock offering in January to fund about 20% of the pending MillerCoors transaction. And we made solid progress in our planning for the integration of MillerCoors and the Miller global brand portfolio. Completion of this game-changing transaction is still expected in the second half of this year, and we intend to be ready to go on day 1 following the close. 
In the balance of 2016, we will continue to focus on our First Choice for consumers and customers ambition, all driven through our Profit After Capital Charge lens and with the intent to drive total shareholder returns. 
So with that, Jonathan, we'd now like to open it up for questions. Over to you."

But I'm having a hard time, Dave, reconciling what I'm seeing in the Nielsen data for Miller Lite and Coors Light specifically. I recognize there's some disconnect between on-premise and off-premise, but I'm seeing, on a trailing 12-week basis, for instance, Coors Light volumes up 1.1% but Miller Lite down 2.6%. There's some really notable divergences in terms of price mix. So is there anything kind of going on in terms of price/pack architecture or promotion in the off-premise that would drive some of that divergence in terms of the syndicated data?"

To be quite frank, I don't spend a lot of time on the scanner data. But I guess what I would say is there -- let's see, a few things come to mind. It's 12-week data, and so in some cases, you'll see what I would call sample error or call it divergence versus the population if you're a statistician. And so that's one thing. Particularly, for example, you can see differences between the Nielsen data and the IRI data for exactly the same periods, and that could be explained by what I call sample error. Also, as we talked about on the earlier call, there are channel differences. So you are missing the liquor store and on-premise. We already talked about that. Miller Lite does skew toward the on-premise, but I don't think that's the -- I think those other factors are really important, along with geography, which I think is probably a very important factor. For example, Miller Lite would skew more heavily toward the Midwest where there's -- divergent, call it, total industry volume trends, there's obviously brand trend differences by geography, and whereas Coors Light would skew more toward, say, the Northeast and the West. And then also, another difference between the scanner data and our sales to retail data in the first quarter would be an extra trading day except we did, for the number that we -- the numbers that we provided to -- we did adjust for that trading day. So it would show up in the reported numbers but not in the ones we provided for you. So there you go. Sample error, geography and channel primarily is the way I would look at it."

But we did say that -- we said it on the last call, and we said it on this one as well, we expect our total global brand spending or investments to be up for the full year. And at the same time, we wanted to emphasize that the second quarter is a significant piece of that in that we anticipate double-digit increase in brand investments, which that is an unusually large increase. But no, we didn't put dimensions around the full year or the subsequent quarters. I can -- there was some timing, how do you say, phasing of marketing that's worth remembering from last year where MillerCoors was quite light on marketing and brand spend in the first half of the year for a variety of reasons and then really, how do you say, raised the bar in the sense that more than 3/4 of the increase in brand spend for MillerCoors last year was actually in the fourth quarter because we had ad properties and brand communications that we really wanted to invest behind. This year in the first half of the year, we also have the introduction of Henry's Hard Sodas, and we have great ad creative behind Coors Light leading into peak season and I think great ad creative behind Miller Lite in the U.S. as well. To the earlier question about Henry's margins, if you look on Nielsen, you'll see an index of -- this would be to consumers of 167 versus, call it, mainstream maybe Coors Light of 100.

Upon close of the transaction, we would -- it'd be like a -- well, anyway, we would essentially revalue the plan as if we'd had a curtailment. And sometimes when you have a plan change, a pension plan change, depending on how much changes, you can have a curtailment, and therefore, you do a revaluation. And on the close of the transaction, Brian informs me that, yes, we would revalue the pension plans. But it wouldn't change -- anyway, let's leave it at that. We feel good about where our pensions are at this point. And some of them are even actually fully funded at this point in -- particularly in the U.K. and in Canada overall on a U.S. GAAP basis. So and you -- I don't know, you've probably seen that come through the filings where the funded status has improved from being down like a little, let's call it, 1.5 years ago being close to $0.5 billion short.

So we think about brand investments similarly to all of our other, call it, cash uses, capital allocation or what have you, and that means PACC model. So profit after capital charge. Where do we think we can get a great return on our investment dollars? We do have a bias to invest behind our brands, but that's actually nothing new. We've had that for over a decade at least in that range. And then so PACC model matters. Mark Hunter said a number of times, it's the quality of the spend, not the amount or tonnage. It's not about tonnage. In other words, we could have spent more behind our brands last year in Canada when -- and actually in the U.S. when we had in, say, the first and second quarter when we had some pretty rough trends behind the Coors Light brand. But that would not have been a high-value use of our shareholders' cash. So we did not do that because we frankly didn't have the ad creative or the promotional properties to invest behind to get a great return. So we didn't do that. This year, we've got Henry's Hard Soda. We've got great ad opportunities and, call it, consumer communication, in Mark Hunter's words, around Coors Light and Miller Lite. We've got the English Premier League in Europe now, although I would hasten to add that that's something that we would -- generally, when we pick up new promotional properties, we fund them with a -- sort of within an existing sort of reasonable budget, if you will."

David is now transitioning back to his role as our Europe CFO as we welcome our new Global CFO, Mauricio Restrepo, who joined Molson Coors yesterday and is here with us this morning. 
Before our earnings call today, David and I will take you through highlights of our first quarter 2016 results for the Molson Coors Brewing Company, along with some perspective on the balance of 2016. 
In the first quarter, we continued to focus on our First Choice ambition and on building a stronger brand portfolio, delivering value-added innovation, strengthening our core brand positions through incremental marketing investments and continuing to premiumize our portfolio. We began to see the benefits to our top line performance as we grew worldwide volume; improved core brand momentum in key markets; introduced fast-growing innovations in all of our businesses; and achieved strong Above Premium growth globally, including in craft, flavored malt beverages and cider. We also significantly expanded gross operating and pretax margins globally and increased total company underlying after-tax earnings more than 28% while growing underlying EBITDA more than 15% versus a year ago.
At the same time, we completed a common stock offering in January to fund about 20% of the pending MillerCoors transaction, and we made solid progress in our planning for the integration of MillerCoors and the Miller global brand portfolio. Completion of this game-changing transaction is still expected in the second half of this year, and we intend to be ready to go on day 1 following the close. 
In brands, Coors Light grew volume 3.5% globally, including strong double-digit growth in the U.K. and Ireland and high single-digit growth in Latin America. In Above Premium, our craft portfolio drove growth from Doom Bar and a broader Sharp's portfolio in the U.K.; Creemore in Granville Island in Canada; Blue Moon Belgian White in the U.S. and in the U.K. and its sister brand, Belgian Moon, in Canada; and also the newly acquired Saint Archer in the U.S. 
In ciders, we grew volume of Rekorderlig in Europe and Strongbow in Canada. And in flavored malt beverages, the introduction of Henry's Hard Soda is proceeding well ahead of expectations and driving incremental Above Premium volume for us in the U.S. 
We continued to strengthen our business through improvements to our sales execution and revenue management capabilities. We increased efficiency of our operations, and we implemented common global systems. To ensure that our supply chain is fit for future, we completed the sale of our Vancouver brewery in Canada for CAD 185 million, and we'll lease the brewery back from the buyer as we build a new, more efficient and flexible brewery. We also gained agreement to the closure of Burton South Brewery in the U.K., allowing us to further consolidate U.K. brewing operations. 
Regional highlights for the first quarter are as follows: In the U.S., underlying equity income increased 22.1% from a year ago, driven by higher net pricing, positive sales mix, timing of shipments and lower cost of goods sold. Coors Light and Miller Lite each gained share of the U.S. premium light segment for the fourth consecutive quarter, with both brands achieving flat sales-to-retail volume for the first time in MillerCoors history. Improved momentum for these 2 brands was driven by ongoing improvements to their consumer communications, which appeals to a broad cross-section of men and women, millennials and multicultural consumers.
Coors Banquet remains the only national premium beer in the category that continues to grow. In the higher-margin Above Premium segment, our lead craft brand, Blue Moon Belgian White, delivered another quarter of growth, as did Leinenkugel's Grapefruit Shandy and the newly acquired Saint Archer brands. 
In FMBs, we achieved strong initial results from the introduction of Henry's Hard Sodas in the first quarter. And according to Nielsen, Henry's Hard Orange Soda has the best velocity of any hard soda since the fourth week of its launch, and Henry's Hard Ginger Ale soda is the #1 ginger ale in this fast-growing segment. 
In Canada, we delivered strong earnings growth, but our top line performance was lower in both volume and revenue per hectoliter. In brands, Coors Light and Molson Canadian both had a challenging quarter, and we're taking additional concrete steps to improve performance in the balance of the year, which I'll discuss in a few minutes. In Above Premium and craft, Coors Banquet, Belgian Moon, Mad Jack Apple Lager, Heineken and Strongbow Cider all grew volume and share in the quarter, along with our Creemore and Grandville craft brands. 
In headline financial results for the quarter, Canada underlying pretax income increased 25.2% in constant currency, primarily due to a timing-led reduction in distribution costs, some lower pension expenses and results of our ongoing cost saving initiatives. These factors were partially offset by the impact of lower volume and higher brand investments. Excluding the impact of the loss of the Miller brands, Canada STRs declined 1.6%. But including the Miller brands, STRs declined 5.2%. Increased competitor trade spend and pricing activities, especially in Québec in the West region, led to overall softer volume.
In Europe, earnings were lower in the quarter, primarily due to higher brand investments and amortization expenses, lower net pension benefit and the termination of the Heineken contract brewing arrangement in the U.K. Notwithstanding, our business and our brands performed well across the region. We increased market share, and we continued to premiumize our portfolio and reduce costs. We grew volume in 7 of 11 countries and for 7 of our lead core and premium brands in the region. In core brands, Carling, Bergenbier and Ozujsko grew share of segment in their primary markets. Our Above Premium portfolio increased momentum, with strong double-digit growth by Coors Light on the craft portfolio, including Doom Bar and the other Sharp's brands. And additionally, our cider portfolio achieved strong growth, with the inclusion of Rekorderlig since the middle of 2015. And the full repatriation of the Staropramen brand in the U.K. also added to the solid progress we made in premiumizing our Europe portfolio. 
Our International business improved pretax performance in the first quarter, driven by continued volume growth in Latin America, India and Japan as well as lower marketing and overhead expenses due to the substantial restructure of our China business last year. Coors Light grew a high single-digit rate in international markets due to our launch in Colombia as well as growth in our existing Latin America markets.
Now I'll turn over to David to give first quarter financial highlights and perspective on the balance of 2016. David?"

Our first quarter financial headlines are as follows: Headline net sales increased 0.1% on a constant currency basis, driven by 1.2% growth in worldwide volume. Including foreign currency movements, net sales were do",1104,"Thank you, Mark, and hello, everybody. Our first quarter financial headlines are as follows: Headline net sales increased 0.1% on a constant currency basis, driven by 1.2% growth in worldwide volume. Including foreign currency movements, net sales were down approximately 6% in U.S. dollars. Our net sales per hectoliter decreased 1.9% in constant currency due to negative mix in Canada and lower Heineken contract brew volume in Europe. Underlying after-tax income increased 28.1% to $110.3 million or $0.54 per share, driven by worldwide volume growth and lower cost of goods sold.
On a U.S. GAAP basis, we reported income from continuing operations attributable to Molson Coors of $159.3 million, which is nearly double the prior year results. In addition to the factors that drove higher underlying income, this increase was primarily due to $110.4 million gain on the sale of the Vancouver brewery at the end of the first quarter, partially offset by special charges related to brewery closures. Please note that we received the cash from the Vancouver brewery sale on the first day of the second quarter.
Underlying EBITDA in the quarter is $263.4 million, a 15.2% increase from a year ago. We issued 29.9 million shares of Class B common stock from our equity offering in January for approximately $2.5 billion of net proceeds, which will fund about 20% of the $12 billion pending MillerCoors transaction. Please see the earnings release we distributed earlier this morning for a detailed review of business unit financial results in the quarter. 
Total debt at the end of the first quarter was $3 billion. And cash and cash equivalents totaled $2.6 billion, resulting in a net debt of just over $400 million, which is significantly lower than prior year due to the proceeds received from our equity offering earlier this year.
Looking forward to the remainder of 2016, our strong first quarter results were aided by the timing of Easter holiday and the additional days sales as a result of 2016 being a leap year, along with relatively favorable cost comparisons in the U.S. and lower Canada distribution costs. We anticipate that the results will not benefit from most of these factors in the balance of this year. 
Other trends to consider for the last 3 quarters of this year include higher investments in our brands this year, including a double-digit increase globally in the second quarter leading into peak season in the U.S., Canada and Europe; incremental Europe brand amortization expense with an annualized impact of approximately $15 million, which began in the fourth quarter of 2015, along with lower net pension benefit in Europe this year; a total prohibition on the sale of alcohol unexpectedly implemented by the state government in Bihar, India in early April. We don't know how long this ban will be in place, and we expect this development to present a headwind for International business until it is resolved as this is our largest state of operation in India. Note, however, that this prohibition of Bihar has no impact on the Mount Shivalik business in India that we purchased last year. The impact of terminated contracts, which are now nearly all behind us; and finally, foreign currency translation, which at current exchange rates would not be a significant factor in our underlying pretax results this year. This view has improved significantly since our February earnings call because of the recent strengthening of the Canadian dollar versus the U.S. dollar. Given the recent volatility of our key foreign currencies, however, it is important to watch these rates closely.
Regarding 2016 guidance, all of the following matrix exclude any effects of the MillerCoors and Miller global brands transaction, the timing of which will have a big impact on virtually all guidance measures. For the full year, we expect cash contributions to our defined pension plans to be in the range of $45 million to $65 million in 2016 and pension expense of approximately $17 million, including our 42% of MillerCoors contributions and expense; capital spending of approximately $300 million; MG&A expense in corporate of approximately $120 million as we invest more behind innovation and commercial excellence this year; consolidated net interest expense of approximately $110 million; and underlying effective tax rate in the range of 18% to 22%, assuming no further changes in tax laws, settlement of tax audits or adjustments to uncertain tax provisions.
Regarding free cash flow guidance, we still have a large number of dynamic factors in play in relation to cash use and capital deployment, principally due to the pending MillerCoors transaction. And therefore, we plan to issue 2016 underlying free cash flow guidance later in the year with the goal of removing some of the recent volatility to guidance that has occurred. 
As far as cost outlook is concerned, we continue to expect the cost of goods sold per hectoliter in Canada and Europe in local currency to increase at a low single-digit rate for the full year 2016. We now expect 2016 MillerCoors COGS per hectoliter to be approximately in line with prior year. Lower-than-expected prices for diesel, aluminum and corn as well as acceleration of some of our cost savings initiatives drove the change from previous guidance above the low single digits. We now expect our international COGS per hectoliter in local currency to increase at the high single-digit rate for 2016. This is up from low single digits previously due to geographic mix changes.
We continue to expect cost savings over the next 2 years to be in the range of $50 million to $70 million. This view excludes cost savings from MillerCoors as well as synergies resulting from the pending MillerCoors acquisition, which we expect to be $200 million by the year 4 following the transaction close. 
Finally, here are the most recent volume trends for each of the businesses early in the second quarter, which are impacted by the early timing of Easter this year. In the U.S. and Canada for the 3 weeks through April 23, sales to retail decreased at mid-single-digit rates. In Europe, volume through to April 25 decreased low single digits. And our International sales volume, including royalty volume through to April 23, decreased at double-digit rate, partially due to the alcohol prohibition in Bihar, India. As ever, please keep in mind these numbers represent only a portion of the current quarter, and trends could change in the weeks ahead. 
Also, note that following the close of the pending MillerCoors transaction, we plan to discontinue providing early next quarter volumes.
At this point, I'll turn it back over to Mark for outlook, wrap-up and the Q&A. Mark?"
263765,312033274,971122,"Molson Coors Brewing Company, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 03, 2016",2016-05-03,"Earnings Calls","Molson Coors Beverage Company","Executives","Thanks, David.

In 2016, we will continue to drive our First Choice for consumer and customer agenda in the geographies and segments where we choose to play. As we move into peak season this year, we're seeing additional competitive pricing pressure, and we intend to step up our brand investment significantly, particularly in the second quarter. 
In the U.S, there has been a great deal of change in MillerCoors over the past 10 months. Those changes were necessary to create the foundation for the volume growth we aim to achieve by 2019. As we work to close the transaction, MillerCoors remains disciplined, decisive and accountable for growing the business, transforming its portfolio and driving value for our shareholders. 
In American light lagers, we continued to gain momentum by the revitalization of our 2 largest U.S. brands, Coors Light and Miller Lite Light. 
In Above Premium, we continued to develop higher-margin offerings that can scale and stick, including strong early result from the launch of Henry's Hard Orange and Ginger Ale sodas. And we'll introduce a cherry cola flavor later this year. 
We've also made the decision to offer our fastest-growing Leinenkugel's extension, Grapefruit Shandy, on a year-round basis to strengthen the Leinenkugel's brand family, which, alongside Blue Moon and Belgian White, forms as the base of a formidable craft portfolio. 
In cider, we're broadening the appeal of Smith & Hard Cider -- Smith & Forge Hard Cider by adding a bottle package to our lineup. We'll continue to build First Choice customer partnerships with our building material retail strategy, which leverages the higher velocity and broad appeal of American light lagers. We plan to expand this valuable tool beyond the on-premise additional channels in the balance of this year.
In Canada, the restructuring of our brand portfolio was largely complete and gaining traction. In the first quarter, we achieved strong volume growth behind both Coors Banquet and Pilsner. We also continued to see strong momentum for our craft brands, Creemore and Granville Island, as well as in our Mexican portfolio with Sol and Dos Equis and flavored malt beverages with Mad Jack. At the end of the quarter, we launched Mad Jack Root Beer and ginger ale, the first major hard soda entries in Canada. We continue to focus on accelerating growth for our core brands, Coors Light and Molson Canadian, as our biggest opportunity and challenge. Coors Light brand health has improved behind our North American packaging update, which continued to roll out in first quarter, along with high-impact retail executions that drove positive momentum and social engagement. For Molson Canadian, following another successful Anything for Hockey campaign in the first quarter, we'll continue into peak season with strong programming and new communication that celebrates all of the rich qualities of our beer and our Canadian identity. 
Operationally, we continue on our mission to be first choice for consumers and customers, focusing on our Field Sales Management program to deliver brilliant store-level execution across space, assortment and pricing. In 2016, we will also continue to restructure our supply chain to ensure we are fit for the future. The sale of our Vancouver brewery for CAD 185 million at the end of the first quarter was a significant first step towards allowing us to build a more efficient and flexible brewery over the next few years.
In Europe, we achieved solid top line performance in the first quarter on the strength of our core brands and the addition of the Rekorderlig cider and Staropramen brands in the U.K. Although the increased brand amortization expense will present a headwind for the next couple of quarters, we'll continue to invest in our core brand portfolio across Europe to grow share of segment. In fact, earlier today, we announced the signing of a global Carling sponsorship as the official beer partner of the English Premier League. This sponsorship reaches well beyond Carling in the U.K., as it allows us to leverage any brand in any market with one of the most popular sports properties globally. 
We'll also continue to premiumize our portfolio with Coors Light; the Sharp's portfolio led by Doom Bar; Ireland's leading craft brand, Franciscan Well; Cobra; Rekorderlig; and Staropramen. And to ensure that our supply chain is fit for future, the plant closure of Burton South Brewery in the U.K. is progressing well, along with the transition of production to a recently modernized Burton North brewery by the end of 2017. 
Our International business is focused on attaining profitability in 2016 on a constant currency basis versus 2013 foreign exchange rates when we originally made this commitment and continuing to accelerate our overall growth in existing in select new markets. Upon closing of the MillerCoors and the Miller global brands transaction, we will integrate the Miller international brands into our portfolio and leverage a footprint that complements our growth strategy and allows us to gain entrance into high-priority markets while increasing our business scale in current markets. 
We also intend to continue to drive rapid growth for Coors Light in Latin America, including the high potential Colombian market, where we launched at the end of last year. Going forward, we expect the Coors, Miller and Staropramen brands to form the backbone of our International portfolio. 
In India, we will continue to add scale through our Mount Shivalik business, which we acquired last year, as we develop contingency plans related to the Bihar alcohol prohibition. 
To wrap up. In the balance of 2016, we'll continue to focus on our First Choice for consumers and customer -- customers ambition, all driven through our PACC lens and with the intent to drive total shareholder returns.
Now before we start the Q&A portion of the call, just a quick comment. As usual, our prepared remarks will be on our website for your reference within a couple of hours this afternoon. Also at 1 p.m. Eastern Time today, Dave Dunnewald will host a follow-up conference call, which is an opportunity for you to ask additional questions regarding our quarterly results. This call will also be available for you to hear via a webcast on our website. 
Additionally, in the next 2 months, we hope to see many of you at 2 events. Firstly, we will hold our Annual Meeting of Stockholders on Wednesday, May 25, 2016, here in Denver. And second, we'll host our Annual New York Investor and Analyst Day at New York Stock Exchange in the afternoon of Wednesday, June 8, 2016. 
Finally, I want to offer a thank you to David Heede, who has capably led the finance function over the past almost 6 months. 
So at this point, Connor, we'd like to open up for questions, please."

The exception to that really has been in Alberta, where, obviously, that economy is under a lot of pressure with what we've seen from the oil industry, but not dissimilar to what we've seen in the U.S., where in a relatively benign volume market, the areas of real consumer momentum tend to be in imports, higher-price segments like FMBs and craft."

And to answer your question and give that some context, the markets in which we operate were pretty much flat from a volume perspective. So in other words, we gained share and we will calculate that to be about a 0.6% or 0.7% share gain across the quarter, which, again, I think is very solid. And I think pleasingly, it's share gain driven by the majority of our countries, by the majority of our main brands. And we also saw some pretty good trends on our premium brands.

And then, Stewart, do you want to just talk a bit some of the specifics, I think our building confidence. If you look across our business, Mark, whether that's Coors Light and Miller Lite in the U.S., whether it's the way that Carling has got back into share of segment growth over the last couple of years in the U.K., I think we've got a track record of where we've seen challenges in our business continuing to work that challenge and place the right response. And I think the most recent trends in the U.S. on our 2 biggest brands demonstrate our ability to get focused, put the right inputs in place. And I mean, these are big, big brands. It's like driving an oil tanker. It doesn't turn around overnight, but you've got to remain resolute and focused on the right inputs. We've demonstrated that in the U.S. We've demonstrated it in other markets. In all honestly, we had a couple of misfires in some of our consumer communication in Canada, but I think Stewart and the team have really got to grips with what's required now. And we're feeling very good about the quality of our communications that we've got in the marketplace. But Stewart, do you want to just talk about a few more of the specifics, our building confidence as we go into Q2 and then Q3, in particular?"

Sure, Mark. I'd actually just, Mark, just step back one second and just say that as we looked at our strategic plan 3 years ago, we really built out 3 big blocks: one was redoing our supply chain footprint; the other was lowering our G&A cost base; and the third was improving our commercial capability and portfolio. So -- and those are relevant. Why? Because on the cost base and the supply chain, the savings that we're getting from that have allowed us to start to feed the investments required to get the brands going. On the brand side, we're really focused on making sure that we had a portfolio that was right for consumers. And on the Above Premium, which is where we built up all the brands, we're performing well, and we're really happy with those brands. On Molson Canadian and on Coors Light, those brands sit in the mainstream. That is the part of the market that is under the most pressure. And if you looked at this past quarter, Canadian held share of the segment, our Coors Light did not. So Coors Light is where our real challenge is. I've been pretty clear about calling out where the challenges are for Coors Light, those being our need to improve our brand scores, our need to reach out to millennials and to engage those consumers more actively in our brands. I think when you look at the first quarter from a cost standpoint, our G&A cost went down, and we spent some of that money back in the brand. So that's living our strategy. I think against the brand itself, we saw finally the introduction of some marketing that is working. Our advertising is scoring better than any of the campaigns we've seen over the last 3 or 4 years. That's a positive. And we're seeing an uptick in our brand equity. So those are positives. I think if you looked at the activity that we have for the second quarter and the callout that we made in the earnings release and the script this morning, we pointed to the fact that we expect to put more money behind the brands, and that is because we have a pretty full activation agenda. We've got a full advertising agenda, and we know that we need to spend some money to get the energy going on these brands. So that's where we are, and I think you'll be in a position in June to hear more from us and to see some of that work when we meet in New York."

I've been pretty clear that once our planning team have finished all of the planning work and we get deal approval and we're moving towards close, then we can update more specifically at that point. But I think the gains that we offered last November as we worked through the planning stands good, and we'll update more broadly in due course. From your question in -- with regard to the center of gravity that will be our business being the U.S., our overall strategy doesn't change. We will have a bigger position in the U.S., and that has many benefits associated with it. But we've been on a journey to build our footprint over the course of the last 5 years in particular, led by Coors Light and more recently by Staropramen, and that will continue. I'm not going to comment specifically on any M&A opportunities. We never do, as you're aware. But we need to play to win in both the U.S., Canada and in our European business, and we need to continue to build our global footprint lead through our global brands. That's principally been on an asset-light license and export model. It's likely that, that model will continue as we look to take the Coor's trademark, Staropramen trademark in the future, the Miller trademark into more markets.

Tremendous traction and velocity and growth in Central and South America. And it's a brand which has become our second largest brand in our U.K. and Ireland portfolio and has grown to well over 1 million hectoliters now across the U.K. and Ireland. So it's in a number of international markets, but I wouldn't describe it as having a global footprint center of gravity outside of North America certainly, Central and South America, now U.K. and Ireland business. And strong and growing momentum behind the Coors Light brand. Alongside that, we've introduced Coors 1873 into a couple of markets just to assist the brand of Coors Banquet.

Robert, we've got a great clear bottle offering, brown bottle offering and green bottle offering, but that's me probably getting out my depth on my marketing skills. But the overall positionings of the brand are very complementary. It gives us more scale in a number of existing MCI markets, and it gives us an entry point into a number of new markets as well.

And interest from around the world continues to grow, so we're already on that path and have been developing that over the course of the last 3 to 5 years, in particular, and we're seeing demand grow. And I think we're in a strong position when you look at the #1 Irish brands, the leading brand in the U.K. with Sharp's and our Canadian brands as well that there's opportunities for us to really build out that craft portfolio at an international level, and that's central to some of our international expansion thinking at this point in time."

But I'll take your comments for that on the other question. My second question, if I may, is given the Carling business in the U.K., how are you kind of seeing the potential for the Brexit potential vote next month in England? Would that cause meaningful issues for you? Or that's something that is relatively managed within the scope of the operations in Europe?"

With regard to the Carling business in the U.K. and Brexit, that's as a great question. I think if you asked 10 commentators, you'd probably get 10 different points of view. I mean, it's outside of our control. The consumer demand in the U.K. for Carling and our other brands, I think, will remain unaffected by whatever decision is made. The impact on currency and any translational impact I think is probably the thing that we're keeping our eye on at the moment. But I don't it'll affect any real kind of demand patterns in the U.K., which is clearly what we're really interested in. I don't know, Simon, whether you'd offer any more color on that.

I think the theme that I would point you to is that in general, we are increasing our investments in marketing, and those investments are playing out well for us with stronger volumes, stronger revenues and premiumizing that portfolio. And actually, that's a factor that should cross all the markets. So if, for example, I took Staropramen, we are investing in Staropramen across all of our European markets, and we've also repatriated that into the U.K. And we're investing behind it, and that's giving us double-digit growth almost universally actually across those markets. So there are always some puts and takes from a timing perspective in individual markets, but our general strategy of investing behind our core brands and investing in premiumization is working at the aggregate level in Europe. And any country that isn't true in this quarter, I'd be confident that we could continue to drive those countries back towards the norm. So I don't think there's actually as much variation as perhaps you might be pointing to. I think, overall, our strategy is just working in aggregate."

The second one, in the earlier call, you said that pricing ex mix was up 0.8% for the MillerCoors portfolio. Can you just give us some nuance there in terms of what was the increase in the value brands compared to, say, mainstream? It seems to me that on value, pricing might have come down. If you can explain that. And then the third and last question, I think that Miller High Life, it's, in my opinion, in a very unique position within your value portfolio, and one would think that it's maybe stuck in between mainstream and value.

David is now transitioning back to his role as our Europe CFO as we welcome our new Global CFO, Mauricio Restrepo, who joined Molson Coors yesterday and is here with us this morning. 
Before our earnings call today, David and I will take you through highlights of our first quarter 2016 results for the Molson Coors Brewing Company, along with some perspective on the balance of 2016. 
In the first quarter, we continued to focus on our First Choice ambition and on building a stronger brand portfolio, delivering value-added innovation, strengthening our core brand positions through incremental marketing investments and continuing to premiumize our portfolio. We began to see the benefits to our top line performance as we grew worldwide volume; improved core brand momentum in key markets; introduced fast-growing innovations in all of our businesses; and achieved strong Above Premium growth globally, including in craft, flavored malt beverages and cider. We also significantly expanded gross operating and pretax margins globally and increased total company underlying after-tax earnings more than 28% while growing underlying EBITDA more than 15% versus a year ago.
At the same time, we completed a common stock offering in January to fund about 20% of the pending MillerCoors transaction, and we made solid progress in our planning for the integration of MillerCoors and the Miller global brand portfolio. Completion of this game-changing transaction is still expected in the second half of this year, and we intend to be ready to go on day 1 following the close. 
In brands, Coors Light grew volume 3.5% globally, including strong double-digit growth in the U.K. and Ireland and high single-digit growth in Latin America. In Above Premium, our craft portfolio drove growth from Doom Bar and a broader Sharp's portfolio in the U.K.; Creemore in Granville Island in Canada; Blue Moon Belgian White in the U.S. and in the U.K. and its sister brand, Belgian Moon, in Canada; and also the newly acquired Saint Archer in the U.S. 
In ciders, we grew volume of Rekorderlig in Europe and Strongbow in Canada. And in flavored malt beverages, the introduction of Henry's Hard Soda is proceeding well ahead of expectations and driving incremental Above Premium volume for us in the U.S. 
We continued to strengthen our business through improvements to our sales execution and revenue management capabilities. We increased efficiency of our operations, and we implemented common global systems. To ensure that our supply chain is fit for future, we completed the sale of our Vancouver brewery in Canada for CAD 185 million, and we'll lease the brewery back from the buyer as we build a new, more efficient and flexible brewery. We also gained agreement to the closure of Burton South Brewery in the U.K., allowing us to further consolidate U.K. brewing operations. 
Regional highlights for the first quarter are as follows: In the U.S., underlying equity income increased 22.1% from a year ago, driven by higher net pricing, positive sales mix, timing of shipments and lower cost of goods sold. Coors Light and Miller Lite each gained share of the U.S. premium light segment for the fourth consecutive quarter, with both brands achieving flat sales-to-retail volume for the first time in MillerCoors history. Improved momentum for these 2 brands was driven by ongoing improvements to their consumer communications, which appeals to a broad cross-section of men and women, millennials and multicultural consumers.
Coors Banquet remains the only national premium beer in the category that continues to grow. In the higher-margin Above Premium segment, our lead craft brand, Blue Moon Belgian White, delivered another quarter of growth, as did Leinenkugel's Grapefruit Shandy and the newly acquired Saint Archer brands. 
In FMBs, we achieved strong initial results from the introduction of Henry's Hard Sodas in the first quarter. And according to Nielsen, Henry's Hard Orange Soda has the best velocity of any hard soda since the fourth week of its launch, and Henry's Hard Ginger Ale soda is the #1 ginger ale in this fast-growing segment. 
In Canada, we delivered strong earnings growth, but our top line performance was lower in both volume and revenue per hectoliter. In brands, Coors Light and Molson Canadian both had a challenging quarter, and we're taking additional concrete steps to improve performance in the balance of the year, which I'll discuss in a few minutes. In Above Premium and craft, Coors Banquet, Belgian Moon, Mad Jack Apple Lager, Heineken and Strongbow Cider all grew volume and share in the quarter, along with our Creemore and Grandville craft brands. 
In headline financial results for the quarter, Canada underlying pretax income increased 25.2% in constant currency, primarily due to a timing-led reduction in distribution costs, some lower pension expenses and results of our ongoing cost saving initiatives. These factors were partially offset by the impact of lower volume and higher brand investments. Excluding the impact of the loss of the Miller brands, Canada STRs declined 1.6%. But including the Miller brands, STRs declined 5.2%. Increased competitor trade spend and pricing activities, especially in Québec in the West region, led to overall softer volume.
In Europe, earnings were lower in the quarter, primarily due to higher brand investments and amortization expenses, lower net pension benefit and the termination of the Heineken contract brewing arrangement in the U.K. Notwithstanding, our business and our brands performed well across the region. We increased market share, and we continued to premiumize our portfolio and reduce costs. We grew volume in 7 of 11 countries and for 7 of our lead core and premium brands in the region. In core brands, Carling, Bergenbier and Ozujsko grew share of segment in their primary markets. Our Above Premium portfolio increased momentum, with strong double-digit growth by Coors Light on the craft portfolio, including Doom Bar and the other Sharp's brands. And additionally, our cider portfolio achieved strong growth, with the inclusion of Rekorderlig since the middle of 2015. And the full repatriation of the Staropramen brand in the U.K. also added to the solid progress we made in premiumizing our Europe portfolio. 
Our International business improved pretax performance in the first quarter, driven by continued volume growth in Latin America, India and Japan as well as lower marketing and overhead expenses due to the substantial restructure of our China business last year. Coors Light grew a high single-digit rate in international markets due to our launch in Colombia as well as growth in our existing Latin America markets.
Now I'll turn over to David to give first quarter financial highlights and perspective on the balance of 2016. David?"

Our first quarter financial headlines are as follows: Headline net sales increased 0.1% on a constant currency basis, driven by 1.2% growth in worldwide volume. Including foreign currency movements, net sales were down approximately 6% in U.S. dollars. Our net sales per hectoliter decreased 1.9% in constant currency due to negative mix in Canada and lower Heineken contract brew volume in Europe. Underlying after-tax income increased 28.1% to $110.3 million or $0.54 per share, driven by worldwide volume growth and lower cost of goods sold.
On a U.S. GAAP basis, we reported income from continuing operations attributable to Molson Coors of $159.3 million, which is nearly double the prior year results. In addition to the factors that drove higher underlying income, this increase was primarily due to $110.4 million gain on the sale of the Vancouver brewery at the end of the first quarter, partially offset by special charges related to brewery closures. Please note that we received the cash from the Vancouver brewery sale on the first day of the second quarter.
Underlying EBITDA in the quarter is $263.4 million, a 15.2% increase from a year ago. We issued 29.9 million shares of Class B common stock from our equity offering in January for approximately $2.5 billion of net proceeds, which will fund about 20% of the $12 billion pending MillerCoors transaction. Please see the earnings release we distributed earlier this morning for a detailed review of business unit financial results in the quarter. 
Total debt at the end of the first quarter was $3 billion. And cash and cash equivalents totaled $2.6 billion, resulting in a net debt of just over $400 million, which is significantly lower than prior year due to the proceeds received from our equity offering earlier this year.
Looking forward to the remainder of 2016, our strong first quarter results were aided by the timing of Easter holiday and the additional days sales as a result of 2016 being a leap year, along with relatively favorable cost comparisons in the U.S. and lower Canada distribution costs. We anticipate that the results will not benefit from most of these factors in the balance of this year. 
Other trends to consider for the last 3 quarters of this year include higher investments in our brands this year, including a double-digit increase globally in the second quarter leading into peak season in the U.S., Canada and Europe; incremental Europe brand amortization expense with an annualized impact of approximately $15 million, which began in the fourth quarter of 2015, along with lower net pension benefit in Europe this year; a total prohibition on the sale of alcohol unexpectedly implemented by the state government in Bihar, India in early April. We don't know how long this ban will be in place, and we expect this development to present a headwind for International business until it is resolved as this is our largest state of operation in India. Note, however, that this prohibition of Bihar has no impact on the Mount Shivalik business in India that we purchased last year. The impact of terminated contracts, which are now nearly all behind us; and finally, foreign currency translation, which at current exchange rates would not be a significant factor in our underlying pretax results this year. This view has improved significantly since our February earnings call because of the recent strengthening of the Canadian dollar versus the U.S. dollar. Given the recent volatility of our key foreign currencies, however, it is important to watch these rates closely.
Regarding 2016 guidance, all of the following matrix exclude any effects of the MillerCoors and Miller global brands transaction, the timing of which will have a big impact on virtually all guidance measures. For the full year, we expect cash contributions to our defined pension plans to be in the range of $45 million to $65 million in 2016 and pension expense of approximately $17 million, including our 42% of MillerCoors contributions and expense; capital spending of approximately $300 million; MG&A expense in corporate of approximately $120 million as we invest more behind innovation and commercial excellence this year; consolidated net interest expense of approximately $110 million; and underlying effective tax rate in the range of 18% to 22%, assuming no further changes in tax laws, settlement of tax audits or adjustments to uncertain tax provisions.
Regarding free cash flow guidance, we still have a large number of dynamic factors in play in relation to cash use and capital deployment, principally due to the pending MillerCoors transaction. And therefore, we plan to issue 2016 underlying free cash flow guidance later in the year with the goal of removing some of the recent volatility to guidance that has occurred. 
As far as cost outlook is concerned, we continue to expect the cost of goods sold per hectoliter in Canada and Europe in local currency to increase at a low single-digit rate for the full year 2016. We now expect 2016 MillerCoors COGS per hectoliter to be approximately in line with prior year. Lower-than-expected prices for diesel, aluminum and corn as well as acceleration of some of our cost savings initiatives drove the change from previous guidance above the low single digits. We now expect our international COGS per hectoliter in local currency to increase at the high single-digit rate for 2016. This is up from low single digits previously due to geographic mix changes.
We continue to expect cost savings over the next 2 years to be in the range of $50 million to $70 million. This view excludes cost savings from MillerCoors as well as synergies resulting from the pending MillerCoors acquisition, which we expect to be $200 million by the year 4 following the transaction close. 
Finally, here are the most recent volume trends for each of the businesses early in the second quarter, which are impacted by the early timing of Easter this year. In the U.S. and Canada for the 3 weeks through April 23, sales to retail decreased at mid-single-digit rates. In Europe, volume through to April 25 decreased low single digits. And our International sales volume, including royalty volume through to April 23, decreased at double-digit rate, partially due to the alcohol prohibition in Bihar, India. As ever, please keep in mind these numbers represent only a portion of the current quarter, and trends could change in the weeks ahead. 
Also, note that following the close of the pending MillerCoors transaction, we plan to discontinue providing early next quarter volumes.
At this point, I'll turn it back over to Mark for outlook, wrap-up and the Q&A. Mark?"

In 2016, we will continue to drive our First Choice for consumer and customer agenda in the geographies and segments where we choose to play. As we move into peak season this year, we're seeing additional competitive pricing pressure, and we intend to step up our brand investment significantly, particularly in the second quarter. 
In the U.S, there has been a great deal of change in MillerCoors over the past 10 months. Those changes were necessary to create the foundation for the volume growth we aim to achieve by 2019. As we work to close the transaction, MillerCoors remains disciplined, decisive and accountable for growing the business, transforming its portfolio and driving value for our shareholders. 
In American light lagers, we continued to gain momentum by the revitalization of our 2 largest U.S. brands, Coors Light and Miller Lite Light. 
In Above Premium, we continued to develop higher-margin offerings that can scale and stick, including strong early result from the launch of Henry's Hard Orange and Ginger Ale sodas. And we'll introduce a cherry cola flavor later this year. 
We've also made the decision to offer our fastest-growing Leinenkugel's extension, Grapefruit Shandy, on a year-round basis to strengthen the Leinenkugel's brand family, which, alongside Blue Moon and Belgian White, forms as the base of a formidable craft portfolio. 
In cider, we're broadening the appeal of Smith & Hard Cider -- Smith & Forge Hard Cider by adding a bottle package to our lineup. We'll continue to build First Choice customer partnerships with our building material retail strategy, which leverages the higher velocity and broad appeal of American light lagers. We plan to expand this valuable tool beyond the on-premise additional channels in the balance of this year.
In Canada, the restructuring of our brand portfolio was largely complete and gaining traction. In the first quarter, we achieved strong volume growth behind both Coors Banquet and Pilsner. We also continued to see strong momentum for our craft brands, Creemore and Granville Island, as well as in our Mexican portfolio with Sol and Dos Equis and flavored malt beverages with Mad Jack. At the end of the quarter, we launched Mad Jack Root Beer and ginger ale, the first major hard soda entries in Canada. We continue to focus on accelerating growth for our core brands, Coors Light and Molson Canadian, as our biggest opportunity and challenge. Coors Light brand health has improved behind our North American packaging update, which continued to roll out in first quarter, along with high-impact retail executions that drove positive momentum and social engagement. For Molson Canadian, following another successful Anything for Hockey campaign in the first quarter, we'll continue into peak season with strong programming and new communication that celebrates all of the rich qualities of our beer and our Canadian identity. 
Operationally, we continue on our mission to be first choice for consumers and customers, focusing on our Field Sales Management program to deliver brilliant store-level execution across space, assortment and pricing. In 2016, we will also continue to restructure our supply chain to ensure we are fit for the future. The sale of our Vancouver brewery for CAD 185 million at the end of the first quarter was a significant first step towards allowing us to build a more efficient and flexible brewery over the next few years.
In Europe, we achieved solid top line performance in the first quarter on the strength of our core brands and the addition of the Rekorderlig cider and Staropramen brands in the U.K. Although the increased brand amortization expense will present a headwind for the next couple of quarters, we'll continue to invest in our core brand portfolio across Europe to grow share of segment. In fact, earlier today, we announced the signing of a global Carling sponsorship as the official beer partner of the English Premier League. This sponsorship reaches well beyond Carling in the U.K., as it allows us to leverage any brand in any market with one of the most popular sports properties globally. 
We'll also continue to premiumize our portfolio with Coors Light; the Sharp's portfolio led by Doom Bar; Ireland's leading craft brand, Franciscan Well; Cobra; Rekorderlig; and Staropramen. And to ensure that our supply chain is fit for future, the plant closure of Burton South Brewery in the U.K. is progressing well, along with the transition of production to a recently modernized Burton North brewery by the end of 2017. 
Our International business is focused on attaining profitability in 2016 on a constant currency basis versus 2013 foreign exchange rates when we originally made this commitment and continuing to accelerate our overall growth in existing in select new markets. Upon closing of the MillerCoors and the Miller global brands transaction, we will integrate the Miller international brands into our portfolio and leverage a footprint that complements our growth strategy and allows us to gain entrance into high-priority markets while increasing our business scale in current markets. 
We also intend to continue to drive rapid growth for Coors Light in Latin America, including the high potential Colombian market, where we launched at the end of last year. Going forward, we expect the Coors, Miller and Staropramen brands to form the backbone of our International portfolio. 
In India, we will continue to add scale through our Mount Shivalik business, which we acquired last year, as we develop contingency plans related to the Bihar alcohol prohibition. 
To wrap up. In the balance of 2016, we'll continue to focus on our First Choice for consumers and customer -- customers ambition, all driven through our PACC lens and with the intent to drive total shareholder returns.
Now before we start the Q&A portion of the call, just a quick comment. As usual, our prepared remarks will be on our website for your reference within a couple of hours this afternoon. Also at 1 p.m. Eastern Time today, Dave Dunnewald will host a follow-up conference call, which is an opportunity for you to ask additional questions regarding our quarterly results. This call will also be available for you to hear via a webcast on our website. 
Additionally, in the next 2 months, we hope to see many of you at 2 events. Firstly, we will hold our Annual Meeting of Stockholders on Wednesday, May 25, 2016, here in Denver. And second, we'll host our Annual New York Investor and Analyst Day at New York Stock Exchange in the afternoon of Wednesday, June 8, 2016. 
Finally, I want to offer a thank you to David Heede, who has capably led the finance function over the past almost 6 months. 
So at this point, Connor, we'd like to open up for questions, please."

The exception to that really has been in Alberta, where, obviously, that economy is under a lot of pressure with what we've seen from the oil industry, but not dissimilar to what we've seen in the U.S., where in a relatively benign volume market, the areas of real consumer momentum tend to be in imports, higher-price segments like FMBs and craft."

And to answer your question and give that some context, the markets in which we operate were pretty much flat from a volume perspective. So in other words, we gained share and we will calculate that to be about a 0.6% or 0.7% share gain across the quarter, which, again, I think is very solid. And I think pleasingly, it's share gain driven by the majority of our countries, by the majority of our main brands. And we also saw some pretty good trends on our premium brands.

Sure, Mark. I'd actually just, Mark, just step back one second and just say that as we looked at our strategic plan 3 years ago, we really built out 3 big blocks: one was redoing our supply chain footprint; the other was lowering our G&A cost base; and the third was improving our commercial capability and portfolio. So -- and those are relevant. Why? Because on the cost base and the supply chain, the savings that we're getting from that have allowed us to start to feed the investments required to get the brands going. On the brand side, we're really focused on making sure that we had a portfolio that was right for consumers. And on the Above Premium, which is where we built up all the brands, we're performing well, and we're really happy with those brands. On Molson Canadian and on Coors Light, those brands sit in the mainstream. That is the part of the market that is under the most pressure. And if you looked at this past quarter, Canadian held share of the segment, our Coors Light did not. So Coors Light is where our real challenge is. I've been pretty clear about calling out where the challenges are for Coors Light, those being our need to improve our brand scores, our need to reach out to millennials and to engage those consumers more actively in our brands. I think when you look at the first quarter from a cost standpoint, our G&A cost went down, and we spent some of that money back in the brand. So that's living our strategy. I think against the brand itself, we saw finally the introduction of some marketing that is working. Our advertising is scoring better than any of the campaigns we've seen over the last 3 or 4 years. That's a positive. And we're seeing an uptick in our brand equity. So those are positives. I think if you looked at the activity that we have for the second quarter and the callout that we made in the earnings release and the script this morning, we pointed to the fact that we expect to put more money behind the brands, and that is because we have a pretty full activation agenda. We've got a full advertising agenda, and we know that we need to spend some money to get the energy going on these brands. So that's where we are, and I think you'll be in a position in June to hear more from us and to see some of that work when we meet in New York."

But I think the gains that we offered last November as we worked through the planning stands good, and we'll update more broadly in due course. From your question in -- with regard to the center of gravity that will be our business being the U.S., our overall strategy doesn't change. We will have a bigger position in the U.S., and that has many benefits associated with it. But we've been on a journey to build our footprint over the course of the last 5 years in particular, led by Coors Light and more recently by Staropramen, and that will continue. I'm not going to comment specifically on any M&A opportunities. We never do, as you're aware. But we need to play to win in both the U.S., Canada and in our European business, and we need to continue to build our global footprint lead through our global brands. That's principally been on an asset-light license and export model. It's likely that, that model will continue as we look to take the Coor's trademark, Staropramen trademark in the future, the Miller trademark into more markets. That's probably all I can say at this stage."

Tremendous traction and velocity and growth in Central and South America. And it's a brand which has become our second largest brand in our U.K. and Ireland portfolio and has grown to well over 1 million hectoliters now across the U.K. and Ireland. So it's in a number of international markets, but I wouldn't describe it as having a global footprint center of gravity outside of North America certainly, Central and South America, now U.K. and Ireland business. And strong and growing momentum behind the Coors Light brand. Alongside that, we've introduced Coors 1873 into a couple of markets just to assist the brand of Coors Banquet. And again, we've seen that perform strongly. So we're looking to build out the Coors trademark.

Robert, we've got a great clear bottle offering, brown bottle offering and green bottle offering, but that's me probably getting out my depth on my marketing skills. But the overall positionings of the brand are very complementary. It gives us more scale in a number of existing MCI markets, and it gives us an entry point into a number of new markets as well.

My second question, if I may, is given the Carling business in the U.K., how are you kind of seeing the potential for the Brexit potential vote next month in England? Would that cause meaningful issues for you? Or that's something that is relatively managed within the scope of the operations in Europe?"

So thanks for your acknowledgment on the M&A question. I would just mention, obviously, our definitive agreement with ABI is that Pilsner or Cal [ph] brand remains in our portfolio on the U.S. on a perpetual royalty-free basis",195,"Okay. Thanks, Philippe [ph]. So thanks for your acknowledgment on the M&A question. I would just mention, obviously, our definitive agreement with ABI is that Pilsner or Cal [ph] brand remains in our portfolio on the U.S. on a perpetual royalty-free basis. So that's in our portfolio currently and will remain in our portfolio irrespective of what's been announced last week by ABI in the SAB divestiture. With regard to the Carling business in the U.K. and Brexit, that's as a great question. I think if you asked 10 commentators, you'd probably get 10 different points of view. I mean, it's outside of our control. The consumer demand in the U.K. for Carling and our other brands, I think, will remain unaffected by whatever decision is made. The impact on currency and any translational impact I think is probably the thing that we're keeping our eye on at the moment. But I don't it'll affect any real kind of demand patterns in the U.K., which is clearly what we're really interested in. I don't know, Simon, whether you'd offer any more color on that.

I think the theme that I would point you to is that in general, we are increasing our investments in marketing, and those investments are playing out well for us with stronger volumes, stronger revenues and premiumizing that portfolio. And actually, that's a factor that should cross all the markets. So if, for example, I took Staropramen, we are investing in Staropramen across all of our European markets, and we've also repatriated that into the U.K. And we're investing behind it, and that's giving us double-digit growth almost universally actually across those markets. So there are always some puts and takes from a timing perspective in individual markets, but our general strategy of investing behind our core brands and investing in premiumization is working at the aggregate level in Europe. And any country that isn't true in this quarter, I'd be confident that we could continue to drive those countries back towards the norm. So I don't think there's actually as much variation as perhaps you might be pointing to. I think, overall, our strategy is just working in aggregate."

The second one, in the earlier call, you said that pricing ex mix was up 0.8% for the MillerCoors portfolio. Can you just give us some nuance there in terms of what was the increase in the value brands compared to, say, mainstream? It seems to me that on value, pricing might have come down. If you can explain that. And then the third and last question, I think that Miller High Life, it's, in my opinion, in a very unique position within your value portfolio, and one would think that it's maybe stuck in between mainstream and value.

David is now transitioning back to his role as our Europe CFO as we welcome our new Global CFO, Mauricio Restrepo, who joined Molson Coors yesterday and is here with us this morning. 
Before our earnings call today, David and I will take you through highlights of our first quarter 2016 results for the Molson Coors Brewing Company, along with some perspective on the balance of 2016. 
In the first quarter, we continued to focus on our First Choice ambition and on building a stronger brand portfolio, delivering value-added innovation, strengthening our core brand positionings through incremental marketing investments and continuing to premiumize our portfolio. We began to see the benefits to our top line performance as we grew worldwide volume; improved core brand momentum in key markets; introduced fast-growing innovations in all of our businesses; and achieved strong Above Premium growth globally, including in craft, flavored malt beverages and cider. We also significantly expanded gross operating and pretax margins globally and increased total company underlying after-tax earnings more than 28% while growing underlying EBITDA more than 15% versus a year ago.
At the same time, we completed a common stock offering in January to fund about 20% of the pending MillerCoors transaction, and we made solid progress in our planning for the integration of MillerCoors and the Miller global brand portfolio. Completion of this game-changing transaction is still expected in the second half of this year, and we intend to be ready to go on day 1 following the close. 
In brands, Coors Light grew volume 3.5% globally, including strong double-digit growth in the U.K. and Ireland and high single-digit growth in Latin America. In Above Premium, our craft portfolio drove growth from Doom Bar and a broader Sharp's portfolio in the U.K.; Creemore in Granville Island in Canada; Blue Moon Belgian White in the U.S. and in the U.K. and its sister brand, Belgian Moon, in Canada; and also the newly-acquired Saint Archer in the U.S. 
In ciders, we grew volume of Rekorderlig in Europe and Strongbow in Canada. And in flavored malt beverages, the introduction of Henry's Hard Soda is proceeding well ahead of expectations and driving incremental Above Premium volume for us in the U.S. 
We continued to strengthen our business through improvements to our sales execution and revenue management capabilities. We increased efficiency of our operations, and we implemented common global systems. To ensure that our supply chain is fit for future, we completed the sale of our Vancouver brewery in Canada for CAD 185 million, and we'll lease the brewery back from the buyer as we build a new, more efficient and flexible brewery. We also gained agreement to the closure of Burton South Brewery in the U.K., allowing us to further consolidate U.K. brewing operations. 
Regional highlights for the first quarter are as follows: In the U.S., underlying equity income increased 22.1% from a year ago, driven by higher net pricing, positive sales mix, timing of shipments and lower cost of goods sold. Coors Light and Miller Lite each gained share of the U.S. Premium Light segment for the fourth consecutive quarter, with both brands achieving flat sales-to-retail volume for the first time in MillerCoors history. Improved momentum for these 2 brands was driven by ongoing improvements to their consumer communications, which appeals to a broad cross-section of men and women, millennials and multicultural consumers.
Coors Banquet remains the only national premium beer in the category that continues to grow. In the higher-margin Above Premium segment, our lead craft brand, Blue Moon Belgian White, delivered another quarter of growth, as did Leinenkugel's Grapefruit Shandy and the newly acquired Saint Archer brands. 
In FMBs, we achieved strong initial results from the introduction of Henry's Hard Sodas in the first quarter. And according to Nielsen, Henry's Hard Orange Soda has the best velocity of any hard soda since the fourth week of its launch, and Henry's Hard Ginger Ale soda is the #1 ginger ale in this fast-growing segment. 
In Canada, we delivered strong earnings growth, but our top line performance was lower in both volume and revenue per hectoliter. In brands, Coors Light and Molson Canadian both had a challenging quarter, and we're taking additional concrete steps to improve performance in the balance of the year, which I'll discuss in a few minutes. In Above Premium and craft, Coors Banquet, Belgian Moon, Mad Jack Apple Lager, Heineken and Strongbow Cider all grew volume and share in the quarter, along with our Creemore and Grandville craft brands. 
In headline financial results for the quarter, Canada underlying pretax income increased 25.2% in constant currency, primarily due to a timing-led reduction in distribution costs, some lower pension expenses and results of our ongoing cost saving initiatives. These factors were partially offset by the impact of lower volume and higher brand investments. Excluding the impact of the loss of the Miller brands, Canada STRs declined 1.6%. But including the Miller brands, STRs declined 5.2%. Increased competitor trade spend and pricing activities, especially in Québec and the West region, led to overall softer volume.
In Europe, earnings were lower in the quarter, primarily due to higher brand investments and amortization expenses, lower net pension benefit and the termination of the Heineken contract brewing arrangement in the U.K. Notwithstanding, our business and our brands performed well across the region. We increased market share, and we continued to premiumize our portfolio and reduce costs. We grew volume in 7 of 11 countries and for 7 of our lead core and premium brands in the region. In core brands, Carling, Bergenbier and Ozujsko grew share of segment in their primary markets. Our Above Premium portfolio increased momentum, with strong double-digit growth by Coors Light and our craft portfolio, including Doom Bar and the other Sharp's brands. And additionally, our cider portfolio achieved strong growth, with the inclusion of Rekorderlig since the middle of 2015. And the full repatriation of the Staropramen brand in the U.K. also added to the solid progress we made in premiumizing our Europe portfolio. 
Our International business improved pretax performance in the first quarter, driven by continued volume growth in Latin America, India and Japan as well as lower marketing and overhead expenses due to the substantial restructure of our China business last year. Coors Light grew a high single-digit rate in international markets due to our launch in Colombia as well as growth in our existing Latin America markets.
Now I'll turn over to David to give first quarter financial highlights and perspective on the balance of 2016. David?"
263765,312033274,971502,"Molson Coors Brewing Company, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 03, 2016",2016-05-03,"Earnings Calls","Molson Coors Beverage Company","Executives","Thank you, Mark, and hello, everybody. Our first quarter financial headlines are as follows: Headline net sales increased 0.1% on a constant currency basis, driven by 1.2% growth in worldwide volume. Including foreign currency movements, net sales were do",1102,"Thank you, Mark, and hello, everybody. Our first quarter financial headlines are as follows: Headline net sales increased 0.1% on a constant currency basis, driven by 1.2% growth in worldwide volume. Including foreign currency movements, net sales were down approximately 6% in U.S. dollars. Our net sales per hectoliter decreased 1.9% in constant currency due to negative mix in Canada and lower Heineken contract brewing volume in Europe. Underlying after-tax income increased 28.1% to $110.3 million or $0.54 per share, driven by worldwide volume growth and lower cost of goods sold.
On a U.S. GAAP basis, we reported income from continuing operations attributable to Molson Coors of $159.3 million, which is nearly double the prior year results. In addition to the factors that drove higher underlying income, this increase was primarily due to $110.4 million gain on the sale of the Vancouver brewery at the end of the first quarter, partially offset by special charges related to brewery closures. Please note that we received the cash from the Vancouver brewery sale on the first day of the second quarter.
Underlying EBITDA in the quarter is $263.4 million, a 15.2% increase from a year ago. We issued 29.9 million shares of Class B common stock from our equity offering in January for approximately $2.5 billion of net proceeds, which will fund about 20% of the $12 billion pending MillerCoors transaction. Please see the earnings release we distributed earlier this morning for a detailed review of business unit financial results in the quarter. 
Total debt at the end of the first quarter was $3 billion. And cash and cash equivalents totaled $2.6 billion, resulting in a net debt of just over $400 million, which is significantly lower than prior year due to the proceeds received from our equity offering earlier this year.
Looking forward to the remainder of 2016, our strong first quarter results were aided by the timing of Easter holiday and the additional days sales as a result of 2016 being a leap year, along with relatively favorable cost comparisons in the U.S. and lower Canada distribution costs. We anticipate that our results will not benefit from most of these factors in the balance of this year. 
Other trends to consider for the last 3 quarters of this year include: higher investments in our brands this year, including a double-digit increase globally in the second quarter leading into peak season in the U.S., Canada and Europe; incremental Europe brand amortization expense with an annualized impact of approximately $15 million, which began in the fourth quarter of 2015, along with lower net pension benefit in Europe this year; a total prohibition on the sale of alcohol unexpectedly implemented by the state government in Bihar, India in early April. We don't know how long this ban will be in place, and we expect this development to present a headwind for International business until it is resolved, as this is our largest state of operation in India. Note, however, that this prohibition in Bihar has no impact on the Mount Shivalik business in India that we purchased last year; the impact of terminated contracts, which are now nearly all behind us; and finally, foreign currency translation, which at current exchange rates would not be a significant factor in our underlying pretax results this year. This view has improved significantly since our February earnings call because of the recent strengthening of the Canadian dollar versus the U.S. dollar. Given the recent volatility of our key foreign currencies, however, it is important to watch these rates closely.
Regarding 2016 guidance, all of the following metrics exclude any effects of the MillerCoors and Miller global brands transaction, the timing of which will have a big impact on virtually all guidance measures. For the full year, we expect cash contributions to our defined pension plans to be in the range of $45 million to $65 million in 2016 and pension expense of approximately $17 million, including our 42% of MillerCoors contributions and expense; capital spending of approximately $300 million; MG&A expense in corporate of approximately $120 million as we invest more behind innovation and commercial excellence this year; consolidated net interest expense of approximately $110 million; and underlying effective tax rate in the range of 18% to 22%, assuming no further changes in tax laws, settlement of tax audits or adjustments to uncertain tax provisions.
Regarding free cash flow guidance, we still have a large number of dynamic factors in play in relation to cash use and capital deployment, principally due to the pending MillerCoors transaction. And therefore, we plan to issue 2016 underlying free cash flow guidance later in the year with the goal of removing some of the recent volatility to guidance that has occurred. 
As far as cost outlook is concerned, we continue to expect the cost of goods sold per hectoliter in Canada and Europe in local currency to increase at low single-digit rate for full year 2016. We now expect 2016 MillerCoors COGS per hectoliter to be approximately in line with prior year. Lower-than-expected prices for diesel, aluminum and corn as well as acceleration of some of our cost savings initiatives drove the change from previous guidance above the low single digits. We now expect our international COGS per hectoliter in local currency to increase at the high single-digit rate for 2016. This is up from low single digits previously due to geographic mix changes.
We continue to expect cost savings for the next 2 years to be in the range of $50 million to $70 million. This view excludes cost savings from MillerCoors as well as synergies resulting from the pending MillerCoors acquisition, which we expect to be $200 million by the year 4 following the transaction close. 
Finally, here are the most recent volume trends for each of the businesses early in the second quarter, which are impacted by the early timing of Easter this year. In the U.S. and Canada for the 3 weeks through April 23, sales to retail decreased at mid-single-digit rates. In Europe, volume through to April 25 decreased low single digits. And our International sales volume, including royalty volume through to April 23, decreased at double-digit rate, partially due to the alcohol prohibition in Bihar, India. As ever, please keep in mind these numbers represent only a portion of the current quarter, and trends could change in the weeks ahead. 
Also, note that following the close of the pending MillerCoors transaction, we plan to discontinue providing early next quarter volumes.
At this point, I'll turn it back over to Mark for outlook, wrap-up and the Q&A. Mark?"

In 2016, we will continue to drive our First Choice for consumer and customer agenda in the geographies and segments where we choose to play. As we move into peak season this year, we're seeing additional competitive pricing pressure, and we intend to step up our brand investment significantly, particularly in the second quarter. 
In the U.S, there has been a great deal of change in MillerCoors over the past 10 months. Those changes were necessary to create the foundation for the volume growth we aim to achieve by 2019. As we work to close the transaction, MillerCoors remains disciplined, decisive and accountable for growing the business, transforming its portfolio and driving value for our shareholders. 
In American light lagers, we continued to gain momentum by the revitalization of our 2 largest U.S. brands, Coors Light and Miller Lite. 
In Above Premium, we continue to develop higher-margin offerings that can scale and stick, including strong early result from the launch of Henry's Hard Orange and Ginger Ale sodas. And we'll introduce a cherry cola flavor later this year. 
We've also made the decision to offer our fastest-growing Leinenkugel's extension, Grapefruit Shandy, on a year-round basis to strengthen the Leinenkugel's brand family, which, alongside Blue Moon Belgian White, forms the base of a formidable craft portfolio. 
In cider, we're broadening the appeal of Smith & Hard Cider -- Smith & Forge Hard Cider by adding a bottle package to our lineup. We'll continue to build First Choice customer partnerships with our Building with Beer retail strategy, which leverages the higher velocity and broad appeal of American light lagers. We plan to expand this valuable tool beyond the on-premise to additional channels in the balance of this year.
In Canada, the restructuring of our brand portfolio was largely complete and gaining traction. In the first quarter, we achieved strong volume growth behind both Coors Banquet and Pilsner. We also continued to see strong momentum for our craft brands, Creemore and Granville Island, as well as in our Mexican portfolio with Sol and Dos Equis and flavored malt beverages with Mad Jack. At the end of the quarter, we launched Mad Jack Root Beer and ginger ale, the first major hard soda entries in Canada. We continue to focus on accelerating growth for our core brands, Coors Light and Molson Canadian, as our biggest opportunity and challenge. Coors Light brand health has improved behind our North American packaging update, which continued to roll out in first quarter, along with high-impact retail executions that drove positive momentum and social engagement. For Molson Canadian, following another successful Anything for Hockey campaign in the first quarter, we'll continue into peak season with strong programming and new communication that celebrates all of the rich qualities of our beer and our Canadian identity. 
Operationally, we continue on our mission to be First Choice for consumers and customers, focusing on our Field Sales Management program to deliver brilliant store-level execution across space, assortment and pricing. In 2016, we will also continue to restructure our supply chain to ensure we are fit for the future. The sale of our Vancouver brewery for CAD 185 million at the end of the first quarter was a significant first step towards allowing us to build a more efficient and flexible brewery over the next few years.
In Europe, we achieved solid top line performance in the first quarter on the strength of our core brands and the addition of the Rekorderlig cider and Staropramen brands in the U.K. Although the increased brand amortization expense will present a headwind for the next couple of quarters, we'll continue to invest in our core brand portfolio across Europe to grow share of segment. In fact, earlier today, we announced the signing of a global Carling sponsorship as the official beer partner of the English Premier League. This sponsorship reaches well beyond Carling in the U.K., as it allows us to leverage any brand in any market with one of the most popular sports properties globally. 
We'll also continue to premiumize our portfolio with Coors Light; the Sharp's portfolio led by Doom Bar; Ireland's leading craft brand, Franciscan Well; Cobra; Rekorderlig; and Staropramen. And to ensure that our supply chain is fit for future, the planned closure of our Burton South Brewery in the U.K. is progressing well, along with the transition of production to a recently-modernized Burton North brewery by the end of 2017. 
Our International business is focused on attaining profitability in 2016 on a constant currency basis versus 2013 foreign exchange rates when we originally made this commitment and continuing to accelerate our overall growth in existing and select new markets. Upon closing of the MillerCoors and the Miller global brands transaction, we will integrate the Miller international brands into our portfolio and leverage a footprint that complements our growth strategy and allows us to gain entrance into high-priority markets, while increasing our business scale in current markets. 
We also intend to continue to drive rapid growth for Coors Light in Latin America, including the high potential Colombian market, where we launched at the end of last year. Going forward, we expect the Coors, Miller and Staropramen brands to form the backbone of our International portfolio. 
In India, we will continue to add scale through our Mount Shivalik business, which we acquired last year, as we develop contingency plans related to the Bihar alcohol prohibition. 
To wrap up. In the balance of 2016, we'll continue to focus on our First Choice for consumers and customer -- customers ambition, all driven through our PACC lens and with intent to drive total shareholder returns.
Now before we start the Q&A portion of the call, just a quick comment. As usual, our prepared remarks will be on our website for your reference within a couple of hours this afternoon. Also at 1 p.m. Eastern Time today, Dave Dunnewald will host a follow-up conference call, which is an opportunity for you to ask additional questions regarding our quarterly results. This call will also be available for you to hear via webcast on our website. 
Additionally, in the next 2 months, we hope to see many of you at 2 events. Firstly, we will hold our Annual Meeting of Stockholders on Wednesday, May 25, 2016, here in Denver. And second, we'll host our Annual New York Investor and Analyst Day at the New York Stock Exchange in the afternoon of Wednesday, June 8, 2016. 
Finally, I want to offer a thank you to David Heede, who has capably led the finance function over the past almost 6 months. 
So at this point, Connor, we'd like to open up for questions, please."

The exception to that really has been in Alberta, where, obviously, that economy is under a lot of pressure with what we've seen from the oil industry, but not dissimilar to what we've seen in the U.S., where in a relatively-benign volume market, the areas of real consumer momentum tend to be in imports, higher-price segments like FMBs and craft."

And to answer your question and give that some context, the markets in which we operate were pretty much flat from a volume perspective. So in other words, we gained share and we would calculate that to be about a 0.6% or 0.7% share gain across the quarter, which, again, I think is very solid. And I think pleasingly, it's share gain driven by the majority of our countries, by the majority of our main brands. And we also saw some pretty good trends on our premium brands.

And I think the most recent trends in the U.S. on our 2 biggest brands demonstrate our ability to get focused, put the right inputs in place. And I mean, these are big, big brands. It's like driving an oil tanker. It doesn't turn around overnight, but you've got to remain resolute and focused on the right inputs.

So -- and those are relevant. Why? Because on the cost base and the supply chain, the savings that we're getting from that have allowed us to start to feed the investments required to get the brands going. On the brand side, we're really focused on making sure that we had a portfolio that was right for consumers. And on the Above Premium, which is where we built up all the brands, we're performing well, and we're really happy with those brands. On Molson Canadian and on Coors Light, those brands sit in the mainstream. That is the part of the market that is under the most pressure. And if you looked at this past quarter, Canadian held share of the segment, our Coors Light did not. So Coors Light is where our real challenge is. I've been pretty clear about calling out where the challenges are for Coors Light, those being our need to improve our brand scores, our need to reach out to millennials and to engage those consumers more actively in our brands. I think when you look at the first quarter from a cost standpoint, our G&A cost went down, and we spent some of that money back in the brand. So that's living our strategy. I think against the brand itself, we saw finally the introduction of some marketing that is working. Our advertising is scoring better than any of the campaigns we've seen over the last 3 or 4 years. That's a positive. And we're seeing an uptick in our brand equity. So those are positives. I think if you looked at the activity that we had for the second quarter and the callout that we made in the earnings release and the script this morning, we pointed to the fact that we expect to put more money behind the brands, and that is because we have a pretty full activation agenda. We've got a full advertising agenda, and we know that we need to spend some money to get the energy going on these brands. So that's where we are, and I think you'll be in a position in June to hear more from us and to see some of that work when we meet in New York."

But I think the gains that we offered last November as we worked through the planning stands good, and we'll update more broadly in due course. From your question in -- with regard to the center of gravity that will be our business being the U.S., our overall strategy doesn't change. We will have a bigger position in the U.S., and that has many benefits associated with it. But we've been on a journey to build our footprint over the course of the last 5 years in particular, led by Coors Light and more recently by Staropramen, and that will continue. I'm not going to comment specifically on any M&A opportunities. We never do, as you're aware. But we need to play to win in both the U.S., Canada and in our European business, and we need to continue to build our global footprint led through our global brands. That's principally been on an asset-light license and export model. It's likely that, that model will continue as we look to take the Coor's trademark, Staropramen trademark, and in the future the Miller trademark into more markets. That's probably all I can say at this stage."

And across Europe and our International business, we're close to 19% growth. So we're seeing very, very strong performance as we take the brand outside of North America. Tremendous traction and velocity and growth in Central and South America. And it's a brand which has become our second largest brand in our U.K. and Ireland portfolio and has grown to well over 1 million hectoliters now across the U.K. and Ireland. So it's in a number of international markets, but I wouldn't describe it as having a global footprint center of gravity outside of North America; certainly, Central and South America, now U.K. and Ireland business. And strong and growing momentum behind the Coors Light brand. Alongside that, we've introduced Coors 1873 into a couple of markets just to assist the brand of Coors Banquet. And again, we've seen that perform strongly. So we're looking to build out the Coors trademark.

In really simplistic terms, Robert, we've got a great clear bottle offering, brown bottle offering and green bottle offering, but that's me probably getting out of my depth on my marketing skills. But the overall positionings of the brand are very complementary. It gives us more scale in a number of existing MCI markets, and it gives us an entry point into a number of new markets as well. So our International business will scale up very significantly on the back of this addition to our portfolio with what I think will be a great backbone of international brands.

But I don't it'll affect any real kind of demand patterns in the U.K., which is clearly what we're really interested in. I don't know, Simon, whether you'd offer any more color on that.

I think the theme that I would point you to is that in general, we are increasing our investments in marketing, and those investments are playing out well for us with stronger volumes, stronger revenues and premiumizing our portfolio. And actually, that's a factor that should cross all the markets. So if, for example, I took Staropramen, we are investing in Staropramen across all of our European markets, and we've also repatriated that into the U.K. And we're investing behind it, and that's giving us double-digit growth almost universally actually across those markets. So there are always some puts and takes from a timing perspective in individual markets, but our general strategy of investing behind our core brands and investing in premiumization is working at the aggregate level in Europe. And any countries that, that isn't true in this quarter, I'd be confident that we could continue to drive those countries back towards the norm. So I don't think there's actually as much variation as perhaps you might be pointing to. And I think, overall, our strategy is just working in aggregate."

And what happened really with the price increase in the fall? Did it stick or not? That's the first question. The second one, in the earlier call, you said that pricing ex mix was up 0.8% for the MillerCoors portfolio. Can you just give us some nuance there in terms of what was the increase in the value brands compared to, say, mainstream? It seems to me that on value, pricing might have come down. If you can explain that. And then the third and last question, I think that Miller High Life, it's, in my opinion, in a very unique position within your value portfolio, and one would think that it's maybe stuck in between mainstream and value.

Apologies for the slight delay due to technical issue. Many thanks for joining us today. 
With me on the call this morning from Molson Coors, we have Mauricio Restrepo, our Global CFO; Gavin Hattersley, the COO of Miller Coors; Stewart Glendinning, the CEO of Canada; Simon Cox, our European CEO; Kandy Anand, our International CEO; [indiscernible] our Deputy General Counsel; Brian Tabolt our Global Controller; and David Dunnewald, the VP of Investor Relations.
For our earnings call today, Mauricio and I will take you through highlights of our second quarter 2016 results for Molson Coors Brewing Company along with some perspective on the second half of 2016.
In the second quarter, we continued to focus on our First Choice ambition and in building a stronger, broader and more premium brand portfolio, underpinned by incremental sales and marketing investment as we discussed on our first quarter earnings call. Progress in the second quarter included net sales revenue per hectoliter growth on a constant currency basis in all of our businesses, strong Coors Light growth globally. Improved core brand momentum, fast-growing innovations in key markets and strong Above Premium growth globally. 
We significantly increased investments behind our brands while retaining our shipments and other short-term factors held back bottom line performance in the quarter. In brands, Coors Light grew volume more than 4% globally, including strong double-digit growth in Europe and Latin America and low single-digit growth in the U.S., its best performance in nearly 3 years. In Above Premium, our craft portfolio drove growth, from Doom Bar and other Sharp brands in the U.K. from Creemore Springs and Belgium Moon in Canada and from Leinenkugel's grapefruit shandy and the newly acquired Saint Archer in the U.S. 
Staropramen grew strongly across Europe outside of its home market, and ciders grew volume at Rekorderlig in Europe and Strongbow Canada. In flavored malt beverages, we now have the largest hard soda franchise in the U.S. with the successful introduction of the Henry's hard soda brands earlier this year. We continue to strengthen our business to improvements through sales execution and revenue management capabilities, increased efficiency of our operations and implementation of global systems. In short, our supply chain is fit for the future. In the second quarter, we reached an agreement to purchase land in British Columbia on which will build a new efficient and flexible brewery over the next few years. This new brewery site is attractively priced real access situation in the TransCanada Highway making it ideal for serving the Western Canada and U.S. market, and we anticipate completing the land purchase just this month.
In the past few months, we have also made substantial progress in the pending MillerCoors transaction, including an integration planning and completing the necessary financing at very attractive rates. Investor demand for our recent debt offering was very strong, and we achieved record and near-record low interest rates on our debt issue. We're pleased with the transaction progress made to date, and we continue to plan for closing before the end of 2016, more specifically, October 10 based on the joint ABI SAB recent announcements. We're very excited to be much closer to completing this game-changing transaction, which will enable simplified decision-making and will reduce the complexities of dual ownership. It will help us become a more integrated and efficient brewer and will enable us to become a more effective competitor as a single owner consumer choice in an increasingly diverse and fast-growing brewing industry. 
As part of integration planning process, last week, I announced the leadership appointments that will strengthen our combined organization, and it will take effect on the close of the transaction. Our transaction and timing remain dependent clearly on the completion of the ABI and SABMiller transaction. 
The regional highlights for the second quarter are as follows. In the U.S., while overall sales to retail volume decreased 1.7%, driven primarily by our Below Premium brands, Coors Light STRs were up low single digits in the quarter, which was its best quarterly performance since the fourth quarter of 2012. Domestic net revenue per hectoliter grew 0.7% for the quarter as a result of favorable pricing and positive sales mix. Our largest brand gained share of the Premium Light segment for the first consecutive quarter. And please note that all of our performance discussions related -- relating to Coors Light exclude the citrus that was discontinued last year. With flat STRs, Miller Lite gained share of the Premium Light segment for the seventh [ph] consecutive quarter. Improved momentum for these 2 brands was driven by continued rollout of the new visual identity and consumer communications, which appeal to our broad section of men and women, millennials and multicultural consumers. Additionally, Coors Banquet is now on its 10th consecutive year of growth. In higher margin Above Premium segment Henry's was #1 hard soda franchise in the second quarter in the strength of Henry's hard orange and ginger ale. In craft Leinenkugel's grapefruit shandy and the newly acquired Saint Archer brands continue to drive volume although Bloom and Belgian White declined low single digits. As an important indication of the traction we are gaining in the U.S., for the first time in history of the joint venture, in 2016, MillerCoors finished #1 in the supplier survey, which polled hundreds of U.S. distributors performance of wine and spirit suppliers. This is a key accomplishment in our First Choice a mission for our customers and is an example of the type of efforts we are driving globally to ensure we are focusing on these important customer relationships. On the bottom line, MillerCoors' second quarter underlying net income declined 3.8% to $468.8 million, driven primarily by the timing of shipments due to calendar shifts, which are partially offset by lower cost of goods sold, higher net pricing and positive sales mix. Meanwhile, Molson Coors' second quarter underlying equity income in the U.S. segment increased 1.4% due to an $11.1 million anticipated refund of federal excise tax paid on imports. This tax refund is based on qualifying volumes exported from the U.S. by the Coors Brewing Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Molson Coors and was driven by new legislation enacted this year in the U.S. First half underlying equity earnings in the U.S. segment, which was not significantly affected by the timing of beer shipments, increased 9.4%.
In Canada, STRs declined 0.1%, and our sales volume declined 0.8% in the second quarter. Weak economic conditions in western Canada were largely offset by favorable timing of the Canada Day holiday this year. Net sales per hectoliter in local currency increased 1.2% in the quarter despite competitive pressures in the east and a pronounced consumer shift of value brands in Alberta. 
In core brands, although Coors Light volumes declined our new packaging advertising impacts sales promotions are driving improved consumer purchase intent and brand health scores. Molson Canadian volume suffered from a significant shift towards the value segment in Alberta. In Above Premium and craft, we continue to see strong performance with Coors Banquet, Belgian Moon, Mad Jack, Heineken, Dos Equis and cider all grew volume and share in the quarter along with our Creemore Springs craft brands. 
And headline financial results for the quarter, Canada underlying pretax income decreased 19.7% in constant currency, primarily due to a significant increase in sales and marketing investment as we discussed in our last earnings call. 
Looking at the first half of the same basis underlying pretax income decreased 10.1%, also driven primarily by increased brand investments. Our Europe business achieved 1.6% volume growth and increased market share across the region, driven by growth in 7 of our 11 lead core and premium brands. Net sales revenue per hectoliter increased 1.3% in local currency, driven entirely by brand and geographic mix. In core brands, Carling, Bergenbier and all grew share of segment in their primary markets. And our Above Premium portfolio increased momentum with strong double-digit growth by Coors Light and our craft portfolio, including Blue Moon, Doom Bar and other Sharp's brands. Finally, the inclusion of Rekorderlig Cider since the middle of 2015 and the dollar repatriation of the Staropramen brand in the U.K. this year added to the solid progress we made in premiumizing our Europe portfolio. Consistent with the first quarter, underlying pretax income was lower in the quarter due to higher brand investments and amortization expenses, lower net pension benefit and the termination of the Heineken arrangements in the U.K. along with unfavorable foreign currency movements of this quarter. Our International business grew Coors Light at strong double-digit rate in the second quarter, driven by Latin America, including our brand launch in Colombia late last year. Overall volume including royalty volume declined 9.3%, driven by the enactment of alcohol prohibition in Bihar in India, the transfer of Staropramen in the U.K. to our Europe segment and the volume impact of our substantial China restructure. Underlying pretax performance improved in the second quarter, and drivers included volume growth in Latin America and Japan, favorable sales mix as well as lower price promotion and overhead expenses related to the restructure of our China business last year including cycling $3.6 million of price promotion expense a year ago.
Now I'll turn over to Mauricio to give second quarter financial highlights and perspective for the balance of 2016. Mauricio?"

As a reminder, all of the results that I will be discussing are in U.S. dollars, unless I note otherwise. Our second quarter financial headlines are as follows. Net sales were down approximately 2% in U.S. dollars due to currency movements. On a constant currency basis, net sales increased 1.9% driven by Europe, Canada and international. Our net sales per hectoliter increased 2.4% in constant currency due to positive mix. On a U.S. GAAP basis we reported pretax income of $196.9 million, 32.1% lower than a year ago. While after-tax income from continuing operations attributable to Molson Coors was $174.1 million, down 24.1% from the prior year result. These decreases were primarily due to noncash special charges and other noncore expenses related to our pending acquisition, the alcohol prohibition in Bihar and the planned brewery closures along with higher MG&A expenses. Underlying pretax income in constant currency decreased 6.9% in the quarter and 8.6% on a reported basis, partly due to year-over-year differences in the timing of brand investments and other expenses as well as lower worldwide volume. First half results eliminate some of these quarterly timing differences and reflected 3.4% growth in constant currency underlying pretax income and 2% growth on a reported basis in U.S. dollars. 
Second quarter underlying after-tax income decreased 9.2% to $239.5 million or $1.11 per diluted share, driven by lower worldwide volume, higher brand investments in all of our businesses and the negative foreign currency movements, which are partially offset by a positive mix, lower underlying net interest expense and higher underlying U.S. equity income. Underlying EBITDA in the quarter was $428.7 million. That is 5.8% lower than a year ago, while our first half underlying EBITDA grew 1.2%. Underlying free cash flow in the first half of 2016 was $158.9 million. This represents a decrease of $82.2 million from the prior year, primarily driven by lower underlying after-tax income, negative foreign currency and less benefit from working capital changes, excluding special and other noncore items, including higher cash paid for taxes. In early July, we completed a $7 billion long-term debt offering with a weighted average coupon of 2.9%, including the lowest 30-year BBB- coupon ever issued in U.S. dollars as well as a 1.25% coupon for our 8-year euro debt issuance. As a result of these attractive rates, we anticipate that our annualized interest cost on the transaction financing will be approximately $260 [ph] million at current interest and foreign exchange rates. This annual interest expense is nearly $200 million lower than the assumed bridge loan and other transaction-related interest expense included in the 2015 pro forma financial results that we filed in May. With the debt offering, we achieved broad high-quality investor participation and attractive pricing. More than 400 institutional investors participated in the offering. Combining this debt issue with our $2.6 billion equity offering in February and up to $3 billion of a previously arranged term loan, we now have in place all the financing needed for the pending MillerCoors transaction. 
Total debt at the end of the second quarter was $3 billion, which does not include the $7 billion of long-term debt we issued in July. Cash and cash equivalents totaled slightly less than $3 billion, resulting in net debt of $37 million, which is significantly lower than prior year due to the cash proceeds received from our equity offering earlier in the year. Please see the earnings release distributed earlier this morning for a detailed review of our business unit financial results in the quarter.
Now looking forward to the remainder of 2016 following some factors to consider for the last 2 quarters of this year. Incremental Europe brand amortization expense with an annualized impact of approximately $50 [ph] million, which began in the fourth quarter of 2015 along with lower net pension benefits in Europe this year. A total prohibition on the sale of alcohol an expectedly plummeted by the state government in Bihar in early April. We don't know how long this band will be in place, and we expect this development to present a headwind for our International business for the foreseeable future or until it is overturned. And finally foreign currency translation which at current exchange rates would be headwind of about $13 million to our underlying pretax results in the second half this year with most of the impact in Europe. Given the recent volatility of our key foreign currencies, particularly the British pound, it is important to watch these rates closely. Regarding 2016 guidance, all of the following metrics exclude any effects of the MillerCoors and Miller global brands transaction, the timing of which will have a big impact on virtually all of our guidance measures. For the full year, we continue to expect cash contributions to our defined benefit pension plans to be in the range of $45 million to $65 million in 2016 and pension expense of approximately $17 million, including our 42% of MillerCoors contribution and expense; MG&A expense in corporate of approximately $120 million on an underlying basis, which excludes expenses related to our pending transaction; consolidated net interest expense of approximately $110 million on an underlying basis, which excludes transaction-related  interest expense and income; and underlying effective tax rate in the range of 18% to 22% assuming no further changes in tax loss, settlement of tax audits or adjustments to our uncertain tax positions. In updated guidance, we now expect underlying capital spending of approximately $220 million, which excludes capital this year related to the construction of our new brewery in British Columbia. As far as our cost outlook is concerned, we continue to expect the cost of goods sold per hectoliter in Canada and Europe in local currency to increase a low single-digit rate for the full year 2016. We now expect 2016 MillerCoors COGS per hectoliter to decrease at a low single-digit rate versus prior year. Further cost reductions including acceleration of some of our cost savings initiatives and changes in sales mix drove the change from previous guidance of approximately in line. We now expect our international COGS per hectoliter to increase at a double-digit rate for 2016. This is up from a high single-digit increase previously due to geographic mix changes. We continue to expect annual cost savings for this year and next year to be in the range of $50 million to $70 million. This excludes cost savings for MillerCoors as well as synergies resulting from the pending MillerCoors acquisition, which we expect to be $200 million by year 4 following the transaction close. Finally, here are the most recent volume trends for each of our businesses early in the third quarter. 
In the U.S. for the 3 weeks through July 23, STRs decreased at a mid-single-digit rate, partially due to the timing of the loading for the July 4 holiday while they decreased at a high single-digit rate in Canada for the same period. In Europe, volumes through July 25 decreased high single digits. And our international sales volume, including royalty volume through July 23, decreased at a low single-digit rate, primarily due to the alcohol prohibition in Bihar. As ever, please keep in mind these numbers represent only a portion of the current quarter, and trends could change in the weeks ahead. Also as a reminder, following the close of the pending MillerCoors transaction, we plan to discontinue providing these early next quarter volume trends.
At this point, I'll turn it back over to Mark for outlook, wrap-up and the Q&A. Mark?"

In the second half of this year, we will continue to drive our First Choice for consumer and customer agenda in the geographies and segments where we choose to play, ensuring built up broader, stronger and more premium portfolio while driving best-in-class customer service and partnerships. In the U.S., MillerCoors remains laser focused on the strategy to drive total volume growth by 2019. For the first time in many years, our largest business is in line with its volume expectations for the first 6 months. The quarter also provides additional steps towards its growth ambition with strength in marketing behind flagship brands, Coors Light and Miller Lite, and we're starting to see the positive impact. Also, we continue to see success in the innovation space. in Above Premium, we remain bullish in the potential of Henry's as the hard soda category continues to grow. In the second quarter, Henry's became the #1 hard soda franchise. The MillerCoors plans to roll out Henry's hard cherry cola later this month. In segment, MillerCoors will continue to invest support for Blue Moon and Leinenkugel during the balance of the peak year selling season. MillerCoors also recently announced that it had agreed to purchase majority interest of Oregon-based Hot Valley brewing company and to increase its ownership of the Georgia-based and beer company from an minority stake to a majority interest. These are highly regarded brewers both in the region and nationwide and further strengthen U.S. craft portfolio, which also includes Blue Moon, Leinenkugel's and Saint Archer. Additionally, next month at its fall meeting with distributors, the U.S. team will share plans to improve the performance of Below Premium portfolio. And the team continues to expand its Building with Beer retail strategy beyond on premise the additional channels to build First Choice customer partnerships. The changes standing in the MillerCoors ownership structured the not one of apprehension but excitement. In the meantime, everyone at MillerCoors remains discipline, decisive and accountable for growing our business, transforming our portfolio and driving shareholder value. In Canada, we are investing behind the new product quality focused advertising and improved sales execution by our field sales management program. These efforts are aimed not only at improving our premium performance also continuing to accelerate our growing Above Premium portfolio. We will continue our position to hard soda space with Mad Jack root beer and ginger ale, the first major hard soda entries in Canada. Additionally, we signed a partnership agreement in May with Brazil de Montréal to leverage its craft and speciality beers in Québec and across the strong Canada distribution network. Following the close of the pending MillerCoors transaction, we're also looking forward to bringing the Miller brands back into our Canada portfolio.
In Europe, we achieved top line and market share growth in the second quarter on the strength of our core and Above Premium brands along with the addition of the Rekorderlig cider and Staropramen brands in the U.K. Increased brand amortization expense will continue to present a headwind for one more quarter, and we'll continue to invest in our core brand portfolio across Europe to continue to grow our share of segment. This will include leveraging our English Premier League sponsorship well beyond Carling in the U.K. to many high-potential brand and market opportunities. We will also continue to premiumize our portfolio with Coors Light, the Sharp's portfolio led by Doom Bar, Rekorderlig and Staropramen in the U.K. as well as Ireland's leading craft brand, Franciscan Well. Our International business is focused on continuing to accelerate our overall growth in existing and select new markets while maintaining profitability in 2016 on a constant currency basis versus the original 2013 commitment, now excluding the impact of the Bihar alcohol prohibition. Upon closing of the MillerCoors transaction, we will integrate the Miller International brands into our portfolio and leverage a footprint that complements our growth strategy and allows us to gain entrance into high-priority markets while increasing our business scale in current markets. We will also continue to drive rapid growth from Coors Light in Latin America. Going forward, Coors Miller and Staropramen brands will be the priorities for our international brand portfolio. And in India, we will continue to add scale through our Mount Shivalik business.
To wrap up, in the second half of 2016, we will continue to focus on our First Choice for consumer and customer ambition, all driven through our capital charge lens and with the intent to drive total shareholder returns.

Central to that the quality the breadth and depth of our brand portfolio and our ability to premiumize our portfolio while building our customer relationship. So we made good on the commitment to step up our investment through the second quarter. I think if you look at our NSR per hectoliter, we saw per hec growth in all of our regions. I'm encouraged by the sequential improvement in our share trends and all of our regions as well from Q1 into Q2. But clearly, brand building is a long-term game. And my objective and the executive objective here is to continue to invest in a sustained way. Clearly, the focus is always in the quality of our investments I'd rather spend less dollars in a great than more idea on a bad idea, but our job is to develop great ideas and then invest in a sustained way.

But obviously 2 pieces to margins, Judy. The NSR, which we were quite pleased, was broadly in line with the underlying trend in Q1, really was driven by the COGS. And if you look at what happened in cost of goods sold in the second half, we broadly offset our inflation with cost savings. And the increase you see there was the increase in some of our marketing investments for impact promotions, which go in case. So that was investment behind the brands. You saw some impact from transactional FX and volume deleverage. But I would look at the first half and say, if you look at the first half, actually, we had an improvement in COGS of about 0.7%. So hopefully that helps."

Volumes are up 1.6%, and NSR per hectoliter up [ph] 1.3%. So I think that's a reasonably good balance. It is true that the NSR per hectoliter was driven by mix with price under pressure but, that goes back to our to strategy we've been trying to make sure that we invest behind the premium brands to drive the right both portfolio and geographic mix. So whilst pricing is under pressure across many of the markets, I think we're doing a pretty solid job in recognizing that and driving volumes and shares and mix to get to an overall positive revenue growth.

And the money that we put behind commercial really went to 3 places. It went to invest behind our growing Above Premium portfolio, which is continue to grow share. So I think that's very sticky. Those brands have continued to grow. Coors Banquet turned in a better than 20% growth again this quarter. I think the second piece is we put money behind our big brands relative to in case promotions. And I think last year we had some concerns that we weren't competitive. I think this year, we were well-balanced, and I think that was a positive. And then on the third the investment, we pushed investment behind our share of voice. We were underindexing. And together with really effective advertising copy, we've seen that continue to grow our brand scores. So growing brand scores is a great telltale sign that you're spending money in the right place.

So outside of the Czech market, and we're seeing double-digit growth in many of those markets. My personal perspective is in a greater Europe basis, there's still a lot of runway ahead of us. And one of the changes I announced in the last couple of weeks, Mark, is we look at our European business including our export and license market, and one of the benefits from that is we have a more holistic Europe approach across all markets in Staropramen. Outside of Europe, that's part of our thinking and our emerging planning ahead of integration. Staropramen's currently in Canada. We're just going to testing and incubating the brand of their the U.S. marketplace is slightly more context because of the distributor relationship with importer relationship that we inherited when we acquired the business. We're working our way through that and his broader conversation with Gavin, and the team really looking at where we want to place our bets on our important part for you going forward recognizing we have an embarrassment of Richie's and Staropramen potentially in the future. So that's work that were currently thinking our way through just now. But in terms of the Staropramen, which is lets call it Greater Europe very, very solid progress in Ukraine, which is a really difficult market, we continue to take share there.

On behalf of Molson Coors Brewing Company, thank you for joining us today for our second quarter 2016 follow-up earnings conference call. Our goal on this call is to address as many additional earnings related questions as possible following our regular earnings conference call with Mark Hunter, Mauricio Restrepo and our business unit CEOs earlier today. We will use a standard question and answer format and we anticipate that the call will last less than an hour. 
Before we begin, I will paraphrase the company's safe harbor language. Some of the discussion today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from what the company projects today, so please refer to our most recent 10-K and 10-Q filings for a more complete description of factors that could affect the these projections. The company does not undertake to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they're made. 
Regarding any non-U.S. GAAP measures that may be discussed during the call and, from time to time, by our company's executives in discussing our performance, please visit the company's website, molsoncoors.com, that's www.molsoncoors.com, and click on the Financial Reporting tab at the Investor Relations page for a reconciliation of these measures to the nearest U.S. GAAP result. Also, unless otherwise indicated, all financial results the company discusses are versus the comparable prior year period and in U.S. dollars. We also encourage investors and analysts to read SABMiller PLC news releases and trading statements that include financial and other information relating to the MillerCoors joint venture. 
So let's get started with an introduction of the team with me on this call. We have Kevin Kim, Investor Relations Senior Manager; Ashley Dunlop, Finance Forecasting Senior Manager; Brian Tabolt, Controller; Jason, Treasury Director; and Mark, VP of Tax. 
So regarding quarterly results, as Mark Hunter mentioned on our regular earnings call this morning, in the second quarter, we continued to focus on our first choice ambition and on building a stronger, broader and more premium brand portfolio, underpinned by incremental sales and marketing investments as we discussed on our first quarter earnings call a few months ago. Progress in the quarter included net sales revenue per [indiscernible] growth on a constant currency basis in all of our businesses, included strong Coors Light growth globally, improved core brand momentum, fast-growing innovations in key markets and strong Above Premium growth globally. We significantly increased investments behind our brands, although the timing of shipments and other short term factors held back bottom line performance in the quarter. 
In brands, Coors Light grew volume more than 4% globally, including strong double-digit growth in Europe and Latin America and low single-digit growth in the U.S., this brand's best performance here in nearly 3 years. We continued to strengthen our business through improvements through our sales execution and revenue management capabilities, increased efficiency of our operations and implementation of global -- common global system. To ensure that our supply chain is fit for the future, in the second quarter, we reached an agreement to purchase land in British Columbia on which we will build a new efficient and flexible brewery over the next few years. This new brewery site is attractively priced, has rail access and is situated on the TransCanada Highway, making it ideal for serving the Western Canada and U.S. markets. We anticipate completing the land purchase this month. 
In the past few months, we've also made substantial progress on the pending MillerCoors transaction, including an integration planning and completing the necessary financing at very attractive rates. Investor demand for our recent debt offering was very strong, in we achieved record and near record low interest rates on our debt issue. We're pleased with the transaction progress made to date and we continue to plan for a closing before the end of 2016. 
In the balance of this year, we will continue to focus on our first choice for consumers and customers ambition, all driven through our Profit After Capital Charge and with the intent to drive total shareholder returns. 
So with that, I'd like to open it up for your questions. Over to you, Chris."

I mean, it really gets back to what Mark was talking about on the earlier -- Gavin on the earlier call and that is, with only 3 weeks of data, relatively small changes in the timing of holidays in weather in various regions around the U.S. and so forth can have a disproportionate effect on those numbers and cause really quite a bit of volatility. And we've seen that pretty frequently over the many, call it, 27 years we've been providing those data points. And that actually limits their usefulness and in this particular time frame, call it, early July, you have the largest holiday of the year right on the edge of that time period, July 4, obviously in the U.S. And then if you're wondering about Canada, you've got the Canada Day holiday on July 1. Just -- yes, simply, a lot of volatility in the numbers. I think longer-term view of volume trends and brand health and so forth, they are actually more useful and that's why we talked about discontinuing those numbers upon or following completion of the transaction."

They actually have performed very well. What has been really quite different from what we expected is actually the -- what you call it, the actual backdrop, the macroeconomic challenges of that Eurozone are obviously pretty well documented, but the actual performance of the businesses themselves have been quite good. We've had localized challenges in places like Serbia that we talked about. Originally, Romania was a particularly challenging market for us. And we've been able to make great progress in Romania and I would say meaningful progress in Serbia. The one thing that we did not anticipate when we did the transaction was the speed with which we would be able to combine the U.K. business with the Central Europe businesses. And that has allowed us to vastly increase the, call it, synergies or efficiencies of the overall Europe operating unit. And so we've had challenges like plugs, we've had macroeconomic challenges and so forth, but nonetheless, the business has performed really well and we've been able to vastly exceed our expectations for cost savings. And also, list some best practices out of the central Europe business too. Some of our other businesses, for example, our sales processes, we're now embedding in our Canada business. They've already been essentially lifted and shifted to our U.K. business. These have helped us to improve our efficiency and effectiveness in sales -- in the sales force in those geographies and obviously, there's more potential to do that going forward."

On behalf of Molson Coors Brewing Company, thank you for joining us today for our Second Quarter 2016 Follow-Up Earnings Conference Call. Our goal in this call is to address as many additional earnings-related questions as possible following our regular earnings conference call with Mark Hunter, Mauricio Restrepo and our business unit CEOs earlier today. We will use a standard question-and-answer format, and we anticipate that the call will last less than an hour. 
Before we begin, I will paraphrase the company's safe harbor language. Some of the discussion today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from what the company projects today, so please refer to our most recent 10-K and 10-Q filings for a more complete description of factors that could affect these projections. The company does not undertake to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they're made. 
Regarding any non-U.S. GAAP measures that may be discussed during the call, and from time to time, by our company's executives in discussing our performance, please visit the company's website, molsoncoors.com, that's www.molsoncoors.com, and click on the Financial Reporting tab of the Investor Relations page for a reconciliation of these measures to the nearest U.S. GAAP result. Also, unless otherwise indicated, all financial results the company discusses are versus the comparable prior year period and in U.S. dollars. We also encourage investors and analysts to read SABMiller plc news releases and trading statements that include financial and other information relating to the MillerCoors joint venture. 
So let's get started with an introduction of the team with me on this call. We have Kevin Kim, Investor Relations Senior Manager; Ashley Dunlop, Finance Forecasting Senior Manager; Brian Tabolt, Controller; Jason Charpentier, Treasury Director; and Mark Saks, VP of Tax. 
So regarding quarterly results, as Mark Hunter mentioned on our regular earnings call this morning, in the second quarter, we continued to focus on our First Choice ambition and on building a stronger, broader and more premium brand portfolio, underpinned by incremental sales and marketing investments, as we discussed on our first quarter earnings call a few months ago. Progress in the quarter included net sales revenue per hectoliter growth on a constant currency basis in all of our businesses. That included strong Coors Light growth globally, improved core brand momentum, fast-growing innovations in key markets and strong Above Premium growth globally. We significantly increased investments behind our brands, although the timing of shipments and other short-term factors held back bottom line performance in the quarter. 
In brands, Coors Light grew volume more than 4% globally, including strong double-digit growth in Europe and Latin America and low single-digit growth in the U.S., this brand's best performance here in nearly 3 years. We continued to strengthen our business through improvements to our sales execution and revenue management capabilities, increased efficiency of our operations and implementation of global -- common global system. To ensure that our supply chain is fit for the future, in the second quarter, we reached an agreement to purchase land in British Columbia on which we will build a new efficient and flexible brewery over the next few years. This new brewery site is attractively priced, has rail access and is situated on the TransCanada Highway, making it ideal for serving the Western Canada and U.S. markets. We anticipate completing the land purchase this month. 
In the past few months, we've also made substantial progress on the pending MillerCoors transaction, including an integration planning and completing the necessary financing at very attractive rates. Investor demand for our recent debt offering was very strong,  and we achieved record and near record low interest rates on our debt issue. We're pleased with the transaction progress made to date, and we continue to plan for a closing before the end of 2016. 
In the balance of this year, we will continue to focus on our First Choice for consumers and customers' ambition, all driven through our Profit After Capital Charge lens and with the intent to drive total shareholder returns. 
So with that, I'd like to open it up for your questions. Over to you, Kris."

And in this particular time frame, call it, early July, you have the largest holiday of the year right on the edge of that time period, July 4 obviously in the U.S. And then if you're wondering about Canada, you've got the Canada Day holiday on July 1. So just -- yes, simply, a lot of volatility in the numbers. I think longer-term view of volume trends and brand health and so forth, they're actually more useful, and that's why we've talked about discontinuing those numbers upon or following completion of the transaction."

What has been really quite different from what we expected is actually the -- what you call it, the actual backdrop, the macroeconomic challenges of that Eurozone, which are obviously pretty well documented. But the actual performance of the businesses themselves has been quite good. And we've had localized challenges in places like Serbia that we talked about. Originally, Romania was a particularly challenging market for us, and we've been able to make great progress in Romania and I would say meaningful progress in Serbia. The one thing that we did not anticipate when we did the transaction was the speed with which we would be able to combine the U.K. business with the Central Europe businesses. And that has allowed us to vastly increase the, call it, synergies or efficiencies of the overall Europe operating unit. And so we've had challenges like floods. We've had macroeconomic challenges and so forth. But nonetheless, the business has performed really well, and we've been able to vastly exceed our expectations for cost savings and also list some best practices out of the Central Europe business too. Some of our other businesses, for example, our sales processes we're now embedding in our Canada business, they've already been essentially lifted and shifted to our U.K. business. These have helped us to improve our efficiency and effectiveness in sales -- in the sales force in those geographies, and obviously, there's more potential to do that going forward."

On behalf of Molson Coors Brewing Company, thank you for joining us today for our Second Quarter 2016 Follow-Up Earnings Conference Call. Our goal in this call is to address as many additional earnings-related questions as possible following our regular earnings conference call with Mark Hunter, Mauricio Restrepo and our business unit CEOs earlier today. We will use a standard question-and-answer format, and we anticipate that the call will last less than an hour. 
Before we begin, I will paraphrase the company's safe harbor language. Some of the discussion today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from what the company projects today, so please refer to our most recent 10-K and 10-Q filings for a more complete description of factors that could affect these projections. The company does not undertake to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they're made. 
Regarding any non-U.S. GAAP measures that may be discussed during the call, and from time to time, by our company's executives in discussing our performance, please visit the company's website, molsoncoors.com, that's www.molsoncoors.com, and click on the Financial Reporting tab of the Investor Relations page for a reconciliation of these measures to the nearest U.S. GAAP result. Also, unless otherwise indicated, all financial results the company discusses are versus the comparable prior year period and in U.S. dollars. We also encourage investors and analysts to read SABMiller plc news releases and trading statements that include financial and other information relating to the MillerCoors joint venture. 
So let's get started with an introduction of the team with me on this call. We have Kevin Kim, Investor Relations Senior Manager; Ashley Dunlop, Finance Forecasting Senior Manager; Brian Tabolt, Controller; Jason Charpentier, Treasury Director; and Mark Saks, VP of Tax. 
So regarding quarterly results, as Mark Hunter mentioned on our regular earnings call this morning, in the second quarter, we continued to focus on our First Choice ambition and on building a stronger, broader and more premium brand portfolio, underpinned by incremental sales and marketing investments, as we discussed on our first quarter earnings call a few months ago. Progress in the quarter included net sales revenue per hectoliter growth on a constant currency basis in all of our businesses. That included strong Coors Light growth globally, improved core brand momentum, fast-growing innovations in key markets and strong Above Premium growth globally. We significantly increased investments behind our brands, although the timing of shipments and other short-term factors held back bottom line performance in the quarter. 
In brands, Coors Light grew volume more than 4% globally, including strong double-digit growth in Europe and Latin America and low single-digit growth in the U.S., this brand's best performance here in nearly 3 years. We continued to strengthen our business through improvements to our sales execution and revenue management capabilities, increased efficiency of our operations and implementation of global -- common global systems. To ensure that our supply chain is fit for the future, in the second quarter, we reached an agreement to purchase land in British Columbia on which we will build a new efficient and flexible brewery over the next few years. This new brewery site is attractively priced, has rail access and is situated on the TransCanada Highway, making it ideal for serving the Western Canada and U.S. markets. We anticipate completing the land purchase this month. 
In the past few months, we've also made substantial progress on the pending MillerCoors transaction, including an integration planning and completing the necessary financing at very attractive rates. Investor demand for our recent debt offering was very strong,  and we achieved record and near record low interest rates on our debt issue. We're pleased with the transaction progress made to date, and we continue to plan for a closing before the end of 2016. 
In the balance of this year, we will continue to focus on our First Choice for consumers and customers' ambition, all driven through our Profit After Capital Charge lens and with the intent to drive total shareholder returns. 
So with that, I'd like to open it up for your questions. Over to you, Kris."

But the actual performance of the businesses themselves has been quite good. And we've had localized challenges in places like Serbia that we talked about. Originally, Romania was a particularly challenging market for us, and we've been able to make great progress in Romania and I would say meaningful progress in Serbia. The one thing that we did not anticipate when we did the transaction was the speed with which we would be able to combine the U.K. business with the Central Europe businesses. And that has allowed us to vastly increase the, call it, synergies or efficiencies of the overall Europe operating unit. And so we've had challenges like floods. We've had macroeconomic challenges and so forth. But nonetheless, the business has performed really well, and we've been able to vastly exceed our expectations for cost savings and also list some best practices out of the Central Europe business too. Some of our other businesses, for example, our sales processes we're now embedding in our Canada business, they've already been essentially lifted and shifted to our U.K. business. These have helped us to improve our efficiency and effectiveness in sales -- in the sales force in those geographies, and obviously, there's more potential to do that going forward."

Apologies for that slight delay due to technical issue. Many thanks for joining us today. 
With me on the call this morning from Molson Coors, we have Mauricio Restrepo, our Global CFO; Gavin Hattersley, the CEO of Miller Coors; Stewart Glendinning, the CEO of Canada; Simon Cox, our European CEO; Kandy Anand, our International CEO; Lee Reichert, our Deputy General Counsel; Brian Tabolt our Global Controller; and Dave Dunnewald, the VP of Investor Relations.
For our earnings call today, Mauricio and I will take you through the highlights of our second quarter 2016 results for Molson Coors Brewing Company along with some perspective on the second half of 2016.
In the second quarter, we continued to focus on our First Choice ambition and in building a stronger, broader and more premium brand portfolio, underpinned by incremental sales and marketing investment, as we discussed on our first quarter earnings call. Progress in the second quarter included net sales revenue per hectoliter growth on a constant currency basis in all of our businesses, strong Coors Light growth globally, improved core brand momentum, fast-growing innovations in key markets and strong Above Premium growth globally. 
We significantly increased investments behind our brands although the timing of shipments and other short-term factors held back bottom line performance in the quarter. In brands, Coors Light grew volume more than 4% globally, including strong double-digit growth in Europe and Latin America and low single digit growth in the U.S., its best performance year in nearly 3 years. 
In Above Premium, our craft portfolio drove growth, from Doom Bar and other Sharp's brands in the U.K. from Creemore Springs and Belgian Moon in Canada and from Leinenkugel's Grapefruit Shandy and the newly acquired Saint Archer in the U.S. 
Staropramen grew strongly across Europe outside of its home market. And in ciders, we grew volume at Rekorderlig in Europe and Strongbow Canada. In flavored malt beverages, we now have the largest hard soda franchise in the U.S. with the successful introduction of the Henry's Hard Soda brands earlier this year. 
We continue to strengthen our business through improvements through sales execution and revenue management capabilities, increased efficiency of our operations and implementation of common global systems. To ensure that our supply chain is fit for the future, in the second quarter, we reached an agreement to purchase land in British Columbia on which we will build a new efficient and flexible brewery over the next few years. This new brewery site is attractively priced, has real access and is situated in the Trans-Canada Highway, making it ideal for serving the Western Canada and U.S. markets, and we anticipate completing the land purchase this month.
In the past few months, we have also made substantial progress in the pending MillerCoors transaction, including an integration planning and completing the necessary financing at very attractive rates. Investor demand for our recent debt offering was very strong, and we achieved record and near-record low interest rates on our debt issue. We're pleased with the transaction progress made to date, and we continue to plan for closing before the end of 2016, more specifically, October 10 based on the joint ABI-SAB recent announcement.
We're very excited to be much closer to completing this game-changing transaction, which will enable simplified decision-making and will reduce t  complexities of dual ownership. It will help us to become a more integrated and efficient brewer, and it will enable us to become a more effective competitor as a single owner promoting consumer choice in an increasingly diverse and fast-growing brewing industry. 
As part of integration planning process, last week, I announced some leadership appointments that will strengthen our combined organization, and it will take effect upon the close of the transaction. Our transaction and its timing remain dependent clearly on the completion of the ABI and SABMiller transaction. 
The regional highlights for the second quarter are as follows: 
In the U.S., while overall sales to retail volume decreased 1.7%, driven primarily by our Below Premium brands, Coors Light STRs were up low single digits in the quarter, which was its best quarterly performance since the fourth quarter of 2012. Domestic net revenue per hectoliter grew 0.7% for the quarter as a result of favorable pricing and positive sales mix. 
Our largest brand gained share of the Premium Light segment for the fifth consecutive quarter. And please note that all of our performance discussions related to -- relating to Coors Light exclude the Citrus Radler extension that was discontinued last year. With flat STRs, Miller Lite gained share of the Premium Light segment for the seventh consecutive quarter. Improved momentum for these 2 brands was driven by continued rollout of the new visual identities and consumer communications, which appeal to a broad section of men and women, millennials and multicultural consumers. Additionally, Coors Banquet is now on its 10th consecutive year of growth. 
In the higher-margin Above Premium segment, Henry's was the #1 hard soda franchise in the second quarter and the strength of Henry's Hard Orange and Ginger Ale. In craft, Leinenkugel's Grapefruit Shandy and the newly-acquired Saint Archer brands continued to drive volume, although Blue Moon Belgian White declined low single digits. 
As an important indication of the traction we are gaining in the U.S., for the first time in the history of the joint venture, in 2016, MillerCoors finished #1 in the Tamron supplier survey, which pooled hundreds of U.S. distributors in rating the performance of beer, wine and spirits suppliers. This is a key accomplishment in our First Choice ambition for our customers and is an example of the type of efforts we are driving globally to ensure we are focusing on these important customer relationships. 
On the bottom line, MillerCoors' second quarter underlying net income declined 3.8% to $468.8 million, driven primarily by the timing of shipments due to calendar shifts, which were partially offset by lower cost of goods sold, higher net pricing and positive sales mix. Meanwhile, Molson Coors' second quarter underlying equity income in the U.S. segment increased 1.4% due to an $11.1 million anticipated refund of federal excise tax paid on imports. This tax refund is based on qualifying volumes exported from the U.S. by the Coors Brewing Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Molson Coors, and was driven by new legislation enacted this year in the U.S. First half underlying equity earnings in the U.S. segment, which was not significantly affected by the timing of beer shipments, increased 9.4%.
In Canada, STRs declined 0.1%, and our sales volume declined 0.8% in the second quarter. Weak economic conditions in Western Canada were largely offset by favorable timing of the Canada Day holiday this year. Net sales per hectoliter in local currency increased 1.2% in the quarter despite competitive pressures in the East and a pronounced consumer shift to value brands in Alberta. 
In core brands, although Coors Light volumes declined, our new packaging, advertising and impact sales promotions are driving improved consumer purchase intent and brand health scores. Molson Canadian volume suffered from a significant shift towards the value segment in Alberta. 
In Above Premium and craft, we continue to see strong performance as Coors Banquet, Belgian Moon, Mad Jack, Heineken, Dos Equis, Sol and Strongbow Cider all grew volume and share in the quarter, along with our Creemore Springs craft brands. 
In headline financial results for the quarter, Canada underlying pretax income decreased 19.7% in constant currency, primarily due to a significant increase in sales and marketing investment, as we discussed on our last earnings call. 
Looking at the first half on the same basis, underlying pretax income decreased 10.1%, also driven primarily by increased brand investments. 
Our Europe business achieved 1.6% volume growth and increased market share across the region, driven by growth in 7 of our 11 lead core and premium brands. Net sales revenue per hectoliter increased 1.3% in local currency, driven entirely by brand and geographic mix. In core brands, Carling, Bergenbier and Ozujsko all grew share of segment in their primary markets. And our Above Premium portfolio increased momentum with strong double digit growth by Coors Light and our craft portfolio, including Blue Moon, Doom Bar and the other Sharp's brands. 
Finally, the inclusion of Rekorderlig Cider since the middle of 2015 and the full  repatriation of the Staropramen brand in the U.K. this year added to the solid progress we made in premium-izing our Europe portfolio. 
Consistent with the first quarter, underlying pretax income was lower in the quarter due to higher brand investments and amortization expenses, lower net pension benefit and the termination of the Heineken contract brewing arrangements in the U.K. along with unfavorable foreign currency movements of this quarter. 
Our International business grew Coors Light at a strong double digit rate in the second quarter, driven by Latin America, including our brand launch in Colombia late last year. Overall, volume, including royalty volume, declined 9.3%, driven by the enactment of alcohol prohibition in Bihar in India, the transfer of Staropramen in the U.K. to our Europe segment and the volume impact of our substantial China restructure. 
Underlying pretax performance improved in the second quarter, and drivers included volume growth in Latin America and Japan, favorable sales mix, as well as lower price promotion and overhead expenses related to the restructure of our China business last year, including cycling $3.6 million of price promotion expense a year ago.
Now I'll turn over to Mauricio to give second quarter financial highlights and perspective on the balance of 2016. Mauricio?"

As a reminder, all of the results that I will be discussing are in U.S. dollars, unless I note otherwise. Our second quarter financial headlines are as follows: Net sales were down approximately 2% in U.S. dollar",1268,"Thank you, Mark, and hello, everybody. As a reminder, all of the results that I will be discussing are in U.S. dollars, unless I note otherwise. 
Our second quarter financial headlines are as follows: 
Net sales were down approximately 2% in U.S. dollars due to currency movements. On a constant currency basis, net sales increased 1.9%, driven by Europe, Canada and International. Our net sales per hectoliter increased 2.4% in constant currency due to positive mix. 
On a U.S. GAAP basis, we reported pretax income of $196.9 million, 32.1% lower than a year ago. While after-tax income from continuing operations attributable to Molson Coors was $174.1 million, down 24.1% from the prior year result. These decreases were primarily due to noncash special charges and other noncore expenses related to our pending acquisition, the alcohol prohibition in Bihar and planned brewery closures, along with higher MG&A expenses. 
Underlying pretax income in constant currency decreased 6.9% in the quarter and 8.6% on a reported basis, partly due to year-over-year differences in the timing of brand investments and other expenses as well as lower worldwide volume. First half results eliminate some of these quarterly timing differences and reflected 3.4% growth in constant currency, underlying pretax income and 2% growth on a reported basis in U.S. dollars. 
Second quarter underlying after-tax income decreased 9.2% to $239.5 million or $1.11 per diluted share, driven by lower worldwide volume, higher brand investments in all of our businesses and the negative foreign currency movements, which were partially offset by positive mix, lower underlying net interest expense and higher underlying U.S. equity income. Underlying EBITDA in the quarter was $428.7 million. That is 5.8% lower than a year ago. While our first half underlying EBITDA grew 1.2%. Underlying free cash flow in the first half of 2016 was $158.9 million. This represents a decrease of $82.2 million from the prior year, primarily driven by lower underlying after-tax income, negative foreign currency and less benefit from working capital changes, excluding special and other noncore items, including higher cash paid for taxes. 
In early July, we completed a $7 billion long-term debt offering with a weighted average coupon of 2.9%, including the lowest 30-year BBB- coupon ever issued in U.S. dollars as well as a 1.25% coupon for our 8-year euro debt issue. As a result of these attractive rates, we anticipate that our annualized interest cost on the transaction financing will be approximately $260 million at current interest and foreign exchange rates. This annual interest expense is nearly $200 million lower than the assumed bridge loan and other transaction-related interest expense included in the 2015 pro forma financial results that we filed in May. 
With the debt offering, we achieved broad high-quality investor participation and attractive pricing. More than 400 institutional investors participated in the offering. 
Combining this debt issue with our $2.6 billion equity offering in February and up to $3 billion of a previously arranged term loan, we now have in place all the financing needed for the pending MillerCoors transaction. 
Total debt at the end of the second quarter was $3 billion, which does not include the $7 billion of long-term debt we issued in July. Cash and cash equivalents totaled slightly less than $3 billion, resulting in net debt of $37 million, which is significantly lower than prior year due to the cash proceeds received from our equity offering earlier in the year. Please see the earnings release we distributed earlier this morning for a detailed review of our business unit financial results in the quarter.
Now looking forward to the remainder of 2016, following are some factors to consider for the last 2 quarters of this year. 
Incremental Europe brand amortization expense with an annualized impact of approximately $50 million which began in the fourth quarter of 2015, along with lower net pension benefit in Europe this year. 
A total prohibition on the sale of alcohol unexpectedly implemented by the state government in Bihar in early April. We don't know how long this ban will be in place, and we expect this development to present a headwind for our International business for the foreseeable future or until it is overturned. 
And finally, foreign currency translation, which at current exchange rates, would be a headwind of about $13 million to our underlying pretax results in the second half this year, with most of the impact in Europe. Given the recent volatility of our key foreign currencies, particularly the British pound, it is important to watch these rates closely. 
Regarding 2016 guidance, all of the following metrics exclude any effects of the MillerCoors and Miller global brands transaction, the timing of which will have a big impact on virtually all of our guidance measures. 
For the full year, we continue to expect cash contributions to our defined benefit pension plans to be in the range of $45 million to $65 million in 2016 and pension expense of approximately $17 million, including our 42% of MillerCoors contribution and expense; MG&A expense in corporate of approximately $120 million on an underlying basis, which excludes expenses related to our pending transaction; consolidated net interest expense of approximately $110 million on an underlying basis, which excludes transaction-related  interest expense and income; an underlying effective tax rate in the range of 18% to 22% assuming no further changes in tax loss, settlement of tax audits or adjustments to our uncertain tax positions. 
In updated guidance, we now expect underlying capital spending of approximately $220 million, which excludes capital this year related to the construction of our new brewery in British Columbia. As far as our cost outlook is concerned, we continue to expect the cost of goods sold per hectoliter in Canada and Europe in local currency to increase at a low single digit rate for the full year 2016. We now expect 2016 MillerCoors COGS per hectoliter to decrease at a low single digit rate versus prior year. Further, cost reductions, including acceleration of some of our cost savings initiatives and changes in sales mix drove the change from previous guidance of approximately in line. We now expect our international COGS per hectoliter to increase at a double digit rate for 2016. This is up from a high single digit increase previously due to geographic mix changes. We continue to expect annual cost savings for this year and next year to be in the range of $50 million to $70 million. This view  excludes cost savings from MillerCoors as well as synergies resulting from the pending MillerCoors acquisition which we expect to be $200 million by year 4 following the transaction close. 
Finally, here are the most recent volume trends for each of our businesses early in the third quarter. 
In the U.S., for the 3 weeks through July 23, STRs decreased at a mid single digit rate, partially due to the timing of the load-in for the July 4 holiday while they decreased at a high single digit rate in Canada for the same period. In Europe, volume through July 25 decreased high single digits. And our International sales volume, including royalty volume, through July 23, decreased at a low single digit rate, primarily due to the alcohol prohibition in Bihar. As ever, please keep in mind that these numbers represent only a portion of the current quarter, and trends could change in the weeks ahead. Also as a reminder, following the close of the pending MillerCoors transaction, we plan to discontinue providing these early next quarter volume trends.
At this point, I'll turn it back over to Mark for our outlook, wrap-up and the Q&A. Mark?"

In the second half of this year, we will continue to drive our First Choice for consumer and customer agenda in the geographies and segments where we choose to play, ensuring we build a broader, stronger and a more premium portfolio while driving best-in-class customer service and partnerships. 
In the U.S., MillerCoors remains laser-focused on its strategy to drive total volume growth by 2019. For the first time in many years, our largest business is in line with its volume expectations for the first 6 months. The quarter also provided additional steps towards its growth ambition, with strength in marketing behind flagship brands, Coors Light and Miller Lite, and we're starting to see the positive impact. 
Also we continue to see success in the innovation space. In Above Premium, we remain bullish in the potential of Henry's as the hard soda category continues to grow. In the second quarter, Henry's became the #1 hard soda franchise, and MillerCoors plans to roll out Henry's Hard Cherry Cola this month. 
In the craft segment, MillerCoors will continue to invest buying ad support for Blue Moon and Leinenkugel during the balance of the peak year selling season. MillerCoors also recently announced that it had agreed to purchase a majority interest in Oregon-based Hop Valley Brewing company and to increase its ownership of the Georgia-based Terrapin Beer company from a minority stake to a majority interest. These are highly regarded brewers both in their regions and nationwide, and they further strengthen our leading U.S. craft portfolio, which also includes Blue Moon, Leinenkugel's and Saint Archer. Additionally, next month, at its fall meeting with distributors, the U.S. team will share plans to improve the performance of its Below Premium portfolio. And the team continues to expand its Building with Beer retail strategy beyond on-premise the additional channels to build First Choice customer partnerships.  
With changes pending in the MillerCoors ownership structure, the merger's not one of apprehension, but excitement. In the meantime, everyone at MillerCoors remains discipline, decisive and accountable for growing our business, transforming our portfolio and driving shareholder value. 
In Canada, we are investing behind new product quality-focused advertising and improved sales execution via our field sales management program. These efforts are aimed not only at improving our premium performance, but also continuing to accelerate our growing Above Premium portfolio. We will continue our position in the hard soda space with Mad Jack root beer and ginger ale, the first major hard soda entries in Canada. 
Additionally, we signed a partnership agreement in May with Brasseur de Montréal to leverage its craft and speciality beers in Québec and across our strong Canada distribution network. Following the close of the pending MillerCoors transaction, we're also looking forward to bringing the Miller brands back into our Canada portfolio.
In Europe, we achieved top line and market share growth in the second quarter on the strength of our core and Above Premium brands, along with the addition of the Rekorderlig Cider and Staropramen brands in the U.K. Increased brand amortization expense will continue to present a headwind for one more quarter, and we'll continue to invest in our core brand portfolio across Europe to continue to grow our share of segment. This will include leveraging our English Premier League sponsorship well beyond Carling in the U.K. to many high-potential brand and market opportunities. We will also continue to premium-ize our portfolio with Coors Light, the Sharp's portfolio led by Doom Bar, Cobra, Rekorderlig and Staropramen in the U.K., as well as Ireland's leading craft brand, Franciscan Well. 
Our International business is focused on continuing to accelerate our overall growth in existing and select new markets while attaining profitability in 2016 on a constant currency basis versus our original 2013 commitment, now excluding the impact of the Bihar alcohol prohibition. Upon closing of the MillerCoors transaction, we will integrate the Miller International brands into our portfolio and leverage a footprint that complements our growth strategy and allows us to gain entrance into high-priority markets while increasing our business scale in current markets. We will also continue to drive rapid growth for Coors Light in Latin America. 
Going forward, the Coors, Miller and Staropramen brands will be the priorities for our International brand portfolio. And in India, we will continue to add scale to our Mount Shivalik business.
To wrap up, in the second half of 2016, we will continue to focus on our First Choice for consumer and customer ambition, all driven through our after capital charge lens and with the intent to drive total shareholder returns.
Now before we start the Q&A portion of the call, just a quick comment. As usual, our prepared remarks will be in our website for your reference within a couple of hours this afternoon. Also at 1 p.m. Eastern Time today, Dave Dunnewald will host a follow-up conference call, which is an opportunity for you to ask additional questions regarding our quarterly results.

Central to that is the quality, the breadth and depth of our brand portfolio and our ability to premium-ize our portfolio while building our customer relationships.

I'm encouraged by the sequential improvement in our share trends, in all of our regions as well, from Q1 into Q2. But clearly, brand building is a long-term game. And my objective and the executive objective here is to continue to invest in a sustained way. Clearly, the focus is always on the quality of our investments. You've heard me say in the past, I'd rather spend less dollars in a great idea than more dollars in a bad idea. But our job is to develop great ideas and invest in a sustained way. And that's what we're doing, and I expect to see us continue to do that through the third quarter as well.

The NSR, which we were quite pleased with, I mean, was broadly in line with the underlying trend in Q1, really, was driven by the COGS. And if you looked at what happened in cost of goods sold in the second half, we broadly offset our inflation with cost savings. And the increase you see there was the increase in some of our marketing investments for impact promotions which go in case. So that was the investment behind the brands. You saw some impact from transactional FX and volume deleverage. But I would look at the first half and say, if you looked at the first half, actually, we had an improvement in COGS of about 0.7%.

And what we're trying to do, obviously, is make sure that we've got an appropriate balance between price and volume or NSR per hectoliter and volume, which again, I think we achieved in the quarter. Volumes were up 1.6%, and NSR per hectoliter at 1.3%. So I think that's a reasonably good balance. It is true that the NSR per hectoliter is driven by mix with price under pressure, but that goes back to our to premium-ization strategy. We've been trying to make sure that we invest behind the premium brands to drive the right both portfolio and geographic mix. So whilst pricing is under pressure across many of the markets, I think we're doing a pretty solid job in recognizing that and driving volumes and shares and mix to get to an overall positive revenue growth.

Look, you probably did just talk about our First Choice agenda just briefly in just saying that against the 3 platforms we've been driving -- lowering our cost base, overhauling our supply chain network and improving the front end, all 3 of those actually are looking good. On the first 2, we continue to see cost savings in the quarter, and that allowed us to drive some of that brand investment that we put behind commercial. And the money that we put behind commercial really went to 3 places. It went to invest behind our growing Above Premium portfolio, which has continued to grow share of beer. So I think actually that's very sticky. Those brands have continued to grow. And Coors Banquet turned in a better than 20% growth again this quarter. I think the second piece is we put money behind our big brands relative to in-case promotions. And I think last year, we had some concerns that we weren't competitive. I think this year, we were well-balanced, and I think that was a positive. And then on the third investment, we pushed investment behind our share of voice. We were under-indexing. And together with really effective advertising copy, we've seen that now continue to grow our brand scores. So growing brand scores is a great telltale sign that you're spending money in the right place. So that's how I describe the brand expense for Q2."

So if you look at the shape of our existing International portfolio, the 2 backbone brands are principally Coors Light and Staropramen.

So if you look at the shape of our existing International portfolio, the 2 backbone brands are principally Coors Light and Staropramen. Clearly, Blue Moon is now in many, many markets globally, growing rapidly from a small base. If you look at Staropramen specifically post the StarBev acquisition, we increased investment in the brand, really, across greater Europe, so outside of the Czech market. And we're seeing double-digit growth in many of those markets. My personal perspective is on a greater Europe basis, there's still a lot of runway ahead of us. And one of the changes I announced just in the last couple of weeks, Mark, is that we'll now look at our European business, including our export and license markets, and one of the benefits from that is we have a more holistic Europe approach across all markets on Staropramen. I think outside of Europe, that's part of our thinking and our emerging planning ahead of integration. Staropramen's currently in Canada. We're just going to testing and incubating the brand there. The U.S. marketplace is slightly more complex because of the distributor relationship or the importer relationship that we inherited when we acquired the StarBev business. We're working our way through that. And there's a broader conversation with Gavin and the team, really looking at where we want to place our bets on our import portfolio going forward, recognizing that we're kind of -- we are an embarrassment of [indiscernible] Staropramen potentially in the future. So that's work that we're currently thinking our way through just now. But in terms of the heartland for Staropramen, which is let's call it Greater Europe, very, very solid progress. In Ukraine, which is a really difficult market, we've continued to take share there. So I feel very good about the possibilities ahead for Staropramen as part of our kind of our three-pronged International portfolio, including the addition of the Miller brand."

Apologies for that slight delay due to technical issue. Many thanks for joining us today. 
With me on the call this morning from Molson Coors, we have Mauricio Restrepo, our Global CFO; Gavin Hattersley, the CEO of Miller Coors; Stewart Glendinning, the CEO of Canada; Simon Cox, our European CEO; Kandy Anand, our International CEO; Lee Reichert, our Deputy General Counsel; Brian Tabolt our Global Controller; and Dave Dunnewald, the VP of Investor Relations.
For our earnings call today, Mauricio and I will take you through the highlights of our second quarter 2016 results for Molson Coors Brewing Company along with some perspective on the second half of 2016.
In the second quarter, we continued to focus on our First Choice ambition and in building a stronger, broader and more premium brand portfolio, underpinned by incremental sales and marketing investment, as we discussed on our first quarter earnings call. Progress in the second quarter included net sales revenue per hectoliter growth on a constant currency basis in all of our businesses, strong Coors Light growth globally, improved core brand momentum, fast-growing innovations in key markets and strong Above Premium growth globally. 
We significantly increased investments behind our brands although the timing of shipments and other short-term factors held back bottom line performance in the quarter. In brands, Coors Light grew volume more than 4% globally, including strong double-digit growth in Europe and Latin America and low single digit growth in the U.S., its best performance year in nearly 3 years. 
In Above Premium, our craft portfolio drove growth, from Doom Bar and other Sharp's brands in the U.K. from Creemore Springs and Belgian Moon in Canada and from Leinenkugel's Grapefruit Shandy and the newly acquired Saint Archer in the U.S. 
Staropramen grew strongly across Europe outside of its home market. And in ciders, we grew volume at Rekorderlig in Europe and Strongbow in Canada. In flavored malt beverages, we now have the largest hard soda franchise in the U.S. with the successful introduction of the Henry's Hard Soda brands earlier this year. 
We continue to strengthen our business through improvements to our sales execution and revenue management capabilities, increased efficiency of our operations and implementation of common global systems. To ensure that our supply chain is fit for the future, in the second quarter, we reached an agreement to purchase land in British Columbia on which we will build a new efficient and flexible brewery over the next few years. This new brewery site is attractively priced, has rail access and is situated in the Trans-Canada Highway, making it ideal for serving the Western Canada and U.S. markets, and we anticipate completing the land purchase this month.
In the past few months, we have also made substantial progress in the pending MillerCoors transaction, including an integration planning and completing the necessary financing at very attractive rates. Investor demand for our recent debt offering was very strong, and we achieved record and near-record low interest rates on our debt issue. We're pleased with the transaction progress made to date, and we continue to plan for closing before the end of 2016, more specifically, October 10 based on the joint ABI-SAB recent announcement.
We're very excited to be much closer to completing this game-changing transaction, which will enable simplified decision-making and will reduce the complexities of dual ownership. It will help us to become a more integrated and efficient brewer, and it will enable us to become a more effective competitor as a single owner promoting consumer choice in an increasingly diverse and fast-growing brewing industry. 
As part of integration planning process, last week, I announced some leadership appointments that will strengthen our combined organization, and it will take effect upon the close of the transaction. Our transaction and its timing remain dependent clearly on the completion of the ABI and SABMiller transaction. 
The regional highlights for the second quarter are as follows.
In the U.S., while overall sales to retail volume decreased 1.7%, driven primarily by our Below Premium brands, Coors Light STRs were up low single digits in the quarter, which was its best quarterly performance since the fourth quarter of 2012. Domestic net revenue per hectoliter grew 0.7% for the quarter as a result of favorable pricing and positive sales mix. 
Our largest brand gained share of the Premium Light segment for the fifth consecutive quarter. And please note that all of our performance discussions related to -- relating to Coors Light exclude the Citrus Radler extension that was discontinued last year. With flat STRs, Miller Lite gained share of the Premium Light segment for the seventh consecutive quarter. Improved momentum for these 2 brands was driven by continued rollout of the new visual identities and consumer communications, which appeal to a broad section of men and women, millennials and multicultural consumers. Additionally, Coors Banquet is now in its 10th consecutive year of growth. 
In the higher-margin Above Premium segment, Henry's was the #1 hard soda franchise in the second quarter on the strength of Henry's Hard Orange and Ginger Ale. In craft, Leinenkugel's Grapefruit Shandy and the newly-acquired Saint Archer brands continued to drive volume, although Blue Moon Belgian White declined low single digits. 
As an important indication of the traction we are gaining in the U.S., for the first time in the history of the joint venture, in 2016, MillerCoors finished #1 in the Tamron supplier survey, which polled hundreds of U.S. distributors in rating the performance of beer, wine and spirits suppliers. This is a key accomplishment in our First Choice ambition for our customers and is an example of the type of efforts we are driving globally to ensure we are focusing on these important customer relationships. 
On the bottom line, MillerCoors' second quarter underlying net income declined 3.8% to $468.8 million, driven primarily by the timing of shipments due to calendar shifts, which were partially offset by lower cost of goods sold, higher net pricing and positive sales mix. Meanwhile, Molson Coors' second quarter underlying equity income in the U.S. segment increased 1.4% due to an $11.1 million anticipated refund of federal excise tax paid on imports. This tax refund is based on qualifying volumes exported from the U.S. by the Coors Brewing Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of Molson Coors, and was driven by new legislation enacted this year in the U.S. First half underlying equity earnings in the U.S. segment, which was not significantly affected by the timing of beer shipments, increased 9.4%.
In Canada, STRs declined 0.1%, and our sales volume declined 0.8% in the second quarter. Weak economic conditions in Western Canada were largely offset by favorable timing of the Canada Day holiday this year. Net sales per hectoliter in local currency increased 1.2% in the quarter despite competitive pressures in the East and a pronounced consumer shift to value brands in Alberta. 
In core brands, although Coors Light volumes declined, our new packaging, advertising and impact sales promotions are driving improved consumer purchase intent and brand health scores. Molson Canadian volume suffered from a significant shift towards the value segment in Alberta. 
In Above Premium and craft, we continue to see strong performance as Coors Banquet, Belgian Moon, Mad Jack, Heineken, Dos Equis, Sol and Strongbow Cider all grew volume and share in the quarter, along with our Creemore Springs craft brands. 
In headline financial results for the quarter, Canada underlying pretax income decreased 19.7% in constant currency, primarily due to a significant increase in sales and marketing investment, as we discussed on our last earnings call. 
Looking at the first half on the same basis, underlying pretax income decreased 10.1%, also driven primarily by increased brand investments. 
Our Europe business achieved 1.6% volume growth and increased market share across the region, driven by growth in 7 of our 11 lead core and premium brands. Net sales revenue per hectoliter increased 1.3% in local currency, driven entirely by brand and geographic mix. In core brands, Carling, Bergenbier and Ozujsko all grew share of segment in their primary markets. And our Above Premium portfolio increased momentum with strong double digit growth by Coors Light and our craft portfolio, including Blue Moon, Doom Bar and the other Sharp's brands. 
Finally, the inclusion of Rekorderlig Cider since the middle of 2015 and the full repatriation of the Staropramen brand in the U.K. this year added to the solid progress we made in premium-izing our Europe portfolio. 
Consistent with the first quarter, underlying pretax income was lower in the quarter due to higher brand investments and amortization expenses, lower net pension benefit and the termination of the Heineken contract brewing arrangements in the U.K. along with unfavorable foreign currency movements this quarter. 
Our International business grew Coors Light at a strong double digit rate in the second quarter, driven by Latin America, including our brand launch in Colombia late last year. Overall, volume, including royalty volume, declined 9.3%, driven by the enactment of alcohol prohibition in Bihar in India, the transfer of Staropramen in the U.K. to our Europe segment and the volume impact of our substantial China restructure. 
Underlying pretax performance improved in the second quarter, and drivers included volume growth in Latin America and Japan, favorable sales mix, as well as lower price promotion and overhead expenses related to the restructure of our China business last year, including cycling $3.6 million of price promotion expense a year ago.
Now I'll turn over to Mauricio to give second quarter financial highlights and perspective on the balance of 2016. Mauricio?"

As a reminder, all of the results that I will be discussing are in U.S. dollars, unless I note otherwise. Our second quarter financial headlines are as follows.Net sales were down approximately 2% in U.S. dollars",1270,"Thank you, Mark, and hello, everybody. As a reminder, all of the results that I will be discussing are in U.S. dollars, unless I note otherwise. 
Our second quarter financial headlines are as follows.
Net sales were down approximately 2% in U.S. dollars due to currency movements. On a constant currency basis, net sales increased 1.9%, driven by Europe, Canada and International. Our net sales per hectoliter increased 2.4% in constant currency due to positive mix. 
On a U.S. GAAP basis, we reported pretax income of $196.9 million, 32.1% lower than a year ago while after-tax income from continuing operations attributable to Molson Coors was $174.1 million, down 24.1% from the prior year result. These decreases were primarily due to noncash special charges and other noncore expenses related to our pending acquisition, the alcohol prohibition in Bihar and planned brewery closures, along with higher MG&A expenses. 
Underlying pretax income in constant currency decreased 6.9% in the quarter and 8.6% on a reported basis, partly due to year-over-year differences in the timing of brand investments and other expenses as well as lower worldwide volume. First half results eliminate some of these quarterly timing differences and reflected 3.4% growth in constant currency, underlying pretax income and 2% growth on a reported basis in U.S. dollars. 
Second quarter underlying after-tax income decreased 9.2% to $239.5 million or $1.11 per diluted share, driven by lower worldwide volume, higher brand investments in all of our businesses and the negative foreign currency movements, which were partially offset by positive mix, lower underlying net interest expense and higher underlying U.S. equity income. Underlying EBITDA in the quarter was $428.7 million -- that is 5.8% lower than a year ago -- while our first half underlying EBITDA grew 1.2%. Underlying free cash flow in the first half of 2016 was $158.9 million. This represents a decrease of $82.2 million from the prior year, primarily driven by lower underlying after-tax income, negative foreign currency and less benefit from working capital changes, excluding special and other noncore items, including higher cash paid for taxes. 
In early July, we completed a $7 billion long-term debt offering with a weighted average coupon of 2.9%, including the lowest 30-year BBB- coupon ever issued in U.S. dollars as well as a 1.25% coupon for our 8-year euro debt issue. As a result of these attractive rates, we anticipate that our annualized interest cost on the transaction financing will be approximately $260 million at current interest and foreign exchange rates. This annual interest expense is nearly $200 million lower than the assumed bridge loan and other transaction-related interest expense included in the 2015 pro forma financial results that we filed in May. 
With the debt offering, we achieved broad high-quality investor participation and attractive pricing. More than 400 institutional investors participated in the offering. 
Combining this debt issue with our $2.6 billion equity offering in February and up to $3 billion of a previously arranged term loan, we now have in place all the financing needed for the pending MillerCoors transaction. 
Total debt at the end of the second quarter was $3 billion, which does not include the $7 billion of long-term debt we issued in July. Cash and cash equivalents totaled slightly less than $3 billion, resulting in net debt of $37 million, which is significantly lower than prior year due to the cash proceeds received from our equity offering earlier in the year. Please see the earnings release we distributed earlier this morning for a detailed review of our business unit financial results in the quarter.
Now looking forward to the remainder of 2016, following are some factors to consider for the last 2 quarters of this year. 
Incremental Europe brand amortization expense with an annualized impact of approximately $50 million which began in the fourth quarter of 2015, along with lower net pension benefit in Europe this year. 
A total prohibition on the sale of alcohol unexpectedly implemented by the state government in Bihar in early April. We don't know how long this ban will be in place, and we expect this development to present a headwind for our International business for the foreseeable future or until it is overturned. 
And finally, foreign currency translation, which at current exchange rates, would be a headwind of about $13 million to our underlying pretax results in the second half this year, with most of the impact in Europe. Given the recent volatility of our key foreign currencies, particularly the British pound, it is important to watch these rates closely. 
Regarding 2016 guidance, all of the following metrics exclude any effects of the MillerCoors and Miller global brands transaction, the timing of which will have a big impact on virtually all of our guidance measures. 
For the full year, we continue to expect cash contributions to our defined benefit pension plans to be in the range of $45 million to $65 million in 2016 and pension expense of approximately $17 million, including our 42% of MillerCoors contribution and expense; MG&A expense in corporate of approximately $120 million on an underlying basis, which excludes expenses related to our pending transaction; consolidated net interest expense of approximately $110 million on an underlying basis, which excludes transaction-related  interest expense and income; an underlying effective tax rate in the range of 18% to 22% assuming no further changes in tax laws, settlement of tax audits or adjustments to our uncertain tax positions. 
In updated guidance, we now expect underlying capital spending of approximately $220 million, which excludes capital this year related to the construction of our new brewery in British Columbia. As far as our cost outlook is concerned, we continue to expect the cost of goods sold per hectoliter in Canada and Europe in local currency to increase at a low single digit rate for the full year 2016. We now expect 2016 MillerCoors COGS per hectoliter to decrease at a low single digit rate versus prior year. Further cost reductions, including acceleration of some of our cost savings initiatives and changes in sales mix, drove the change from previous guidance of approximately in line. We now expect our international COGS per hectoliter to increase at a double digit rate for 2016. This is up from a high single digit increase previously due to geographic mix changes. We continue to expect annual cost savings for this year and next year to be in the range of $50 million to $70 million. This view excludes cost savings from MillerCoors as well as synergies resulting from the pending MillerCoors acquisition which we expect to be $200 million by year 4 following the transaction close. 
Finally, here are the most recent volume trends for each of our businesses early in the third quarter. 
In the U.S., for the 3 weeks through July 23, STRs decreased at a mid single digit rate, partially due to the timing of the load-in for the July 4 holiday while they decreased at a high single digit rate in Canada for the same period. In Europe, volume through July 25 decreased high single digits. And our International sales volume, including royalty volume, through July 23, decreased at a low single digit rate, primarily due to the alcohol prohibition in Bihar. As ever, please keep in mind that these numbers represent only a portion of the current quarter, and trends could change in the weeks ahead. Also as a reminder, following the close of the pending MillerCoors transaction, we plan to discontinue providing these early next quarter volume trends.
At this point, I'll turn it back over to Mark for our outlook, wrap-up and the Q&A. Mark?"

In the second half of this year, we will continue to drive our First Choice for consumer and customer agenda in the geographies and segments where we choose to play, ensuring we build a broader, stronger and a more premium portfolio while driving best-in-class customer service and partnerships. 
In the U.S., MillerCoors remains laser-focused on its strategy to drive total volume growth by 2019. For the first time in many years, our largest business is in line with its volume expectations for the first 6 months. The quarter also provided additional steps towards its growth ambition, with strength in marketing behind flagship brands, Coors Light and Miller Lite, and we're starting to see the positive impact. 
Also we continue to see success in the innovation space. In Above Premium, we remain bullish in the potential of Henry's as the hard soda category continues to grow. In the second quarter, Henry's became the #1 hard soda franchise, and MillerCoors plans to roll out Henry's Hard Cherry Cola this month. 
In the craft segment, MillerCoors will continue to invest buying ad support for Blue Moon and Leinenkugel during the balance of the peak year selling season. MillerCoors also recently announced that it had agreed to purchase a majority interest in Oregon-based Hop Valley Brewing company and to increase its ownership of the Georgia-based Terrapin Beer company from a minority stake to a majority interest. These are highly regarded brewers both in their regions and nationwide, and they further strengthen our leading U.S. craft portfolio, which also includes Blue Moon, Leinenkugel's and Saint Archer. Additionally, next month, at its fall meeting with distributors, the U.S. team will share plans to improve the performance of its Below Premium portfolio. And the team continues to expand its Building with Beer retail strategy beyond on-premise to additional channels to build First Choice customer partnerships.  
With changes pending in the MillerCoors ownership structure, the merger's not one of apprehension, but excitement. In the meantime, everyone at MillerCoors remains disciplined, decisive and accountable for growing our business, transforming our portfolio and driving shareholder value. 
In Canada, we are investing behind new product quality-focused advertising and improved sales execution via our field sales management program. These efforts are aimed not only at improving our premium performance, but also continuing to accelerate our growing Above Premium portfolio. We will continue our position in the hard soda space with Mad Jack root beer and ginger ale, the first major hard soda entries in Canada. 
Additionally, we signed a partnership agreement in May with Brasseur de Montréal to leverage its craft and speciality beers in Québec and across our strong Canada distribution network. Following the close of the pending MillerCoors transaction, we're also looking forward to bringing the Miller brands back into our Canada portfolio.
In Europe, we achieved top line and market share growth in the second quarter on the strength of our core and Above Premium brands, along with the addition of the Rekorderlig Cider and Staropramen brands in the U.K. Increased brand amortization expense will continue to present a headwind for one more quarter, and we'll continue to invest in our core brand portfolio across Europe to continue to grow our share of segment. This will include leveraging our English Premier League sponsorship well beyond Carling in the U.K. to many high-potential brand and market opportunities. We will also continue to premium-ize our portfolio with Coors Light, the Sharp's portfolio led by Doom Bar, Cobra, Rekorderlig and Staropramen in the U.K., as well as Ireland's leading craft brand, Franciscan Well. 
Our International business is focused on continuing to accelerate our overall growth in existing and select new markets while attaining profitability in 2016 on a constant currency basis versus our original 2013 commitment, now excluding the impact of the Bihar alcohol prohibition. Upon closing of the MillerCoors transaction, we will integrate the Miller International brands into our portfolio and leverage a footprint that complements our growth strategy and allows us to gain entrance into high-priority markets while increasing our business scale in current markets. We will also continue to drive rapid growth for Coors Light in Latin America. 
Going forward, the Coors, Miller and Staropramen brands will be the priorities for our International brand portfolio. And in India, we will continue to add scale to our Mount Shivalik business.
To wrap up, in the second half of 2016, we will continue to focus on our First Choice for consumer and customer ambition, all driven through our profit after capital charge lens and with the intent to drive total shareholder returns.
Now before we start the Q&A portion of the call, just a quick comment. As usual, our prepared remarks will be on our website for your reference within a couple of hours this afternoon. Also at 1 p.m. Eastern Time today, Dave Dunnewald will host a follow-up conference call, which is an opportunity for you to ask additional questions regarding our quarterly results. This call will also be available for you to hear via webcast on our website. Additionally, we hope to see many of you at the Barclays Consumer Staples Conference in Boston on September 7.

Central to that is the quality, the breadth and depth of our brand portfolio and our ability to premium-ize our portfolio while building our customer relationships. So we made good on the commitment to step up our investment through the second quarter. I think if you look at our NSR per hectoliter, we saw NSR per hec growth in all of our regions. I'm encouraged by the sequential improvement in our share trends, in all of our regions as well, from Q1 into Q2. But clearly, brand building is a long-term game. And my objective and the executive objective here is to continue to invest in a sustained way. Clearly, the focus is always on the quality of our investments.

As I say, the sequential improvement that you've seen from Q1 to Q2, I think, is a testament to the focus and output right across our business. Stewart, do you want to pick up on the Canada-specific question? 
Do we have Stewart?
[Technical Difficulty]
It sounds like we've lost Stewart for a second. So Judy, we'll get him back in, and then I'll fill him back on to answer your specific question, if you can just bear with us. Apologies for that. We seem to have a couple of technical hitches this morning."

So just -- if I can just answer that question -- sorry, I was talking and nobody could hear me. But obviously, 2 pieces to the margin, Judy. The NSR, which we were quite pleased with, I mean, was broadly in line with the underlying trend in Q1, really, was driven by the COGS. And if you looked at what happened in cost of goods sold in the second half, we broadly offset our inflation with cost savings. And the increase you see there was the increase in some of our marketing investments for impact promotions which go in case. So that was the investment behind the brands. You saw some impact from transactional FX and volume deleverage. But I would look at the first half and say, if you looked at the first half, actually, we had an improvement in COGS of about 0.7%. So hopefully, that helps."

I mean, overall, we would characterize that the European quarter is pretty solid and net sales revenue are up at 3%. And what we're trying to do, obviously, is make sure that we've got an appropriate balance between price and volume or NSR per hectoliter and volume, which again, I think we achieved in the quarter. Volumes were up 1.6%, and NSR per hectoliter up 1.3%. So I think that's a reasonably good balance. It is true that the NSR per hectoliter is driven by mix with price under pressure, but that goes back to our to premium-ization strategy. We've been trying to make sure that we invest behind the premium brands to drive the right both portfolio and geographic mix. So whilst pricing is under pressure across many of the markets, I think we're doing a pretty solid job in recognizing that and driving volumes and shares and mix to get to an overall positive revenue growth. So we'd be quite satisfied with it, recognizing that pricing remains competitive."

Sure, Mark. Yes. Look, you probably did just talk about our First Choice agenda just briefly in just saying that against the 3 platforms we've been driving -- lowering our cost base, overhauling our supply chain network and improving the front end, all 3 of those actually are looking good. On the first 2, we continue to see cost savings in the quarter, and that allowed us to drive some of that brand investment that we put behind commercial. And the money that we put behind commercial really went to 3 places. It went to invest behind our growing Above Premium portfolio, which has continued to grow share of beer. So I think actually that's very sticky. Those brands have continued to grow. And Coors Banquet turned in a better than 20% growth again this quarter. I think the second piece is we put money behind our big brands relative to in-case promotions. And I think last year, we had some concerns that we weren't competitive. I think this year, we were well-balanced, and I think that was a positive. And then on the third investment, we pushed investment behind our share of voice. We were under-indexing. And together with really effective advertising copy, we've seen that now continue to grow our brand scores. So growing brand scores is a great telltale sign that you're spending money in the right place. So that's how I describe the brand expense for Q2."

Clearly, Blue Moon is now in many, many markets globally, growing rapidly from a small base. If you look at Staropramen specifically post the StarBev acquisition, we increased investment in the brand, really, across greater Europe, so outside of the Czech market. And we're seeing double-digit growth in many of those markets. My personal perspective is on a greater Europe basis, there's still a lot of runway ahead of us. And one of the changes I announced just in the last couple of weeks, Mark, is that we'll now look at our European business, including our export and license markets, and one of the benefits from that is we have a more holistic Europe approach across all markets on Staropramen. I think outside of Europe, that's part of our thinking and our emerging planning ahead of integration. Staropramen's currently in Canada. We're just kind of testing and incubating the brand there. The U.S. marketplace is slightly more complex because of the distributor relationship or the importer relationship that we inherited when we acquired the StarBev business. We're working our way through that. And there's a broader conversation with Gavin and the team, really looking at where we want to place our bets on our import portfolio going forward, recognizing that we're kind of -- we have an embarrassment of riches with Pilsner Urquell and Peroni and Grolsch and Staropramen potentially in the future. So that's work that we're currently thinking our way through just now. But in terms of the heartland for Staropramen, which is let's call it Greater Europe, very, very solid progress. In Ukraine, which is a really difficult market, we've continued to take share there. So I feel very good about the possibilities ahead for Staropramen as part of our kind of our three-pronged International portfolio, including the addition of the Miller brand."

So the first year will be challenging and tricky in some places, but got to look beyond that to the value that's going to be created by the addition of the Miller International portfolio."

The focus has been on driving the right inputs which then impact on the outputs. And I'm certainly very encouraged, and I know the team there are, by the fact that we've seen our brand health metrics and our purchase intent numbers move in a very positive direction through the second quarter. So I think quality of our copy, the promotional intensity in terms of our in-case, the rollout of the visual identity, further alignment with the U.S. creative platform, all of those thing's all go very well. But this is a big, big brand, and you don't turn things on or turn things off overnight. So we are working this hard, and I think we're working on the right input measures, are starting, certainly through our brand tracking, to demonstrate that we're pulling on the right levers, and I expect to see performance improve through the balance of this year and into 2017. Encouragingly, when you look at Coors' trademark in totality in Canada and add in Banquet, which Stewart mentioned is up over 20% again in the month, the Coors' trademarks in generally good health.

On behalf of Molson Coors Brewing Company, thank you for joining us today for our Second Quarter 2016 Follow-Up Earnings Conference Call. Our goal in this call is to address as many additional earnings-related questions as possible following our regular earnings conference call with Mark Hunter, Mauricio Restrepo and our business unit CEOs earlier today. We will use a standard question-and-answer format, and we anticipate that the call will last less than an hour. 
Before we begin, I will paraphrase the company's safe harbor language. Some of the discussion today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from what the company projects today, so please refer to our most recent 10-K and 10-Q filings for a more complete description of factors that could affect these projections. The company does not undertake to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they're made. 
Regarding any non-U.S. GAAP measures that may be discussed during the call, and from time to time, by our company's executives in discussing our performance, please visit the company's website, molsoncoors.com, that's www.molsoncoors.com, and click on the Financial Reporting tab of the Investor Relations page for a reconciliation of these measures to the nearest U.S. GAAP result. Also, unless otherwise indicated, all financial results the company discusses are versus the comparable prior year period and in U.S. dollars. We also encourage investors and analysts to read SABMiller plc news releases and trading statements that include financial and other information relating to the MillerCoors joint venture. 
So let's get started with an introduction of the team with me on this call. We have Kevin Kim, Investor Relations Senior Manager; Ashley Dunlop, Finance Forecasting Senior Manager; Brian Tabolt, Controller; Jason Charpentier, Treasury Director; and Mark Saks, VP of Tax. 
So regarding quarterly results, as Mark Hunter mentioned on our regular earnings call this morning, in the second quarter, we continued to focus on our First Choice ambition and on building a stronger, broader and more premium brand portfolio, underpinned by incremental sales and marketing investments, as we discussed on our first quarter earnings call a few months ago. Progress in the quarter included net sales revenue per hectoliter growth on a constant currency basis in all of our businesses. That included strong Coors Light growth globally, improved core brand momentum, fast-growing innovations in key markets and strong Above Premium growth globally. We significantly increased investments behind our brands, although the timing of shipments and other short-term factors held back bottom line performance in the quarter. 
In brands, Coors Light grew volume more than 4% globally, including strong double-digit growth in Europe and Latin America and low single-digit growth in the U.S., this brand's best performance here in nearly 3 years. We continued to strengthen our business through improvements to our sales execution and revenue management capabilities, increased efficiency of our operations and implementation of global -- common global systems. To ensure that our supply chain is fit for the future, in the second quarter, we reached an agreement to purchase land in British Columbia on which we will build a new efficient and flexible brewery over the next few years. This new brewery site is attractively priced, has rail access and is situated on the TransCanada Highway, making it ideal for serving the Western Canada and U.S. markets. We anticipate completing the land purchase this month. 
In the past few months, we've also made substantial progress on the pending MillerCoors transaction, including an integration planning and completing the necessary financing at very attractive rates. Investor demand for our recent debt offering was very strong,  and we achieved record and near record low interest rates on our debt issue. We're pleased with the transaction progress made to date, and we continue to plan for a closing before the end of 2016. 
In the balance of this year, we will continue to focus on our First Choice for consumers and customers' ambition, all driven through our Profit After Capital Charge lens and with the intent to drive total shareholder returns. 
So with that, I'd like to open it up for your questions. Over to you, Kris."

And we've seen that pretty frequently over the many, call it, 27 years we've been providing those data points. And that actually limits their usefulness. And in this particular time frame, call it, early July, you have the largest holiday of the year right on the edge of that time period, July 4 obviously in the U.S. And then if you're wondering about Canada, you've got the Canada Day holiday on July 1. So just -- yes, simply, a lot of volatility in the numbers.

And that land is obviously much less expensive than the land that we sold, because we can not only buy new land but also build -- largely build a new brewery for the -- with proceeds from that -- the land sale, which we completed last quarter."

What has been really quite different from what we expected is actually the -- what'd you call it, the actual backdrop, the macroeconomic challenges of that Eurozone, which are obviously pretty well documented. But the actual performance of the businesses themselves has been quite good. And we've had localized challenges in places like Serbia that we talked about. Originally, Romania was a particularly challenging market for us, and we've been able to make great progress in Romania and I would say meaningful progress in Serbia. The one thing that we did not anticipate when we did the transaction was the speed with which we would be able to combine the U.K. business with the Central Europe businesses. And that has allowed us to vastly increase the, call it, synergies or efficiencies of the overall Europe operating unit. And so we've had challenges like floods. We've had macroeconomic challenges and so forth. But nonetheless, the business has performed really well, and we've been able to vastly exceed our expectations for cost savings and also list some best practices out of the Central Europe business too. Some of our other businesses, for example, our sales processes we're now embedding in our Canada business, they've already been essentially lifted and shifted to our U.K. business. These have helped us to improve our efficiency and effectiveness in sales -- in the sales force in those geographies, and obviously, there's more potential to do that going forward."

Apologies for that slight delay due to technical issue. Many thanks for joining us today. 
With me on the call this morning from Molson Coors, we have Mauricio Restrepo, our Global CFO; Gavin Hattersley, the CEO of Miller Coors; Stewart Glendinning, the CEO of Canada; Simon Cox, our European CEO; Kandy Anand, our International CEO; Lee Reichert, our Deputy General Counsel; Brian Tabolt our Global Controller; and Dave Dunnewald, the VP of Investor Relations.
For our earnings call today, Mauricio and I will take you through the highlights of our second quarter 2016 results for Molson Coors Brewing Company along with some perspective on the second half of 2016.
In the second quarter, we continued to focus on our First Choice ambition and in building a stronger, broader and more premium brand portfolio, underpinned by incremental sales and marketing investment, as we discussed on our first quarter earnings call. Progress in the second quarter included net sales revenue per hectoliter growth on a constant currency basis in all of our businesses, strong Coors Light growth globally, improved core brand momentum, fast-growing innovations in key markets and strong Above Premium growth globally. 
We significantly increased investments behind our brands although the timing of shipments and other short-term factors held back bottom line performance in the quarter. In brands, Coors Light grew volume more than 4% globally, including strong double-digit growth in Europe and Latin America and low single digit growth in the U.S., its best performance year in nearly 3 years. 
In Above Premium, our craft portfolio drove growth, from Doom Bar and other Sharp's brands in the U.K. from Creemore Springs and Belgian Moon in Canada and from Leinenkugel's Grapefruit Shandy and the newly acquired Saint Archer in the U.S. 
Staropramen grew strongly across Europe outside of its home market. And in ciders, we grew volume at Rekorderlig in Europe and Strongbow in Canada. In flavored malt beverages, we now have the largest hard soda franchise in the U.S. with the successful introduction of the Henry's Hard Soda brands earlier this year. 
We continue to strengthen our business through improvements to our sales execution and revenue management capabilities, increased efficiency of our operations and implementation of common global systems. To ensure that our supply chain is fit for the future, in the second quarter, we reached an agreement to purchase land in British Columbia on which we will build a new efficient and flexible brewery over the next few years. This new brewery site is attractively priced, has rail access and is situated in the Trans-Canada Highway, making it ideal for serving the Western Canada and U.S. markets, and we anticipate completing the land purchase this month.
In the past few months, we have also made substantial progress in the pending MillerCoors transaction, including an integration planning and completing the necessary financing at very attractive rates. Investor demand for our recent debt offering was very strong, and we achieved record and near-record low interest rates on our debt issue. We're pleased with the transaction progress made to date, and we continue to plan for closing before the end of 2016, more specifically, October 10 based on the joint ABI-SAB recent announcement.
We're very excited to be much closer to completing this game-changing transaction, which will enable simplified decision-making and will reduce the complexities of dual ownership. It will help us to become a more integrated and efficient brewer, and it will enable us to become a more effective competitor as a single owner promoting consumer choice in an increasingly diverse and fast-growing brewing industry. 
As part of integration planning process, last week, I announced some leadership appointments that will strengthen our combined organization, and it will take effect upon the close of the transaction. Our transaction and its timing remain dependent clearly on the completion of the ABI and SABMiller transaction. 
The regional highlights for the second quarter are as follows.
In the U.S., while overall sales to retail volume decreased 1.7%, driven primarily by our Below Premium brands, Coors Light STRs were up low single digits in the quarter, which was its best quarterly performance since the fourth quarter of 2012. Domestic net revenue per hectoliter grew 0.7% for the quarter as a result of favorable pricing and positive sales mix. 
Our largest brand gained share of the Premium Light segment for the fifth consecutive quarter. And please note that all of our performance discussions related to -- relating to Coors Light exclude the Citrus Radler extension that was discontinued last year. With flat STRs, Miller Lite gained share of the Premium Light segment for the seventh consecutive quarter. Improved momentum for these 2 brands was driven by continued rollout of the new visual identities and consumer communications, which appeal to a broad section of men and women, millennials and multicultural consumers. Additionally, Coors Banquet is now in its 10th consecutive year of growth. 
In the higher-margin Above Premium segment, Henry's was the #1 hard soda franchise in the second quarter on the strength of Henry's Hard Orange and Ginger Ale. In craft, Leinenkugel's Grapefruit Shandy and the newly-acquired Saint Archer brands continued to drive volume, although Blue Moon Belgian White declined low single digits. 
As an important indication of the traction we are gaining in the U.S., for the first time in the history of the joint venture, in 2016, MillerCoors finished #1 in the Tamron supplier survey, which polled hundreds of U.S. distributors in rating the performance of beer, wine and spirits suppliers. This is a key accomplishment in our First Choice ambition for our customers and is an example of the type of efforts we are driving globally to ensure we are focusing on these important customer relationships. 
On the bottom line, MillerCoors' second quarter underlying net income declined 3.8% to $468.8 million, driven primarily by the timing of shipments due to calendar shifts, which were partially offset by lower cost of goods sold, higher net pricing and positive sales mix. Meanwhile, Molson Coors' second quarter underlying equity income in the U.S. segment increased 1.4% due to an $11.1 million anticipated refund of federal excise tax paid on imports. This tax refund is based on qualifying volumes exported from the U.S. by the Coors Brewing Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of Molson Coors, and was driven by new legislation enacted this year in the U.S. First half underlying equity earnings in the U.S. segment, which was not significantly affected by the timing of beer shipments, increased 9.4%.
In Canada, STRs declined 0.1%, and our sales volume declined 0.8% in the second quarter. Weak economic conditions in Western Canada were largely offset by favorable timing of the Canada Day holiday this year. Net sales per hectoliter in local currency increased 1.2% in the quarter despite competitive pressures in the East and a pronounced consumer shift to value brands in Alberta. 
In core brands, although Coors Light volumes declined, our new packaging, advertising and impact sales promotions are driving improved consumer purchase intent and brand health scores. Molson Canadian volume suffered from a significant shift towards the value segment in Alberta. 
In Above Premium and craft, we continue to see strong performance as Coors Banquet, Belgian Moon, Mad Jack, Heineken, Dos Equis, Sol and Strongbow Cider all grew volume and share in the quarter, along with our Creemore Springs craft brands. 
In headline financial results for the quarter, Canada underlying pretax income decreased 19.7% in constant currency, primarily due to a significant increase in sales and marketing investment, as we discussed on our last earnings call. 
Looking at the first half on the same basis, underlying pretax income decreased 10.1%, also driven primarily by increased brand investments. 
Our Europe business achieved 1.6% volume growth and increased market share across the region, driven by growth in 7 of our 11 lead core and premium brands. Net sales revenue per hectoliter increased 1.3% in local currency, driven entirely by brand and geographic mix. In core brands, Carling, Bergenbier and Ozujsko all grew share of segment in their primary markets. And our Above Premium portfolio increased momentum with strong double digit growth by Coors Light and our craft portfolio, including Blue Moon, Doom Bar and the other Sharp's brands. 
Finally, the inclusion of Rekorderlig Cider since the middle of 2015 and the full repatriation of the Staropramen brand in the U.K. this year added to the solid progress we made in premium-izing our Europe portfolio. 
Consistent with the first quarter, underlying pretax income was lower in the quarter due to higher brand investments and amortization expenses, lower net pension benefit and the termination of the Heineken contract brewing arrangements in the U.K. along with unfavorable foreign currency movements this quarter. 
Our International business grew Coors Light at a strong double digit rate in the second quarter, driven by Latin America, including our brand launch in Colombia late last year. Overall, volume, including royalty volume, declined 9.3%, driven by the enactment of alcohol prohibition in Bihar in India, the transfer of Staropramen in the U.K. to our Europe segment and the volume impact of our substantial China restructure. 
Underlying pretax performance improved in the second quarter, and drivers included volume growth in Latin America and Japan, favorable sales mix, as well as lower price promotion and overhead expenses related to the restructure of our China business last year, including cycling $3.6 million of price promotion expense a year ago.
Now I'll turn over to Mauricio to give second quarter financial highlights and perspective on the balance of 2016. Mauricio?"
263765,312033288,1022523,"Molson Coors Brewing Company, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 02, 2016",2016-08-02,"Earnings Calls","Molson Coors Beverage Company","Executives","Thank you, Mark, and hello, everybody. As a reminder, all of the results that I will be discussing are in U.S. dollars, unless I note otherwise. Our second quarter financial headlines are as follows.Net sales were down approximately 2% in U.S. dollars",1269,"Thank you, Mark, and hello, everybody. As a reminder, all of the results that I will be discussing are in U.S. dollars, unless I note otherwise. 
Our second quarter financial headlines are as follows.
Net sales were down approximately 2% in U.S. dollars due to currency movements. On a constant currency basis, net sales increased 1.9%, driven by Europe, Canada and International. Our net sales per hectoliter increased 2.4% in constant currency due to positive mix. 
On a U.S. GAAP basis, we reported pretax income of $196.9 million, 32.1% lower than a year ago while after-tax income from continuing operations attributable to Molson Coors was $174.1 million, down 24.1% from the prior year result. These decreases were primarily due to noncash special charges and other noncore expenses related to our pending acquisition, the alcohol prohibition in Bihar and planned brewery closures, along with higher MG&A expenses. 
Underlying pretax income in constant currency decreased 6.9% in the quarter and 8.6% on a reported basis, partly due to year-over-year differences in the timing of brand investments and other expenses as well as lower worldwide volume. First half results eliminate some of these quarterly timing differences and reflected 3.4% growth in constant currency, underlying pretax income and 2% growth on a reported basis in U.S. dollars. 
Second quarter underlying after-tax income decreased 9.2% to $239.5 million or $1.11 per diluted share, driven by lower worldwide volume, higher brand investments in all of our businesses and the negative foreign currency movements, which were partially offset by positive mix, lower underlying net interest expense and higher underlying U.S. equity income. Underlying EBITDA in the quarter was $428.7 million -- that is 5.8% lower than a year ago -- while our first half underlying EBITDA grew 1.2%. Underlying free cash flow in the first half of 2016 was $158.9 million. This represents a decrease of $82.2 million from the prior year, primarily driven by lower underlying after-tax income, negative foreign currency and less benefit from working capital changes, excluding special and other noncore items, including higher cash paid for taxes. 
In early July, we completed a $7 billion long-term debt offering with a weighted average coupon of 2.9%, including the lowest 30-year BBB- coupon ever issued in U.S. dollars as well as a 1.25% coupon for our 8-year euro debt issue. As a result of these attractive rates, we anticipate that our annualized interest cost on the transaction financing will be approximately $260 million at current interest and foreign exchange rates. This annual interest expense is nearly $200 million lower than the assumed bridge loan and other transaction-related interest expense included in the 2015 pro forma financial results that we filed in May. 
With the debt offering, we achieved broad high-quality investor participation and attractive pricing. More than 400 institutional investors participated in the offering. 
Combining this debt issue with our $2.6 billion equity offering in February and up to $3 billion of a previously arranged term loan, we now have in place all the financing needed for the pending MillerCoors transaction. 
Total debt at the end of the second quarter was $3 billion, which does not include the $7 billion of long-term debt we issued in July. Cash and cash equivalents totaled slightly less than $3 billion, resulting in net debt of $37 million, which is significantly lower than prior year due to the cash proceeds received from our equity offering earlier in the year. Please see the earnings release we distributed earlier this morning for a detailed review of our business unit financial results in the quarter.
Now looking forward to the remainder of 2016, following are some factors to consider for the last 2 quarters of this year. 
Incremental Europe brand amortization expense with an annualized impact of approximately $50 million which began in the fourth quarter of 2015, along with lower net pension benefit in Europe this year. 
A total prohibition on the sale of alcohol unexpectedly implemented by the state government in Bihar in early April. We don't know how long this ban will be in place, and we expect this development to present a headwind for our International business for the foreseeable future or until it is overturned. 
And finally, foreign currency translation, which at current exchange rates, would be a headwind of about $13 million to our underlying pretax results in the second half this year, with most of the impact in Europe. Given the recent volatility of our key foreign currencies, particularly the British pound, it is important to watch these rates closely. 
Regarding 2016 guidance, all of the following metrics exclude any effects of the MillerCoors and Miller global brands transaction, the timing of which will have a big impact on virtually all of our guidance measures. 
For the full year, we continue to expect cash contributions to our defined benefit pension plans to be in the range of $45 million to $65 million in 2016 and pension expense of approximately $17 million, including our 42% of MillerCoors contribution and expense; MG&A expense in corporate of approximately $120 million on an underlying basis, which excludes expenses related to our pending transaction; consolidated net interest expense of approximately $110 million on an underlying basis, which excludes transaction-related interest expense and income; an underlying effective tax rate in the range of 18% to 22% assuming no further changes in tax laws, settlement of tax audits or adjustments to our uncertain tax positions. 
In updated guidance, we now expect underlying capital spending of approximately $220 million, which excludes capital this year related to the construction of our new brewery in British Columbia. As far as our cost outlook is concerned, we continue to expect the cost of goods sold per hectoliter in Canada and Europe in local currency to increase at a low single digit rate for the full year 2016. We now expect 2016 MillerCoors COGS per hectoliter to decrease at a low single digit rate versus prior year. Further cost reductions, including acceleration of some of our cost savings initiatives and changes in sales mix, drove the change from previous guidance of approximately in line. We now expect our international COGS per hectoliter to increase at a double digit rate for 2016. This is up from a high single digit increase previously due to geographic mix changes. We continue to expect annual cost savings for this year and next year to be in the range of $50 million to $70 million. This view excludes cost savings from MillerCoors as well as synergies resulting from the pending MillerCoors acquisition which we expect to be $200 million by year 4 following the transaction close. 
Finally, here are the most recent volume trends for each of our businesses early in the third quarter. 
In the U.S., for the 3 weeks through July 23, STRs decreased at a mid-single digit rate, partially due to the timing of the load-in for the July 4 holiday while they decreased at a high single digit rate in Canada for the same period. In Europe, volume through July 25 decreased high single digits. And our International sales volume, including royalty volume, through July 23, decreased at a low single digit rate, primarily due to the alcohol prohibition in Bihar. As ever, please keep in mind that these numbers represent only a portion of the current quarter, and trends could change in the weeks ahead. Also as a reminder, following the close of the pending MillerCoors transaction, we plan to discontinue providing these early next quarter volume trends.
At this point, I'll turn it back over to Mark for our outlook, wrap-up and the Q&A. Mark?"

In the second half of this year, we will continue to drive our First Choice for consumer and customer agenda in the geographies and segments where we choose to play, ensuring we build a broader, stronger and a more premium portfolio while driving best-in-class customer service and partnerships. 
In the U.S., MillerCoors remains laser-focused on its strategy to drive total volume growth by 2019. For the first time in many years, our largest business is in line with its volume expectations for the first 6 months. The quarter also provided additional steps towards its growth ambition, with strength in marketing behind flagship brands, Coors Light and Miller Lite, and we're starting to see the positive impact. 
Also we continue to see success in the innovation space. In Above Premium, we remain bullish in the potential of Henry's as the hard soda category continues to grow. In the second quarter, Henry's became the #1 hard soda franchise, and MillerCoors plans to roll out Henry's Hard Cherry Cola this month. 
In the craft segment, MillerCoors will continue to invest buying ad support for Blue Moon and Leinenkugel during the balance of the peak year selling season. MillerCoors also recently announced that it had agreed to purchase a majority interest in Oregon-based Hop Valley Brewing company and to increase its ownership of the Georgia-based Terrapin Beer company from a minority stake to a majority interest. These are highly regarded brewers both in their regions and nationwide, and they further strengthen our leading U.S. craft portfolio, which also includes Blue Moon, Leinenkugel's and Saint Archer. Additionally, next month, at its fall meeting with distributors, the U.S. team will share plans to improve the performance of its Below Premium portfolio. And the team continues to expand its Building with Beer retail strategy beyond on-premise to additional channels to build First Choice customer partnerships. 
With changes pending in the MillerCoors ownership structure, the merger's not one of apprehension, but excitement. In the meantime, everyone at MillerCoors remains disciplined, decisive and accountable for growing our business, transforming our portfolio and driving shareholder value. 
In Canada, we are investing behind new product quality-focused advertising and improved sales execution via our field sales management program. These efforts are aimed not only at improving our premium performance, but also continuing to accelerate our growing Above Premium portfolio. We will continue our position in the hard soda space with Mad Jack root beer and ginger ale, the first major hard soda entries in Canada. 
Additionally, we signed a partnership agreement in May with Brasseur de Montréal to leverage its craft and specialty beers in Québec and across our strong Canada distribution network. Following the close of the pending MillerCoors transaction, we're also looking forward to bringing the Miller brands back into our Canada portfolio.
In Europe, we achieved top line and market share growth in the second quarter on the strength of our core and Above Premium brands, along with the addition of the Rekorderlig Cider and Staropramen brands in the U.K. Increased brand amortization expense will continue to present a headwind for one more quarter, and we'll continue to invest in our core brand portfolio across Europe to continue to grow our share of segment. This will include leveraging our English Premier League sponsorship well beyond Carling in the U.K. to many high-potential brand and market opportunities. We will also continue to premium-ize our portfolio with Coors Light, the Sharp's portfolio led by Doom Bar, Cobra, Rekorderlig and Staropramen in the U.K., as well as Ireland's leading craft brand, Franciscan Well. 
Our International business is focused on continuing to accelerate our overall growth in existing and select new markets while attaining profitability in 2016 on a constant currency basis versus our original 2013 commitment, now excluding the impact of the Bihar alcohol prohibition. Upon closing of the MillerCoors transaction, we will integrate the Miller International brands into our portfolio and leverage a footprint that complements our growth strategy and allows us to gain entrance into high-priority markets while increasing our business scale in current markets. We will also continue to drive rapid growth for Coors Light in Latin America. 
Going forward, the Coors, Miller and Staropramen brands will be the priorities for our International brand portfolio. And in India, we will continue to add scale to our Mount Shivalik business.
To wrap up, in the second half of 2016, we will continue to focus on our First Choice for consumer and customer ambition, all driven through our profit after capital charge lens and with the intent to drive total shareholder returns.
Now before we start the Q&A portion of the call, just a quick comment. As usual, our prepared remarks will be on our website for your reference within a couple of hours this afternoon. Also at 1 p.m. Eastern Time today, Dave Dunnewald will host a follow-up conference call, which is an opportunity for you to ask additional questions regarding our quarterly results. This call will also be available for you to hear via webcast on our website. Additionally, we hope to see many of you at the Barclays Consumer Staples Conference in Boston on September 7.

Central to that is the quality, the breadth and depth of our brand portfolio and our ability to premium-ize our portfolio while building our customer relationships. So we made good on the commitment to step up our investment through the second quarter. I think if you look at our NSR per hectoliter, we saw NSR per hec growth in all of our regions. I'm encouraged by the sequential improvement in our share trends, in all of our regions as well, from Q1 into Q2. But clearly, brand building is a long-term game. And my objective and the executive objective here is to continue to invest in a sustained way. Clearly, the focus is always on the quality of our investments.

And that's what we're doing, and I expect to see us continue to do that through the third quarter as well.

The NSR, which we were quite pleased with, I mean, was broadly in line with the underlying trend in Q1, really, was driven by the COGS. And if you looked at what happened in cost of goods sold in the second half, we broadly offset our inflation with cost savings. And the increase you see there was the increase in some of our marketing investments for impact promotions which go in case. So that was the investment behind the brands. You saw some impact from transactional FX and volume deleverage. But I would look at the first half and say, if you looked at the first half, actually, we had an improvement in COGS of about 0.7%.

I mean, overall, we would characterize that the European quarter is pretty solid and net sales revenue are up at 3%. And what we're trying to do, obviously, is make sure that we've got an appropriate balance between price and volume or NSR per hectoliter and volume, which again, I think we achieved in the quarter. Volumes were up 1.6%, and NSR per hectoliter up 1.3%. So I think that's a reasonably good balance. It is true that the NSR per hectoliter is driven by mix with price under pressure, but that goes back to our to premium-ization strategy. We've been trying to make sure that we invest behind the premium brands to drive the right both portfolio and geographic mix. So whilst pricing is under pressure across many of the markets, I think we're doing a pretty solid job in recognizing that and driving volumes and shares and mix to get to an overall positive revenue growth. So we'd be quite satisfied with it, recognizing that pricing remains competitive."

Sure, Mark. Yes. Look, you probably did just talk about our First Choice agenda just briefly in just saying that against the 3 platforms we've been driving -- lowering our cost base, overhauling our supply chain network and improving the front end, all 3 of those actually are looking good. On the first 2, we continue to see cost savings in the quarter, and that allowed us to drive some of that brand investment that we put behind commercial. And the money that we put behind commercial really went to 3 places. It went to invest behind our growing Above Premium portfolio, which has continued to grow share of beer. So I think actually that's very sticky. Those brands have continued to grow. And Coors Banquet turned in a better than 20% growth again this quarter. I think the second piece is we put money behind our big brands relative to in-case promotions. And I think last year, we had some concerns that we weren't competitive. I think this year, we were well-balanced, and I think that was a positive. And then on the third investment, we pushed investment behind our share of voice. We were under-indexing. And together with really effective advertising copy, we've seen that now continue to grow our brand scores. So growing brand scores is a great telltale sign that you're spending money in the right place. So that's how I describe the brand expense for Q2."

Clearly, Blue Moon is now in many, many markets globally, growing rapidly from a small base. If you look at Staropramen specifically post the StarBev acquisition, we increased investment in the brand, really, across greater Europe, so outside of the Czech market. And we're seeing double-digit growth in many of those markets. My personal perspective is on a greater Europe basis, there's still a lot of runway ahead of us. And one of the changes I announced just in the last couple of weeks, Mark, is that we'll now look at our European business, including our export and license markets, and one of the benefits from that is we have a more holistic Europe approach across all markets on Staropramen. I think outside of Europe, that's part of our thinking and our emerging planning ahead of integration. Staropramen's currently in Canada. We're just kind of testing and incubating the brand there. The U.S. marketplace is slightly more complex because of the distributor relationship or the importer relationship that we inherited when we acquired the StarBev business. We're working our way through that. And there's a broader conversation with Gavin and the team, really looking at where we want to place our bets on our import portfolio going forward, recognizing that we're kind of -- we have an embarrassment of riches with Pilsner Urquell and Peroni and Grolsch and Staropramen potentially in the future. So that's work that we're currently thinking our way through just now. But in terms of the heartland for Staropramen, which is let's call it Greater Europe, very, very solid progress. In Ukraine, which is a really difficult market, we've continued to take share there. So I feel very good about the possibilities ahead for Staropramen as part of our kind of our three-pronged International portfolio, including the addition of the Miller brand."

One is across our existing infrastructures. So as I indicated, we're looking forward to getting the Miller brands back into our portfolio in Canada. And obviously, the volumes in the U.K. and Ireland will roll into our existing business there. The second platform is those markets where we already have route to markets and strong positions, and that will build those positions out further. So for example, in Panama, our business which is a strong Coors business, will step change in scaled terms with the addition of the Miller brands.

We saw 1.2% global volume growth for Coors Light on a year-to-date basis with growth of more than 14% outside of North America.
We had fast-growing innovations in key markets, including Henry's hard soda in the U.S. and Mad Jack in Canada, and we saw global growth year-to-date in our Above Premium portfolio through, for example, Doom Bar and other Sharp's craft [ph] brands in the U.K., Creemore Springs in Belgium in [ph] Canada and our 4 newly acquired brewers in the U.S. We also saw a strong growth by Staropramen across Europe outside of its whole [ph] market. And we also additionally saw cider volume increases with Rekorderlig in Europe and Strongbow in Canada. 
Overall, we continue to strengthen our business through improvements to our sales execution and revenue management capabilities, increased efficiency of our operations and implementation of common global systems. 
Regional highlights for the third quarter and year-to-date are as follows: In the U.S., overall sales to retail volume decreased 4% for the quarter and 2.5% year-to-date on a trailing day adjusted basis, driven primarily by our Below Premium and Premium Light brands. Coors Light and Miller Lite again gained segment market share while STRs declined, reflecting industry trends. Coors Banquet continued to grow STR volume and segment share. And in the higher-margin Above Premium segment, Henry's continues to be the #1 hard soda franchise. Also, our Saint Archer, Terrapin, Hop Valley and revolver [ph] businesses have significantly expanded our craft offering for consumers and customers. 
Domestic net sales revenue per hectoliter grew 1.6% for the quarter and 1.2% year-to-date as a result of favorable net pricing and positive sales mix. On the bottom line, U.S. segment underlying equity income increased 9% in the third quarter, driven primarily by lower cost of goods sold, higher net pricing and positive sales mix. Year-to-date underlying equity income increased 9.3%, primarily due to the factors mentioned above, as well as a $12.3 million anticipated refund of federal excise tax paid in [ph] imports, which we discussed on our last earnings call.
In Canada, net sales per hectoliter in local currency increased 0.6%, driven by growth in our Above Premium brands. This NSR increase reflected headline price increases and positive brand mix, but with higher levels of spin back as we ensured our brands are competitive on a market-by-market basis. 
Our performance in the Above Premium segment continue to be strong as we saw growth in both our own brands and our partner brands. Coors Banquet, Mad Jack and Belgian Moon all continue to deliver stronger growth, and our craft [ph] brands continued to grow share of the total beer category. 
The mainstream segment continue to face market pressure where our brand held [ph] scores for Coors Light and Molson Canadian have continued to improve month-over-month, and our sales execution input measures are similarly improving.
Our COGS per hectoliter increased 3.5% in local currency, with most of the increase being driven by volume deleverage and mix shift to higher-cost products. Our cost savings program continue to be strong and fully offset the impacts of inflation and other cost increases in the quarter. And the bottom line underlying pretax income declined by $15.9 million in the third quarter, driven by lower volume, increased COGS, higher marketing investments and foreign exchange impacts of U.S. dollar-based supplier contracts.
Europe net sales decreased 0.6% in local currency for the third quarter, driven by 1.4% lower volume due to weaker demand versus strong sales last year across much of the region, along with some trade inventory overhang from the Euro 2016 football or soccer championships in the second quarter this year.
Nonetheless, we held our share position in the region and our continued portfolio pre-memorization [ph], and mix management drove a 1.2% increase in net sales revenue per hectoliter from local currency. In the quarter, we achieved strong growth by Coors Light, Staropramen outside of the Czech Republic and our craft [ph] portfolios, including Blue Moon, Doom Bar and the other Sharp's brands, as well as Rekorderlig Cider. Underlying pretax income was lower in the quarter due to higher brand amortization expenses, lower net pension benefit and unfavorable foreign currency movements, especially related to the depreciation of the British pound. Year-to-date, the benefit of higher net sales and NSR per hectoliter from local currency volume and market share in Europe were more than offset by unfavorable foreign currency movements, higher brand amortization expense, lower pension benefits and the termination of the Heineken contract brewing arrangements in the U.K.
Our International business continues to drive Coors Light momentum with year-to-date volume for this brand, up mid single digits, led by growth in Latin America and Australia. Excluding the impact of total alcohol prohibition in Bihar, India and the transfer of the Staropramen U.K. business to our Europe segment, our year-to-date underlying pretax performance has significantly improved versus last year, driven by volume growth in the remaining international markets.
Now I'll turn it over to Mauricio to give third quarter financial highlights and new performance metrics. Mauricio?"
263765,404132594,1068359,"Molson Coors Brewing Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2016",2016-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Molson Coors Beverage Company","Executives","Thank you, Mark, and hello, everybody. As a reminder, all of the results that I will be discussing are in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise noted. So our third quarter and year-to-date financial headlines are as follows: Net sales were down approximately",1598,"Thank you, Mark, and hello, everybody. As a reminder, all of the results that I will be discussing are in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise noted. 
So our third quarter and year-to-date financial headlines are as follows: 
Net sales were down approximately 7% in U.S. dollars in the third quarter and about 5% year-to-date, primarily due to currency movements, especially in Europe, as well as lower worldwide volume. On a constant currency basis, net sales decreased 2.2% in the third quarter and were virtually unchanged year-to-date versus the same period last year. Our net sales per hectoliter in constant currency increased 1.3% in the quarter and 0.9% year-to-date due to positive mix. 
On a U.S. GAAP basis, we reported third quarter after-tax income from continuing operations attributable to Molson Coors of $202.5 million, up from $13.7 million a year ago. This increase was primarily driven by cycling $275 million of impairment charges recorded for certain Europe brands last year. On a year-to-date basis, U.S. GAAP after-tax income increased 67.5% to $539.8 million, driven by brand impairment charges last year and a gain on the sale of our Vancouver brewery earlier this year. Third quarter underlying after-tax income decreased 14.3% to $222.7 million or $1.03 per diluted share, driven by lower worldwide volume, a higher underlying tax rate and higher brand investments globally, which were partially offset by positive mix and higher underlying U.S. equity income.
Year-to-date underlying after-tax income decreased 5.5% to $576.4 million, driven by the same factors as in the quarter, along with negative foreign currency movements. Underlying pretax income declined 6.2% for the third quarter and 1.3% year-to-date. Underlying EBITDA in the quarter was $403.1 million, 4.1% lower than a year ago, and our year-to-date underlying EBITDA declined 0.8%. 
Underlying free cash flow in the first 3 quarters of 2016 was $469.4 million. This represents a decrease of $24.9 million from the prior year, primarily driven by lower underlying after-tax income and lower distributions from MillerCoors. 
Total debt at the end of the third quarter was $9.9 billion. Cash and cash equivalents totaled slightly less than $10 billion, resulting in a net cash position of $94 million as we prepared to close the MillerCoors transaction on October 11. Please see the earnings release we distributed earlier this morning for a detailed review of our business unit financial results in the quarter. Also, please see the Investor Relations page of our website this morning for updated 2015 full year and 2016 year-to-date pro forma financial statements that reflect our preliminary purchase accounting for the transaction.
Now looking forward to the remainder of 2016, following are some financial quarters to consider for the fourth quarter. 
Our Europe business results will continue to reflect lower net pension benefits. Total alcohol prohibition in Bihar has presented a headwind in our International business since its enactment in April this year, and we will continue to address this within our business. And finally foreign currency translation, which at current exchange rate, would be a headwind of approximately $8 million to our underlying pretax results in the fourth quarter this year, with all of the impact in Europe. Given the volatility of our key foreign currencies, particularly the British pound, it is important to watch these rates closely.
Now regarding 2016 guidance, all of the following metrics exclude any effects of the MillerCoors and Miller global brands transaction. For the full year, we continue to expect cash contributions to our defined benefit pension plans to be in the range of $45 million to $65 million in 2016 and pension expense of approximately $17 million including our 42% of MillerCoors contributions and expense. Underlying capital spending of approximately $220 million, which excludes capital this year related to the construction of our new brewery in British Columbia, which we expect to be largely funded by the proceeds from the sale of our Vancouver brewery earlier this month. MG&A expense and [ph] corporate of approximately $120 million on an underlying basis, which excludes expenses related to the MillerCoors transaction. Consolidated net interest expense of approximately $110 million on an underlying basis, which excludes transaction-related interest expense and income.  An underlying effective tax rate in the range of 18% to 22%, assuming no further changes in tax laws, settlement of tax audits, excess tax deductions for share-based compensation or adjustments to our uncertain tax position. As far as our cost outlook is concerned, we continue to expect full year 2016 cost of goods sold per hectoliter in Canada and Europe to increase at a low single-digit rate in local currency, and we expect a low single-digit decrease in MillerCoors and a double-digit increase in international versus prior year.  As we first mentioned several months ago, with the completion of the MillerCoors transaction, we are no longer providing the most recent volume trends for each of our businesses. 
Earlier this year, we told you that we would share more specifics regarding 3 new performance metrics with you once the transaction closed. These metrics are:  Transaction adjusted EPS, an all-in multiyear cost savings target and an early view of our combined company underlying free cash flow target for 2017 So taking these in order, transaction adjusted EPS is a new non-GAAP performance measure we are introducing to provide enhanced visibility to the performance and value of our company post transaction. To calculate this measure, we start with underlying book EPS, a non-GAAP measure, and then add back after-tax book amortization that is directly related to the transaction, and we then add the transaction related cash tax benefits. Based on our latest pro forma financial statements, which we will post on our website this morning, our 2015 pro forma transaction adjusted EPS was $6.11 per diluted share on an underlying basis. This calculation includes transaction-related after-tax book amortization of approximately $42 million and cash tax benefits of $275 million per year, but it does not include any pretax income related to the Miller global brands nor any benefit from deal synergies. Because the routes to market and supply-chain structures for many of the Miller global brands markets are being developed, the cost and margin structure for these businesses are also work-in-progress. As a result, we have decided to exclude the Miller global brands from our pro forma results for periods prior to the close of the transaction. 
For the first 3 quarters of 2016, pro forma transaction adjusted EPS was $5.43 per diluted share, an increase of 4% versus $5.22 per diluted share for the first 3 quarters of 2015.
Going on to our second metric, cost savings over the next 3 years. We have set an all-in target of $550 million, which will be made up of ongoing cost savings in all of our businesses, as well as transaction-related synergies, all of which will be delivered by the third full year of our combined company, which is 2019. Approximately half of this 3-year cost savings target is synergies, which represents a synergy goal that is nearly 40% larger and 25% faster than the original $200 million synergies target over 4 years that we shared with you when we announced the transaction nearly a year ago. We expect the synergies delivery to be weighted [ph] towards years 2 and 3, while the other cost savings will be weighted towards years 1 and 2 of the program. As we have been discussing for the past year, we expect these cost savings to come primarily from the areas of global procurement and shared services, along with North American supply chain so they will primarily benefit the cost of goods sold line. As part of the planning process for the past year, we have also identified a moderate amount of savings from information systems. Please note that we do not plan to provide additional specifics regarding annual phasing of the cost savings or a detailed breakout of transaction-related synergies versus other cost savings. 
Related to this cost savings goal, we anticipate incurring approximately $350 million of onetime incremental cash costs over 3 years to capture synergies, about evenly split between incremental capital spending and cash operating expense, primarily in the first 2 years of the program. Note that the incremental CapEx would be on top of our recent all-in CapEx run rate of approximately $650 million to $700 million, plus or minus 10%, including 100% of MillerCoors CapEx in recent years. With a base CapEx spend of approximately $2.1 billion over the past 3 years, the CapEx needed to capture synergies represents an increment of less than 10% to our current run rate.  We will continue to apply our PACC model to these and all other significant potential capital and cash deployment decisions to help ensure that they are aligned with our priorities. 
Finally, as always, when these cost savings initiatives are completed in 3 years, we will continue to pursue cost reductions across our business in order to provide resources to help drive our top line, bottom line and shareholder value. 
Finally, to help you model our business, we also want to share our preliminary underlying free cash flow target for 2017, which is $1.1 billion, plus or minus 10%. Note that this target includes the impact of incremental interest expense, U.S. tax expense and synergies-related CapEx in 2017 as well as the cash tax benefits resulting from the transaction. As in the past, we plan to report back to you each year regarding how we are performing against these targets.
So at this point, I'll turn it back over to Mark for highlights of the transaction, business outlook and Q&A. Mark?"
263765,404132594,1068359,"Molson Coors Brewing Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2016",2016-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Molson Coors Beverage Company","Executives","Thanks, Mauricio. This clearly is a historic time in the evolution of Molson Coors. Three weeks ago, we completed our acquisition of the remaining 58% [ph] stake in the MillerCoors joint venture, along with the Miller global brand portfolio. We emerged as",1446,"Thanks, Mauricio. This clearly is a historic time in the evolution of Molson Coors. Three weeks ago, we completed our acquisition of the remaining 58% [ph] stake in the MillerCoors joint venture, along with the Miller global brand portfolio. We emerged as the world's third largest brewer, bringing together Molson Coors and MillerCoors into a bigger, better organization. As one company with an expanded portfolio of iconic brands, we intend to leverage our increased scale, resources, synergies and combined commercial experience to accelerate our First Choice agenda and deliver long-term shareholder value. Because of this game-changing transaction, Molson Coors now controls 100% of the highly strategic and attractive U.S. business and will accelerate new growth opportunities in emerging and developed beer markets globally through the Miller brand rights. This transaction also includes our operating efficiency and go-to-market strategy by step-changing our commercial capability on a truly global scale. Financially, this is a compelling combination based on a very attractive price, planned operational synergies, substantial cash tax benefits and the attractive financial package that we put in place earlier this year.
As a reminder, for $12 billion of cash, we have purchased the remaining 58% [ph] of the MillerCoors joint venture that we didn't already own. Sole [ph] ownership of the Miller brands, which outside of the U.S., will be managed in more than 50 countries by our Molson Coors International, Molson Coors Canada, Molson Coors Europe businesses; perpetual royalty-free U.S. licensees for the existing SAB Miller import and license firms, [ph] including [ph], Pilsner Urquell, Foster's, Grolsch and Redd's, for which MillerCoors most recently paid royalties of approximately $16 [ph] million in 2015. And finally, because this is an asset transaction for U.S. tax purposes, we will see immediate cash tax benefits that we now estimate will exceed $275 million annually for the next 15 years. This represents an increase from our previous estimate of more than $250 million per year due to the detailed tax due [ph] diligence work that we've completed during the past year. 
The purchase price implies a headline enterprise value multiple of 11.5x 2015 combined underlying EBITDA. By including the present value of the cash tax benefits of purchase multiple drops in the effect of 9.2x. These tax benefits are common with this type of asset transaction, and they carried a high degree of certainty. As such, we believe that this is the most appropriate way to value this combination. This represents very attractive purchase multiple even though it does not include anticipated benefit of our transaction related synergies. We expect this combination to be accretive to underlying diluted EPS and transaction adjusted EPS in the first full year of operations before synergies, and we expect it to meet our rates in year 1, which is consistent with our disciplined use of cash framework.
Now looking forward as a combined company, our teams are focused on driving our First Choice agenda, finishing the year with strong performance in each of our business cease and hitting the ground running on integration. You've heard us speak about these things in the past each of our businesses will continue to focus on transforming our portfolio to the Above Premium segment, introducing value-driving innovation, integrating the Miller brands and lifting and shifting best practices in talent across the global organization.
To provide just a few examples by business. In the U.S., and will focus on the development and integration of these new craft partners in Saint Archer, Terrapin, Hot Belly and Revolver. In FMBs, Henry will add a new hard great favor to its lineup of hard sodas. We're introducing a new line of hard sparkling waters in the growing alcohol sparkly water category. Henry's sparkling will be launched internationally in March with lemon and lime and passionfruit flavors. Redd's and Blue Moon Belgian White will introduce new aluminum paper packaging in the second quarter of 2017. 
Over the past few months, we built a strategy that elevates across our economy portfolio. For example, Miller highlight recently announced plans to reintroduce new advertising creative that brings back its classic jingle, If you got time, we got the beer, while also revamping its packaging to further play our Heritage. Elsewhere across the Economy portfolio, will be reintroduced nationally and opening price point and Milwaukee's Best is getting a total packaging update to get a fresh new look. And beginning early in 2017, we'll hopefully revamp Light including our new packaging and advertising. Our innovation in the value category, we're introducing spiked watermelon to this new reserve brand family, and we're increasing the size of our PET bottle singles from 40 MCs to 42 MCs for the same price, again to deliver value to our consumers and customers. In Canada, our team is integrating the Miller brands back into our portfolio and will double down on Above Premium MGD. We're also assessing opportunities for Miller high line and other U.S. brands that we can lift and shift to the CAD to market. Mad Jack is performing well in the FMB space and will consider under innovative options to drive value for our Canada consumers and customers.
In Europe, we now have the Miller brands in the U.K. and Ireland, and this business is also preparing to begin to managing the international license and export business in the region starting on January 1. This will allow us to drive Staropramen, Carling another lead brands with fully aligned strategies across Europe. We'll also continue to build our craft portfolio including further expansion of Blue Moon across the region.
Our International business is well in the way to full integration of the Miller global brands into our portfolio, and we're leveraging to complement our growth strategy emerging markets. For example, in Panama and Honduras where our partners are have already embraced Coors Light, we're ready to accelerate growth with the addition of the Miller brands. The International team has also begun planning -- the planning process for transitioning Puerto Rico over for MillerCoors on January 1. Going forward, the Coors and Miller brands will be the priority brands for our International business. 
To summarize, we're delighted to come MillerCoors transaction, which is a compelling strategic and financial opportunity for our company and our shareholders that catapults Molson Coors in the next level. And this combination fits into our key priorities in 3 specific areas. Firstly in brand lead growth, the cash tax benefits and cost savings made possible transaction provide resources that we can invest an accelerating the transformation of the front end of our business, for example, investing behind our core brands across all of our geographies, premiumizing our portfolio and engaging with consumers in new ways, including cross-border exchange of category changing innovation, expanding the depth and reach of our international brands in fast-growing markets including securing for certain future for the Miller brands globally; and finally, leveraging our shared commercial capabilities exploring brand building world-class leadership leadership and unrivaled customer excellence.
Secondly, this transformation of our company offers unique opportunities for us to drive cash generation through substantial tax benefits, cost synergies, cross-border working capital improvements and disciplined use of our PACC model across the combined company. We expect all of these benefits to provide strong free cash flow and allow us to acquisition debt and maintain our commitment investment grade debt ratings. And thirdly, this transaction represents a prudent high return use of cash Molson Coors and our shareholders. We're using this transaction not only to make Molson Coors a bigger company while also a better company without integration complexity normally found in a deal of this size. As we focus on deleveraging our balance sheet over the next 2 to 3 years, we've suspended our share repurchase program and have announced that we plan to maintain our current dividend per share level, and we'll revisit our dividend policy once deleveraging is well underway. Overall, this combination is a game changer in our ambition to become First Choice for consumer and customers, and it's highly consistent with our goals and our focus on building extraordinary brands, delivering innovation and driving significant value to our shareholders.

You're aware of some of the changes that we've made at the leadership level and spread and spread number 2 in the customer areas cost move across from Europe.

Our first, FX, transactional FX alluded to U.S. sourcing of raw materials, lower volumes and higher marketing spend. And on the volume side the Mark pointed out, we're seeing some  shifts. We've been growing share in the Atlantic provinces. The west, which is a difficult area for us in September we saw progress in the third quarter September actually was flat share. In Ontario, big market for us to resolve growing share CBO and on the on-premise. So the number of tough areas is actually shrinking, and I think our increased execution will help that. At the same time, the higher levels of marketing spend are yielding positive improvements in our brand scores. And of course, we expect that we will be able to translate that into improved volumes. So that's a trend the quarter [indiscernible] the home of Canada's. I mean Canada is something that we are thinking very carefully about not only the business but also as an industry.

Now there are obviously some tailwinds that are represented in the form of the $275 million of cash tax benefits but also some headwinds because we have a significant interest, expense increase of around $250 million per annum because of the acquisition financing. There's additional D&A expense from the step-up due to the fair value measurement required by purchase accounting of around $70 million, and there's higher income taxes because now we own the other 58% of MillerCoors so we're paying additional taxes of around 200 or we'll be paying additional taxes of around $200 million in 2017 versus what we did before."

So the first one, bigger picture, something that every investor I talked to ask me is what the track record of Gavin Hattersley and why are they the right people to execute here? And of course, they asked the question with great respect but people look at Philippe having been a dud for 20 years. So what we want to understand you look at MillerCoors, clearly a few years ago, Tom Long over 4 years and now Gavin so if you can answer the question in terms of what your track record and why should investors be comfortable that this is the right management team to execute the significant plan? And the second question maybe more for Mauricio just in terms of numbers this different ways to get -- to judge the guidance that you've given us today. One way I judge it as I look at the cost savings that MillerCoors generated over the last 4 -- last 5 years on average, right? About $120 million per annum, ADA last year, you're running about $80 million this year, if I look at the $90 million next year for the third quarter. So you've done $120 million on average over the last 5 years. But then I look at the synergy number you're giving us today, $275 million divided by 3, that's $92 million. And then I take out from the balance the Molson Coors savings ex MillerCoors, there's $132 [ph] million of cost savings in MillerCoors. So synergies plus cost savings in MillerCoors, and I know the lines get blurred, are about 124 per annum over the next 3 years, which is what MillerCoors did over the last 5 years. So not sure how to judge that number. Nice that you can sustain it but if this is the significant transaction and there's this before of opportunities that we talked about in terms of cost savings because now you own the full company, why would the cost savings $124 million as per my math total would be pretty much similar to what we been doing for the last 5 years. I guess if you can answer -- well, those are the 2 questions."

So I will just leave it there. I'm not going to talk to any more detail beyond that. And let me just back up in the second question you asked for Mauricio, what we have endeavored to do here is get transparency and ensure that we are not duplicating any of the cost savings in our business. And clearly, we've now set a target for the next 3 years. We'll update that on an annual basis. There was a lot of questions around the synergies number, and we have scaled that up and picked up the pace on the synergies number, and we've made sure that there's no duplication with the synergies on an underlying cost savings, and we'll continue to test ourselves as to whether that number can be further improved as we actually get into fully running the business. But we feel it's a number we can meet and will attempt to beat and make sense as we look at a business which if you remember has very, very little geographical overlap. You got to drive this by a number of restructuring initiatives, setting up things like shared services globally, and we'll get at that, and we'll update you if there's any new news in that number, but we feel it's the right number for our business at this point in time."

One of the things that I indicated earlier this year was that we have developed a small global growth group led by Candy.

Clearly, some of those opportunities will require incremental investment in our business, but we'll look at those and around as we aggregate our total sales and marketing spend across our business. So I'm more interested in the quality of our marketing, and I think there's plenty of examples, and there's one in the U.S. market at the moment where people are competitors have been spending very aggressively, and let's just say the incremental spend always by success and really focus on the quality of our marketing and the discipline of our execution, and we'll continue to drive efficiencies across our marketing spend. And then if there's a return, it makes sense for us will put it through the PACC model and we will spend incrementally to generate additional returns.

But you get to the point where each SKU has to deliver on a velocity basis and has to actually demonstrate customers and consumers. And as Gavin mentioned earlier, things like seasonal packs which been a big driver of the craft industry of really started to come under pressure because consumers are now, in essence, making up their own seasonal packs by the way they actually show up in shelves. I think what you're starting to see us from a retailer perspective, it really simplified the offering and the well marks recently as they reset all of their shares sets. So the more progressive retailers are really trying to focus on those brands have got long-term distinct positionings and drive velocity per SKU. Also think from a consumer perspective, because most of the craft growth has been driven in the back of heavily hopped IPAs, consumers are recognizing that beers are great, but they're not beers probably take here through a long location and were starting to see some consumer step back into some of the American light brands. So I think it's just craft starting to kind of shake itself out with the brands well-positioned, clearly distinctive of that the retailers really starting to simplify their offer. And that's in think that starting to have an impact over all in the craft velocity or craft trends. Gavin, I don't know if you want to add anything to that and then pick up the STW, STRs questions?"

Today, Mauricio and I will split our call into 2 parts. First, we will take you through our third quarter 2016 results to, in essence, close out Molson Coors Brewing Company as it's been structured for the past several years. Then we'll turn our attention to our recently completed MillerCoors transaction and [indiscernible] updated financial reporting metrics, along with some perspective for the fourth quarter of this year.
And in third quarter, we continue to focus on our First Choice ambition and on building a stronger, broader and more premium brand portfolio, underpinned by incremental sales and marketing investment as we've discussed all year.
Business highlights for the quarter and year-to-date included: Increased net sales revenue per hectoliter on a constant currency basis in all of our businesses for the quarter and year-to-date. We increased investments in our brands globally. Coors Light Miller Lite again gained share in the U.S. Premium Lite segment for the quarter, including the highest segment share gain in 3 years for Coors Light. We saw 1.2% global volume growth for Coors Light on a year-to-date basis with growth of more than 14% outside of North America.
We had fast-growing innovations in key markets, including Henry's hard soda in the U.S. and Mad Jack in Canada, and we saw global growth year-to-date in our Above Premium portfolio through, for example, Doom Bar and other Sharp's craft brands in the U.K., Creemore Springs and Belgian Moon in Canada and our 4 newly acquired brewers in the U.S. We also saw a strong growth by Staropramen across Europe outside of its whole market. And we also additionally saw cider volume increases with Rekorderlig in Europe and Strongbow in Canada. 
Overall, we continue to strengthen our business through improvements to our sales execution and revenue management capabilities, increased efficiency of our operations and implementation of common global systems. 
Regional highlights for the third quarter and year-to-date are as follows: In the U.S., overall sales to retail volume decreased 4% for the quarter and 2.5% year-to-date on a trailing day adjusted basis, driven primarily by our Below Premium and Premium Light brands. Coors Light and Miller Lite again gained segment market share while STRs declined, reflecting industry trends. Coors Banquet continued to grow STR volume and segment share. And in the higher-margin Above Premium segment, Henry's continues to be the #1 hard soda franchise. Also, our Saint Archer, Terrapin, Hop Valley and Revolver businesses have significantly expanded our craft offering for consumers and customers. 
Domestic net sales revenue per hectoliter grew 1.6% for the quarter and 1.2% year-to-date as a result of favorable net pricing and positive sales mix. On the bottom line, U.S. segment underlying equity income increased 9% in the third quarter, driven primarily by lower cost of goods sold, higher net pricing and positive sales mix. Year-to-date underlying equity income increased 9.3%, primarily due to the factors mentioned above, as well as a $12.3 million anticipated refund of federal excise tax paid in imports, which we discussed on our last earnings call.
In Canada, net sales per hectoliter in local currency increased 0.6%, driven by growth in our Above Premium brands. This NSR increase reflected headline price increases and positive brand mix, but with higher levels of spin back as we ensured our brands are competitive on a market-by-market basis. 
Our performance in the Above Premium segment continue to be strong as we saw growth in both our own brands and our partner brands. Coors Banquet, Mad Jack and Belgian Moon all continue to deliver strong growth, and our craft brands continued to grow share of the total beer category. 
The mainstream segment continued to face market pressure where our brand health scores for Coors Light and Molson Canadian have continued to improve month-over-month, and our sales execution input measures are similarly improving.
Our COGS per hectoliter increased 3.5% in local currency, with most of the increase being driven by volume deleverage and mix shift to higher-cost products. Our cost savings program continue to be strong and fully offset the impacts of inflation and other cost increases in the quarter. And the bottom line underlying pretax income declined by $15.9 million in the third quarter, driven by lower volume, increased COGS, higher marketing investments and foreign exchange impacts of U.S. dollar-based supplier contracts.
Europe net sales decreased 0.6% in local currency for the third quarter, driven by 1.4% lower volume due to weaker demand versus strong sales last year across much of the region, along with some trade inventory overhang from the Euro 2016 football or soccer championships in the second quarter this year.
Nonetheless, we held our share position in the region, and our continued portfolio premiumization and mix management drove a 1.2% increase in net sales revenue per hectoliter from local currency. In the quarter, we achieved strong growth by Coors Light, Staropramen outside of the Czech Republic and our craft portfolios, including Blue Moon, Doom Bar and the other Sharp's brands, as well as Rekorderlig Cider. Underlying pretax income was lower in the quarter due to higher brand amortization expenses, lower net pension benefit and unfavorable foreign currency movements, especially related to the depreciation of the British pound. Year-to-date, the benefit of higher net sales and NSR per hectoliter from local currency volume and market share in Europe were more than offset by unfavorable foreign currency movements, higher brand amortization expense, lower pension benefits and the termination of the Heineken contract brewing arrangements in the U.K.
Our International business continues to drive Coors Light momentum with year-to-date volume for this brand, up mid single digits, led by growth in Latin America and Australia. Excluding the impact of total alcohol prohibition in Bihar, India and the transfer of the Staropramen U.K. business to our Europe segment, our year-to-date underlying pretax performance has significantly improved versus last year, driven by volume growth in the remaining international markets.
Now I'll turn it over to Mauricio to give third quarter financial highlights and new performance metrics. Mauricio?"

As a reminder, all of the results that I will be discussing are in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise noted. 
So our third quarter and year-to-date financial headlines are as follows: 
Net sales were down approximately 7% in U.S. dollars in the third quarter and about 5% year-to-date, primarily due to currency movements, especially in Europe, as well as lower worldwide volume. On a constant currency basis, net sales decreased 2.2% in the third quarter and were virtually unchanged year-to-date versus the same period last year. Our net sales per hectoliter in constant currency increased 1.3% in the quarter and 0.9% year-to-date due to positive mix. 
On a U.S. GAAP basis, we reported third quarter after-tax income from continuing operations attributable to Molson Coors of $202.5 million, up from $13.7 million a year ago. This increase was primarily driven by cycling $275 million of impairment charges recorded for certain Europe brands last year. On a year-to-date basis, U.S. GAAP after-tax income increased 67.5% to $539.8 million, driven by brand impairment charges last year and a gain on the sale of our Vancouver brewery earlier this year. Third quarter underlying after-tax income decreased 14.3% to $222.7 million or $1.03 per diluted share, driven by lower worldwide volume, a higher underlying tax rate and higher brand investments globally, which were partially offset by positive mix and higher underlying U.S. equity income.
Year-to-date underlying after-tax income decreased 5.5% to $576.4 million, driven by the same factors as in the quarter, along with negative foreign currency movements. Underlying pretax income declined 6.2% for the third quarter and 1.3% year-to-date. Underlying EBITDA in the quarter was $403.1 million, 4.1% lower than a year ago, and our year-to-date underlying EBITDA declined 0.8%. 
Underlying free cash flow in the first 3 quarters of 2016 was $469.4 million. This represents a decrease of $24.9 million from the prior year, primarily driven by lower underlying after-tax income and lower distributions from MillerCoors. 
Total debt at the end of the third quarter was $9.9 billion. Cash and cash equivalents totaled slightly less than $10 billion, resulting in a net cash position of $94 million as we prepared to close the MillerCoors transaction on October 11. Please see the earnings release we distributed earlier this morning for a detailed review of our business unit financial results in the quarter. Also, please see the Investor Relations page of our website this morning for updated 2015 full year and 2016 year-to-date pro forma financial statements that reflect our preliminary purchase accounting for the transaction.
Now looking forward to the remainder of 2016, following are some financial quarters to consider for the fourth quarter. 
Our Europe business results will continue to reflect lower net pension benefits. Total alcohol prohibition in Bihar has presented a headwind in our International business since its enactment in April this year, and we will continue to address this within our business. And finally foreign currency translation, which at current exchange rate, would be a headwind of approximately $8 million to our underlying pretax results in the fourth quarter this year, with all of the impact in Europe. Given the volatility of our key foreign currencies, particularly the British pound, it is important to watch these rates closely.
Now regarding 2016 guidance, all of the following metrics exclude any effects of the MillerCoors and Miller global brands transaction. For the full year, we continue to expect cash contributions to our defined benefit pension plans to be in the range of $45 million to $65 million in 2016 and pension expense of approximately $17 million including our 42% of MillerCoors contributions and expense. Underlying capital spending of approximately $220 million, which excludes capital this year related to the construction of our new brewery in British Columbia, which we expect to be largely funded by the proceeds from the sale of our Vancouver brewery earlier this month. MG&A expense in Corporate of approximately $120 million on an underlying basis, which excludes expenses related to the MillerCoors transaction. Consolidated net interest expense of approximately $110 million on an underlying basis, which excludes transaction-related interest expense and income.  An underlying effective tax rate in the range of 18% to 22%, assuming no further changes in tax laws, settlement of tax audits, excess tax deductions for share-based compensation or adjustments to our uncertain tax position. As far as our cost outlook is concerned, we continue to expect full year 2016 cost of goods sold per hectoliter in Canada and Europe to increase at a low single-digit rate in local currency, and we expect a low single-digit decrease in MillerCoors and a double-digit increase in international versus prior year.  As we first mentioned several months ago, with the completion of the MillerCoors transaction, we are no longer providing the most recent volume trends for each of our businesses. 
Earlier this year, we told you that we would share more specifics regarding 3 new performance metrics with you once the transaction closed. These metrics are:  Transaction adjusted EPS, an all-in multiyear cost savings target and an early view of our combined company underlying free cash flow target for 2017 So taking these in order, transaction adjusted EPS is a new non-GAAP performance measure we are introducing to provide enhanced visibility to the performance and value of our company post transaction. To calculate this measure, we start with underlying book EPS, a non-GAAP measure, and then add back after-tax book amortization that is directly related to the transaction, and we then add the transaction related cash tax benefits. Based on our latest pro forma financial statements, which we will post on our website this morning, our 2015 pro forma transaction adjusted EPS was $6.11 per diluted share on an underlying basis. This calculation includes transaction-related after-tax book amortization of approximately $42 million and cash tax benefits of $275 million per year, but it does not include any pretax income related to the Miller global brands nor any benefit from deal synergies. Because the routes to market and supply-chain structures for many of the Miller global brands markets are being developed, the cost and margin structure for these businesses are also work-in-progress. As a result, we have decided to exclude the Miller global brands from our pro forma results for periods prior to the close of the transaction. 
For the first 3 quarters of 2016, pro forma transaction adjusted EPS was $5.43 per diluted share, an increase of 4% versus $5.22 per diluted share for the first 3 quarters of 2015.
Going on to our second metric, cost savings over the next 3 years. We have set an all-in target of $550 million, which will be made up of ongoing cost savings in all of our businesses, as well as transaction-related synergies, all of which will be delivered by the third full year of our combined company, which is 2019. Approximately half of this 3-year cost savings target is synergies, which represents a synergy goal that is nearly 40% larger and 25% faster than the original $200 million synergies target over 4 years that we shared with you when we announced the transaction nearly a year ago. We expect the synergies delivery to be weighted towards years 2 and 3, while the other cost savings will be weighted towards years 1 and 2 of the program. As we have been discussing for the past year, we expect these cost savings to come primarily from the areas of global procurement and shared services, along with North American supply chain so they will primarily benefit the cost of goods sold line. As part of the planning process for the past year, we have also identified a moderate amount of savings from information systems. Please note that we do not plan to provide additional specifics regarding annual phasing of the cost savings or a detailed breakout of transaction-related synergies versus other cost savings. 
Related to this cost savings goal, we anticipate incurring approximately $350 million of onetime incremental cash costs over 3 years to capture synergies, about evenly split between incremental capital spending and cash operating expense, primarily in the first 2 years of the program. Note that the incremental CapEx would be on top of our recent all-in CapEx run rate of approximately $650 million to $700 million, plus or minus 10%, including 100% of MillerCoors CapEx in recent years. With a base CapEx spend of approximately $2.1 billion over the past 3 years, the CapEx needed to capture synergies represents an increment of less than 10% to our current run rate.  We will continue to apply our PACC model to these and all other significant potential capital and cash deployment decisions to help ensure that they are aligned with our priorities. 
Finally, as always, when these cost savings initiatives are completed in 3 years, we will continue to pursue cost reductions across our business in order to provide resources to help drive our top line, bottom line and shareholder value. 
Finally, to help you model our business, we also want to share our preliminary underlying free cash flow target for 2017, which is $1.1 billion, plus or minus 10%. Note that this target includes the impact of incremental interest expense, U.S. tax expense and synergies-related CapEx in 2017 as well as the cash tax benefits resulting from the transaction. As in the past, we plan to report back to you each year regarding how we are performing against these targets.
So at this point, I'll turn it back over to Mark for highlights of the transaction, business outlook and Q&A. Mark?"

Three weeks ago, we completed our acquisition of the remaining 58% stake in the MillerCoors joint venture, along with the Miller global brand portfolio. We emerged as the",1467,"Thanks, Mauricio. This clearly is a historic time in the evolution of Molson Coors. Three weeks ago, we completed our acquisition of the remaining 58% stake in the MillerCoors joint venture, along with the Miller global brand portfolio. We emerged as the world's third largest brewer, bringing together Molson Coors and MillerCoors into a bigger, better organization. As one company with an expanded portfolio of iconic brands, we intend to leverage our increased scale, resources, synergies and combined commercial experience to accelerate our First Choice agenda and deliver long-term shareholder value. Because of this game-changing transaction, Molson Coors now controls 100% of the highly strategic and attractive U.S. business and will accelerate new growth opportunities in emerging and developed beer markets globally through the Miller brand rights. This transaction also includes our operating efficiency and go-to-market strategy by step-changing our commercial capability on a truly global scale. Financially, this is a compelling combination based on a very attractive price, planned operational synergies, substantial cash tax benefits and the attractive financial package that we put in place earlier this year.
As a reminder, for $12 billion of cash, we have purchased the remaining 58% of the MillerCoors joint venture that we didn't already own. Sole ownership of the Miller brands, which outside of the U.S., will be managed in more than 50 countries by our Molson Coors International, Molson Coors Canada, Molson Coors Europe businesses; perpetual royalty-free U.S. licensees for the existing SAB Miller import and licensed brands, including Peroni, Pilsner Urquell, Foster's, Grolsch and Redd's, for which MillerCoors most recently paid royalties of approximately $16 [ph] million in 2015. And finally, because this is an asset transaction for U.S. tax purposes, we will see immediate cash tax benefits that we now estimate will exceed $275 million annually for the next 15 years. This represents an increase from our previous estimate of more than $250 million per year due to the detailed tax diligence work that we've completed during the past year. 
The purchase price implies a headline enterprise value multiple of 11.5x 2015 combined underlying EBITDA. By including the present value of the cash tax benefits, the purchase multiple drops in effect of 9.2x. These tax benefits are common with this type of asset transaction, and they carry a high degree of certainty. As such, we believe this is the most appropriate way to value this combination. This represents a very attractive purchase multiple even though it does not include the anticipated benefit of our transaction-related synergies. We expect this combination to be accretive to underlying diluted EPS and transaction adjusted EPS in the first full year of operations before synergies, and we expected to meet our PACC hurdle rates in year 1, which is consistent with our disciplined use of cash framework.
Now looking forward as a combined company, our teams are focused on driving our First Choice agenda, finishing the year with strong performance in each of our businesses and hitting the ground running on integration. You've heard us speak about these themes in the past, but each of our businesses will continue to focus on transforming our portfolio to the Above Premium segment, introducing value-driving innovation, integrating the Miller brands and lifting and shifting best practices and talent across our global organization.
To provide just a few examples by business. In the U.S., Tenth and Blake will focus on the development and integration of these new craft partners in Archer, Terrapin, Hop valley and Revolver. In FMBs, Henry's will add a new hard grape flavor to its line of hard sodas, while introducing a new line of hard sparkling waters in the growing alcohol sparkling water category. Henry's hard sparkling will be launched nationally in March with lemon and lime and passion fruit flavors. Redd's and Blue Moon Belgian White will introduce new aluminum paint packaging in the second quarter of 2017. 
Over the past few months, we've built a strategy that elevates across our economy portfolio. For example, Miller highlight recently announced plans to reintroduce new advertising created that brings back its classic jingle, ""If you've got time, we've got the beer,"" while also revamping its packaging to further play up it's unique heritage. 
Elsewhere across the Economy portfolio, Hams will be reintroduced nationally at an opening price point and Milwaukee's Best is getting a total packaging update to give a fresh new look. And beginning early in 2017, we'll fully revamp Keystone Light including all new packaging and advertising. 
For our innovation in the value category, we are introducing spiked watermelon, to the still reserve brand family, and we're increasing the size of our PET bottle singles from 40 MCs to 42 MCs for the same price, again, to deliver value to our consumers and customers. 
In Canada, our team is integrating the Miller brands back into our portfolio and will double down on Above Premium MGD. We're also assessing the opportunities for Miller High Life and other U.S. brands that we can lift and shift to the Canada market. Mad Jack is performing well in the FMB space and we will consider other innovative options that will drive value for our Canada consumers and customers.
In Europe, we now have the Miller brands in the U.K. and Ireland, and this business is also preparing to begin managing the international license and export business in the region starting on January 1. This will allow us to drive Staropramen, Carling and other lead brands with fully aligned strategies across Europe. We'll also continue to build our craft portfolio, including further expansion of Blue Moon across the region.
Our International business is well on the way to full integration of the Miller global brands into our portfolio, and we're leveraging a new footprint that complements our growth strategy in emerging markets. For example, in Panama and Honduras, where our partners are have already embraced Coors Light, we're ready to accelerate growth with the addition of the Miller brands. The International team has also begun planning -- the planning process for transitioning Puerto Rico over for MillerCoors on January 1. Going forward, the Coors and Miller brands will be the priority brands for our International business. 
To summarize, we're delighted to have completed the MillerCoors transaction, which is a compelling strategic and financial opportunity for our company and our shareholders that catapults Molson Coors to the next level. And this combination fits into our key priorities in 3 specific areas. 
Firstly, in brand lead growth, the cash tax benefits and cost savings made possible by this transaction provide resources that we can invest in accelerating the transformation at the front end of our business, through, for example, investing behind our core brands across all of our geographies, premiumizing our portfolio and engaging with consumers in new ways, including cross-border exchange of category changing innovation, expanding the depth and reach of our international brands in fast-growing markets, including securing a certain and aligned future for the Miller brands globally, and finally, leveraging our shared commercial capability through extraordinary brand building world-class insights, digital leadership and unrivaled customer excellence.
Secondly, this transformation of our company offers unique opportunities for us to drive cash through a substantial tax benefits, cost synergies, cross-border working capital improvements and disciplined use of our PACC model across the combined company. We expect all of these benefits to provide strong free cash flow and allow us to quickly pay down acquisition debt and maintain our commitment's investment grade debt ratings. 
And thirdly, this transaction represents a prudent high-return use of cash Molson Coors and our shareholders. We're using this transaction not only to make Molson Coors a bigger company but also a better company without integration complexity normally found in a deal of this size. As we focus on deleveraging our balance sheet over the next 2 to 3 years, we've suspended our share repurchase program and have announced that we plan to maintain our current dividend per share level, and we'll revisit our dividend policy once deleveraging is well underway. Overall, this combination is a game-changer in our ambition to become first choice for consumers and customers, and it's highly consistent with our goals and our focus on building extraordinary brands, delivering innovation and driving significant value to our shareholders.
Now before we start the Q&A portion of the call, just a quick comment. As usual, our prepared remarks will be in our website for your reference within a couple of hours this afternoon. Also at 1 p.m. Eastern Time today, Dave Dunnewald will host a follow-up conference call, which is an opportunity for you to ask additional questions regarding our quarterly results.

The West, which is -- has been a difficult area for us in September, as we saw progress in the third quarter, September, actually, was flat share. In Ontario, a big beer market for us. We saw growing share in the LCBO  and in the on-premise. So the number of tough areas is actually shrinking, and I think our increased execution certainly will help that. At the same time, the higher levels of marketing spend are yielding positive improvements in our brand scores. And of course, we expect that we'll be able to translate that into improved volumes.

Now there are obviously some tailwinds that are represented in the form of the $275 million of cash tax benefits, but also some headwinds, because we have a significant interest expense increase of around $250 million per annum because of the acquisition financing. There's additional D&A expense from the step-up due to the fair value remeasurement required by purchase accounting of around $70 million. And there's higher income taxes, because now we own the other 58% of MillerCoors, so we're paying additional taxes of around 200 -- or we will be paying additional taxes of around $200 million in 2017 versus what we did before."

We've made 4 acquisitions, which  we're pleased about, and we've grown our flavored malt beverage share meaningfully over the last year or so. Our Premium Light's continued to perform well. Miller Lite's gained share of the Premium Light segment for the eighth consecutive quarter, Judy; and Coors Light gained share for the sixth consecutive quarter. We've reengaged the Economy drinker, and it's a hot priority for us. We've recently announced our Economy strategy at the full distributor meeting and that was well-received by our distribution network. Our Above Premium performance specifically was hindered by some of the performance on Blue Moon and Leinenkugel's, particularly seasonals and variety packs, and that's an industry-wide trend, and it's an issue we're addressing.

So the first one, bigger picture, something that every investor I talk to ask me is, ""What's the track record of Mark Hunter and Gavin Hattersley, and why are they the right people to execute here?"" And of course, I ask the question with great respect, right? But people look at -- breathe on Philippe  having been at that for 20 years. So what we want to understand when we look at MillerCoors; Leo Kiely, a few years ago; Tom Long for 4 years; and now, Gavin. So if you can answer the question in terms of, what's your track record and why should investors be comfortable that this is the right management team to execute the significant plan? And the second question maybe is more for Mauricio, just basic in terms of numbers. I guess there's different ways to get -- to judge the guidance that you've given us today. One way I judge it is that I look at the cost savings that MillerCoors generated over the last 4 -- over last 5 years on average, right? About $120 million per annum, $88 million this year, you're running about $80 million this year, if I look at the $90 million this year for the third quarter. So you've done $120 million on average over the last 5 years. But then I look at the synergy number you are giving us today, $275 million divided by 3, that's $92 million. And then I take out from the balance, the Molson Coors savings ex MillerCoors, there's another $32 million of cost savings in MillerCoors. So synergies plus cost savings in MillerCoors, and I know that the lines get blurred, are about $124 million per annum over the next 3 years, which is what MillerCoors did over the last 5 years. So not so sure to be -- how to judge that number. Nice that you can sustain it. But if this is the significant transaction and there's this plethora of opportunities that we've talked about in terms of cost savings because now you own the full company, why would the cost savings, $124 million as per my math, total, would be pretty much similar to what you've been doing for the last 5 years. I guess if you can answer -- well, those are the 2 questions."

I'll let our track record speak for ourselves. We're both seasoned professionals who've been in the beer industry for a long period of time, driven significant change across many businesses, integrated businesses like StarBev and driven this transaction at a rate, which on a valuation multiple, I think, is utterly compelling for our business. So I'll just leave it there. I'm not going to talk in any more detail beyond that. And let me just back up on the second question. I know you asked for Mauricio. But what we have endeavored to do here is get full transparency and ensure that we are not duplicating any of the cost savings in our business. And clearly, we've now set a target for the next 3 years. We'll update that on an annual basis. There was a lot of questions around the synergies number, and we have scaled that up and picked up the pace on the synergies number. And we've ensured that there's no duplication with the synergies on an ongoing underlying cost savings, and we'll continue to test ourselves as to whether that number can be further improved as we actually get into fully running the business. But we feel it's a number we can meet and will attempt to beat. It makes sense as we look at a business, which if you remember, has very, very little geographical overlap. You got to drive this by a number of restructuring initiatives, setting up things like shared services globally, and we'll get at that. And we'll update you if there's any new news on that number, but we feel it's the right number for our business at this point in time."

And I mean, again, I haven't given any guidance as to how portion the cost savings. One of the things I did indicated earlier this year was that we have now developed a small global growth group led by Kandy. That team will be looking for incremental opportunities to accelerate our top line performance. Clearly, some of those opportunities will require incremental investment in our business, but we'll look at those in the round as we aggregate our total sales and marketing spend across our business. So I'm more interested in the quality of our marketing. And I think there's plenty of examples, and there's one in the U.S. market at the moment where people or competitors have been spending very aggressively. And let's just say the incremental spend doesn't always buy you success. I'm really focus on the quality of our marketing and the discipline of our execution, and we'll continue to drive efficiencies across our marketing spend. And if there's a return, that makes sense for us, we'll put it through the PACC model and we will spend incrementally to generate additional returns. So we want to drive very hard on getting the top line moving, and that will be a focus for us over the course of the next 24 to 36 months. I'm not going to get any more specifics than that, Pablo."

I don't think it's true to say that craft is weak for everybody. That's a really generous statement. I think there's a number of craft companies that continue to show very strong growth, and we just acquired a number of them, which is a good thing for our business. I think what you are starting to see though in the marketplace is what I described as probably oversupply of flavors in SKUs or beer styles in SKUs. And both retailers and consumers are trying to make sense of the plethora of choice, and that's against the backdrop that craft has been good for the beer industry because it's driven conversations and interest in beer to probably an all-time high. But you get to the point where each SKU has to deliver on a velocity basis and has to actually demonstrate as well to both our customers and our consumers. And as Gavin mentioned earlier, things like seasonal packs, which have been a big driver of the craft industry, have really started to come under pressure because consumers are now, in essence, making up their own seasonal packs by the way that they actually show up the shelves. So I think what you're starting to see is from a retailer perspective, a push to really simplify the offering. And Walmart just did that recently as they reset all of their shelf sets. So the more progressive retailers are really trying to focus on those brands have got long-term distinct positionings and drive velocity per SKU. Also I think from a consumer perspective, because most of the craft growth has been driven on the back of heavily hopped IPAs, consumers are recognizing that those beers are great, but they're not beers that you can probably take with you through a long occasion, and we're actually starting to see some consumer step back into some of the American light brands. So I think it's just craft starting to kind of shake itself out with the brands that are well-positioned, clearly distinctive, and alongside that, the retailers really starting to simplify their offer. And that's in its infancy at the moment, but I think that's starting to have an impact in overall kind of craft velocity or craft trends. Gavin, I don't know whether you want to add anything to that and then pick up the STW, STRs question?"

As far as the STWs, STRs are concerned, Mark, I mean, fundamentally, there's just the difference in timing. If you remember, at the end of Q2, that dynamic was reversed, where domestic STWs were down and STRs were down less than that. On a year-to-date basis, those 2 numbers are much closer. And generally, we try and align those things much closer by the end of the year as we try and ship to consumption.

There are also other savings that are coming from looking at our supply chain network that are not included in the synergy piece of the optimization of the North America supply chain grid.

Many of you have asked about our ability to get Coors Light and Miller Lite growing at the same time, and we're now doing that consistently. And alongside them, Coors Banquet is going from strength to strength. And we continue to drive the premiumization of our portfolio, and the craft acquisitions and Henry's are great examples. Don't forget the Redd's, which is now such a significant brand, didn't even exist just over 3 years ago. And my view is that we still have untapped opportunities in our own portfolio as well. So all of the component parts are there. A lot was down to how ruthless we want to be from an execution perspective. But Gavin and the leadership team have driven a significant change in the ambition, the energy and the focus in our U.S. business, and it's been great to see that happening.

In terms of production, we are relying either on our infrastructure like MillerCoors.

On behalf of Molson Coors Brewing Company, thank you for joining us today for our Third Quarter 2016 Follow-Up Earnings Conference Call. Our goal on this call is to address as many additional earnings-related questions as possible following our regular earnings conference call with Mark Hunter, Mauricio Restrepo and our business unit CEOs as earlier today. 
We will use a standard question-and-answer format, and we anticipate that the call will last less than an hour. 
Before we begin, I will paraphrase our safe harbor language. Some of our discussion today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from what we project today, so please refer to our most recent 10-K and 10-Q filings for a more complete description of factors that could affect these projections. We do not undertake to publicly update forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future results or otherwise. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. 
Regarding any non-U.S. GAAP measures that we may discuss during the call and from time-to-time by our executives in discussing our company's performance, please visit our website, www.molsoncoors.com, and click on the financial reporting tab at the Investor Relations page for a reconciliation of these measures with the nearest U.S. GAAP results. Also, unless otherwise indicated, all financial results we discuss are versus the comparable prior year period and in U.S. dollars. 
So let's get started with an introduction of the team with me on the call today. First of all, we have Mauricio Restrepo, CFO; Kevin Kim, Investor Relations Senior Manager; Alex Gowan [ph], Finance Forecasting Manager; Erik Mickelson, Technical Accounting Senior Manager; Brian Tabolt Controller; Mike Rumley, Treasurer; and Mark Saks, VP of Tax. 
Regarding quarterly results, as Mark Hunter mentioned on our regular earnings call this morning, in the third quarter, we continue to focus on First Choice ambition and on building a stronger, broader and more premium brand portfolio underpinned by incremental sales and marketing investments, as we have discussed all year. 
Business highlights for the quarter and year-to-date included increasing net sales revenue per hectoliter on a constant currency basis in all of our businesses for the quarter and for the year-to-date, increased investments in our brands globally. Coors Light and Miller Lite again gained share in the U.S. Premium Light segment, including the highest segment share gained in 3 years for Coors Light. 1.2% global volume growth for Coors Light year-to-date, with growth of more than 14% year-to-date outside of North America. Fast growth innovations in key markets, including Henry's Hard Soda in U.S. and Mad Jack in Canada. And global growth year-to-date in Above Premium through -- for example, Doom Bar and other Sharp's craft brands in the U.K., Creemore Springs and Belgian Moon in Canada and 4 newly acquired brewers in the U.S. And Above Premium also included strong growth by Staropramen across Europe outside of its home market, and cider volume increases with Rekorderlig in Europe and Strongbow in Canada. 
So we -- so kind of on an overall basis, we continue to strengthen our business through improvements to our sales execution and revenue management capabilities, increased efficiency of our operations and implementation of common global systems. 
This is a historic time for -- in the evolution of Molson Coors. 3 weeks ago, we completed our acquisition of the remaining 58% stake in the MillerCoors joint venture, along with Miller global brand portfolio. We emerged as the word's third largest brewer, bringing together Molson Coors and MillerCoors into a bigger, better organization. As one company with an expanded portfolio of iconic brands, we intend to leverage our increased scale, resources and synergies as well as combined commercial experience to accelerate our First Choice agenda and deliver long-term shareholder value. 
On the earnings call earlier this morning, Mauricio also shared perspective regarding 3 new performance measures: transaction, adjusted EPS and all-in multi-year cost savings target and an early view of our combined company underlying free cash flow target for 2017. In addition to any earnings-related questions you may have, we would be happy to answer any questions you have regarding these new or updated performance metrics. 
And finally, for your reference, please note that we have posted full year 2015 and year-to-date 2016 pro forma financial statements on our website to give effects to the MillerCoors acquisition and the related financing, as those were completed on January 1, 2015. 
So with that as an introduction, I'd like to turn it over or open it up for questions. Over to you, Laura."

So this is the long-anticipated follow-up call, where we get clarification on the free cash flow guidance. So I guess, what everyone is kind of trying to reconcile is you've got $6,000.11 of transaction-adjusted EPS in 2015. That translates to roughly $1.32 billion in terms of the implied cash flow number. And then, Mauricio, you're guiding to $1.1 billion. So it seems like there is a pretty big step-down even after adjusting for cash restructuring charge. So can you just help us sort of reconcile kind of how we go from 2015 to '17 in terms of free cash flow?"

I don't think I'll be able to reconcile it point-by-point, Judy. But what I would say, I guess, first of all, is we're really dealing with 2 different measures here in a sense that it's a cruel accounting versus cash accounting said moderately. The free cash flow guidance $1.1 billion is truly a cash performance measure. The transaction adjusted EPS number is not a cash performance measure. It actually starts with underlying book EPS and then makes to cash adjustments to kinds of amortization or cash -- and cash tax benefit. So they're really say not directly comparable. The types of differences that you'd see between those 2 numbers would be things like pension contributions, cash versus expense. So obviously, the pension cash would be directly reflected in the free cash flow number, but the pension expense number would be reflected in underlying EPS, which is the base for the transaction adjusted EPS. Another example would be capital expenditures versus depreciation and amortization. Third example would be cash taxes versus book taxes and we talked about the 270 -- more than $275 million of cash tax benefit associated with the transaction, but we have not provided guidance on other cash taxes or on book taxes. Now those are included in the performance, but we don't -- you don't have a specific view from a cash standpoint for the free cash flow.
And then finally, capital expenditures needed to capture synergy. As Mauricio mentioned on earlier call, we do anticipate some incremental CapEx related to the -- to capturing synergies. And those would tend will be loaded more toward the first 2 years of the 3-year time frame that we talked about as far as cost savings go. And -- so that then we can capture the synergies, again as we mentioned, predominantly in years 2 and 3 for those. Although, I would hasten to mention that the other cost savings that we mentioned, non-synergies in other words, actually re skewed towards more years 1 or 2 of the 3-year time period. Does that give your at least some headlines of why there might be some differences between those 2 numbers?"

Meaning, the idea of showing the transaction-adjusted EPS would simply to give a reflection of the earnings capability of the business once you take that underlying earnings per share and you just -- you adjusted for 2 items that are not evident, when you go back in time and look at the pro forma. Of course, going forward, the $275 million of cash tax benefit will be hitting your earnings. It's just that as we went back and we were looking at the earnings in 2015, that's one adjustment that we had to make.

Thanks, Brian. The -- as I think that you mentioned, Judy, there is $0.39 change and actually that was due to 3 main factors. One of them is the increase in the cash tax benefits that we're seeing, that's above $0.12. We're also seeing an adjustment to both amortization and depreciation, but as you know, we strip out amortization for transaction-adjusted EPS. However, depreciation, we do not strip out that actually was a $0.10 improvement via the purchase accounting work that the accounting team has been doing there. And then the rest of the difference is related to other purchase accounting adjustments, including valuation of assets and liabilities, things like pension and other property, plant and equipment, where they're going to continue to do their work and you'll actually in all likelihood see additional adjustments, albeit they may be a little bit smaller, but additional adjustments in future quarters and in fact the opening balance it is lockdown for one year from the close of transaction."

So what's happening there?"" So just back of the envelope analysis, you take the $1.3 billion, $1.4 billion, okay. You add the $275 million of benefit that you're getting there, so you're getting around $1.6 billion, okay, of cash generation. But now we're paying $250 million per year more of interest, so you have to deduct that from $1.6 billion to get to $1.35 billion, okay. And in addition, you're paying more taxes because we own the other 58% [ph] of MillerCoors. So your $1.35 billion deduct another $200 million, that gives you about 1.15, there you go, that's roughly from a cash flow perspective how I would look at, okay how does the $1.1 billion compared to what should be the norm sort of the ""normalized cash flow generation potential"" of the 2 separate business, if you just added the 2 together."

When we bought the other 58% of MillerCoors, that increase are significantly our exposure to profit through cash flow, but we're really talking about profits here increase our exposure to the U.S. business and call it industry and corporate income tax rate, which is among the highest in the world. And so because of the -- I guess, simple migration of pretax income in the direction of U.S. exposure that results in an higher average blend of tax rate. Now to start with though on the 58% of the MillerCoors business that we are buying, we do not pay corporate income taxes on that portion, SAB Miller out of London paid whatever taxes were due on that via their situation. We pay taxes on a 42% of the MillerCoors portion that we own. Now we're -- now our income tax rate on average, we expect to be somewhat higher. In fact, the guidance has changed from 18% to 22% for 2016 without the transaction, so the 25% to 28% in future years, all else being equal no changes in tax rate and those types of things. So you get 25% to 28% on a longer-term basis, including other 58% of MillerCoors. So you can tell several percentage point higher than what we have with the pre-existing shape of the business.
And if you look -- Kevin reminded me, if you look at the pro forma table on the website, you can see a pro forma tax rate of around 25% for the 2015 full year pro forma number. So there you go, I mean, the tax -- the effective tax rate in pro forma is in that 25% to 28% range that we have been talking about. Does that help?"

For example, in license revenue, you have different revenue from a royalty revenue versus a wholly-owned market the amount of revenue. So we have not provided a number on that one. I would put that in the bucket of to be determined, similar to some of the comments that Mark made earlier on the call today. From a Canada standpoint, that is an interesting one. When the brands were bought -- the rights of brands of Canada bought were us about 1.5 years ago, they always said about the size of the Miller brands in Canada was mid-single digit percent of our Canada volume. We have not updated that and that would be subject to the performance of those brands over the last 1.5 years under SAB Miller. So we see what that looks like from a volume standpoint and would that provide additional leverage, specific to your question. We'll see. We'll see, which brands will be produced locally versus imported or what. In other words, that will be one of the details that we will sort out with you over time. And then one thing we're not talking about profit but Bryan made a good point that we do have a purchase price protection on the purchases of Miller International brand as they existed in SAP system.

Our goal on this call is to address as many additional earnings-related questions as possible following our regular earnings conference call with Mark Hunter, Mauricio Restrepo and our business unit CEOs as earlier today. 
We will use a standard question-and-answer format, and we anticipate that the call will last less than an hour. 
Before we begin, I will paraphrase our safe harbor language. Some of our discussion today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from what we project today, so please refer to our most recent 10-K and 10-Q filings for a more complete description of factors that could affect these projections. We do not undertake to publicly update forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future results or otherwise. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. 
Regarding any non-U.S. GAAP measures that we may discuss during the call and from time-to-time by our executives in discussing our company's performance, please visit our website, www.molsoncoors.com, and click on the financial reporting tab at the Investor Relations page for a reconciliation of these measures with the nearest U.S. GAAP results. Also, unless otherwise indicated, all financial results we discuss are versus the comparable prior year period and in U.S. dollars. 
So let's get started with an introduction of the team with me on the call today. First of all, we have Mauricio Restrepo, CFO; Kevin Kim, Investor Relations Senior Manager; Alex Gowan [ph], Finance Forecasting Manager; Erik Mickelson, Technical Accounting Senior Manager; Brian Tabolt Controller; Mike Rumley, Treasurer; and Mark Saks, VP of Tax. 
Regarding quarterly results, as Mark Hunter mentioned on our regular earnings call this morning, in the third quarter, we continue to focus on First Choice ambition and on building a stronger, broader and more premium brand portfolio underpinned by incremental sales and marketing investments, as we have discussed all year. 
Business highlights for the quarter and year-to-date included increasing net sales revenue per hectoliter on a constant currency basis in all of our businesses for the quarter and for the year-to-date, increased investments in our brands globally. Coors Light and Miller Lite again gained share in the U.S. Premium Light segment, including the highest segment share gained in 3 years for Coors Light. 1.2% global volume growth for Coors Light year-to-date, with growth of more than 14% year-to-date outside of North America. Fast growth innovations in key markets, including Henry's Hard Soda in U.S. and Mad Jack in Canada. And global growth year-to-date in Above Premium through -- for example, Doom Bar and other Sharp's craft brands in the U.K., Creemore Springs and Belgian Moon in Canada and 4 newly acquired brewers in the U.S. And Above Premium also included strong growth by Staropramen across Europe outside of its home market, and cider volume increases with Rekorderlig in Europe and Strongbow in Canada. 
So we -- so kind of on an overall basis, we continue to strengthen our business through improvements to our sales execution and revenue management capabilities, increased efficiency of our operations and implementation of common global systems. 
This is a historic time for -- in the evolution of Molson Coors. 3 weeks ago, we completed our acquisition of the remaining 58% stake in the MillerCoors joint venture, along with Miller global brand portfolio. We emerged as the word's third largest brewer, bringing together Molson Coors and MillerCoors into a bigger, better organization. As one company with an expanded portfolio of iconic brands, we intend to leverage our increased scale, resources and synergies as well as combined commercial experience to accelerate our First Choice agenda and deliver long-term shareholder value. 
On the earnings call earlier this morning, Mauricio also shared perspective regarding 3 new performance measures: transaction, adjusted EPS and all-in multi-year cost savings target and an early view of our combined company underlying free cash flow target for 2017. In addition to any earnings-related questions you may have, we would be happy to answer any questions you have regarding these new or updated performance metrics. 
And finally, for your reference, please note that we have posted full year 2015 and year-to-date 2016 pro forma financial statements on our website to give effects to the MillerCoors acquisition and the related financing, as those were completed on January 1, 2015. 
So with that as an introduction, I'd like to turn it over or open it up for questions. Over to you, Laura."

So this is the long-anticipated follow-up call, where we get clarification on the free cash flow guidance. So I guess, what everyone is kind of trying to reconcile is you've got $6.11 of transaction-adjusted EPS in 2015. That translates to roughly $1.32 billion in terms of the implied cash flow number. And then, Mauricio, you're guiding to $1.1 billion. So it seems like there is a pretty big step-down even after adjusting for cash restructuring charge. So can you just help us sort of reconcile kind of how we go from 2015 to '17 in terms of free cash flow?"

I don't think I'll be able to reconcile it point-by-point, Judy. But what I would say, I guess, first of all, is we're really dealing with 2 different measures here in a sense that it's like accrual accounting versus cash accounting. Said more directly, the free cash flow guidance of $1.1 billion is truly a cash performance measure. The transaction-adjusted EPS number is not a cash performance measure. It actually starts with underlying book EPS and then makes to cash adjustments to kinds of amortization or cash -- and cash tax benefits. So they're really -- at least they're not directly comparable. The types of differences that you'd see between those 2 numbers would be things like pension contributions, cash versus expense. So obviously, the pension cash would be directly reflected in the free cash flow number. But the pension expense number would be reflected in underlying EPS, which is the base for the transaction-adjusted EPS. Another example would be capital expenditures versus depreciation and amortization. Third example would be cash taxes versus booked taxes. And we've talked about the -- more than $275 million of cash tax benefits associated with the transaction, but we have not provided guidance on other cash taxes or on booked taxes. Now those are included in the performance, but we don't have a specific view from a cash standpoint for the free cash flow.
And then finally, capital expenditures needed to capture synergies. As Mauricio mentioned on earlier call, we do anticipate some incremental CapEx related to the -- to capturing synergies. And those who tend be loaded more toward the first 2 years of the 3-year time frame that we talked about as far as cost savings go and -- so that then we can capture the synergies, again as he mentioned, predominantly in years 2 and 3 for those. Although, I would hasten to mention that the other cost savings that we mentioned, non-synergies, in other words, actually are skewed more toward years 1 or 2 of the 3-year time period. Does that give you at least some headlines of why there might be some differences between those 2 numbers?"

Of course, going forward, the $275 million of cash tax benefit will be hitting your earnings. It's just that as we went back and we were looking at the earnings in 2015, that's one adjustment that we had to make.

And that's what I was referring to earlier -- on earlier call when I mentioned the bridge financing. However, compared to the Boston Conference pro forma number of, what was that? $572 million, yes, thanks, Brian, the -- as I think you mentioned, Judy, there is $0.39 change. And actually that was due to 3 main factors. One of them is the increase in the cash tax benefits that we're seeing, that's above $0.12. We're also seeing an adjustment to both amortization and depreciation. But as you know, we strip out booked amortization for transaction-adjusted EPS. However, depreciation, we do not strip out, and that actually was a $0.10 improvement via the purchase accounting work that the accounting team has been doing here. And then the rest of the difference is related to other purchase accounting adjustments, including valuation of assets and liabilities, things like pension and other property, plant and equipment, where they're going to continue to do their work, and you'll actually in all likelihood see additional adjustments, albeit they may be a bit smaller, but additional adjustments in future quarters until in fact the opening balance sheet is locked down 1 year from the close of the transaction."

You had asked about dividends and buyback. So dividend, the exact wording that we've used around that is that we will consider our dividend policy. Again, right now, it's being held even on a per share basis per quarter as we pay down debt. And when debt pay-down as well underway, then we can -- we have said that we will be willing to revisit our dividend policy.

So just back-of-the-envelope analysis, you take the $1.3 billion, $1.4 billion, okay? You add the $275 million of benefit that you're getting there, so you're getting around $1.6 billion, okay, of cash generation. But now we're paying $250 million per year more of interest, okay? So you have to deduct that from the $1.6 billion. You get to $1.35 billion, okay? And in addition, you're paying more taxes, because we own the other 58% of MillerCoors. So of your $1.35 billion, deduct another $200 million. That gives you about $1.15 billion. There you go.

Actually, I'm glad you asked that, because it may not be obvious to a lot of folks. When we bought the other 58% of MillerCoors, that increases our significantly our exposure to profit through cash flow, but we're really talking about profits here, because booked tax rate that we're talking about, increases our exposure to the U.S. business and call it industry and corporate income tax rate, which is among the highest in the world. And so because of the -- I guess, simple migration of pretax income in the direction of U.S. exposure, that results in a higher average blended tax rate. Now to start with though on the 58% of the MillerCoors business that we're buying, we did pay corporate income taxes on that portion, SABMiller out of London paid whatever taxes were due on that via their situation. We paid taxes on a 42% of the MillerCoors portion that we owned. Now we're -- now our income tax rate on average, we expect to be somewhat higher. In fact, the guidance has changed from 18% to 22% for 2016 without the transaction to the 25% to 28% in future years, all else being equal, no changes in tax rate and those types of things. So 25% to 28% on a longer-term basis, including the other 58% of MillerCoors. So you can tell that's several percentage point higher than what we have with the preexisting shape of the business. And if you look -- Kevin reminded me, if you look at the pro forma table on the website, you can see a pro forma tax rate of around 25% for the 2015 full year pro forma number. So there you go. I mean, the tax -- the effective tax rate in the pro forma is in that 25% to 28% range that we've been talking about."

On the -- so Miller International volume, we said as far as the transaction communication, that, that was about 3.2 million hectoliters per year. And we have not changed that point of view. From a revenue standpoint, we've never provided guidance, because actually that was determinant or would be determined by the route to market of the brands in a dozens of markets around the world. For example, in a license market, you have different revenue from a royalty revenue versus a wholly-owned market the amount of revenue. So we have not provided a number on that one. I would put that in the bucket of to-be-determined, similar to some of the comments that Mark made earlier on the call today. From a Canada standpoint, that is an interesting one. When the brands were bought -- the rights of the brands of Canada bought from us about 1.5 years ago or so, they always said about the size of the Miller brands in Canada was mid-single-digit percent of our Canada volume. We have not updated that, and that would be subject to the performance of those brands over the last 1.5 years under SABMiller. And so we'll see what that looks like from a volume standpoint. And would that provide additional leverage, specific to your question? We'll see. We'll see which brands will be produced locally versus imported or what. In other words, that will be one of the details that we'll sort out with you over time. And one thing -- we're not talking about profit, but Bryan made a good point that we do have a purchase price protection on the purchases of the Miller International brand as they existed in SAB system. If the profit trailing 12 months' EBITDA is less than $70 million for that 12-month time period, then there will be a purchase price adjustment that we would negotiate with ABI, and it's sort of ratio of roughly 11.3x."

To that, you add the $275 million of annual tax benefit. From that, you deduct the $200 million of additional tax and the $250 million of additional interest.

On behalf of Molson Coors Brewing Company, thank you for joining us today for our Third Quarter 2016 Follow-Up Earnings Conference Call. Our goal on this call is to address as many additional earnings-related questions as possible following our regular earnings conference call with Mark Hunter, Mauricio Restrepo and our business unit CEOs as earlier today. 
We will use a standard question-and-answer format, and we anticipate that the call will last less than an hour. 
Before we begin, I will paraphrase our safe harbor language. Some of our discussion today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from what we project today, so please refer to our most recent 10-K and 10-Q filings for a more complete description of factors that could affect these projections. We do not undertake to publicly update forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future results or otherwise. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. 
Regarding any non-U.S. GAAP measures that we may discuss during the call and from time-to-time by our executives in discussing our company's performance, please visit our website, www.molsoncoors.com, and click on the financial reporting tab at the Investor Relations page for a reconciliation of these measures with the nearest U.S. GAAP results. Also, unless otherwise indicated, all financial results we discuss are versus the comparable prior year period and in U.S. dollars. 
So let's get started with an introduction of the team with me on the call today. First of all, we have Mauricio Restrepo, CFO; Kevin Kim, Investor Relations Senior Manager; Alex Going [ph], Finance Forecasting Manager; Erik Mickelson, Technical Accounting Senior Manager; Brian Tabolt Controller; Mike Rumley, Treasurer; and Mark Saks, VP of Tax. 
Regarding quarterly results, as Mark Hunter mentioned on our regular earnings call this morning, in the third quarter, we continue to focus on First Choice ambition and on building a stronger, broader and more premium brand portfolio underpinned by incremental sales and marketing investments, as we have discussed all year. 
Business highlights for the quarter and year-to-date included increasing net sales revenue per hectoliter on a constant currency basis in all of our businesses for the quarter and for the year-to-date, increased investments in our brands globally. Coors Light and Miller Lite again gained share in the U.S. Premium Light segment, including the highest segment share gain in 3 years for Coors Light. 1.2% global volume growth for Coors Light year-to-date, with growth of more than 14% year-to-date outside of North America. Fast growth innovations in key markets, including Henry's Hard Sodas in U.S. and Mad Jack in Canada. And global growth year-to-date in Above Premium through, for example, Doom Bar and other Sharp's craft brands in the U.K., Creemore Springs and Belgian Moon in Canada and 4 newly acquired brewers in the U.S. And Above Premium also included strong growth by Staropramen across Europe outside of its home market, and cider volume increases with Rekorderlig in Europe and Strongbow in Canada. 
So we -- so kind of on an overall basis, we continued to strengthen our business through improvements to our sales execution and revenue management capabilities, increased efficiency of our operations and implementation of common global systems. 
This is a historic time for -- in the evolution of Molson Coors. 3 weeks ago, we completed our acquisition of the remaining 58% stake in the MillerCoors joint venture, along with Miller global brand portfolio. We emerged as the world’s third largest brewer, bringing together Molson Coors and MillerCoors into a bigger, better organization. As one company with an expanded portfolio of iconic brands, we intend to leverage our increased scale, resources and synergies as well as combined commercial experience to accelerate our First Choice agenda and deliver long-term shareholder value. 
On the earnings call earlier this morning, Mauricio also shared perspective regarding 3 new performance measures: transaction, adjusted EPS and all-in multi-year cost savings target and an early view of our combined company underlying free cash flow target for 2017. In addition to any earnings-related questions you may have, we would be happy to answer any questions you have regarding these new or updated performance metrics. 
And finally, for your reference, please note that we have posted full year 2015 and year-to-date 2016 pro forma financial statements on our website that give effect to the MillerCoors acquisition and the related financing, as if those were completed on January 1, 2015. 
So with that as an introduction, I'd like to turn it over -- or open it up for questions. Over to you, Laura."

So this is the long-anticipated follow-up call, where we get clarification on the free cash flow guidance. So I guess, what everyone is kind of trying to reconcile is you've got $6.11 of transaction-adjusted EPS in 2015. That translates to roughly $1.32 billion in terms of the implied cash flow number. And then, Mauricio, you were guiding to $1.1 billion. So it seems like there is a pretty big step-down even after adjusting for cash restructuring charge. So can you just help us sort of reconcile kind of how we go from 2015 to '17 in terms of free cash flow?"

I don't think I'll be able to reconcile it point-by-point, Judy. But what I would say, I guess, first of all, is we're really dealing with 2 different measures here in a sense that it's like accrual accounting versus cash accounting. Said more directly, the free cash flow guidance of $1.1 billion is truly a cash performance measure. The transaction-adjusted EPS number is not a cash performance measure. It actually starts with underlying book EPS and then makes 2 cash adjustments, 2 kinds of amortization or cash -- and cash tax benefits. So they're really, how do you say, not directly comparable. The types of differences that you'd see between those 2 numbers would be things like pension contributions, cash versus expense. So obviously, the pension cash would be directly reflected in the free cash flow number. But the pension expense number would be reflected in underlying EPS, which is the base for the transaction-adjusted EPS. Another example would be capital expenditures versus depreciation and amortization. Third example would be cash taxes versus booked taxes. And we've talked about the -- more than $275 million of cash tax benefits associated with the transaction, but we have not provided guidance on other cash taxes or on booked taxes. Now those are included in the pro formas, but we don't -- you don't have a specific view from a cash standpoint for the free cash flow.
And then finally, capital expenditures needed to capture synergies. As Mauricio mentioned on the earlier call, we do anticipate some incremental CapEx related to the -- to capturing synergies. And those will tend be loaded more toward the first 2 years of the 3-year time frame that we talked about as far as cost savings go and -- so that then we can capture the synergies, again as he mentioned, predominantly in years 2 and 3 for those. Although, I would hasten to mention that the other cost savings that we mentioned, non-synergies, in other words, actually are skewed more toward years 1 or 2 of the 3-year time period. Does that give you at least some headlines of why there might be some differences between those 2 numbers?"

So that's going to obviously increase the free cash flow going forward if you assume all else being equal from a 2017 base. And then going forward, obviously, all of the accounting and accrual adjustments versus cash adjustments, meaning the idea of showing the transaction-adjusted EPS was simply to give a reflection of the earnings capability of the business once you take that underlying earnings per share and you just -- you adjust it for 2 items that are not evident when you go back in time and look at the pro forma. Of course, going forward, the $275 million of cash tax benefit will be hitting your earnings. It's just that as we went back and we were looking at the earnings in 2015, that's one adjustment that we had to make. So at the end of the day, again, one is an accrual and an accounting measure and the other one is a cash flow measure. Now in that cash flow of the $1.1 billion, you will have the impact of additional interest expense, of the additional taxes that are being paid, et cetera, et cetera."

However, compared to the Boston Conference pro forma number of, what was that? $572 million, yes, thanks, Brian, the -- as I think you mentioned, Judy, there is $0.39 change. And actually that was due to 3 main factors. One of them is the increase in the cash tax benefits that we're seeing, that's above $0.12. We're also seeing an adjustment to both amortization and depreciation. But as you know, we strip out booked amortization for transaction-adjusted EPS. However, depreciation, we do not strip out, and that actually was a $0.10 improvement via the purchase accounting work that the accounting team has been doing here. And then the rest of the difference is related to other purchase accounting adjustments, including valuation of assets and liabilities, things like pension and other property, plant and equipment, where they're going to continue to do their work, and you'll actually in all likelihood see additional adjustments, albeit they may be a bit smaller, but additional adjustments in future quarters until in fact the opening balance sheet is locked down 1 year from the close of the transaction."

Nevertheless -- and as Dave correctly pointed out, there's always room for improvement in working capital. We are looking at some specific initiatives, working very closely with the U.S. team with MillerCoors. And hopefully, there will be some interesting benefits coming out of that."

But that's not the complete picture until you understand what is the financial benefit that the company would be obtaining in so doing."

And in this analysis, I'll just to do kind of a top-of-my-head again, sort of the back-of-the-envelope analysis. So if you look historically at the capacity to generate free cash flow of the Molson Coors business and then you look at the capacity to generate cash flow of the MillerCoors business and you put the 2 together historically and you say, okay, well, that roughly gives me between $1.3 billion, $1.4 billion. And obviously, you guys are looking and saying, Jesus, but these guys are reporting the $1.1 billion. So what's happening there? So just back-of-the-envelope analysis, you take the $1.3 billion, $1.4 billion, okay? You add the $275 million of benefit that you're getting there, so you're getting around $1.6 billion, okay, of cash generation. But now we're paying $250 million per year more of interest, okay? So you have to deduct that from the $1.6 billion. You get to $1.35 billion, okay? And in addition, you're paying more taxes, because we own the other 58% of MillerCoors. So of your $1.35 billion, deduct another $200 million. That gives you about $1.15 billion. There you go. That's roughly, from a cash flow perspective, how I would look at, okay, how does the $1.1 billion compare to what should be the norm sort of the ""normalized cash flow generation potential"" of the 2 separate business if you just added the 2 together."

Actually, I'm glad you asked that, because it may not be obvious to a lot of folks. When we bought the other 58% of MillerCoors, that increases significantly our exposure to -- in profits and cash flow, although we're really talking about profits here, because it's the booked tax rate that we're talking about, increases our exposure to the U.S. business and call it industry and corporate income tax rate, which is among the highest in the world. And so because of the -- I guess, simple migration of pretax income in the direction of U.S. exposure, that results in a higher average blended tax rate. Now to start with though on the 58% of the MillerCoors business that we're buying, we did not pay corporate income taxes on that portion. SABMiller out of London paid whatever taxes were due on that via their situation. We paid taxes on the 42% of the MillerCoors portion that we owned. Now we're -- now our income tax rate on average, we expect to be somewhat higher. In fact, the guidance has changed from 18% to 22% for 2016 without the transaction to 25% to 28% in future years, all else being equal, no changes in tax rate and those types of things. So you can -- 25% to 28% on a longer-term basis, including the other 58% of MillerCoors. So you can tell that's several percentage points higher than what we have with the preexisting shape of the business. And if you look -- Kevin reminded me, if you look at the pro forma tables on the website, you can see a pro forma tax rate of around 25% for the 2015 full year pro forma number. So there you go. I mean, the tax -- the effective tax rate in the pro forma is in that 25% to 28% range that we've been talking about."

On the -- so Miller International volume, we said as part of the transaction communication that we -- that was about 3.2 million hectoliters per year. And we have not changed that point of view. From a revenue standpoint, we've never provided guidance, because actually that would determine -- or would be determined by the route to market of the brands in a dozens of markets around the world. For example, in a license market you have different revenue from a royalty revenue versus a wholly-owned market the amount of revenue. So we have not provided a number on that one. I would put that in the bucket of to-be-determined, similar to some of the comments that Mark made earlier on the call today. 
From a Canada standpoint, that is an interesting one. When the brands were bought -- the rights of the brands of Canada bought from us about 1.5 years ago or so, they always said about the size of the Miller brands in Canada was mid-single-digit percent of our Canada volume. We have not updated that, and that would be subject to the performance of those brands over the last 1.5 years under SABMiller. And so we'll see what that looks like from a volume standpoint. And would that provide additional leverage, specific to your question? We'll see. We'll see which brands will be produced locally versus imported or what. In other words, that will be one of the details that we'll sort out with you over time. 
And one thing -- we're not talking about profit, but Bryan made a good point that we do have a purchase price protection on the purchase of the Miller International brands as they existed in SAB system. If the profit, trailing 12 months' EBITDA is less than $70 million for that 12-month time period, then there will be a purchase price adjustment that we would negotiate with ABI, and it's at a ratio of roughly 11.3x."

Nevertheless, because the information is there, I just want to -- just to make your life easier, you guys, I mean, it's an exercise that you can try to do yourself in the sense that you know what the underlying free cash flow was for both businesses. So the same exercise that I did for 2017, you yourselves can do for 2015. So you just add the underlying free cash flows of both businesses and with MillerCoors at 100% as well. To that, you add the $275 million of annual tax benefits. From that, you deduct the $200 million of additional tax and the $250 million of additional interest. The only little piece that you wouldn't have is the CapEx that will be spent in 2017 to obtain the synergies. But other than that, the calculation is exactly the same. So that's all I want to say.

Today, Mauricio and I will split our call into 2 parts. First, we will take you through our third quarter 2016 results to, in essence, close out Molson Coors Brewing Company as it's been structured for the past several years. Then we'll turn our attention to our recently completed MillerCoors transaction and to renew our updated financial reporting metrics, along with some perspective for the fourth quarter of this year.
In third quarter, we continue to focus on our First Choice ambition and on building a stronger, broader and more premium brand portfolio, underpinned by incremental sales and marketing investment as we've discussed all year.
Business highlights for the quarter and year-to-date included: Increased net sales revenue per hectoliter on a constant currency basis in all of our businesses for the quarter and year-to-date. We increased investments in our brands globally. Coors Light Miller Lite again gained share in the U.S. Premium Light segment for the quarter, including the highest segment share gain in 3 years for Coors Light. We saw 1.2% global volume growth for Coors Light on a year-to-date basis with growth of more than 14% outside of North America.
We had fast-growing innovations in key markets, including Henry's hard soda in the U.S. and Mad Jack in Canada, and we saw global growth year-to-date in our Above Premium portfolio through, for example, Doom Bar and other Sharp's craft brands in the U.K., Creemore Springs and Belgian Moon in Canada and our 4 newly acquired brewers in the U.S. We also saw strong growth by Staropramen across Europe outside of its whole market. And we also additionally saw cider volume increases with Rekorderlig in Europe and Strongbow in Canada. 
Overall, we continue to strengthen our business through improvements to our sales execution and revenue management capabilities, increased efficiency of our operations and implementation of common global systems. 
Regional highlights for the third quarter and year-to-date are as follows: In the U.S., overall sales to retail volume decreased 4% for the quarter and 2.5% year-to-date on a trailing day adjusted basis, driven primarily by our Below Premium and Premium Light brands. Coors Light and Miller Lite again gained segment market share while STRs declined, reflecting industry trends. Coors Banquet continued to grow STR volume and segment share. And in the higher-margin Above Premium segment, Henry's continues to be the #1 hard soda franchise. Also, our Saint Archer, Terrapin, Hop Valley and Revolver businesses have significantly expanded our craft offering for consumers and customers. 
Domestic net sales revenue per hectoliter grew 1.6% for the quarter and 1.2% year-to-date as a result of favorable net pricing and positive sales mix. On the bottom line, U.S. segment underlying equity income increased 9% in the third quarter, driven primarily by lower cost of goods sold, higher net pricing and positive sales mix. Year-to-date underlying equity income increased 9.3%, primarily due to the factors mentioned above, as well as a $12.3 million anticipated refund of federal excise tax paid in imports, which we discussed on our last earnings call.
In Canada, net sales per hectoliter in local currency increased 0.6%, driven by growth in our Above Premium brands. This NSR increase reflected headline price increases and positive brand mix, but with higher levels of spin [ph] back as we ensured our brands are competitive on a market-by-market basis. 
Our performance in the Above Premium segment continue to be strong as we saw growth in both our own brands and our partner brands. Coors Banquet, Mad Jack and Belgian Moon all continue to deliver strong growth, and our craft brands continued to grow share of the total beer category. 
The mainstream segment continued to face market pressure where our brand health scores for Coors Light and Molson Canadian have continued to improve month-over-month, and our sales execution input measures are similarly improving.
Our COGS per hectoliter increased 3.5% in local currency, with most of the increase being driven by volume deleverage and mix shift to higher-cost products. Our cost savings program continue to be strong and fully offset the impacts of inflation and other cost increases in the quarter. And the bottom line underlying pretax income declined by $15.9 million in the third quarter, driven by lower volume, increased COGS, higher marketing investments and foreign exchange impacts of U.S. dollar-based supplier contracts.
Europe net sales decreased 0.6% in local currency for the third quarter, driven by 1.4% lower volume due to weaker demand versus strong sales last year across much of the region, along with some trade inventory overhang from the Euro 2016 football or soccer championships in the second quarter this year.
Nonetheless, we held our share position in the region, and our continued portfolio premiumization and mix management drove a 1.2% increase in net sales revenue per hectoliter from local currency. In the quarter, we achieved strong growth by Coors Light, Staropramen outside of the Czech Republic and our craft portfolios, including Blue Moon, Doom Bar and the other Sharp's brands, as well as Rekorderlig Cider. 
Underlying pretax income was lower in the quarter due to higher brand amortization expenses, lower net pension benefit and unfavorable foreign currency movements, especially related to the depreciation of the British pound. Year-to-date, the benefit of higher net sales and NSR per hectoliter from local currency volume and market share in Europe were more than offset by unfavorable foreign currency movements, higher brand amortization expense, lower pension benefits and the termination of the Heineken contract brewing arrangements in the U.K.
Our International business continues to drive Coors Light momentum with year-to-date volume for this brand, up mid-single digits, led by growth in Latin America and Australia. Excluding the impact of total alcohol prohibition in Bihar, India and the transfer of the Staropramen U.K. business to our Europe segment, our year-to-date underlying pretax performance has significantly improved versus last year, driven by volume growth in the remaining international markets.
Now I'll turn it over to Mauricio to give third quarter financial highlights and new performance metrics. Mauricio?"
263765,404132594,1069215,"Molson Coors Brewing Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2016",2016-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Molson Coors Beverage Company","Executives","Thank you, Mark, and hello, everybody. As a reminder, all of the results that I will be discussing are in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise noted. So our third quarter and year-to-date financial headlines are as follows: Net sales were down approximately",1596,"Thank you, Mark, and hello, everybody. As a reminder, all of the results that I will be discussing are in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise noted. 
So our third quarter and year-to-date financial headlines are as follows: 
Net sales were down approximately 7% in U.S. dollars in the third quarter and about 5% year-to-date, primarily due to currency movements, especially in Europe, as well as lower worldwide volume. On a constant currency basis, net sales decreased 2.2% in the third quarter and were virtually unchanged year-to-date versus the same period last year. Our net sales per hectoliter in constant currency increased 1.3% in the quarter and 0.9% year-to-date due to positive mix. 
On a U.S. GAAP basis, we reported third quarter after-tax income from continuing operations attributable to Molson Coors of $202.5 million, up from $13.7 million a year ago. This increase was primarily driven by cycling $275 million of impairment charges recorded for certain Europe brands last year. 
On a year-to-date basis, U.S. GAAP after-tax income increased 67.5% to $539.8 million, driven by brand impairment charges last year and a gain on the sale of our Vancouver brewery earlier this year. Third quarter underlying after-tax income decreased 14.3% to $222.7 million or $1.03 per diluted share, driven by lower worldwide volume, a higher underlying tax rate and higher brand investments globally, which were partially offset by positive mix and higher underlying U.S. equity income.
Year-to-date underlying after-tax income decreased 5.5% to $576.4 million, driven by the same factors as in the quarter, along with negative foreign currency movements. Underlying pretax income declined 6.2% for the third quarter and 1.3% year-to-date. Underlying EBITDA in the quarter was $403.1 million, 4.1% lower than a year ago, and our year-to-date underlying EBITDA declined 0.8%. 
Underlying free cash flow in the first 3 quarters of 2016 was $469.4 million. This represents a decrease of $24.9 million from the prior year, primarily driven by lower underlying after-tax income and lower distributions from MillerCoors. 
Total debt at the end of the third quarter was $9.9 billion. Cash and cash equivalents totaled slightly less than $10 billion, resulting in a net cash position of $94 million as we prepared to close the MillerCoors transaction on October 11. Please see the earnings release we distributed earlier this morning for a detailed review of our business unit financial results in the quarter. Also, please see the Investor Relations page of our website this morning for updated 2015 full year and 2016 year-to-date pro forma financial statements that reflect our preliminary purchase accounting for the transaction.
Now looking forward to the remainder of 2016, following are some financial quarters to consider for the fourth quarter. 
Our Europe business results will continue to reflect lower net pension benefits. Total alcohol prohibition in Bihar has presented a headwind in our International business since its enactment in April this year, and we will continue to address this within our business. And finally foreign currency translation, which at current exchange rate, would be a headwind of approximately $8 million to our underlying pretax results in the fourth quarter this year, with all of the impact in Europe. Given the volatility of our key foreign currencies, particularly the British pound, it is important to watch these rates closely.
Now regarding 2016 guidance, all of the following metrics exclude any effects of the MillerCoors and Miller global brands transaction. For the full year, we continue to expect cash contributions to our defined benefit pension plans to be in the range of $45 million to $65 million in 2016 and pension expense of approximately $17 million including our 42% of MillerCoors contributions and expense. Underlying capital spending of approximately $220 million, which excludes capital this year related to the construction of our new brewery in British Columbia, which we expect to be largely funded by the proceeds from the sale of our Vancouver brewery earlier this month. MG&A expense in Corporate of approximately $120 million on an underlying basis, which excludes expenses related to the MillerCoors transaction. 
Consolidated net interest expense of approximately $110 million on an underlying basis, which excludes transaction-related interest expense and income. An underlying effective tax rate in the range of 18% to 22%, assuming no further changes in tax laws, settlement of tax audits, excess tax deductions for share-based compensation or adjustments to our uncertain tax position. As far as our cost outlook is concerned, we continue to expect full year 2016 cost of goods sold per hectoliter in Canada and Europe to increase at a low single-digit rate in local currency, and we expect a low single-digit decrease in MillerCoors and a double-digit increase in international versus prior year. As we first mentioned several months ago, with the completion of the MillerCoors transaction, we are no longer providing the most recent volume trends for each of our businesses. 
Earlier this year, we told you that we would share more specifics regarding 3 new performance metrics with you once the transaction closed. These metrics are: transaction adjusted EPS, an all-in multiyear cost savings target and an early view of our combined company underlying free cash flow target for 2017. 
So taking these in order, transaction adjusted EPS is a new non-GAAP performance measure we are introducing to provide enhanced visibility to the performance and value of our company post transaction. To calculate this measure, we start with underlying book EPS, a non-GAAP measure, and then add back after-tax book amortization that is directly related to the transaction, and we then add the transaction related cash tax benefits. 
Based on our latest pro forma financial statements, which we will post on our website this morning, our 2015 pro forma transaction adjusted EPS was $6.11 per diluted share on an underlying basis. This calculation includes transaction-related after-tax book amortization of approximately $42 million and cash tax benefits of $275 million per year, but it does not include any pretax income related to the Miller global brands nor any benefit from deal synergies. 
Because the routes to market and supply-chain structures for many of the Miller global brands markets are being developed, the cost and margin structure for these businesses are also work-in-progress. As a result, we have decided to exclude the Miller global brands from our pro forma results for periods prior to the close of the transaction. 
For the first 3 quarters of 2016, pro forma transaction adjusted EPS was $5.43 per diluted share, an increase of 4% versus $5.22 per diluted share for the first 3 quarters of 2015.
Going on to our second metric, cost savings over the next 3 years. We have set an all-in target of $550 million, which will be made up of ongoing cost savings in all of our businesses, as well as transaction-related synergies, all of which will be delivered by the third full year of our combined company, which is 2019. Approximately half of this 3-year cost savings target is synergies, which represents a synergy goal that is nearly 40% larger and 25% faster than the original $200 million synergies target over 4 years that we shared with you when we announced the transaction nearly a year ago. We expect the synergies delivery to be weighted towards years 2 and 3, while the other cost savings will be weighted towards years 1 and 2 of the program. 
As we have been discussing for the past year, we expect these cost savings to come primarily from the areas of global procurement and shared services, along with North American supply chain so they will primarily benefit the cost of goods sold line. As part of the planning process for the past year, we have also identified a moderate amount of savings from information systems. Please note that we do not plan to provide additional specifics regarding annual phasing of the cost savings or a detailed breakout of transaction-related synergies versus other cost savings. 
Related to this cost savings goal, we anticipate incurring approximately $350 million of onetime incremental cash costs over 3 years to capture synergies, about evenly split between incremental capital spending and cash operating expense, primarily in the first 2 years of the program. Note that the incremental CapEx would be on top of our recent all-in CapEx run rate of approximately $650 million to $700 million, plus or minus 10%, including 100% of MillerCoors CapEx in recent years. 
With a base CapEx spend of approximately $2.1 billion over the past 3 years, the CapEx needed to capture synergies represents an increment of less than 10% to our current run rate. We will continue to apply our PACC model to these and all other significant potential capital and cash deployment decisions to help ensure that they are aligned with our priorities. 
Finally, as always, when these cost savings initiatives are completed in 3 years, we will continue to pursue cost reductions across our business in order to provide resources to help drive our top line, bottom line and shareholder value. 
Finally, to help you model our business, we also want to share our preliminary underlying free cash flow target for 2017, which is $1.1 billion, plus or minus 10%. Note that this target includes the impact of incremental interest expense, U.S. tax expense and synergies-related CapEx in 2017 as well as the cash tax benefits resulting from the transaction. As in the past, we plan to report back to you each year regarding how we are performing against these targets.
So at this point, I'll turn it back over to Mark for highlights of the transaction, business outlook and Q&A. Mark?"
263765,404132594,1069215,"Molson Coors Brewing Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2016",2016-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Molson Coors Beverage Company","Executives","Thanks, Mauricio. This clearly is a historic time in the evolution of Molson Coors. Three weeks ago, we completed our acquisition of the remaining 58% stake in the MillerCoors joint venture, along with the Miller global brand portfolio. We emerged as the",1469,"Thanks, Mauricio. This clearly is a historic time in the evolution of Molson Coors. Three weeks ago, we completed our acquisition of the remaining 58% stake in the MillerCoors joint venture, along with the Miller global brand portfolio. We emerged as the world's third largest brewer, bringing together Molson Coors and MillerCoors into a bigger, better organization. As one company with an expanded portfolio of iconic brands, we intend to leverage our increased scale, resources, synergies and combined commercial experience to accelerate our First Choice agenda and deliver long-term shareholder value. Because of this game-changing transaction, Molson Coors now controls 100% of the highly strategic and attractive U.S. business and will accelerate new growth opportunities in emerging and developed beer markets globally through the Miller brand rights. 
This transaction also improves our operating efficiency and go-to-market strategy by step-changing our commercial capability on a truly global scale. Financially, this is a compelling combination based on a very attractive price, planned operational synergies, substantial cash tax benefits and the attractive financial package that we put in place earlier this year.
As a reminder, for $12 billion of cash, we have purchased the remaining 58% of the MillerCoors joint venture that we didn't already own. Sole ownership of the Miller brands, which outside of the U.S., will be managed in more than 50 countries by our Molson Coors International, Molson Coors Canada, Molson Coors Europe businesses; perpetual royalty-free U.S. licensees for the existing SABMiller import and licensed brands, including Peroni, Pilsner Urquell, Foster's, Grolsch and Redd's, for which MillerCoors most recently paid royalties of approximately $60 million in 2015. And finally, because this is an asset transaction for U.S. tax purposes, we will receive immediate cash tax benefits that we now estimate will exceed $275 million annually for the next 15 years. This represents an increase from our previous estimate of more than $250 million per year due to the detailed tax diligence work that we've completed during the past year. 
The purchase price implies a headline enterprise value multiple of 11.5x 2015 combined underlying EBITDA. By including the present value of the cash tax benefits, the purchase multiple drops an effective 9.2x. These tax benefits are common with this type of asset transaction, and they carry a high degree of certainty. As such, we believe this is the most appropriate way to value this combination. This represents a very attractive purchase multiple even though it does not include the anticipated benefit of our transaction-related synergies. We expect this combination to be accretive to underlying diluted EPS and transaction adjusted EPS in the first full year of operations before synergies, and we expected to meet our PACC hurdle rates in year 1, which is consistent with our disciplined use of cash framework.
Now looking forward as a combined company, our teams are focused on driving our First Choice agenda, finishing the year with strong performance in each of our businesses and hitting the ground running on integration. You've heard us speak about these themes in the past, but each of our businesses will continue to focus on transforming our portfolio to the Above Premium segment, introducing value-driving innovation, integrating the Miller brands and lifting and shifting best practices and talent across our global organization.
To provide just a few examples by business. In the U.S., Tenth and Blake will focus on the development and integration of these new craft partners in Archer, Terrapin, Hop Valley and Revolver. In FMBs, Henry's will add a new hard grape flavor to its line of hard sodas, while introducing a new line of hard sparkling waters to play in the growing alcohol sparkling water category. Henry's Hard Sparkling will be launched nationally in March with lemon and lime and passion fruit flavors. Redd's and Blue Moon Belgian White will introduce new aluminum paint packaging in the second quarter of 2017. 
Over the past few months, we've built a strategy that elevates across our economy portfolio. For example, Miller High Life recently announced plans to reintroduce new advertising creative that brings back its classic jingle, ""If you've got time, we've got the beer,"" while also revamping its packaging to further play up its unique heritage. 
Elsewhere across the Economy portfolio, Hamms will be reintroduced nationally at an opening price point and Milwaukee's Best is getting a total packaging update to give a fresh new look. And beginning early in 2017, we'll fully revamp Keystone Light including all new packaging and advertising. 
For our innovation in the value category, we are introducing spiked watermelon, the Steel Reserve brand family, and we're increasing the size of our PET bottle singles from 40 MCs to 42 MCs for the same price, again, to deliver value to our consumers and customers. 
In Canada, our team is integrating the Miller brands back into our portfolio and will double down on Above Premium MGD. We're also assessing the opportunities for Miller High Life and other U.S. brands that we can lift and shift [ph] to the Canada market. Mad Jack is performing well in the FMB space and we will consider other innovative options that will drive value for our Canada consumers and customers.
In Europe, we now have the Miller brands in the U.K. and Ireland, and this business is also preparing to begin managing the international license and export business in the region starting on January 1. This will allow us to drive Staropramen, Carling and other lead brands with fully aligned strategies across Europe. We'll also continue to build out our craft portfolio, including further expansion of Blue Moon across the region.
Our International business is well on the way to full integration of the Miller global brands into our portfolio, and we're leveraging a new footprint that complements our growth strategy in emerging markets. For example, in Panama and Honduras, where our partners are have already embraced Coors Light, we're ready to accelerate growth with the addition of the Miller brands. The International team has also begun planning -- the planning process for transitioning Puerto Rico over for MillerCoors on January 1. So going forward, the Coors and Miller brands will be the priority brands for our International business. 
To summarize, we're delighted to have completed the MillerCoors transaction, which is a compelling strategic and financial opportunity for our company and our shareholders that catapults Molson Coors to the next level. And this combination fits into our key priorities in 3 specific areas. 
Firstly, in brand-led growth, the cash tax benefits and cost savings made possible by this transaction provide resources that we can invest in accelerating the transformation at the front end of our business, through, for example, investing behind our core brands across all of our geographies, premiumizing our portfolio and engaging with consumers in new ways, including cross-border exchange of category changing innovation, expanding the depth and reach of our international brands in fast-growing markets, including securing a certain and aligned future for the Miller brands globally, and finally, leveraging our shared commercial capability through extraordinary brand building, world-class insights, digital leadership and unrivaled customer excellence.
Secondly, this transformation of our company offers unique opportunities for us to drive cash through a substantial tax benefits, cost synergies, cross-border working capital improvements and disciplined use of our PACC model across the combined company. We expect all of these benefits to provide strong free cash flow and allow us to quickly pay down acquisition debt and maintain our commitment to investment grade debt ratings. 
And thirdly, this transaction represents a prudent high-return use of cash Molson Coors and our shareholders. We're using this transaction not only to make Molson Coors a bigger company but also a better company without integration complexity normally found in a deal of this size. 
As we focus on deleveraging our balance sheet over the next 2 to 3 years, we've suspended our share repurchase program and have announced that we plan to maintain our current dividend per share level, and we'll revisit our dividend policy once deleveraging is well underway. Overall, this combination is a game-changer in our ambition to become first choice for consumers and customers, and it's highly consistent with our goals and our focus on building extraordinary brands, delivering innovation and driving significant value to our shareholders.

I wasn't expecting the second part of that. So well, I'm chatting, Stewart, get thinking. I mean, just a couple of comments on the first part in terms of performance in the quarter, our strategy remains consistent in Canada around making sure that we modernize our supply chain and drive our costs down, taking further cost out of our business and then improving our overall commercial performance. You're aware of some of the changes that we've made at leadership level. And as Fred and -- Fred's #2 in the customer areas [indiscernible] move across from Europe. Their absolute focus will be on commercial execution, really driving our field sales management and model and really, I think, deploying more assertive execution in the marketplace. That started to show up in some of our input measures. But Stewart, do you want to offer just a little bit more color on the third quarter, the things that you're pleased about? And then if you can think about the recreational drugs questions as well and offer a perspective on that, that would be helpful."

First, FX -- transactional FX related to U.S. sourcing of raw materials, lower volumes and higher marketing spend. And on the volume side, Mark pointed out that we are seeing some green shoots. I mean, we've been growing share in the Atlantic provinces. The West, which is -- has been a difficult area for us in September, as we saw progress in the third quarter, September, actually, was flat share. In Ontario, a big beer market for us. We saw growing share in the LCBO and in the on-premise. So the number of tough areas is actually shrinking, and I think our increased execution certainly will help that. At the same time, the higher levels of marketing spend are yielding positive improvements in our brand scores. And of course, we expect that we'll be able to translate that into improved volumes. So that's a trend in the quarter, Vivien. I'll pause for a second in case there's anything else before I talk about cannabis."

Now there are obviously some tailwinds that are represented in the form of the $275 million of cash tax benefits, but also some headwinds, because we have a significant interest expense increase of around $250 million per annum because of the acquisition financing. There's additional D&A expense from the step-up due to the fair value remeasurement required by purchase accounting of around $70 million.

We've made 4 acquisitions, which we're pleased about, and we've grown our flavored malt beverage share meaningfully over the last year or so. Our Premium Lights continued to perform well. Miller Lite's gained share of the Premium Light segment for the eighth consecutive quarter, Judy; and Coors Light gained share for the sixth consecutive quarter. We've reengaged the Economy drinker, and it's a high priority for us. We've recently announced our Economy strategy at the fall distributor meeting and that was well-received by our distribution network. Our Above Premium performance specifically was hindered by some of the performance on Blue Moon and Leinenkugel's, particularly seasonals and variety packs, and that's an industry-wide trend, and it's an issue we're addressing.

So the first one, bigger picture, something that every investor I talk to ask me is, ""What's the track record of Mark Hunter and Gavin Hattersley, and why are they the right people to execute here?"" And of course, I ask the question with great respect, right? But people look at Brit [ph] and Philippe having been at that for 20 years. So what we want to understand when we look at MillerCoors; Leo Kiely, a few years ago; Tom Long for 4 years; and now, Gavin. So if you can answer the question in terms of, what's your track record and why should investors be comfortable that this is the right management team to execute the significant plan? And the second question maybe is more for Mauricio, just basic in terms of numbers. I guess there's different ways to get -- to judge the guidance that you've given us today. One way I judge it is that I look at the cost savings that MillerCoors generated over the last 4 -- over last 5 years on average, right? About $120 million per annum, $88 million this year, you're running about $80 million this year, if I look at the $90 million this year for the third quarter. So you've done $120 million on average over the last 5 years. But then I look at the synergy number you are giving us today, $275 million divided by 3, that's $92 million. And then I take out from the balance, the Molson Coors savings ex MillerCoors, there's another $32 million of cost savings in MillerCoors. So synergies plus cost savings in MillerCoors, and I know that the lines get blurred, are about $124 million per annum over the next 3 years, which is what MillerCoors did over the last 5 years. So not so sure to be -- how to judge that number. Nice that you can sustain it. But if this is the significant transaction and there's this plethora of opportunities that we've talked about in terms of cost savings because now you own the full company, why would the cost savings, $124 million as per my math, total, would be pretty much similar to what you've been doing for the last 5 years. I guess if you can answer -- well, those are the 2 questions."

I'll let our track record speak for ourselves. We're both seasoned professionals who've been in the beer industry for a long period of time, driven significant change across many businesses, integrated businesses like StarBev and driven this transaction at a rate, which on a valuation multiple, I think, is utterly compelling for our business. So I'll just leave it there. I'm not going to talk in any more detail beyond that. And let me just back up on the second question. I know you asked for Mauricio. But what we have endeavored to do here is get full transparency and ensure that we are not duplicating any of the cost savings in our business. And clearly, we've now set a target for the next 3 years. We'll update that on an annual basis. There was a lot of questions around the synergies number, and we have scaled that up and picked up the pace on the synergies number. And we've ensured that there's no duplication with the synergies on an ongoing underlying cost savings, and we'll continue to test ourselves as to whether that number can be further improved as we actually get into fully running the business. But we feel it's a number we can meet and will attempt to beat. It makes sense as we look at a business, which if you remember, has very, very little geographical overlap. You got to drive this by a number of restructuring initiatives, setting up things like shared services globally, and we'll get at that. And we'll update you if there's any new news on that number, but we feel it's the right number for our business at this point in time."

One of the things I did indicated earlier this year was that we have now developed a small global growth group led by Kandy.

Clearly, some of those opportunities will require incremental investment in our business, but we'll look at those in the round as we aggregate our total sales and marketing spend across our business. So I'm more interested in the quality of our marketing. And I think there's plenty of examples, and there's one in the U.S. market at the moment where people or competitors have been spending very aggressively. And let's just say the incremental spend doesn't always buy you success. I'm really focus on the quality of our marketing and the discipline of our execution, and we'll continue to drive efficiencies across our marketing spend. And if there's a return, that makes sense for us, we'll put it through the PACC model and we will spend incrementally to generate additional returns.

I know that it's hard to have a crystal ball there, but why do you think that is? And just mechanically for your U.S. business, it seems like your distributor inventories are higher than you'd like them to be, so is it reasonable to think your own shipments will lag your STRs on the fourth quarter?"

I don't think it's true to say that craft is weak for everybody. That's a really generous statement. I think there's a number of craft companies that continue to show very strong growth, and we just acquired a number of them, which is a good thing for our business. I think what you are starting to see though in the marketplace is what I described as probably oversupply of flavors in SKUs or beer styles in SKUs. And both retailers and consumers are trying to make sense of the plethora of choice, and that's against the backdrop that craft has been good for the beer industry because it's driven conversations and interest in beer to probably an all-time high. But you get to the point where each SKU has to deliver on a velocity basis and has to actually demonstrate its value to both our customers and our consumers. And as Gavin mentioned earlier, things like seasonal packs, which have been a big driver of the craft industry, have really started to come under pressure because consumers are now, in essence, making up their own seasonal packs by the way that they actually show up the shelves. So I think what you're starting to see is from a retailer perspective, a push to really simplify the offering. And Walmart just did that recently as they reset all of their shelf sets. So the more progressive retailers are really trying to focus on those brands have got long-term distinct positionings and drive velocity per SKU. Also I think from a consumer perspective, because most of the craft growth has been driven on the back of heavily hopped IPAs, consumers are recognizing that those beers are great, but they're not beers that you can probably take with you through a long occasion, and we're actually starting to see some consumer step back into some of the American light brands. So I think it's just craft starting to kind of shake itself out with the brands that are well-positioned, clearly distinctive, and alongside that, the retailers really starting to simplify their offer. And that's in its infancy at the moment, but I think that's starting to have an impact in overall kind of craft velocity or craft trends. Gavin, I don't know whether you want to add anything to that and then pick up the STW, STRs question?"

Look, I mean, anything I'd add to that, which is pretty much what you said, right, I mean, there's tons of choice and there's not a lot of floorspace. And velocity of retail is important. And that's why our Building with Beer program, which we've launched, Mark, and talked quite a lot about has had such a positive impact with beer buyers at retail, not only on-premise, but also off-premise. As far as the STWs, STRs are concerned, Mark, I mean, fundamentally, there's just the difference in timing. If you remember, at the end of Q2, that dynamic was reversed, where domestic STWs were down and STRs were down less than that. On a year-to-date basis, those 2 numbers are much closer. And generally, we try and align those things much closer by the end of the year as we try and ship to consumption. So I wouldn't get too worked up on quarter-over-quarter because of timing of holidays, price increases and so on."

There are also other savings that are coming from looking at our supply chain network that are not included in the synergy piece of the optimization of the North America supply chain grid.

That's now been clarified and launched and generated a lot of excitement with our distributors. Many of you have asked about our ability to get Coors Light and Miller Lite growing at the same time, and we're now doing that consistently. And alongside them, Coors Banquet is going from strength to strength. And we continue to drive the premiumization of our portfolio, and the craft acquisitions and Henry's are great examples. Don't forget the Redd's, which is now such a significant brand, didn't even exist just over 3 years ago. And my view is that we still have untapped opportunities in our import portfolio as well. So all of the component parts are there. A lot was down to how ruthless we want to be from an execution perspective. But Gavin and the leadership team have driven a significant change in the ambition, the energy and the focus in our U.S. business, and it's been great to see that happening.

Today, Mauricio and I will split our call into 2 parts. First, we will take you through our third quarter 2016 results to, in essence, close out Molson Coors Brewing Company as it's been structured for the past several years. Then we'll turn our attention to our recently completed MillerCoors transaction and to renew our updated financial reporting metrics, along with some perspective for the fourth quarter of this year.
In third quarter, we continue to focus on our First Choice ambition and on building a stronger, broader and more premium brand portfolio, underpinned by incremental sales and marketing investment as we've discussed all year.
Business highlights for the quarter and year-to-date included: Increased net sales revenue per hectoliter on a constant currency basis in all of our businesses for the quarter and year-to-date. We increased investments in our brands globally. Coors Light Miller Lite again gained share in the U.S. Premium Light segment for the quarter, including the highest segment share gain in 3 years for Coors Light. We saw 1.2% global volume growth for Coors Light on a year-to-date basis with growth of more than 14% outside of North America.
We had fast-growing innovations in key markets, including Henry's hard soda in the U.S. and Mad Jack in Canada, and we saw global growth year-to-date in our Above Premium portfolio through, for example, Doom Bar and other Sharp's craft brands in the U.K., Creemore Springs and Belgian Moon in Canada and our 4 newly acquired brewers in the U.S. We also saw strong growth by Staropramen across Europe outside of its whole market. And we also additionally saw cider volume increases with Rekorderlig in Europe and Strongbow in Canada. 
Overall, we continue to strengthen our business through improvements to our sales execution and revenue management capabilities, increased efficiency of our operations and implementation of common global systems. 
Regional highlights for the third quarter and year-to-date are as follows: In the U.S., overall sales to retail volume decreased 4% for the quarter and 2.5% year-to-date on a trailing day adjusted basis, driven primarily by our Below Premium and Premium Light brands. Coors Light and Miller Lite again gained segment market share while STRs declined, reflecting industry trends. Coors Banquet continued to grow STR volume and segment share. And in the higher-margin Above Premium segment, Henry's continues to be the #1 hard soda franchise. Also, our Saint Archer, Terrapin, Hop Valley and Revolver businesses have significantly expanded our craft offering for consumers and customers. 
Domestic net sales revenue per hectoliter grew 1.6% for the quarter and 1.2% year-to-date as a result of favorable net pricing and positive sales mix. On the bottom line, U.S. segment underlying equity income increased 9% in the third quarter, driven primarily by lower cost of goods sold, higher net pricing and positive sales mix. Year-to-date underlying equity income increased 9.3%, primarily due to the factors mentioned above, as well as a $12.3 million anticipated refund of federal excise tax paid in imports, which we discussed on our last earnings call.
In Canada, net sales per hectoliter in local currency increased 0.6%, driven by growth in our Above Premium brands. This NSR increase reflected headline price increases and positive brand mix, but with higher levels of spin [ph] back as we ensured our brands are competitive on a market-by-market basis. 
Our performance in the Above Premium segment continue to be strong as we saw growth in both our own brands and our partner brands. Coors Banquet, Mad Jack and Belgian Moon all continue to deliver strong growth, and our craft brands continued to grow share of the total beer category. 
The mainstream segment continued to face market pressure where our brand health scores for Coors Light and Molson Canadian have continued to improve month-over-month, and our sales execution input measures are similarly improving.
Our COGS per hectoliter increased 3.5% in local currency, with most of the increase being driven by volume deleverage and mix shift to higher-cost products. Our cost savings program continue to be strong and fully offset the impacts of inflation and other cost increases in the quarter. And the bottom line underlying pretax income declined by $15.9 million in the third quarter, driven by lower volume, increased COGS, higher marketing investments and foreign exchange impacts of U.S. dollar-based supplier contracts.
Europe net sales decreased 0.6% in local currency for the third quarter, driven by 1.4% lower volume due to weaker demand versus strong sales last year across much of the region, along with some trade inventory overhang from the Euro 2016 football or soccer championships in the second quarter this year.
Nonetheless, we held our share position in the region, and our continued portfolio premiumization and mix management drove a 1.2% increase in net sales revenue per hectoliter from local currency. In the quarter, we achieved strong growth by Coors Light, Staropramen outside of the Czech Republic and our craft portfolios, including Blue Moon, Doom Bar and the other Sharp's brands, as well as Rekorderlig Cider. 
Underlying pretax income was lower in the quarter due to higher brand amortization expenses, lower net pension benefit and unfavorable foreign currency movements, especially related to the depreciation of the British pound. Year-to-date, the benefit of higher net sales and NSR per hectoliter from local currency volume and market share in Europe were more than offset by unfavorable foreign currency movements, higher brand amortization expense, lower pension benefits and the termination of the Heineken contract brewing arrangements in the U.K.
Our International business continues to drive Coors Light momentum with year-to-date volume for this brand, up mid-single digits, led by growth in Latin America and Australia. Excluding the impact of total alcohol prohibition in Bihar, India and the transfer of the Staropramen U.K. business to our Europe segment, our year-to-date underlying pretax performance has significantly improved versus last year, driven by volume growth in the remaining international markets.
Now I'll turn it over to Mauricio to give third quarter financial highlights and new performance metrics. Mauricio?"
263765,404132594,1069526,"Molson Coors Brewing Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2016",2016-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Molson Coors Beverage Company","Executives","Thank you, Mark, and hello, everybody. As a reminder, all of the results that I will be discussing are in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise noted. So our third quarter and year-to-date financial headlines are as follows: Net sales were down approximately",1596,"Thank you, Mark, and hello, everybody. As a reminder, all of the results that I will be discussing are in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise noted. 
So our third quarter and year-to-date financial headlines are as follows: 
Net sales were down approximately 7% in U.S. dollars in the third quarter and about 5% year-to-date, primarily due to currency movements, especially in Europe, as well as lower worldwide volume. On a constant currency basis, net sales decreased 2.2% in the third quarter and were virtually unchanged year-to-date versus the same period last year. Our net sales per hectoliter in constant currency increased 1.3% in the quarter and 0.9% year-to-date due to positive mix. 
On a U.S. GAAP basis, we reported third quarter after-tax income from continuing operations attributable to Molson Coors of $202.5 million, up from $13.7 million a year ago. This increase was primarily driven by cycling $275 million of impairment charges recorded for certain Europe brands last year. 
On a year-to-date basis, U.S. GAAP after-tax income increased 67.5% to $539.8 million, driven by brand impairment charges last year and a gain on the sale of our Vancouver brewery earlier this year. Third quarter underlying after-tax income decreased 14.3% to $222.7 million or $1.03 per diluted share, driven by lower worldwide volume, a higher underlying tax rate and higher brand investments globally, which were partially offset by positive mix and higher underlying U.S. equity income.
Year-to-date underlying after-tax income decreased 5.5% to $576.4 million, driven by the same factors as in the quarter, along with negative foreign currency movements. Underlying pretax income declined 6.2% for the third quarter and 1.3% year-to-date. Underlying EBITDA in the quarter was $403.1 million, 4.1% lower than a year ago, and our year-to-date underlying EBITDA declined 0.8%. 
Underlying free cash flow in the first 3 quarters of 2016 was $469.4 million. This represents a decrease of $24.9 million from the prior year, primarily driven by lower underlying after-tax income and lower distributions from MillerCoors. 
Total debt at the end of the third quarter was $9.9 billion. Cash and cash equivalents totaled slightly less than $10 billion, resulting in a net cash position of $94 million as we prepared to close the MillerCoors transaction on October 11. Please see the earnings release we distributed earlier this morning for a detailed review of our business unit financial results in the quarter. Also, please see the Investor Relations page of our website this morning for updated 2015 full year and 2016 year-to-date pro forma financial statements that reflect our preliminary purchase accounting for the transaction.
Now looking forward to the remainder of 2016, following are some financial quarters to consider for the fourth quarter. 
Our Europe business results will continue to reflect lower net pension benefits. Total alcohol prohibition in Bihar has presented a headwind in our International business since its enactment in April this year, and we will continue to address this within our business. And finally foreign currency translation, which at current exchange rate, would be a headwind of approximately $8 million to our underlying pretax results in the fourth quarter this year, with all of the impact in Europe. Given the volatility of our key foreign currencies, particularly the British pound, it is important to watch these rates closely.
Now regarding 2016 guidance, all of the following metrics exclude any effects of the MillerCoors and Miller global brands transaction. For the full year, we continue to expect cash contributions to our defined benefit pension plans to be in the range of $45 million to $65 million in 2016 and pension expense of approximately $17 million including our 42% of MillerCoors contributions and expense. Underlying capital spending of approximately $220 million, which excludes capital this year related to the construction of our new brewery in British Columbia, which we expect to be largely funded by the proceeds from the sale of our Vancouver brewery earlier this month. MG&A expense in Corporate of approximately $120 million on an underlying basis, which excludes expenses related to the MillerCoors transaction. 
Consolidated net interest expense of approximately $110 million on an underlying basis, which excludes transaction-related interest expense and income. An underlying effective tax rate in the range of 18% to 22%, assuming no further changes in tax laws, settlement of tax audits, excess tax deductions for share-based compensation or adjustments to our uncertain tax position. As far as our cost outlook is concerned, we continue to expect full year 2016 cost of goods sold per hectoliter in Canada and Europe to increase at a low single-digit rate in local currency, and we expect a low single-digit decrease in MillerCoors and a double-digit increase in international versus prior year. As we first mentioned several months ago, with the completion of the MillerCoors transaction, we are no longer providing the most recent volume trends for each of our businesses. 
Earlier this year, we told you that we would share more specifics regarding 3 new performance metrics with you once the transaction closed. These metrics are: transaction adjusted EPS, an all-in multiyear cost savings target and an early view of our combined company underlying free cash flow target for 2017. 
So taking these in order, transaction adjusted EPS is a new non-GAAP performance measure we are introducing to provide enhanced visibility to the performance and value of our company post transaction. To calculate this measure, we start with underlying book EPS, a non-GAAP measure, and then add back after-tax book amortization that is directly related to the transaction, and we then add the transaction related cash tax benefits. 
Based on our latest pro forma financial statements, which we will post on our website this morning, our 2015 pro forma transaction adjusted EPS was $6.11 per diluted share on an underlying basis. This calculation includes transaction-related after-tax book amortization of approximately $42 million and cash tax benefits of $275 million per year, but it does not include any pretax income related to the Miller global brands nor any benefit from deal synergies. 
Because the routes to market and supply-chain structures for many of the Miller global brands markets are being developed, the cost and margin structure for these businesses are also work-in-progress. As a result, we have decided to exclude the Miller global brands from our pro forma results for periods prior to the close of the transaction. 
For the first 3 quarters of 2016, pro forma transaction adjusted EPS was $5.43 per diluted share, an increase of 4% versus $5.22 per diluted share for the first 3 quarters of 2015.
Going on to our second metric, cost savings over the next 3 years. We have set an all-in target of $550 million, which will be made up of ongoing cost savings in all of our businesses, as well as transaction-related synergies, all of which will be delivered by the third full year of our combined company, which is 2019. Approximately half of this 3-year cost savings target is synergies, which represents a synergy goal that is nearly 40% larger and 25% faster than the original $200 million synergies target over 4 years that we shared with you when we announced the transaction nearly a year ago. We expect the synergies delivery to be weighted towards years 2 and 3, while the other cost savings will be weighted towards years 1 and 2 of the program. 
As we have been discussing for the past year, we expect these cost savings to come primarily from the areas of global procurement and shared services, along with North American supply chain so they will primarily benefit the cost of goods sold line. As part of the planning process for the past year, we have also identified a moderate amount of savings from information systems. Please note that we do not plan to provide additional specifics regarding annual phasing of the cost savings or a detailed breakout of transaction-related synergies versus other cost savings. 
Related to this cost savings goal, we anticipate incurring approximately $350 million of onetime incremental cash costs over 3 years to capture synergies, about evenly split between incremental capital spending and cash operating expense, primarily in the first 2 years of the program. Note that the incremental CapEx would be on top of our recent all-in CapEx run rate of approximately $650 million to $700 million, plus or minus 10%, including 100% of MillerCoors CapEx in recent years. 
With a base CapEx spend of approximately $2.1 billion over the past 3 years, the CapEx needed to capture synergies represents an increment of less than 10% to our current run rate. We will continue to apply our PACC model to these and all other significant potential capital and cash deployment decisions to help ensure that they are aligned with our priorities. 
Finally, as always, when these cost savings initiatives are completed in 3 years, we will continue to pursue cost reductions across our business in order to provide resources to help drive our top line, bottom line and shareholder value. 
Finally, to help you model our business, we also want to share our preliminary underlying free cash flow target for 2017, which is $1.1 billion, plus or minus 10%. Note that this target includes the impact of incremental interest expense, U.S. tax expense and synergies-related CapEx in 2017 as well as the cash tax benefits resulting from the transaction. As in the past, we plan to report back to you each year regarding how we are performing against these targets.
So at this point, I'll turn it back over to Mark for highlights of the transaction, business outlook and Q&A. Mark?"
263765,404132594,1069526,"Molson Coors Brewing Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2016",2016-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Molson Coors Beverage Company","Executives","Thanks, Mauricio. This clearly is a historic time in the evolution of Molson Coors. Three weeks ago, we completed our acquisition of the remaining 58% stake in the MillerCoors joint venture, along with the Miller global brand portfolio. We emerged as the",1469,"Thanks, Mauricio. This clearly is a historic time in the evolution of Molson Coors. Three weeks ago, we completed our acquisition of the remaining 58% stake in the MillerCoors joint venture, along with the Miller global brand portfolio. We emerged as the world's third largest brewer, bringing together Molson Coors and MillerCoors into a bigger, better organization. As one company with an expanded portfolio of iconic brands, we intend to leverage our increased scale, resources, synergies and combined commercial experience to accelerate our First Choice agenda and deliver long-term shareholder value. Because of this game-changing transaction, Molson Coors now controls 100% of the highly strategic and attractive U.S. business and will accelerate new growth opportunities in emerging and developed beer markets globally through the Miller brand rights. 
This transaction also improves our operating efficiency and go-to-market strategy by step-changing our commercial capability on a truly global scale. Financially, this is a compelling combination based on a very attractive price, planned operational synergies, substantial cash tax benefits and the attractive financial package that we put in place earlier this year.
As a reminder, for $12 billion of cash, we have purchased the remaining 58% of the MillerCoors joint venture that we didn't already own. Sole ownership of the Miller brands, which outside of the U.S., will be managed in more than 50 countries by our Molson Coors International, Molson Coors Canada, Molson Coors Europe businesses; perpetual royalty-free U.S. licensees for the existing SABMiller import and licensed brands, including Peroni, Pilsner Urquell, Foster's, Grolsch and Redd's, for which MillerCoors most recently paid royalties of approximately $60 million in 2015. And finally, because this is an asset transaction for U.S. tax purposes, we will receive immediate cash tax benefits that we now estimate will exceed $275 million annually for the next 15 years. This represents an increase from our previous estimate of more than $250 million per year due to the detailed tax diligence work that we've completed during the past year. 
The purchase price implies a headline enterprise value multiple of 11.5x 2015 combined underlying EBITDA. By including the present value of the cash tax benefits, the purchase multiple drops an effective 9.2x. These tax benefits are common with this type of asset transaction, and they carry a high degree of certainty. As such, we believe this is the most appropriate way to value this combination. This represents a very attractive purchase multiple even though it does not include the anticipated benefit of our transaction-related synergies. We expect this combination to be accretive to underlying diluted EPS and transaction adjusted EPS in the first full year of operations before synergies, and we expected to meet our PACC hurdle rates in year 1, which is consistent with our disciplined use of cash framework.
Now looking forward as a combined company, our teams are focused on driving our First Choice agenda, finishing the year with strong performance in each of our businesses and hitting the ground running on integration. You've heard us speak about these themes in the past, but each of our businesses will continue to focus on transforming our portfolio to the Above Premium segment, introducing value-driving innovation, integrating the Miller brands and lifting and shifting best practices and talent across our global organization.
To provide just a few examples by business. In the U.S., Tenth and Blake will focus on the development and integration of these new craft partners in Archer, Terrapin, Hop Valley and Revolver. In FMBs, Henry's will add a new hard grape flavor to its line of hard sodas, while introducing a new line of hard sparkling waters to play in the growing alcohol sparkling water category. Henry's Hard Sparkling will be launched nationally in March with lemon and lime and passion fruit flavors. Redd's and Blue Moon Belgian White will introduce new aluminum paint packaging in the second quarter of 2017. 
Over the past few months, we've built a strategy that elevates across our economy portfolio. For example, Miller High Life recently announced plans to reintroduce new advertising creative that brings back its classic jingle, ""If you've got time, we've got the beer,"" while also revamping its packaging to further play up its unique heritage. 
Elsewhere across the Economy portfolio, Hamms will be reintroduced nationally at an opening price point and Milwaukee's Best is getting a total packaging update to give a fresh new look. And beginning early in 2017, we'll fully revamp Keystone Light including all new packaging and advertising. 
For our innovation in the value category, we are introducing spiked watermelon, the Steel Reserve brand family, and we're increasing the size of our PET bottle singles from 40 MCs to 42 MCs for the same price, again, to deliver value to our consumers and customers. 
In Canada, our team is integrating the Miller brands back into our portfolio and will double down on Above Premium MGD. We're also assessing the opportunities for Miller High Life and other U.S. brands that we can lift and shift [ph] to the Canada market. Mad Jack is performing well in the FMB space and we will consider other innovative options that will drive value for our Canada consumers and customers.
In Europe, we now have the Miller brands in the U.K. and Ireland, and this business is also preparing to begin managing the international license and export business in the region starting on January 1. This will allow us to drive Staropramen, Carling and other lead brands with fully aligned strategies across Europe. We'll also continue to build out our craft portfolio, including further expansion of Blue Moon across the region.
Our International business is well on the way to full integration of the Miller global brands into our portfolio, and we're leveraging a new footprint that complements our growth strategy in emerging markets. For example, in Panama and Honduras, where our partners are have already embraced Coors Light, we're ready to accelerate growth with the addition of the Miller brands. The International team has also begun planning -- the planning process for transitioning Puerto Rico over for MillerCoors on January 1. So going forward, the Coors and Miller brands will be the priority brands for our International business. 
To summarize, we're delighted to have completed the MillerCoors transaction, which is a compelling strategic and financial opportunity for our company and our shareholders that catapults Molson Coors to the next level. And this combination fits into our key priorities in 3 specific areas. 
Firstly, in brand-led growth, the cash tax benefits and cost savings made possible by this transaction provide resources that we can invest in accelerating the transformation at the front end of our business, through, for example, investing behind our core brands across all of our geographies, premiumizing our portfolio and engaging with consumers in new ways, including cross-border exchange of category changing innovation, expanding the depth and reach of our international brands in fast-growing markets, including securing a certain and aligned future for the Miller brands globally, and finally, leveraging our shared commercial capability through extraordinary brand building, world-class insights, digital leadership and unrivaled customer excellence.
Secondly, this transformation of our company offers unique opportunities for us to drive cash through a substantial tax benefits, cost synergies, cross-border working capital improvements and disciplined use of our PACC model across the combined company. We expect all of these benefits to provide strong free cash flow and allow us to quickly pay down acquisition debt and maintain our commitment to investment grade debt ratings. 
And thirdly, this transaction represents a prudent high-return use of cash Molson Coors and our shareholders. We're using this transaction not only to make Molson Coors a bigger company but also a better company without integration complexity normally found in a deal of this size. 
As we focus on deleveraging our balance sheet over the next 2 to 3 years, we've suspended our share repurchase program and have announced that we plan to maintain our current dividend per share level, and we'll revisit our dividend policy once deleveraging is well underway. Overall, this combination is a game-changer in our ambition to become first choice for consumers and customers, and it's highly consistent with our goals and our focus on building extraordinary brands, delivering innovation and driving significant value to our shareholders.

And then if you can think about the recreational drugs questions as well and offer a perspective on that, that would be helpful."

First, FX -- transactional FX related to U.S. sourcing of raw materials, lower volumes and higher marketing spend. And on the volume side, Mark pointed out that we are seeing some green shoots. I mean, we've been growing share in the Atlantic provinces. The West, which is -- has been a difficult area for us in September, as we saw progress in the third quarter, September, actually, was flat share. In Ontario, a big beer market for us. We saw growing share in the LCBO and in the on-premise. So the number of tough areas is actually shrinking, and I think our increased execution certainly will help that. At the same time, the higher levels of marketing spend are yielding positive improvements in our brand scores. And of course, we expect that we'll be able to translate that into improved volumes. So that's a trend in the quarter, Vivien. I'll pause for a second in case there's anything else before I talk about cannabis."

Now there are obviously some tailwinds that are represented in the form of the $275 million of cash tax benefits, but also some headwinds, because we have a significant interest expense increase of around $250 million per annum because of the acquisition financing. There's additional D&A expense from the step-up due to the fair value remeasurement required by purchase accounting of around $70 million. And there's higher income taxes, because now we own the other 58% of MillerCoors, so we're paying additional taxes of around 200 -- or we will be paying additional taxes of around $200 million in 2017 versus what we did before."

We've got some work to do on the Above Premium segment, but we really like our portfolio there, with the largest craft brand in the country with Blue Moon, and Leinenkugel's is in the top 5 as well. We've made 4 acquisitions, which we're pleased about, and we've grown our flavored malt beverage share meaningfully over the last year or so. Our Premium Lights continued to perform well. Miller Lite's gained share of the Premium Light segment for the eighth consecutive quarter, Judy; and Coors Light gained share for the sixth consecutive quarter. We've reengaged the Economy drinker, and it's a high priority for us. We've recently announced our Economy strategy at the fall distributor meeting and that was well-received by our distribution network. Our Above Premium performance specifically was hindered by some of the performance on Blue Moon and Leinenkugel's, particularly seasonals and variety packs, and that's an industry-wide trend, and it's an issue we're addressing. And we have execution plans for early next year but we are pleased with our performance on a brand like Grapefruit Shandy, which doubled its volumes.

So the first one, bigger picture, something that every investor I talk to ask me is, ""What's the track record of Mark Hunter and Gavin Hattersley, and why are they the right people to execute here?"" And of course, I ask the question with great respect, right? But people look at Brit [ph] and Philippe having been at that for 20 years. So what we want to understand when we look at MillerCoors; Leo Kiely, a few years ago; Tom Long for 4 years; and now, Gavin. So if you can answer the question in terms of, what's your track record and why should investors be comfortable that this is the right management team to execute the significant plan? And the second question maybe is more for Mauricio, just basic in terms of numbers. I guess there's different ways to get -- to judge the guidance that you've given us today. One way I judge it is that I look at the cost savings that MillerCoors generated over the last 4 -- over last 5 years on average, right? About $120 million per annum, $88 million this year, you're running about $80 million this year, if I look at the $90 million this year for the third quarter. So you've done $120 million on average over the last 5 years. But then I look at the synergy number you are giving us today, $275 million divided by 3, that's $92 million. And then I take out from the balance, the Molson Coors savings ex MillerCoors, there's another $32 million of cost savings in MillerCoors. So synergies plus cost savings in MillerCoors, and I know that the lines get blurred, are about $124 million per annum over the next 3 years, which is what MillerCoors did over the last 5 years. So not so sure to be -- how to judge that number. Nice that you can sustain it. But if this is the significant transaction and there's this plethora of opportunities that we've talked about in terms of cost savings because now you own the full company, why would the cost savings, $124 million as per my math, total, would be pretty much similar to what you've been doing for the last 5 years. I guess if you can answer -- well, those are the 2 questions."

Clearly, to your first question, I'm not going to conduct a performance over our quarterly earnings call or get into detail as to why our board believe that I'm the right leader for this business and why I believe Gavin's the right leader for this business. I'll let our track record speak for ourselves. We're both seasoned professionals who've been in the beer industry for a long period of time, driven significant change across many businesses, integrated businesses like StarBev and driven this transaction at a rate, which on a valuation multiple, I think, is utterly compelling for our business. So I'll just leave it there. I'm not going to talk in any more detail beyond that. And let me just back up on the second question. I know you asked for Mauricio. But what we have endeavored to do here is get full transparency and ensure that we are not duplicating any of the cost savings in our business. And clearly, we've now set a target for the next 3 years. We'll update that on an annual basis. There was a lot of questions around the synergies number, and we have scaled that up and picked up the pace on the synergies number. And we've ensured that there's no duplication with the synergies on an ongoing underlying cost savings, and we'll continue to test ourselves as to whether that number can be further improved as we actually get into fully running the business. But we feel it's a number we can meet and will attempt to beat. It makes sense as we look at a business, which if you remember, has very, very little geographical overlap. You got to drive this by a number of restructuring initiatives, setting up things like shared services globally, and we'll get at that. And we'll update you if there's any new news on that number, but we feel it's the right number for our business at this point in time."

One of the things I did indicated earlier this year was that we have now developed a small global growth group led by Kandy.

Clearly, some of those opportunities will require incremental investment in our business, but we'll look at those in the round as we aggregate our total sales and marketing spend across our business. So I'm more interested in the quality of our marketing. And I think there's plenty of examples, and there's one in the U.S. market at the moment where people or competitors have been spending very aggressively. And let's just say the incremental spend doesn't always buy you success. I'm really focus on the quality of our marketing and the discipline of our execution, and we'll continue to drive efficiencies across our marketing spend. And if there's a return, that makes sense for us, we'll put it through the PACC model and we will spend incrementally to generate additional returns.

I don't think it's true to say that craft is weak for everybody. That's a really generous statement. I think there's a number of craft companies that continue to show very strong growth, and we just acquired a number of them, which is a good thing for our business. I think what you are starting to see though in the marketplace is what I described as probably oversupply of flavors in SKUs or beer styles in SKUs. And both retailers and consumers are trying to make sense of the plethora of choice, and that's against the backdrop that craft has been good for the beer industry because it's driven conversations and interest in beer to probably an all-time high. But you get to the point where each SKU has to deliver on a velocity basis and has to actually demonstrate its value to both our customers and our consumers. And as Gavin mentioned earlier, things like seasonal packs, which have been a big driver of the craft industry, have really started to come under pressure because consumers are now, in essence, making up their own seasonal packs by the way that they actually show up the shelves. So I think what you're starting to see is from a retailer perspective, a push to really simplify the offering. And Walmart just did that recently as they reset all of their shelf sets. So the more progressive retailers are really trying to focus on those brands have got long-term distinct positionings and drive velocity per SKU. Also I think from a consumer perspective, because most of the craft growth has been driven on the back of heavily hopped IPAs, consumers are recognizing that those beers are great, but they're not beers that you can probably take with you through a long occasion, and we're actually starting to see some consumer step back into some of the American light brands. So I think it's just craft starting to kind of shake itself out with the brands that are well-positioned, clearly distinctive, and alongside that, the retailers really starting to simplify their offer. And that's in its infancy at the moment, but I think that's starting to have an impact in overall kind of craft velocity or craft trends. Gavin, I don't know whether you want to add anything to that and then pick up the STW, STRs question?"

Look, I mean, anything I'd add to that, which is pretty much what you said, right, I mean, there's tons of choice and there's not a lot of floorspace. And velocity of retail is important. And that's why our Building with Beer program, which we've launched, Mark, and talked quite a lot about has had such a positive impact with beer buyers at retail, not only on-premise, but also off-premise. As far as the STWs, STRs are concerned, Mark, I mean, fundamentally, there's just the difference in timing. If you remember, at the end of Q2, that dynamic was reversed, where domestic STWs were down and STRs were down less than that. On a year-to-date basis, those 2 numbers are much closer. And generally, we try and align those things much closer by the end of the year as we try and ship to consumption. So I wouldn't get too worked up on quarter-over-quarter because of timing of holidays, price increases and so on."

There are also other savings that are coming from looking at our supply chain network that are not included in the synergy piece of the optimization of the North America supply chain grid. So just a lot of savings that are coming from our business as usual, run of the mill, running the business, vis-à-vis the synergies that have specifically to do with those 3 buckets that we alluded to earlier."

That's now been clarified and launched and generated a lot of excitement with our distributors. Many of you have asked about our ability to get Coors Light and Miller Lite growing at the same time, and we're now doing that consistently. And alongside them, Coors Banquet is going from strength to strength. And we continue to drive the premiumization of our portfolio, and the craft acquisitions and Henry's are great examples. Don't forget the Redd's, which is now such a significant brand, didn't even exist just over 3 years ago. And my view is that we still have untapped opportunities in our import portfolio as well. So all of the component parts are there. A lot was down to how ruthless we want to be from an execution perspective. But Gavin and the leadership team have driven a significant change in the ambition, the energy and the focus in our U.S. business, and it's been great to see that happening.

Today, Mauricio and I will split our call into 2 parts. First, we will take you through our third quarter 2016 results to, in essence, close out Molson Coors Brewing Company as it's been structured for the past several years. Then we'll turn our attention to our recently completed MillerCoors transaction and to renew our updated financial reporting metrics, along with some perspective for the fourth quarter of this year.
In third quarter, we continue to focus on our First Choice ambition and on building a stronger, broader and more premium brand portfolio, underpinned by incremental sales and marketing investment as we've discussed all year.
Business highlights for the quarter and year-to-date included: Increased net sales revenue per hectoliter on a constant currency basis in all of our businesses for the quarter and year-to-date. We increased investments in our brands globally. Coors Light Miller Lite again gained share in the U.S. Premium Light segment for the quarter, including the highest segment share gain in 3 years for Coors Light. We saw 1.2% global volume growth for Coors Light on a year-to-date basis with growth of more than 14% outside of North America.
We had fast-growing innovations in key markets, including Henry's hard soda in the U.S. and Mad Jack in Canada, and we saw global growth year-to-date in our Above Premium portfolio through, for example, Doom Bar and other Sharp's craft brands in the U.K., Creemore Springs and Belgian Moon in Canada and our 4 newly acquired brewers in the U.S. We also saw strong growth by Staropramen across Europe outside of its whole market. And we also additionally saw cider volume increases with Rekorderlig in Europe and Strongbow in Canada. 
Overall, we continue to strengthen our business through improvements to our sales execution and revenue management capabilities, increased efficiency of our operations and implementation of common global systems. 
Regional highlights for the third quarter and year-to-date are as follows: In the U.S., overall sales to retail volume decreased 4% for the quarter and 2.5% year-to-date on a trailing day adjusted basis, driven primarily by our Below Premium and Premium Light brands. Coors Light and Miller Lite again gained segment market share while STRs declined, reflecting industry trends. Coors Banquet continued to grow STR volume and segment share. And in the higher-margin Above Premium segment, Henry's continues to be the #1 hard soda franchise. Also, our Saint Archer, Terrapin, Hop Valley and Revolver businesses have significantly expanded our craft offering for consumers and customers. 
Domestic net sales revenue per hectoliter grew 1.6% for the quarter and 1.2% year-to-date as a result of favorable net pricing and positive sales mix. On the bottom line, U.S. segment underlying equity income increased 9% in the third quarter, driven primarily by lower cost of goods sold, higher net pricing and positive sales mix. Year-to-date underlying equity income increased 9.3%, primarily due to the factors mentioned above, as well as a $12.3 million anticipated refund of federal excise tax paid in imports, which we discussed on our last earnings call.
In Canada, net sales per hectoliter in local currency increased 0.6%, driven by growth in our Above Premium brands. This NSR increase reflected headline price increases and positive brand mix, but with higher levels of spin [ph] back as we ensured our brands are competitive on a market-by-market basis. 
Our performance in the Above Premium segment continue to be strong as we saw growth in both our own brands and our partner brands. Coors Banquet, Mad Jack and Belgian Moon all continue to deliver strong growth, and our craft brands continued to grow share of the total beer category. 
The mainstream segment continued to face market pressure where our brand health scores for Coors Light and Molson Canadian have continued to improve month-over-month, and our sales execution input measures are similarly improving.
Our COGS per hectoliter increased 3.5% in local currency, with most of the increase being driven by volume deleverage and mix shift to higher-cost products. Our cost savings program continue to be strong and fully offset the impacts of inflation and other cost increases in the quarter. And the bottom line underlying pretax income declined by $15.9 million in the third quarter, driven by lower volume, increased COGS, higher marketing investments and foreign exchange impacts of U.S. dollar-based supplier contracts.
Europe net sales decreased 0.6% in local currency for the third quarter, driven by 1.4% lower volume due to weaker demand versus strong sales last year across much of the region, along with some trade inventory overhang from the Euro 2016 football or soccer championships in the second quarter this year.
Nonetheless, we held our share position in the region, and our continued portfolio premiumization and mix management drove a 1.2% increase in net sales revenue per hectoliter from local currency. In the quarter, we achieved strong growth by Coors Light, Staropramen outside of the Czech Republic and our craft portfolios, including Blue Moon, Doom Bar and the other Sharp's brands, as well as Rekorderlig Cider. 
Underlying pretax income was lower in the quarter due to higher brand amortization expenses, lower net pension benefit and unfavorable foreign currency movements, especially related to the depreciation of the British pound. Year-to-date, the benefit of higher net sales and NSR per hectoliter from local currency volume and market share in Europe were more than offset by unfavorable foreign currency movements, higher brand amortization expense, lower pension benefits and the termination of the Heineken contract brewing arrangements in the U.K.
Our International business continues to drive Coors Light momentum with year-to-date volume for this brand, up mid-single digits, led by growth in Latin America and Australia. Excluding the impact of total alcohol prohibition in Bihar, India and the transfer of the Staropramen U.K. business to our Europe segment, our year-to-date underlying pretax performance has significantly improved versus last year, driven by volume growth in the remaining international markets.
Now I'll turn it over to Mauricio to give third quarter financial highlights and new performance metrics. Mauricio?"

As a reminder, all of the results that I will be discussing are in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise noted. 
So our third quarter and year-to-date financial headlines are as follows: 
Net sales were down approximately 7% in U.S. dollars in the third quarter and about 5% year-to-date, primarily due to currency movements, especially in Europe, as well as lower worldwide volume. On a constant currency basis, net sales decreased 2.2% in the third quarter and were virtually unchanged year-to-date versus the same period last year. Our net sales per hectoliter in constant currency increased 1.3% in the quarter and 0.9% year-to-date due to positive mix. 
On a U.S. GAAP basis, we reported third quarter after-tax income from continuing operations attributable to Molson Coors of $202.5 million, up from $13.7 million a year ago. This increase was primarily driven by cycling $275 million of impairment charges recorded for certain Europe brands last year. 
On a year-to-date basis, U.S. GAAP after-tax income increased 67.5% to $539.8 million, driven by brand impairment charges last year and a gain on the sale of our Vancouver brewery earlier this year. Third quarter underlying after-tax income decreased 14.3% to $222.7 million or $1.03 per diluted share, driven by lower worldwide volume, a higher underlying tax rate and higher brand investments globally, which were partially offset by positive mix and higher underlying U.S. equity income.
Year-to-date underlying after-tax income decreased 5.5% to $576.4 million, driven by the same factors as in the quarter, along with negative foreign currency movements. Underlying pretax income declined 6.2% for the third quarter and 1.3% year-to-date. Underlying EBITDA in the quarter was $403.1 million, 4.1% lower than a year ago, and our year-to-date underlying EBITDA declined 0.8%. 
Underlying free cash flow in the first 3 quarters of 2016 was $469.4 million. This represents a decrease of $24.9 million from the prior year, primarily driven by lower underlying after-tax income and lower distributions from MillerCoors. 
Total debt at the end of the third quarter was $9.9 billion. Cash and cash equivalents totaled slightly less than $10 billion, resulting in a net cash position of $94 million as we prepared to close the MillerCoors transaction on October 11. Please see the earnings release we distributed earlier this morning for a detailed review of our business unit financial results in the quarter. Also, please see the Investor Relations page of our website this morning for updated 2015 full year and 2016 year-to-date pro forma financial statements that reflect our preliminary purchase accounting for the transaction.
Now looking forward to the remainder of 2016, following are some financial quarters to consider for the fourth quarter. 
Our Europe business results will continue to reflect lower net pension benefits. Total alcohol prohibition in Bihar has presented a headwind in our International business since its enactment in April this year, and we will continue to address this within our business. And finally foreign currency translation, which at current exchange rate, would be a headwind of approximately $8 million to our underlying pretax results in the fourth quarter this year, with all of the impact in Europe. Given the volatility of our key foreign currencies, particularly the British pound, it is important to watch these rates closely.
Now regarding 2016 guidance, all of the following metrics exclude any effects of the MillerCoors and Miller global brands transaction. For the full year, we continue to expect cash contributions to our defined benefit pension plans to be in the range of $45 million to $65 million in 2016 and pension expense of approximately $17 million including our 42% of MillerCoors contributions and expense. Underlying capital spending of approximately $220 million, which excludes capital this year related to the construction of our new brewery in British Columbia, which we expect to be largely funded by the proceeds from the sale of our Vancouver brewery earlier this month. MG&A expense in Corporate of approximately $120 million on an underlying basis, which excludes expenses related to the MillerCoors transaction. 
Consolidated net interest expense of approximately $110 million on an underlying basis, which excludes transaction-related interest expense and income. An underlying effective tax rate in the range of 18% to 22%, assuming no further changes in tax laws, settlement of tax audits, excess tax deductions for share-based compensation or adjustments to our uncertain tax position. As far as our cost outlook is concerned, we continue to expect full year 2016 cost of goods sold per hectoliter in Canada and Europe to increase at a low single-digit rate in local currency, and we expect a low single-digit decrease in MillerCoors and a double-digit increase in international versus prior year. As we first mentioned several months ago, with the completion of the MillerCoors transaction, we are no longer providing the most recent volume trends for each of our businesses. 
Earlier this year, we told you that we would share more specifics regarding 3 new performance metrics with you once the transaction closed. These metrics are: transaction adjusted EPS, an all-in multiyear cost savings target and an early view of our combined company underlying free cash flow target for 2017. 
So taking these in order, transaction adjusted EPS is a new non-GAAP performance measure we are introducing to provide enhanced visibility to the performance and value of our company post transaction. To calculate this measure, we start with underlying book EPS, a non-GAAP measure, and then add back after-tax book amortization that is directly related to the transaction, and we then add the transaction related cash tax benefits. 
Based on our latest pro forma financial statements, which we will post on our website this morning, our 2015 pro forma transaction adjusted EPS was $6.11 per diluted share on an underlying basis. This calculation includes transaction-related after-tax book amortization of approximately $42 million and cash tax benefits of $275 million per year, but it does not include any pretax income related to the Miller global brands nor any benefit from deal synergies. 
Because the routes to market and supply-chain structures for many of the Miller global brands markets are being developed, the cost and margin structure for these businesses are also work-in-progress. As a result, we have decided to exclude the Miller global brands from our pro forma results for periods prior to the close of the transaction. 
For the first 3 quarters of 2016, pro forma transaction adjusted EPS was $5.43 per diluted share, an increase of 4% versus $5.22 per diluted share for the first 3 quarters of 2015.
Going on to our second metric, cost savings over the next 3 years. We have set an all-in target of $550 million, which will be made up of ongoing cost savings in all of our businesses, as well as transaction-related synergies, all of which will be delivered by the third full year of our combined company, which is 2019. Approximately half of this 3-year cost savings target is synergies, which represents a synergy goal that is nearly 40% larger and 25% faster than the original $200 million synergies target over 4 years that we shared with you when we announced the transaction nearly a year ago. We expect the synergies delivery to be weighted towards years 2 and 3, while the other cost savings will be weighted towards years 1 and 2 of the program. 
As we have been discussing for the past year, we expect these cost savings to come primarily from the areas of global procurement and shared services, along with North American supply chain so they will primarily benefit the cost of goods sold line. As part of the planning process for the past year, we have also identified a moderate amount of savings from information systems. Please note that we do not plan to provide additional specifics regarding annual phasing of the cost savings or a detailed breakout of transaction-related synergies versus other cost savings. 
Related to this cost savings goal, we anticipate incurring approximately $350 million of onetime incremental cash costs over 3 years to capture synergies, about evenly split between incremental capital spending and cash operating expense, primarily in the first 2 years of the program. Note that the incremental CapEx would be on top of our recent all-in CapEx run rate of approximately $650 million to $700 million, plus or minus 10%, including 100% of MillerCoors CapEx in recent years. 
With a base CapEx spend of approximately $2.1 billion over the past 3 years, the CapEx needed to capture synergies represents an increment of less than 10% to our current run rate. We will continue to apply our PACC model to these and all other significant potential capital and cash deployment decisions to help ensure that they are aligned with our priorities. 
Finally, as always, when these cost savings initiatives are completed in 3 years, we will continue to pursue cost reductions across our business in order to provide resources to help drive our top line, bottom line and shareholder value. 
Finally, to help you model our business, we also want to share our preliminary underlying free cash flow target for 2017, which is $1.1 billion, plus or minus 10%. Note that this target includes the impact of incremental interest expense, U.S. tax expense and synergies-related CapEx in 2017 as well as the cash tax benefits resulting from the transaction. As in the past, we plan to report back to you each year regarding how we are performing against these targets.
So at this point, I'll turn it back over to Mark for highlights of the transaction, business outlook and Q&A. Mark?"
263765,404132594,1069527,"Molson Coors Brewing Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2016",2016-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Molson Coors Beverage Company","Executives","Thanks, Mauricio. This clearly is a historic time in the evolution of Molson Coors. Three weeks ago, we completed our acquisition of the remaining 58% stake in the MillerCoors joint venture, along with the Miller global brand portfolio. We emerged as the",1469,"Thanks, Mauricio. This clearly is a historic time in the evolution of Molson Coors. Three weeks ago, we completed our acquisition of the remaining 58% stake in the MillerCoors joint venture, along with the Miller global brand portfolio. We emerged as the world's third largest brewer, bringing together Molson Coors and MillerCoors into a bigger, better organization. As one company with an expanded portfolio of iconic brands, we intend to leverage our increased scale, resources, synergies and combined commercial experience to accelerate our First Choice agenda and deliver long-term shareholder value. Because of this game-changing transaction, Molson Coors now controls 100% of the highly strategic and attractive U.S. business and will accelerate new growth opportunities in emerging and developed beer markets globally through the Miller brand rights. 
This transaction also improves our operating efficiency and go-to-market strategy by step-changing our commercial capability on a truly global scale. Financially, this is a compelling combination based on a very attractive price, planned operational synergies, substantial cash tax benefits and the attractive financial package that we put in place earlier this year.
As a reminder, for $12 billion of cash, we have purchased the remaining 58% of the MillerCoors joint venture that we didn't already own. Sole ownership of the Miller brands, which outside of the U.S., will be managed in more than 50 countries by our Molson Coors International, Molson Coors Canada, Molson Coors Europe businesses; perpetual royalty-free U.S. licensees for the existing SABMiller import and licensed brands, including Peroni, Pilsner Urquell, Foster's, Grolsch and Redd's, for which MillerCoors most recently paid royalties of approximately $60 million in 2015. And finally, because this is an asset transaction for U.S. tax purposes, we will receive immediate cash tax benefits that we now estimate will exceed $275 million annually for the next 15 years. This represents an increase from our previous estimate of more than $250 million per year due to the detailed tax diligence work that we've completed during the past year. 
The purchase price implies a headline enterprise value multiple of 11.5x 2015 combined underlying EBITDA. By including the present value of the cash tax benefits, the purchase multiple drops an effective 9.2x. These tax benefits are common with this type of asset transaction, and they carry a high degree of certainty. As such, we believe this is the most appropriate way to value this combination. This represents a very attractive purchase multiple even though it does not include the anticipated benefit of our transaction-related synergies. We expect this combination to be accretive to underlying diluted EPS and transaction adjusted EPS in the first full year of operations before synergies, and we expected to meet our PACC hurdle rates in year 1, which is consistent with our disciplined use of cash framework.
Now looking forward as a combined company, our teams are focused on driving our First Choice agenda, finishing the year with strong performance in each of our businesses and hitting the ground running on integration. You've heard us speak about these themes in the past, but each of our businesses will continue to focus on transforming our portfolio to the Above Premium segment, introducing value-driving innovation, integrating the Miller brands and lifting and shifting best practices and talent across our global organization.
To provide just a few examples by business. In the U.S., Tenth and Blake will focus on the development and integration of these new craft partners in Archer, Terrapin, Hop Valley and Revolver. In FMBs, Henry's will add a new hard grape flavor to its line of hard sodas, while introducing a new line of hard sparkling waters to play in the growing alcohol sparkling water category. Henry's Hard Sparkling will be launched nationally in March with lemon and lime and passion fruit flavors. Redd's and Blue Moon Belgian White will introduce new aluminum paint packaging in the second quarter of 2017. 
Over the past few months, we've built a strategy that elevates across our economy portfolio. For example, Miller High Life recently announced plans to reintroduce new advertising creative that brings back its classic jingle, ""If you've got time, we've got the beer,"" while also revamping its packaging to further play up its unique heritage. 
Elsewhere across the Economy portfolio, Hamms will be reintroduced nationally at an opening price point and Milwaukee's Best is getting a total packaging update to give a fresh new look. And beginning early in 2017, we'll fully revamp Keystone Light including all new packaging and advertising. 
For our innovation in the value category, we are introducing spiked watermelon, the Steel Reserve brand family, and we're increasing the size of our PET bottle singles from 40 MCs to 42 MCs for the same price, again, to deliver value to our consumers and customers. 
In Canada, our team is integrating the Miller brands back into our portfolio and will double down on Above Premium MGD. We're also assessing the opportunities for Miller High Life and other U.S. brands that we can lift and shift [ph] to the Canada market. Mad Jack is performing well in the FMB space and we will consider other innovative options that will drive value for our Canada consumers and customers.
In Europe, we now have the Miller brands in the U.K. and Ireland, and this business is also preparing to begin managing the international license and export business in the region starting on January 1. This will allow us to drive Staropramen, Carling and other lead brands with fully aligned strategies across Europe. We'll also continue to build out our craft portfolio, including further expansion of Blue Moon across the region.
Our International business is well on the way to full integration of the Miller global brands into our portfolio, and we're leveraging a new footprint that complements our growth strategy in emerging markets. For example, in Panama and Honduras, where our partners are have already embraced Coors Light, we're ready to accelerate growth with the addition of the Miller brands. The International team has also begun planning -- the planning process for transitioning Puerto Rico over for MillerCoors on January 1. So going forward, the Coors and Miller brands will be the priority brands for our International business. 
To summarize, we're delighted to have completed the MillerCoors transaction, which is a compelling strategic and financial opportunity for our company and our shareholders that catapults Molson Coors to the next level. And this combination fits into our key priorities in 3 specific areas. 
Firstly, in brand-led growth, the cash tax benefits and cost savings made possible by this transaction provide resources that we can invest in accelerating the transformation at the front end of our business, through, for example, investing behind our core brands across all of our geographies, premiumizing our portfolio and engaging with consumers in new ways, including cross-border exchange of category changing innovation, expanding the depth and reach of our international brands in fast-growing markets, including securing a certain and aligned future for the Miller brands globally, and finally, leveraging our shared commercial capability through extraordinary brand building, world-class insights, digital leadership and unrivaled customer excellence.
Secondly, this transformation of our company offers unique opportunities for us to drive cash through a substantial tax benefits, cost synergies, cross-border working capital improvements and disciplined use of our PACC model across the combined company. We expect all of these benefits to provide strong free cash flow and allow us to quickly pay down acquisition debt and maintain our commitment to investment grade debt ratings. 
And thirdly, this transaction represents a prudent high-return use of cash Molson Coors and our shareholders. We're using this transaction not only to make Molson Coors a bigger company but also a better company without integration complexity normally found in a deal of this size. 
As we focus on deleveraging our balance sheet over the next 2 to 3 years, we've suspended our share repurchase program and have announced that we plan to maintain our current dividend per share level, and we'll revisit our dividend policy once deleveraging is well underway. Overall, this combination is a game-changer in our ambition to become first choice for consumers and customers, and it's highly consistent with our goals and our focus on building extraordinary brands, delivering innovation and driving significant value to our shareholders.

Now there are obviously some tailwinds that are represented in the form of the $275 million of cash tax benefits, but also some headwinds, because we have a significant interest expense increase of around $250 million per annum because of the acquisition financing. There's additional D&A expense from the step-up due to the fair value remeasurement required by purchase accounting of around $70 million. And there's higher income taxes, because now we own the other 58% of MillerCoors, so we're paying additional taxes of around 200 -- or we will be paying additional taxes of around $200 million in 2017 versus what we did before."

We've got some work to do on the Above Premium segment, but we really like our portfolio there, with the largest craft brand in the country with Blue Moon, and Leinenkugel's is in the top 5 as well. We've made 4 acquisitions, which we're pleased about, and we've grown our flavored malt beverage share meaningfully over the last year or so. Our Premium Lights continued to perform well. Miller Lite's gained share of the Premium Light segment for the eighth consecutive quarter, Judy; and Coors Light gained share for the sixth consecutive quarter. We've reengaged the Economy drinker, and it's a high priority for us. We've recently announced our Economy strategy at the fall distributor meeting and that was well-received by our distribution network. Our Above Premium performance specifically was hindered by some of the performance on Blue Moon and Leinenkugel's, particularly seasonals and variety packs, and that's an industry-wide trend, and it's an issue we're addressing.

So the first one, bigger picture, something that every investor I talk to ask me is, ""What's the track record of Mark Hunter and Gavin Hattersley, and why are they the right people to execute here?"" And of course, I ask the question with great respect, right? But people look at Brit [ph] and Philippe having been at that for 20 years. So what we want to understand when we look at MillerCoors; Leo Kiely, a few years ago; Tom Long for 4 years; and now, Gavin. So if you can answer the question in terms of, what's your track record and why should investors be comfortable that this is the right management team to execute the significant plan? And the second question maybe is more for Mauricio, just basic in terms of numbers. I guess there's different ways to get -- to judge the guidance that you've given us today. One way I judge it is that I look at the cost savings that MillerCoors generated over the last 4 -- over last 5 years on average, right? About $120 million per annum, $88 million this year, you're running about $80 million this year, if I look at the $90 million this year for the third quarter. So you've done $120 million on average over the last 5 years. But then I look at the synergy number you are giving us today, $275 million divided by 3, that's $92 million. And then I take out from the balance, the Molson Coors savings ex MillerCoors, there's another $32 million of cost savings in MillerCoors. So synergies plus cost savings in MillerCoors, and I know that the lines get blurred, are about $124 million per annum over the next 3 years, which is what MillerCoors did over the last 5 years. So not so sure to be -- how to judge that number. Nice that you can sustain it. But if this is the significant transaction and there's this plethora of opportunities that we've talked about in terms of cost savings because now you own the full company, why would the cost savings, $124 million as per my math, total, would be pretty much similar to what you've been doing for the last 5 years. I guess if you can answer -- well, those are the 2 questions."

Clearly, to your first question, I'm not going to conduct a performance over our quarterly earnings call or get into detail as to why our board believe that I'm the right leader for this business and why I believe Gavin's the right leader for this business. I'll let our track record speak for ourselves. We're both seasoned professionals who've been in the beer industry for a long period of time, driven significant change across many businesses, integrated businesses like StarBev and driven this transaction at a rate, which on a valuation multiple, I think, is utterly compelling for our business. So I'll just leave it there. I'm not going to talk in any more detail beyond that. And let me just back up on the second question. I know you asked for Mauricio. But what we have endeavored to do here is get full transparency and ensure that we are not duplicating any of the cost savings in our business. And clearly, we've now set a target for the next 3 years. We'll update that on an annual basis. There was a lot of questions around the synergies number, and we have scaled that up and picked up the pace on the synergies number. And we've ensured that there's no duplication with the synergies on an ongoing underlying cost savings, and we'll continue to test ourselves as to whether that number can be further improved as we actually get into fully running the business. But we feel it's a number we can meet and will attempt to beat. It makes sense as we look at a business, which if you remember, has very, very little geographical overlap. You got to drive this by a number of restructuring initiatives, setting up things like shared services globally, and we'll get at that. And we'll update you if there's any new news on that number, but we feel it's the right number for our business at this point in time."

And I mean, again, I haven't given any guidance as to how portion the cost savings. One of the things I did indicated earlier this year was that we have now developed a small global growth group led by Kandy. That team will be looking for incremental opportunities to accelerate our top line performance. Clearly, some of those opportunities will require incremental investment in our business, but we'll look at those in the round as we aggregate our total sales and marketing spend across our business. So I'm more interested in the quality of our marketing. And I think there's plenty of examples, and there's one in the U.S. market at the moment where people or competitors have been spending very aggressively. And let's just say the incremental spend doesn't always buy you success. I'm really focus on the quality of our marketing and the discipline of our execution, and we'll continue to drive efficiencies across our marketing spend. And if there's a return, that makes sense for us, we'll put it through the PACC model and we will spend incrementally to generate additional returns. So we want to drive very hard on getting the top line moving, and that will be a focus for us over the course of the next 24 to 36 months. I'm not going to get any more specifics than that, Pablo."

I don't think it's true to say that craft is weak for everybody. That's a really generous statement. I think there's a number of craft companies that continue to show very strong growth, and we just acquired a number of them, which is a good thing for our business. I think what you are starting to see though in the marketplace is what I described as probably oversupply of flavors in SKUs or beer styles in SKUs. And both retailers and consumers are trying to make sense of the plethora of choice, and that's against the backdrop that craft has been good for the beer industry because it's driven conversations and interest in beer to probably an all-time high. But you get to the point where each SKU has to deliver on a velocity basis and has to actually demonstrate its value to both our customers and our consumers. And as Gavin mentioned earlier, things like seasonal packs, which have been a big driver of the craft industry, have really started to come under pressure because consumers are now, in essence, making up their own seasonal packs by the way that they actually show up the shelves. So I think what you're starting to see is from a retailer perspective, a push to really simplify the offering. And Walmart just did that recently as they reset all of their shelf sets. So the more progressive retailers are really trying to focus on those brands have got long-term distinct positionings and drive velocity per SKU. Also I think from a consumer perspective, because most of the craft growth has been driven on the back of heavily hopped IPAs, consumers are recognizing that those beers are great, but they're not beers that you can probably take with you through a long occasion, and we're actually starting to see some consumer step back into some of the American light brands. So I think it's just craft starting to kind of shake itself out with the brands that are well-positioned, clearly distinctive, and alongside that, the retailers really starting to simplify their offer. And that's in its infancy at the moment, but I think that's starting to have an impact in overall kind of craft velocity or craft trends. Gavin, I don't know whether you want to add anything to that and then pick up the STW, STRs question?"

Look, I mean, anything I'd add to that, which is pretty much what you said, right, I mean, there's tons of choice and there's not a lot of floorspace. And velocity of retail is important. And that's why our Building with Beer program, which we've launched, Mark, and talked quite a lot about has had such a positive impact with beer buyers at retail, not only on-premise, but also off-premise. As far as the STWs, STRs are concerned, Mark, I mean, fundamentally, there's just the difference in timing. If you remember, at the end of Q2, that dynamic was reversed, where domestic STWs were down and STRs were down less than that. On a year-to-date basis, those 2 numbers are much closer. And generally, we try and align those things much closer by the end of the year as we try and ship to consumption. So I wouldn't get too worked up on quarter-over-quarter because of timing of holidays, price increases and so on."

There are also other savings that are coming from looking at our supply chain network that are not included in the synergy piece of the optimization of the North America supply chain grid.

And alongside them, Coors Banquet is going from strength to strength. And we continue to drive the premiumization of our portfolio, and the craft acquisitions and Henry's are great examples. Don't forget the Redd's, which is now such a significant brand, didn't even exist just over 3 years ago. And my view is that we still have untapped opportunities in our import portfolio as well. So all of the component parts are there. A lot was down to how ruthless we want to be from an execution perspective. But Gavin and the leadership team have driven a significant change in the ambition, the energy and the focus in our U.S. business, and it's been great to see that happening.

In terms of production, we are relying either on our infrastructure like MillerCoors.

On behalf of Molson Coors Brewing Company, thank you for joining us today for our Third Quarter 2016 Follow-Up Earnings Conference Call. Our goal on this call is to address as many additional earnings-related questions as possible following our regular earnings conference call with Mark Hunter, Mauricio Restrepo and our business unit CEOs as earlier today. 
We will use a standard question-and-answer format, and we anticipate that the call will last less than an hour. 
Before we begin, I will paraphrase our safe harbor language. Some of our discussion today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from what we project today, so please refer to our most recent 10-K and 10-Q filings for a more complete description of factors that could affect these projections. We do not undertake to publicly update forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future results or otherwise. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. 
Regarding any non-U.S. GAAP measures that we may discuss during the call and from time-to-time by our executives in discussing our company's performance, please visit our website, www.molsoncoors.com, and click on the financial reporting tab at the Investor Relations page for a reconciliation of these measures with the nearest U.S. GAAP results. Also, unless otherwise indicated, all financial results we discuss are versus the comparable prior year period and in U.S. dollars. 
So let's get started with an introduction of the team with me on the call today. First of all, we have Mauricio Restrepo, CFO; Kevin Kim, Investor Relations Senior Manager; Alex Going [ph], Finance Forecasting Manager; Erik Mickelson, Technical Accounting Senior Manager; Brian Tabolt Controller; Mike Rumley, Treasurer; and Mark Saks, VP of Tax. 
Regarding quarterly results, as Mark Hunter mentioned on our regular earnings call this morning, in the third quarter, we continue to focus on First Choice ambition and on building a stronger, broader and more premium brand portfolio underpinned by incremental sales and marketing investments, as we have discussed all year. 
Business highlights for the quarter and year-to-date included increasing net sales revenue per hectoliter on a constant currency basis in all of our businesses for the quarter and for the year-to-date, increased investments in our brands globally. Coors Light and Miller Lite again gained share in the U.S. Premium Light segment, including the highest segment share gain in 3 years for Coors Light. 1.2% global volume growth for Coors Light year-to-date, with growth of more than 14% year-to-date outside of North America. Fast growth innovations in key markets, including Henry's Hard Sodas in U.S. and Mad Jack in Canada. And global growth year-to-date in Above Premium through, for example, Doom Bar and other Sharp's craft brands in the U.K., Creemore Springs and Belgian Moon in Canada and 4 newly acquired brewers in the U.S. And Above Premium also included strong growth by Staropramen across Europe outside of its home market, and cider volume increases with Rekorderlig in Europe and Strongbow in Canada. 
So we -- so kind of on an overall basis, we continued to strengthen our business through improvements to our sales execution and revenue management capabilities, increased efficiency of our operations and implementation of common global systems. 
This is a historic time for -- in the evolution of Molson Coors. 3 weeks ago, we completed our acquisition of the remaining 58% stake in the MillerCoors joint venture, along with Miller global brand portfolio. We emerged as the world’s third largest brewer, bringing together Molson Coors and MillerCoors into a bigger, better organization. As one company with an expanded portfolio of iconic brands, we intend to leverage our increased scale, resources and synergies as well as combined commercial experience to accelerate our First Choice agenda and deliver long-term shareholder value. 
On the earnings call earlier this morning, Mauricio also shared perspective regarding 3 new performance measures: transaction, adjusted EPS and all-in multi-year cost savings target and an early view of our combined company underlying free cash flow target for 2017. In addition to any earnings-related questions you may have, we would be happy to answer any questions you have regarding these new or updated performance metrics. 
And finally, for your reference, please note that we have posted full year 2015 and year-to-date 2016 pro forma financial statements on our website that give effect to the MillerCoors acquisition and the related financing, as if those were completed on January 1, 2015. 
So with that as an introduction, I'd like to turn it over -- or open it up for questions. Over to you, Laura."

So this is the long-anticipated follow-up call, where we get clarification on the free cash flow guidance. So I guess, what everyone is kind of trying to reconcile is you've got $6.11 of transaction-adjusted EPS in 2015. That translates to roughly $1.32 billion in terms of the implied cash flow number. And then, Mauricio, you were guiding to $1.1 billion. So it seems like there is a pretty big step-down even after adjusting for cash restructuring charge. So can you just help us sort of reconcile kind of how we go from 2015 to '17 in terms of free cash flow?"

I don't think I'll be able to reconcile it point-by-point, Judy. But what I would say, I guess, first of all, is we're really dealing with 2 different measures here in a sense that it's like accrual accounting versus cash accounting. Said more directly, the free cash flow guidance of $1.1 billion is truly a cash performance measure. The transaction-adjusted EPS number is not a cash performance measure. It actually starts with underlying book EPS and then makes 2 cash adjustments, 2 kinds of amortization or cash -- and cash tax benefits. So they're really, how do you say, not directly comparable. The types of differences that you'd see between those 2 numbers would be things like pension contributions, cash versus expense. So obviously, the pension cash would be directly reflected in the free cash flow number. But the pension expense number would be reflected in underlying EPS, which is the base for the transaction-adjusted EPS. Another example would be capital expenditures versus depreciation and amortization. Third example would be cash taxes versus booked taxes. And we've talked about the -- more than $275 million of cash tax benefits associated with the transaction, but we have not provided guidance on other cash taxes or on booked taxes. Now those are included in the pro formas, but we don't -- you don't have a specific view from a cash standpoint for the free cash flow.
And then finally, capital expenditures needed to capture synergies. As Mauricio mentioned on the earlier call, we do anticipate some incremental CapEx related to the -- to capturing synergies. And those will tend be loaded more toward the first 2 years of the 3-year time frame that we talked about as far as cost savings go and -- so that then we can capture the synergies, again as he mentioned, predominantly in years 2 and 3 for those. Although, I would hasten to mention that the other cost savings that we mentioned, non-synergies, in other words, actually are skewed more toward years 1 or 2 of the 3-year time period. Does that give you at least some headlines of why there might be some differences between those 2 numbers?"

Of course, going forward, the $275 million of cash tax benefit will be hitting your earnings.

However, compared to the Boston Conference pro forma number of, what was that? $572 million, yes, thanks, Brian, the -- as I think you mentioned, Judy, there is $0.39 change. And actually that was due to 3 main factors. One of them is the increase in the cash tax benefits that we're seeing, that's above $0.12. We're also seeing an adjustment to both amortization and depreciation. But as you know, we strip out booked amortization for transaction-adjusted EPS. However, depreciation, we do not strip out, and that actually was a $0.10 improvement via the purchase accounting work that the accounting team has been doing here. And then the rest of the difference is related to other purchase accounting adjustments, including valuation of assets and liabilities, things like pension and other property, plant and equipment, where they're going to continue to do their work, and you'll actually in all likelihood see additional adjustments, albeit they may be a bit smaller, but additional adjustments in future quarters until in fact the opening balance sheet is locked down 1 year from the close of the transaction."

So at this point, I think I would just leave it kind of where I talked about earlier.

And obviously, you guys are looking and saying, Jesus, but these guys are reporting the $1.1 billion. So what's happening there? So just back-of-the-envelope analysis, you take the $1.3 billion, $1.4 billion, okay? You add the $275 million of benefit that you're getting there, so you're getting around $1.6 billion, okay, of cash generation. But now we're paying $250 million per year more of interest, okay? So you have to deduct that from the $1.6 billion. You get to $1.35 billion, okay? And in addition, you're paying more taxes, because we own the other 58% of MillerCoors. So of your $1.35 billion, deduct another $200 million. That gives you about $1.15 billion. There you go. That's roughly, from a cash flow perspective, how I would look at, okay, how does the $1.1 billion compare to what should be the norm sort of the ""normalized cash flow generation potential"" of the 2 separate business if you just added the 2 together."

Actually, I'm glad you asked that, because it may not be obvious to a lot of folks. When we bought the other 58% of MillerCoors, that increases significantly our exposure to -- in profits and cash flow, although we're really talking about profits here, because it's the booked tax rate that we're talking about, increases our exposure to the U.S. business and call it industry and corporate income tax rate, which is among the highest in the world. And so because of the -- I guess, simple migration of pretax income in the direction of U.S. exposure, that results in a higher average blended tax rate. Now to start with though on the 58% of the MillerCoors business that we're buying, we did not pay corporate income taxes on that portion. SABMiller out of London paid whatever taxes were due on that via their situation. We paid taxes on the 42% of the MillerCoors portion that we owned. Now we're -- now our income tax rate on average, we expect to be somewhat higher. In fact, the guidance has changed from 18% to 22% for 2016 without the transaction to 25% to 28% in future years, all else being equal, no changes in tax rate and those types of things. So you can -- 25% to 28% on a longer-term basis, including the other 58% of MillerCoors. So you can tell that's several percentage points higher than what we have with the preexisting shape of the business. And if you look -- Kevin reminded me, if you look at the pro forma tables on the website, you can see a pro forma tax rate of around 25% for the 2015 full year pro forma number. So there you go. I mean, the tax -- the effective tax rate in the pro forma is in that 25% to 28% range that we've been talking about."

On the -- so Miller International volume, we said as part of the transaction communication that we -- that was about 3.2 million hectoliters per year. And we have not changed that point of view. From a revenue standpoint, we've never provided guidance, because actually that would determine -- or would be determined by the route to market of the brands in a dozens of markets around the world. For example, in a license market you have different revenue from a royalty revenue versus a wholly-owned market the amount of revenue. So we have not provided a number on that one. I would put that in the bucket of to-be-determined, similar to some of the comments that Mark made earlier on the call today. 
From a Canada standpoint, that is an interesting one. When the brands were bought -- the rights of the brands of Canada bought from us about 1.5 years ago or so, they always said about the size of the Miller brands in Canada was mid-single-digit percent of our Canada volume. We have not updated that, and that would be subject to the performance of those brands over the last 1.5 years under SABMiller. And so we'll see what that looks like from a volume standpoint. And would that provide additional leverage, specific to your question? We'll see. We'll see which brands will be produced locally versus imported or what. In other words, that will be one of the details that we'll sort out with you over time. 
And one thing -- we're not talking about profit, but Bryan made a good point that we do have a purchase price protection on the purchase of the Miller International brands as they existed in SAB system. If the profit, trailing 12 months' EBITDA is less than $70 million for that 12-month time period, then there will be a purchase price adjustment that we would negotiate with ABI, and it's at a ratio of roughly 11.3x."

Just as a final comment then, I think just going back to Vivian's question in terms of whether we had pro forma 2015 cash flows. I mean, in the pro formas that you will find on the website, there is a lot of detail quarter-by-quarter since 2015 and 2016. However, there is no pro forma 2015 cash flow that will tie to your $1.1 billion. Nevertheless, because the information is there, I just want to -- just to make your life easier, you guys, I mean, it's an exercise that you can try to do yourself in the sense that you know what the underlying free cash flow was for both businesses. So the same exercise that I did for 2017, you yourselves can do for 2015. So you just add the underlying free cash flows of both businesses and with MillerCoors at 100% as well. To that, you add the $275 million of annual tax benefits. From that, you deduct the $200 million of additional tax and the $250 million of additional interest. The only little piece that you wouldn't have is the CapEx that will be spent in 2017 to obtain the synergies. But other than that, the calculation is exactly the same. So that's all I want to say. Dave?"
