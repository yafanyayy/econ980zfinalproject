Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Fiscal 2016 is off to a great start with record EPS of $1.15, up 49% over Q1 of '15's adjusted results. All of our segments performed very well, with Prepared Foods and Chicken producing reco",1370,"Thanks, Jon. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Fiscal 2016 is off to a great start with record EPS of $1.15, up 49% over Q1 of '15's adjusted results. All of our segments performed very well, with Prepared Foods and Chicken producing record operating income for the quarter, Pork had its second best quarter ever, while Beef showed significant improvement over Q4 and Q1 of '15. In total, we produced record operating income of $776 million at 38% over Q1 of last year. We had a record operating margin of 8.5% and record operating cash flows of $1.1 billion. 
Revenues were down due to the deflationary environment of raw materials and the divestiture of a few noncore businesses. Excluding the divestitures, sales volume was down just over 1% in Q1 as we sell more higher-margin value-added product, upgraded our mix to more profitable sales and processed fewer cattle. We're very pleased with the total synergies capturing $121 million in Q1. $61 million was incremental to Q1 last year, and we're on track to achieve more than $500 million this fiscal year. These synergies are a major source of funds for Prepared Foods growth. 
In the Prepared Foods segment, operating income was $207 million with a 10.9% return on sales, which was a record. Returns benefited primarily from declining raw materials and synergy capture. Volume for the quarter was down 7.7%, with pricing lower by 3.6%. The lower volume was the result of optimizing the sales mix by reducing product label products at retail and, to a lesser extent, the impact of avian influenza on our Turkey lunchmeat business and a slower-than-planned price reduction reflected on net retail shelves. 
For the balance of fiscal 2016, we anticipate continued savings on raw materials as well as synergy capture, and we'll invest a good portion of these savings into pricing, innovation and brand building. Our market outlook for Prepared Foods is near the low end of the 10% to 12% range. 
The Chicken segment produced record operating income of $358 million, with a record 13.6% return on sales. Volume for the quarter was down 0.5%, with 4.7% lower pricing. The slight sales volume decline in chicken again is a reflection of upgrading our mix. Results in the Chicken segment can be chopped up to solid execution. We're outperforming the industry and widened the GAAP. I believe we've demonstrated separation from the commodity players in large part due to the disproportionately high mix of value-added products in our portfolio as well as the production flexibly created with our buy-versus-grow strategy, which also reduces commodity exposure. Remember, on the last call, I broke out the categories how we sell chicken, and only 15% is pure commodity. 
As we continue to grow our value-added sales, produce less than we sell, execute extremely well and gain some benefit from lower grain cost, we now expect the Chicken segment margin to improve more than 11% for the year, up from our previous estimate of more than 10%. 
In the Beef segment, operating income was $71 million, with a 2% return on sales. Volume for the quarter was down 3.8%, while price was down 14.4%. Volume was down due to the Denison plant closure. Retail pricing has declined significantly, but beef is still expensive for consumers, with the beef-to-pork and the beef-to-chicken ratios at record levels. I'm pleased with a turnaround from the losses we sustained in Q4. Some of the improvement can be attributed to the mark-to-market and LCM from Q4. We got about half of it back in Q1, and the remainder will come over the next year or so. Better calcify in Q1, coupled with the realignment of our Denison and Dakota City plants, moderately improved our capacity utilization. 
We feel good about our Beef business, and the team is executing very well. Cattle supplies appear to be growing, and the recent semiannual Cattle on Feed report indicated the total inventory is up 3.2% over the previous year. However, there is still regional disparity in the location of the cattle. Q2 can be a little uneven due to the weather and consumption around [indiscernible]. We're going to remain conservative with our guidance of an operating margin at or above the low end of 1.5% to 3% normalized range. 
I'll add that I'm pleased about [indiscernible]. Our contingent was that it added incremental costs but no real consumer benefit. And now that it's been repealed, we're able to reduce the complexity our business when eliminating ground 800 SKUs. 
In the Pork segment, operating income was $158 million, with a 13% return on sales. Volume was down 2.2%, with pricing down 19.5%. Volume was down due to the divestiture of our Heinold Hog Markets business in Q1 of last year. Excluding this, Pork volume was up 5.5%. 
There were plenty of hogs on the market in Q1, Which lowered our call costs as well as our average selling price. With more hogs, we improved capacity utilization, which helped widen the margin spread. Our Prepared Foods segment benefits from lower pork material prices as well. 
We expect hog industry supply to be around 2% to 3% for the fiscal year, so we should be able to continue with the capacity utilization. We haven't seen any significant improvement in export markets. However, domestic pork demand is good. With near-record results in Q1, we are increasing our Pork segment outlook for the fiscal year, which should produce returns above 8%. 
Now let's move from the segments to our view of consumer demand. Lower gas prices and unemployment at the lowest levels since 2008 are translating into some growth into the perimeter of the grocery store number and more consumer spending on eating away from home. With the diversity of our portfolio, we're prepared to respond to these shifts in consumer behaviors. In the last 3 months, Foodservice traffic was up 1%, while checks-out was up 2%. While we play across all areas of foodservice, we're especially well-aligned with the categories in the national foodservice chains that are showing the most growth. 
On the retail side, overall grocery trips are down, but shoppers are spending more on our Core 9 product lines compared to total food and beverage and overall packaged meats. This is important because our Core 9 product lines are the primary drivers of sales and profitability within our packaged retail offering and includes brands like Jimmy Dean, Tyson, Hillshire Farms, Ball Park and Aidells. 
I'd like to the talk a little bit more about volumes, specifically at retail, and what you might be seeing reported by Nielsen and our IRI. Although to the top 10-branded food companies, including us, lost volume in calendar year 2015, our Core 9 product lines grew 1.2%. We are now seeing the price investments we've made begin to take hold, as sales volume was up 2% in the latest 12-week period but accelerated to a 4% increase in the latest 4-week comparison. 
I also want to point out that the Core 9 product lines, in aggregate, grew in Q1 ahead of the categories. In total, our share of these categories was up, and where our leading brands grew the most, the categories performed the best. Additionally, our volume growth improved through the quarter and on into January. I feel really good about our retail brands and expect to see the recent trends continue for the remainder of the year, as we see the full impact of pricing, recovery from AI and strong brand support. 
So all that's to say, a volume decline at a total Tyson level is an indicative of the health of our business, and I think the overall return we delivered in this quarter and the optimism around our outlook give us confidence for another record setting year, which is why we're raising our fiscal 2016 EPS guidance by 35% -- $0.35 on the low end to $3.85 to $3.95. 
We have a consumer-relevant portfolio packed with advantaged brands and advanced categories. We have superior supply chain. We have a high-performing team focused on execution. I like the position Tyson Foods is in. I like where we're headed, and I like the momentum that's building towards fiscal '17. Dennis?"

With our first quarter results",829,"Thanks, Donnie, and good morning, everyone. Fiscal 2016 is off to a phenomenal start. We've been repeating over the past several years the value of our diversified portfolio, which has been evident in strong, steady returns. With our first quarter results, you can see our earnings potential when all segments performed well and finished within or above their normalized range us. With record EPS, record operating income and record operating cash flows, we were able to repurchase 6.4 million shares for $300 million in Q1. 
So far through the second quarter of this year, we've repurchased 3.9 million shares for $200 million. In total, over the past 7 months, we have now repurchased 16.2 million shares for $750 million. 
I'm also pleased to announce that yesterday, our Board of Directors increased the shares authorized for repurchase under this program by 50 million shares, underscoring our commitment to continue returning cash to shareholders. 
First quarter revenues were $9.2 billion, which is a decrease of 15% from Q1 a year ago, due to significant declines in beef, pork and beef prices. So smallest decline 7% as reported. However, when excluding the divestitures of the Brazil and Mexico chicken operations and the Heinold Hog Market business, our total company sales volume decreased 1%. Despite this small decline in volume, we are continuing to execute our strategy of growing in value-added categories, which is evident in our first quarter results. 
Total company return on sales was a record 8.5%. Operating income was a record $776 million, representing a 38% increase over adjusted operating income from Q1 a year ago. 
Our record earnings of $1.15 per share represents a 49% increase over $0.77 adjusted earnings per share in Q1 last year. 
I would also like to note that on an adjusted basis, our last 12 months EPS is $3.53. 
Our operating cash flow for the first quarter was a record $1.1 billion, and we spent $188 million on capital expenditures. This outpaced our depreciation by $37 million, as we continued to invest in projects with a focus on delivering high ROIC. 
Our effective tax rate in the first quarter was 35.2%. Net debt-to-EBITDA for the past 12 months was 1.7x, and on a gross debt-to-EBITDA basis, this measure was 2.1x. 
Including cash of $1.2 billion, net debt was $5.5 billion. Total liquidity was over $2.4 billion, significantly above our goal of $1.2 billion. Total liquidity at the end of the first quarter was enhanced by cash held for payments to livestock producers deferred to calendar 2016 as well as cash held for the retirement of $638 million in notes coming due in the second quarter. 
When these notes are retired, we will have paid down $2.4 billion of gross debt since the acquisition of Hillshire in August 2014. 
Our rapid leverage reduction in only 19 months reflects our commitment to maintaining investment-grade credit metrics. 
Net interest expense was $65 million during Q1. For the quarter, our diluted shares outstanding were $400 million. 
Now here are some additional thoughts on fiscal 2016. We now expect revenues of approximately $37 billion, which includes the impact of fiscal 2015 divestitures and expected declines in beef, pork and feed prices. We expect to capture more than $500 million of synergies in fiscal '16, which includes more than $200 million of incremental synergies over fiscal '15 from our Prepared Foods profit improvement initiatives and Hillshire brand synergies. 
Net interest expense should approximate $245 million. 
We currently estimate our effective tax rate to be around 35%. CapEx is expected to be $900 million, as we continue to focus on projects that will create long-term shareholder value. 
Prior to adjusting for any additional share repurchases subsequent to this call, and based on our average share price in Q1, we expect our diluted shares to be around 394 million. 
As we have demonstrated, our capital allocation priorities are governed by our disciplined focus on driving long-term shareholder value. Our priorities for deploying these significant cash flows that our operations generate are for growing our businesses organically through operational efficiency and capital expansion projects, along with investing in innovation and brand building; acquiring businesses that support our strategic objectives and returning to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, all while maintaining plenty of liquidity, investment-grade credit ratings and continuing to expand our debt capacity. 
In closing, our Q2 should beat last year but will be less than Q1 due to our typical seasonality. And the third and fourth quarters are expected to be strong. As mentioned in this morning's release, we are raising our EPS guidance range to $3.85 to $3.95 for fiscal 2016, up from $3.50 to $3.65. This represents a 4-year EPS compounded annual growth rate of more than 18% annually. With each of our segments demonstrating tremendous overall performance, we view Q1 not as an exception but as a new foundation, which provides momentum for our continued growth. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we're ready to begin the Q&A."

A number of packaged food companies, both large and small, we've seen, have talked this earnings season about the macro becoming more challenging. Snacking has been one area highlighted in particular. And then conversely, it looks like U.S. frozen categories seem to be improving some. Companies are also talking about the need to up brand support spend in an effort to contain volume deterioration. Your Prepared Foods volumes were down in the quarter, but you talked to the reasons behind that. Your profitability was solid. Can you give us your view of the Packaged Foods macro? You touched on it in your prepared remarks, but can you give us your view of the Prepared Packaged Foods macro from your vantage point? And within this question, can you specifically address this Core 9 effort that you're talking about this morning and how Core 9 insulates you not only within the broader macro, but also within packaged meat specifically?"

I'm going to try to take that like from snacking through frozen into the Core 9 to kind of give you the full feel. So not all snacking's created equal, right? What continues to grow in the snacking category is protein snacking. If I've got my numbers right, total snacking's probably growing at around 6-or-so percent year-over-year. And as you know, that's a major focus for us in our innovation this year. Looking on into the frozen categories, breakfast and value-added poultry are 2 categories that are growing faster than total frozen and total food and beverage, and that's our key focus. But also look -- if you look at 84% of the refrigerated categories in which we compete are growing, and then 87% of the fresh categories in which we compete are growing, and it really reinforces our statement around having advantaged brands in advantaged categories. So now let me loop over into the Core 9. So if you look at the Core 9 brands or product lines really, those are so important because that's where we have the greatest value potential over the long term. Within the Core, we have the highest growth potential. We've probably got the strongest position with both consumers and customers and great margins. So that's why we focus, on what we call, the Core 9, and we spelled of those out in the last call because they are categories in which are growing faster than other refrigerated meats and faster than total food and beverage over the long term. And then we have advantaged positions within those categories."

So if you go back as far as Q3 when the feedlot started, extending the turns, if you will, and keeping cattle in the feedlot longer, coupled with the heifer retention and the reduction in cow slaughter that we saw as the beginning part of the supply chain, the cattle operator began to effort to expand the hard, cattle supply dried up and strained margins. So as we moved out of Q4 into Q1 in -- there were some regional disparity, but overall, the feedlots began to market both cattle and become more current, if you will, with the inventory the have in the feedlot. That provided us the supply we needed to be able to improve our margins. Plus, if you remember back at the end of Q4, right in the last couple of weeks or so in the quarter, we had a lower cost of market adjustment and a mark-to-market adjustment that we made. And so we got about half of that back in Q1. Now the rest of that will keep coming back to us as we progress on through the year because you had beef sold out front, and then you bought live cattle feed against the hedges. So put all that together, we're kind of in the, well, 2% sort of towards the low end or getting towards the middle of that range. As we look forward, Q2 is always a tough quarter for us. You got a lot of weather issues around, as we're seeing this week, up in the Midwest. [indiscernible] is just kind of a low demand for beef, particularly. We want to get through that. Feels like after Easter, should see cattle supply improving in the back half also to improve. I think, longer term, our beef margins should stay within that 1.5% to 3% range. We feel good about that."

So those are what we call the Core 9, where we have a disproportionate ability to grow faster than the categories, and they're very meaningful categories. So if I look at -- and what we've really been focused on is the recent trends in our volume versus the category volume. We were -- I think I mentioned in my comments. I think I said that we were able bit slow in seeing the price declines reflected at retail. And now through the last 4 weeks or so, we've pretty much seen the pricing get reflected on the retail shelf, and volume is responding. If I looked at, say, Smoked Sausage, in the last 4 weeks, our volume growth is up 4% versus -- that's the last 4 weeks versus 2% for the 52-week and 2% for the 12. And last week, it was up double digits, like 10% or so. If I look at Jimmy Dean Breakfast Sausage, for example, we're up 2% in the latest 52, but 11% in the latest 4-week comparison. And that's what we've been looking for to see momentum in volume as we see the price reflected on the shelves. So we feel really good about the core of our business. Also let me -- one on hotdogs real quick. We did see a little bit of impact, I think, from our HRT announcement in hotdogs. But we are seeing a response there.

Can you talk about the sustainability of the margins on those 2 sort of subcategories? Like a lot of people think your tray pack business is not as -- it can't maintain these margins at these levels if supply increases, right? So if you look at 3 segments for the chicken market, it seems to me that whatever supply increase has been coming into the market, it's been on the big bird side. So what happens if and when the retail tray packs supply, industry-wise, increase it? What does that do to your margin structure?

So the 1 and 3-pound rolls of ground beef. That, which is a huge portion, by the way, of the volume decline or use proportion of the volume decline, that meat's going fresh. And frankly, for us, if the consumer would rather have that breast meat in a fresh tray versus having it done and IQF back, we're going to go where the consumer is because, frankly, if margines is up a little bit, same thing on the ground beef. If they'd rather have it, that volume not in the EPC but in a non-UPC tray, we're going to do that. So first of all, we're that in my. A better question, the big revenue issue overall for the company really comes in 3 places. Beef and pork commodity prices are down a lot. And then the other thing is the divestitures of the Mexican business, the Brazilian business and our hind hold hog markets business. So that is the overwhelming majority of the revenue decline quarter-over-quarter and is driven primarily by beef prices and, by the way, will be for the year.

And we we will continue to do that all year because we've got a great opportunity for us."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Fiscal 2016 is off to a great start with record EPS of $1.15, up 49% over Q1 of '15's adjusted results. All of our segments performed very well, with Prepared Foods and Chicken producing reco",1376,"Thanks, Jon. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Fiscal 2016 is off to a great start with record EPS of $1.15, up 49% over Q1 of '15's adjusted results. All of our segments performed very well, with Prepared Foods and Chicken producing record operating income for the quarter, Pork had its second best quarter ever, while Beef showed significant improvement over Q4 and Q1 of '15. In total, we produced record operating income of $776 million at 38% over Q1 of last year. We had a record operating margin of 8.5% and record operating cash flows of $1.1 billion. 
Revenues were down due to the deflationary environment of raw materials and the divestiture of a few noncore businesses. Excluding the divestitures, sales volume was down just over 1% in Q1 as we sell more higher-margin value-added products, upgraded our mix to more profitable sales and processed fewer cattle. We're very pleased with the total synergies capturing $121 million in Q1, $61 million was incremental to Q1 last year, and we're on track to achieve more than $500 million this fiscal year. These synergies are a major source of funds for Prepared Foods growth. 
In the Prepared Foods segment, operating income was $207 million with a 10.9% return on sales, which was a record. Returns benefited primarily from declining raw materials and synergy capture. Volume for the quarter was down 7.7%, with pricing lower by 3.6%. The lower volume was the result of optimizing the sales mix by reducing product -- label products at retail and, to a lesser extent, the impact of avian influenza on our turkey lunchmeat business and a slower-than-planned price reduction reflected on the retail shelves. 
For the balance of fiscal 2016, we anticipate continued savings on raw materials, as well as synergy capture, and we'll invest a good portion of these savings into pricing, innovation and brand building. Our margin outlook for Prepared Foods is near the low end of the 10% to 12% range. 
The Chicken segment produced record operating income of $358 million, with a record 13.6% return on sales. Volume for the quarter was down 0.5%, with 4.7% lower pricing. The slight sales volume decline in chicken again is a reflection of upgrading our mix. Results in the Chicken segment can be chopped up to solid execution. We're outperforming the industry and widened the gap. I believe we've demonstrated separation from the commodity players in large part due to the disproportionately high mix of value-added products in our portfolio, as well as the production flexibility created with our buy versus-grow strategy, which also reduces commodity exposure. Remember on the last call, I broke out the categories how we sell chicken, and only 15% is pure commodity. 
As we continue to grow our value-added sales, produce less than we sell, execute extremely well and gain some benefit from lower grain cost, we now expect the Chicken segment margin to improve to more than 11% for the year, up from our previous estimate of more than 10%. 
In the Beef segment, operating income was $71 million, with a 2% return on sales. Volume for the quarter was down 3.8%, while price was down 14.4%. Volume was down due to the Denison plant closure. Retail pricing has declined significantly, but beef is still expensive for consumers, with the beef-to-pork and the beef-to-chicken price ratios at record levels. I'm pleased with a turnaround from the losses we sustained in Q4. Some of the improvement can be attributed to the mark-to-market and LCM from Q4. We got about half of it back in Q1, and the remainder will come over the next year or so. Better cattle supplies in Q1, coupled with the realignment of our Denison and Dakota City plants, moderately improved our capacity utilization. 
We feel good about our Beef business and the team is executing very well. Cattle supplies appear to be growing, and the recent semiannual Cattle on Feed report indicated the total inventory is up 3.2% over the previous year; however, there is still regional disparity in the location of the cattle. Q2 can be a little uneven due to the weather and consumption around Lent. We're going to remain conservative with our guidance of an operating margin at or above the low end of 1.5% to 3% normalized range. 
I'll add that I'm pleased about repeal of [indiscernible]. Our contention was that it added incremental costs with no real consumer benefit. And now that it's been repealed, we're able to reduce the complexity of our business by eliminating ground 800 SKUs. 
In the Pork segment, operating income was $158 million, with a 13% return on sales. Volume was down 2.2%, with pricing down 19.5%. Volume was down due to the divestiture of our Heinold Hog Markets business in Q1 of last year. Excluding this, Pork volume was up 5.5%. 
There were plenty of hogs on the market in Q1, Which lowered our hog costs, as well as our average selling price. With more hogs, we improved capacity utilization, which helped widen the margin spread. Our Prepared Foods segment benefits from lower pork raw material prices as well. 
We expect hog industry supply to be up around 2% to 3% for the fiscal year, so we should be able to continue with good capacity utilization. We haven't seen any significant improvement in export markets; however, domestic pork demand is good. With near-record results in Q1, we are increasing our Pork segment outlook for the fiscal year, which should produce returns above 8%. 
Now, let's move from the segments to our view of consumer demand. Lower gas prices and unemployment at the lowest levels since 2008 are translating into some growth into the perimeter of the grocery store and more consumer spending on eating away from home. With the diversity of our portfolio, we're prepared to respond to this shift in consumer behaviors. In the last 3 months, foodservice traffic was up 1%, while check size was up 2%. While we play across all areas of foodservice, we're especially well-aligned with the categories in the national foodservice chains that are showing the most growth. 
On the retail side. Overall grocery trips are down, but shoppers are spending more on our Core 9 product lines compared to total food and beverage and overall packaged meats. This is important because our Core 9 product lines are the primary drivers of sales and profitability within our packaged retail offering and includes brands like Jimmy Dean, Tyson, Hillshire Farm, Ball Park and Aidells. 
I'd like to talk a little more about volumes, specifically at retail, and what you might be seeing reported by Nielsen and IRI. Although the top 10-branded food companies, including us, lost volume in calendar year 2015, our Core 9 product lines grew 1.2%. We are now seeing the price investments we've made begin to take hold, as sales volume was up 2% in the latest 12-week period, but accelerated to a 4% increase in the latest 4-week comparison. 
I also want to point out that the Core 9 product lines, in aggregate, grew in Q1 ahead of the categories. In total, our share of these categories was up, and where our leading brands grew the most, the categories performed the best. Additionally, our volume growth improved through the quarter and on into January. I feel really good about our retail brands and expect to see the recent trends continue for the remainder of the year, as we see the full impact from pricing, recovery from AI and strong brand support. 
So all that's to say, a volume decline at the total Tyson level is an indicative of the health of our business, and, I think, the overall return we delivered this quarter and the optimism around our outlook give us confidence for another record setting year, which is why we're raising our fiscal 2016 EPS guidance by 35% -- $0.35 on the low end to $3.85 to $3.95. 
We have a consumer-relevant portfolio packed with advantaged brands in advantaged categories. We have a superior supply chain. We have a high-performing team focused on execution. I like the position Tyson Foods is in, I like where we're headed and I like the momentum that's building towards fiscal '17. Dennis?"

We've been repeating over the past several years the value in our diversified portfolio, which has been evident in strong, steady returns. With our first quarter results, you can see our earnings potential when all segments performed well and finished within or above their normalized ranges. With record EPS, record operating income and record operating cash flows, we were able to repurchase 6.4 million shares for $300 million in Q1. 
So far through the second quarter of this year, we've repurchased 3.9 million shares for $200 million. In total, over the past 7 months, we have now repurchased 16.2 million shares for $750 million. 
I'm also pleased to announce that yesterday, our Board of Directors increased the shares authorized for repurchase under this program by 50 million shares, underscoring our commitment to continue returning cash to shareholders. 
First quarter revenues were $9.2 billion, which is a decrease of 15% from Q1 a year ago, due to significant declines in beef, pork and feed prices. Sales volumes declined 7% as reported. However, when excluding the divestitures of the Brazil and Mexico chicken operations and the Heinold Hog Market business, our total company sales volume decreased 1%. Despite this small decline in volume, we are continuing to execute our strategy of growing in value-added categories, which is evident in our first quarter results. 
Total company return on sales was a record 8.5%. Operating income was a record $776 million, representing a 38% increase over adjusted operating income from Q1 a year ago. 
Our record earnings of $1.15 per share represents a 49% increase over $0.77 adjusted earnings per share in Q1 last year. 
I would also like to note that on an adjusted basis, our last 12 months EPS is $3.53. 
Our operating cash flow for the first quarter was a record $1.1 billion, and we spent $188 million on capital expenditures. This outpaced our depreciation by $37 million, as we continued to invest in projects with a focus on delivering high ROIC. 
Our effective tax rate in the first quarter was 35.2%. Net debt-to-EBITDA for the past 12 months was 1.7x, and on a gross debt-to-EBITDA basis, this measure was 2.1x. 
Including cash of $1.2 billion, net debt was $5.5 billion. Total liquidity was over $2.4 billion, significantly above our goal of $1.2 billion. Total liquidity at the end of the first quarter was enhanced by cash held for payments to livestock producers deferred to calendar 2016, as well as cash held for the retirement of $638 million in notes coming due in the second quarter. 
When these notes are retired, we will have paid down $2.4 billion of gross debt since the acquisition of Hillshire in August 2014. 
Our rapid leverage reduction in only 19 months reflects our commitment to maintaining investment-grade credit metrics. 
Net interest expense was $65 million during Q1. For the quarter, our diluted shares outstanding were $400 million. 
Now here are some additional thoughts on fiscal 2016. We now expect revenues of approximately $37 billion, which includes the impact of fiscal 2015 divestitures and expected declines in beef, pork and feed prices. We expect to capture more than $500 million of synergies in fiscal '16, which includes more than $200 million of incremental synergies over fiscal '15 from our Prepared Foods profit improvement initiatives and Hillshire brand synergies. 
Net interest expense should approximate $245 million. 
We currently estimate our effective tax rate to be around 35%. CapEx is expected to be $900 million, as we continue to focus on projects that will create long-term shareholder value. 
Prior to adjusting for any additional share repurchases subsequent to this call, and based on our average share price in Q1, we expect our diluted shares to be around 394 million. 
As we have demonstrated, our capital allocation priorities are governed by our disciplined focus on driving long-term shareholder value. Our priorities for deploying these significant cash flows that our operations generate are for growing our businesses organically through operational efficiency and capital expansion projects, along with investing in innovation and brand building; acquiring businesses that support our strategic objectives and returning cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, all while maintaining plenty of liquidity, investment-grade ratings and continuing to expand our debt capacity. 
In closing, our Q2 should beat last year, but will be less than Q1 due to our typical seasonality. And the third and fourth quarters are expected to be strong. As mentioned in this morning's release, we are raising our EPS guidance range to $3.85 to $3.95 for fiscal 2016, up from $3.50 to $3.65. This represents a 4-year EPS compounded annual growth rate of more than 18% annually. With each of our segments demonstrating tremendous overall performance, we view Q1 not as an exception, but as a new foundation, which provides momentum for our continued growth.

I'm -- I got to take that like from snacking through frozen into the Core 9 to kind of give you the full feel. So not all snacking's created equal, right? What continues to grow in the snacking category is protein snacking. If I've got my numbers right, total snacking's probably growing at around 6-or-so percent year-over-year. And, as you know, that's a major focus for us in our innovation this year. Looking on into the frozen categories, breakfast and value-added poultry are 2 categories that are growing faster than total frozen and total food and beverage, and that's our key focus. But also look -- if you look at 84% of the refrigerated categories, in which we compete, are growing, and then 87% of the fresh categories, in which we compete, are growing, and it really reinforces our statement around having advantaged brands in advantaged categories. So now let me loop over into the Core 9. So if you look at the Core 9 brands or product lines really, those are so important because that's where we have the greatest value potential over the long term. Within the core, we have the highest growth potential. We've probably got the strongest position with both consumers and customers and great margins. So that's why we focus on, what we call, the Core 9 and we spelled those out in the last call, because they are categories in which are growing faster than other refrigerated meats and faster than total food and beverage over the long term. And then, we have advantaged positions within those categories."

So if you go back as far as Q3 when the feedlot started, extending the turns, if you will, and keeping cattle in the feedlot longer, coupled with the heifer retention and the reduction in cow slaughter that we saw as the beginning parts of the supply chain, and the calf crop operator began to -- the effort to expand the herd, cattle supply dried up and strained margins. So as we moved out of Q4 into Q1 in -- there were some regional disparity, but overall, the feedlots began to market those cattle and become more current, if you will, with the inventory they have in the feedlot. That provided us the supply we needed to be able to improve our margins. Plus, if you remember back at the end of Q4, right in the last couple of weeks or so in the quarter, we had a lower cost of market adjustment and a mark-to-market adjustment that we made. And so we got about half of that back in Q1. Now the rest of that will keep coming back to us as we progress on through the year, because you had beef sold out front, and then you bought live cattle feed against the hedges. So put all that together, we're kind of in the, well, 2% sort of towards the low end or getting towards the middle of that range. As we look forward, Q2 is always a tough quarter for us. You got a lot of weather issues around, as we're seeing this week, up in the Midwest. Lent is kind of a low demand period for beef, particularly, so want to see us get through that. But then, it feels like that after Easter, should see cattle supply improving in the back half also to improve. I think, longer term, our beef margins should stay within that 1.5% to 3% range. We feel good about that."

So those are what we call the Core 9, where we have the disproportionate ability to grow faster than the categories, and they're very meaningful categories. So if I look at -- and what we've really been focused on is the recent trends in our volume versus the category volume. We were -- I think I mentioned in my comments. I think I said this that we were a little bit slow in seeing the price declines reflected at retail. And now through the last 4 weeks or so, we've pretty much seen the pricing get reflected on the retail shelf, and volume is responding. If I looked at, say, Smoked Sausage, in the last 4 weeks, our volume growth is up 4% versus -- that's the last 4 weeks versus 2% for the 52-week and 2% for the 12. And last week, it was up double digits, like 10% or so. If I look at Jimmy Dean Breakfast Sausage, for example, we're up 2% in the latest 52, but 11% in the latest 4-week comparison. And that's what we've been looking for to see momentum in volume as we see the price reflected on the shelf. So we feel really good about the core of our business. Also let me -- one on hotdogs real quick. We did see a little bit of impact, I think, from the IARC announcement in hotdogs. But we are seeing a response there. We feel great about the brand support for the summer grilling season and we're really, really anticipating a very, very strong grilling season this year, so feel great about that. Hope that helps."

So when you combine strength of our value-added portfolio, the strength of our brands, both at fresh and frozen, when you look at the diversity of the portfolio between small bird and value-added and fresh, and then you combine that with this great marketing and innovation engine that we've got, it really does help stabilize the earnings of our Chicken business over time. It's not the same Chicken business that it was few years ago."

As a matter of fact, we're increasing our investment in innovation to be able to drive long-term growth in these brands. And the early week -- during November and December, frankly, we didn't get the price realization on the shelf that we needed to drive volume. During the month of January, the pricing gaps were reflected on the shelf, and we saw the volume response that we were looking for. So I feel great about our growth going forward for the year. We have advantaged brands in advantaged categories, and we fully intend to take advantage of that because that's what the consumer wants us to do. So -- and you're right, we will be lapping the AI problems. We've got to get some points of distribution back, but we're -- we've got a great sales team, working on that. We continue to improve the mix. One of the volume issues in Q1 was that we didn't repeat some private label volume. And frankly, it's like, I don't know, spiral-sliced hams and private label bacon.

Obviously, you outperformed what the commodity markets did in our estimates by about 1,000 basis points. So I think what I'm seeing is, and just help me if I'm wrong here or if I'm reading it incorrectly, but relative to the market, your portfolio is more stable higher-margin products, and that's starting to play through on the revenue line. And clearly, this quarter, we saw that, right? And I think what we're seeing clearly is your big bird segment, if I may, where you're taking a lot of this cheap meat out of the big bird plants and adding value to it. That's been a great strategy. So my question really is more on the retail tray pack side of your business and potentially on the small bird side. Can you talk about the sustainability of the margins on those 2 sort of subcategories? Like a lot of people think your tray pack business is not as -- it can't maintain these margins at these levels if supply increases, right? So if you look at 3 segments for the Chicken market, it seems to me that whatever supply increase has been coming into the market, it's been on the big bird side. So what happens if and when the retail tray pack supply, industry-wise, increase it? What does that do to your margin structure? And then similarly, on the small bird, I mean, I know it's not happening right now, right? We know that there's no new capacity coming in on those 2 segments. But just help me think through that for a second."

So first of all, as evidenced in South Georgia, we have the flexibility within our supply chain to move our mix to where the consumer's going. If you look at a macro view, although recent volumes because at fresh, for example, because you've got so much pork, price is way down and pork demand's up. But in general, remembering that chicken is twice the size of the category of both -- of beef or pork, chicken demand is really good, and it over indexes to the millennials as they enter the workplace and begin, in earnest, consuming foods. So we feel great about the macro trends and where they're leading us. We have the flexibility within our supply chain to move within small bird, fresh, whatever we might do. Certainly, it's not in our business model to oversupply big bird. We'd rather buy that meat and add value to it, as you've mentioned. I think about our business to remember is we got the #1 fresh branded retail. We've got great penetration across a broad segment of customers nationally. And we have phenomenal quality service and innovation. So I feel good that we will remain the leading fresh supplier as we move out front, whether it's a small bird into the retail deli or fast food cutup, or whether it's at retail, plus we've got a lot of innovation that we can continue to innovate in these fresh categories, and our customers rely on that. So I think that is a big portion of what stabilizes our fresh Chicken business, if you will, for the future."

So the 1 and 3-pound rolls of ground beef. That, which is a huge portion, by the way, of the volume decline or a huge proportion of the volume decline, that meat's going fresh. And frankly, for us, if the consumer would rather have that breast meat in a fresh tray versus having it in an IQF bag, we're going to go where the consumer is because, frankly, it margins us up a little bit, same thing on the ground beef. If they'd rather have it, that volume not in the UPC but in a non-UPC tray, we're going to do that. So first of all, bear that in mind. By then for your other question, the big revenue issue overall for the company really comes in 3 places. Beef and pork commodity prices are down a lot. And then the other thing is the divestitures of the Mexican business, the Brazilian business and our Heinold Hog Markets business. So that is the overwhelming majority of the revenue decline quarter-over-quarter and is driven primarily by beef prices and, by the way, will be for the year. So well, we would expect it to be for the year. Does that help?"

In total, we produced record operating income of $776 million at 38% over Q1 of last year. We had a record operating margin of 8.5% and record operating cash flows of $1.1 billion. 
Revenues were down due to the deflationary environment of raw materials and the divestiture of a few noncore businesses. Excluding the divestitures, sales volume was down just over 1% in Q1 as we sold more higher-margin value-added products, upgraded our mix to more profitable sales and processed fewer cattle. We're very pleased with the total synergies, capturing $121 million in Q1, $61 million was incremental to Q1 last year, and we're on track to achieve more than $500 million this fiscal year. These synergies are a major source of funds for Prepared Foods growth. 
In the Prepared Foods segment, operating income was $207 million with a 10.9% return on sales, which was a record. Returns benefited primarily from declining raw materials and synergy capture. Volume for the quarter was down 7.7%, with pricing lower by 3.6%. The lower volume was the result of optimizing the sales mix by reducing private label products at retail, and to a lesser extent, the impact of avian influenza on our turkey lunchmeat business and a slower-than-planned price reduction reflected on the retail shelves. 
For the balance of fiscal 2016, we anticipate continued savings on raw materials, as well as synergy capture, and we'll invest a good portion of these savings into pricing, innovation and brand building. Our margin outlook for Prepared Foods is near the low end of the 10% to 12% range. 
The Chicken segment produced record operating income of $358 million, with a record 13.6% return on sales. Volume for the quarter was down 0.5%, with 4.7% lower pricing. The slight sales volume decline in chicken, again, is a reflection of upgrading our mix. Results in the Chicken segment can be chalked up to solid execution. We're outperforming the industry and widening the gap. I believe we've demonstrated separation from the commodity players in large part due to the disproportionately high mix of value-added products in our portfolio, as well as the production flexibility created with our buy versus grow strategy, which also reduces commodity exposure. Remember on the last call, I broke out the categories of how we sell chicken, and only 15% is pure commodity. 
As we continue to grow our value-added sales, produce less than we sell, execute extremely well and gain some benefit from lower grain costs, we now expect the Chicken segment margin to improve to more than 11% for the year, up from our previous estimate of more than 10%. 
In the Beef segment, operating income was $71 million, with a 2% return on sales. Volume for the quarter was down 3.8%, while price was down 14.4%. Volume was down due to the Denison plant closure. Retail pricing has declined significantly, but beef is still expensive for consumers, with the beef-to-pork and the beef-to-chicken price ratios at record levels. I'm pleased with the turnaround from the losses we sustained in Q4. Some of the improvement can be attributed to the mark-to-market and LCM from Q4. We got about half of it back in Q1, and the remainder will come over the next year or so. Better cattle supplies in Q1, coupled with the realignment of our Denison and Dakota City plants, moderately improved our capacity utilization. 
We feel good about our Beef business and the team is executing very well. Cattle supplies appear to be growing, and the recent semiannual Cattle on Feed report indicated the total inventory is up 3.2% over the previous year; however, there is still regional disparity in the location of the cattle. Q2 can be a little uneven due to the weather and consumption around Lent. So we're going to remain conservative with our guidance of an operating margin at or above the low end of 1.5% to 3% normalized range. 
I will add that I'm pleased about repeal of M-COOL. Our contention was that it added incremental costs with no real consumer benefit. And now that it's been repealed, we're able to reduce the complexity of our business by eliminating around 800 SKUs. 
In the Pork segment, operating income was $158 million, with a 13% return on sales. Volume was down 2.2%, with pricing down 19.5%. Volume was down due to the divestiture of our Heinold Hog Markets business in Q1 of last year. Excluding this, Pork volume was up 5.5%. 
There were plenty of hogs on the market in Q1, which lowered our hog costs, as well as our average selling price. With more hogs, we improved capacity utilization, which helped widen the margin spread. Our Prepared Foods segment benefits from lower pork raw material prices as well. 
We expect hog industry supplies to be up around 2% to 3% for the fiscal year, so we should be able to continue with good capacity utilization. We haven't seen any significant improvement in export markets; however, domestic pork demand is good. With near-record results in Q1, we are increasing our Pork segment outlook for the fiscal year, which should produce returns above 8%. 
Now, let's move from the segments to our view of consumer demand. Lower gas prices and unemployment at the lowest levels since 2008 are translating into some growth into the perimeter of the grocery store and more consumer spending on eating away from home. With the diversity of our portfolio, we're prepared to respond to this shift in consumer behaviors. In the last 3 months, foodservice traffic was up 1%, while check size was up 2%. While we play across all areas of foodservice, we're especially well-aligned with the categories in the national foodservice chains that are showing the most growth. 
On the retail side. Overall grocery trips are down, but shoppers are spending more on our Core 9 product lines compared to total food and beverage and overall packaged meats. This is important because our Core 9 product lines are the primary drivers of sales and profitability within our packaged retail offering and includes brands like Jimmy Dean, Tyson, Hillshire Farm, Ball Park and Aidells. 
I'd like to talk a little more about volume, specifically at retail, and what you might be seeing reported by Nielsen and IRI. Although the top 10 branded food companies, including us, lost volume in calendar year 2015, our Core 9 product lines grew 1.2%. We are now seeing the price investments we've made begin to take hold, as sales volume was up 2% in the latest 12-week period, but accelerated to a 4% increase in the latest 4-week comparison. 
I also want to point out that the Core 9 product lines, in aggregate, grew in Q1 ahead of the categories. In total, our share of these categories was up, and where our leading brands grew the most, the categories performed the best. Additionally, our volume growth improved through the quarter and on into January. I feel really good about our retail brands and expect to see the recent trends continue for the remainder of the year, as we see the full impact from pricing, recovery from AI and strong brand support. 
So all that's to say, a volume decline at the total Tyson level isn't indicative of the health of our business, and I think the overall returns we delivered this quarter and the optimism around our outlook give us confidence for another record setting year, which is why we're raising our fiscal 2016 EPS guidance by 35% -- $0.35 on the low end to $3.85 to $3.95. 
We have a consumer-relevant portfolio packed with advantaged brands in advantaged categories. We have a superior supply chain. We have a high-performing team focused on execution. I like the position Tyson Foods is in, I like where we're headed, and I like the momentum that's building towards fiscal '17. Dennis?"

Fiscal 2016 is off to a phenomenal start. We've been repeating over the past several years the value in our diversified portfolio, which has been evident in strong, steady returns. With our first quarter results",827,"Thanks, Donnie, and good morning, everyone. Fiscal 2016 is off to a phenomenal start. We've been repeating over the past several years the value in our diversified portfolio, which has been evident in strong, steady returns. With our first quarter results, you can see our earnings potential, when all segments performed well and finished within or above their normalized ranges. With record EPS, record operating income and record operating cash flows, we were able to repurchase 6.4 million shares for $300 million in Q1. 
So far, through the second quarter of this year, we've repurchased 3.9 million shares for $200 million. In total, over the past 7 months, we have now repurchased 16.2 million shares for $750 million. 
I'm also pleased to announce that yesterday, our Board of Directors increased the shares authorized for repurchase under this program by 50 million shares, underscoring our commitment to continue returning cash to shareholders. 
First quarter revenues were $9.2 billion, which is a decrease of 15% from Q1 a year ago, due to significant declines in beef, pork and feed prices. Sales volumes declined 7% as reported. However, when excluding the divestitures of the Brazil and Mexico chicken operations and the Heinold Hog Market business, our total company sales volume decreased 1%. Despite this small decline in volume, we are continuing to execute our strategy of growing in value-added categories, which is evident in our first quarter results. 
Total company return on sales was a record 8.5%. Operating income was a record $776 million, representing a 38% increase over adjusted operating income from Q1 a year ago. 
Our record earnings of $1.15 per share represents a 49% increase over $0.77 adjusted earnings per share in Q1 last year. 
I would also like to note that on an adjusted basis, our last 12 months' EPS is $3.53. 
Our operating cash flow for the first quarter was a record $1.1 billion, and we spent $188 million on capital expenditures. This outpaced our depreciation by $37 million, as we continued to invest in projects with a focus on delivering high ROIC. 
Our effective tax rate in the first quarter was 35.2%. Net debt-to-EBITDA for the past 12 months was 1.7x, and on a gross debt-to-EBITDA basis, this measure was 2.1x. 
Including cash of $1.2 billion, net debt was $5.5 billion. Total liquidity was over $2.4 billion, significantly above our goal of $1.2 billion. Total liquidity at the end of the first quarter was enhanced by cash held for payments to livestock producers deferred to calendar 2016, as well as cash held for the retirement of $638 million in notes coming due in the second quarter. 
When these notes are retired, we will have paid down $2.4 billion of gross debt since the acquisition of Hillshire in August 2014. 
Our rapid leverage reduction in only 19 months reflects our commitment to maintaining investment-grade credit metrics. 
Net interest expense was $65 million during Q1. For the quarter, our diluted shares outstanding were $400 million. 
Now here are some additional thoughts on fiscal 2016. We now expect revenues of approximately $37 billion, which includes the impact of fiscal 2015 divestitures and expected declines in beef, pork and feed prices. We expect to capture more than $500 million of synergies in fiscal '16, which includes more than $200 million of incremental synergies over fiscal '15 from our Prepared Foods profit improvement initiatives and Hillshire brand synergies. 
Net interest expense should approximate $245 million. 
We currently estimate our effective tax rate to be around 35%. CapEx is expected to be $900 million, as we continue to focus on projects that will create long-term shareholder value. 
Prior to adjusting for any additional share repurchases subsequent to this call, and based on our average share price in Q1, we expect our diluted shares to be around 394 million. 
As we have demonstrated, our capital allocation priorities are governed by our disciplined focus on driving long-term shareholder value. Our priorities for deploying these significant cash flows that our operations generate are for growing our businesses organically through operational efficiency and capital expansion projects, along with investing in innovation and brand building; acquiring businesses that support our strategic objectives; and returning cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, all while maintaining plenty of liquidity, investment-grade ratings and continuing to expand our debt capacity. 
In closing, our Q2 should beat last year, but will be less than Q1 due to our typical seasonality. And the third and fourth quarters are expected to be strong. As mentioned in this morning's release, we are raising our EPS guidance range to $3.85 to $3.95 for fiscal 2016, up from $3.50 to $3.65. This represents a 4-year EPS compounded annual growth rate of more than 18% annually. With each of our segments demonstrating tremendous overall performance, we view Q1 not as an exception, but as a new foundation, which provides momentum for our continued growth. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we're ready to begin Q&A."

You touched on it in your prepared remarks, but can you give us your view of the Prepared Packaged Foods macro from your vantage point?

I'm going to try to take that like from snacking through frozen into the Core 9 to kind of give you the full feel. So not all snacking's created equal, right? What continues to grow in the snacking category is protein snacking. If I've got my numbers right, total snacking's probably growing at around 6% or so year-over-year. And, as you know, that's a major focus for us in our innovation this year. Looking on into the frozen categories, breakfast and value-added poultry are 2 categories that are growing faster than total frozen and total food and beverage, and that's our key focus. But also look -- if you look at, 84% of the refrigerated categories in which we compete are growing, and then 87% of the fresh categories in which we compete are growing, and it really reinforces our statement around having advantaged brands in advantaged categories. So now let me loop over into the Core 9. So if you look at the Core 9 brands, or product lines really, those are so important because that's where we have the greatest value potential over the long term. Within the core, we have the highest growth potential. We've probably got the strongest position with both consumers and customers and great margins. So that's why we focus on what we call the Core 9, and we spelled those out in the last call, because they are categories in which are growing faster than other refrigerated meats and faster than total food and beverage over the long term. And then, we have advantaged positions within those categories."

So as we moved out of Q4 into Q1 in -- there was some regional disparity, but overall, the feedlots began to market those cattle and become more current, if you will, with the inventory they have in the feedlots. That provided us the supply we needed to be able to improve our margins. Plus, if you'll remember back at the end of Q4, right in the last couple of weeks or so of the quarter, we had a lower cost of market adjustment and a mark-to-market adjustment that we made. And so we got about half of that back in Q1. Now the rest of that will keep coming back to us as we progress on through the year, because you had beef sold out front, and then you bought live cattle futures against it to hedge it. So put all that together, and we're kind of in the, well, we're at 2%, sort of towards the low end or getting towards the middle of that range. As we look forward, Q2 is always a tough quarter for us. You've got a lot of weather issues around, as we're seeing this week, up in the Midwest. Lent is kind of a low demand period for beef, particularly, so I want to see us get through that. But then, it feels like that after Easter, should see cattle supply improving, and the back half ought to improve. So I think, longer term, our beef margins should stay within that 1.5% to 3% range.

So those are what we call the Core 9, where we have the disproportionate ability to grow faster than the categories, and they're very meaningful categories. So if I look -- and what we've really been focused on is the recent trends in our volume versus the category volume. We were -- I think I mentioned in my comments. I think I said this, that we were a little bit slow in seeing the price declines reflected at retail. And now, through the last 4 weeks or so, we've pretty much seen the pricing get reflected on the retail shelf, and volume is responding. If I looked at, say, smoked sausage, in the last 4 weeks, our volume growth is up 4% versus -- that's the last 4 weeks, versus 2% for the 52-week and 2% for the 12. And last week, it was up double digits, like 10% or so. If I look at Jimmy Dean Breakfast Sausage, for example, we're up 2% in the latest 52, but 11% in the latest 4-week comparison. And that's what we've been looking for, to see momentum in volume as we see the price reflected on the shelf. So we feel really good about the core of our business. Also let me -- one on hot dogs real quick. We did see a little bit of impact, I think, from the IARC announcement in hot dogs. But we are seeing a response there. We feel great about the brand support for the summer grilling season and we're really, really anticipating a very, very strong grilling season this year, so feel great about that. Hope that helps."

And we're buying that meat well below $1 instead of selling it well below $1. Plus, with our buy versus grow strategy, we don't have that excess leg quarter to sell. We're selling fewer leg quarters today, and I've been here a long time, I can't ever remember us selling fewer leg quarters than we are today. And the buy versus grow certainly plays a part of that. But with great innovative capabilities, we're finding ways to upgrade that raw material into value-added, high-margin opportunities, and that's a real key. So when you combine the strength of our value-added portfolio, the strength of our brands, both at fresh and frozen, when you look at the diversity of the portfolio between small bird and value-added and fresh, and then you combine that with this great marketing and innovation engine that we've got, it really does help stabilize the earnings of our Chicken business over time.

And I think what we're seeing clearly is your big bird segment, if I may, where you're taking a lot of this cheap meat out of the big bird plants and adding value to it, that's been a great strategy. So my question really is more on the retail tray pack side of your business and potentially on the small bird side. Can you talk about the sustainability of the margins on those 2 sort of subcategories? Like a lot of people think your tray pack business is not as -- it can't maintain these margins at these levels if supply increases, right? So if you look at 3 segments for the Chicken market, it seems to me that whatever supply increase has been coming into the market, it's been on the big bird side. So what happens if and when the retail tray pack supply, industry-wise, increases? What does that do to your margin structure?

So first of all, as evidenced in South Georgia, we have the flexibility within our supply chain to move our mix to where the consumer's going. If you look at a macro view, although recent volumes because -- at fresh, for example, because you've got so much pork, price is way down and pork demand's up. But in general, remembering that chicken is twice the size of the category of both -- of beef or pork, chicken demand is really good, and it over indexes to the millennials as they enter the workplace and begin, in earnest, consuming food. So we feel great about the macro trends and where they're leading us. We have the flexibility within our supply chain to move within small bird, fresh, whatever we might do. Certainly, it's not in our business model to oversupply big bird. We'd rather buy that meat and add value to it, as you mentioned. The thing about our business to remember is we've got the #1 fresh brand at retail. We've got great penetration across a broad segment of customers nationally. And we have phenomenal quality, service and innovation. So I feel good that we will remain the leading fresh supplier as we move out front, whether it's a small bird into the retail deli or fast food cut up, or whether it's at retail, plus we've got a lot of innovation that we can continue to innovate in these fresh categories, and our customers rely on that.

So the 1- and 3-pound rolls of ground beef. That meat -- which is a huge portion, by the way, of the volume decline, or a huge proportion of the volume decline, that meat's going fresh. And frankly, for us, if the consumer would rather have that breast meat in a fresh tray versus having it in an IQF bag, we're going to go where the consumer is, because frankly, it margins us up a little bit. Same thing on ground beef. If they'd rather have it, that volume not in that UPC but in a non-UPC tray, we're going to do that. So first of all, bear that in mind. Backing up to your other question, the big revenue issue overall for the company really comes in 3 places. Beef and pork commodity prices are down a lot. And then the other thing is the divestitures of the Mexican business, the Brazilian business and our Heinold Hog Markets business. So that is the overwhelming majority of the revenue decline quarter-over-quarter, and it's driven primarily by beef prices and, by the way, will be for the year.

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Fiscal 2016 is off to a great start with record EPS of $1.15, up 49% over Q1 of '15's adjusted results. All of our segments performed very well, with Prepared Foods and Chicken producing reco",1379,"Thanks, Jon. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Fiscal 2016 is off to a great start with record EPS of $1.15, up 49% over Q1 of '15's adjusted results. All of our segments performed very well, with Prepared Foods and Chicken producing record operating income for the quarter, Pork had its second best quarter ever, while Beef showed significant improvement over Q4 and Q1 of '15. In total, we produced record operating income of $776 million at 38% over Q1 of last year. We had a record operating margin of 8.5% and record operating cash flows of $1.1 billion. 
Revenues were down due to the deflationary environment of raw materials and the divestiture of a few noncore businesses. Excluding the divestitures, sales volume was down just over 1% in Q1 as we sold more higher-margin value-added products, upgraded our mix to more profitable sales and processed fewer cattle. We're very pleased with the total synergies, capturing $121 million in Q1, $61 million was incremental to Q1 last year, and we're on track to achieve more than $500 million this fiscal year. These synergies are a major source of funds for Prepared Foods growth. 
In the Prepared Foods segment, operating income was $207 million with a 10.9% return on sales, which was a record. Returns benefited primarily from declining raw materials and synergy capture. Volume for the quarter was down 7.7%, with pricing lower by 3.6%. The lower volume was the result of optimizing the sales mix by reducing private label products at retail, and to a lesser extent, the impact of avian influenza on our turkey lunchmeat business and a slower-than-planned price reduction reflected on the retail shelves. 
For the balance of fiscal 2016, we anticipate continued savings on raw materials, as well as synergy capture, and we'll invest a good portion of these savings into pricing, innovation and brand building. Our margin outlook for Prepared Foods is near the low end of the 10% to 12% range. 
The Chicken segment produced record operating income of $358 million, with a record 13.6% return on sales. Volume for the quarter was down 0.5%, with 4.7% lower pricing. The slight sales volume decline in chicken, again, is a reflection of upgrading our mix. Results in the Chicken segment can be chalked up to solid execution. We're outperforming the industry and widening the gap. I believe we've demonstrated separation from the commodity players in large part due to the disproportionately high mix of value-added products in our portfolio, as well as the production flexibility created with our buy versus grow strategy, which also reduces commodity exposure. Remember on the last call, I broke out the categories of how we sell chicken, and only 15% is pure commodity. 
As we continue to grow our value-added sales, produce less than we sell, execute extremely well and gain some benefit from lower grain costs, we now expect the Chicken segment margin to improve to more than 11% for the year, up from our previous estimate of more than 10%. 
In the Beef segment, operating income was $71 million, with a 2% return on sales. Volume for the quarter was down 3.8%, while price was down 14.4%. Volume was down due to the Denison plant closure. Retail pricing has declined significantly, but beef is still expensive for consumers, with the beef-to-pork and the beef-to-chicken price ratios at record levels. I'm pleased with the turnaround from the losses we sustained in Q4. Some of the improvement can be attributed to the mark-to-market and LCM from Q4. We got about half of it back in Q1, and the remainder will come over the next year or so. Better cattle supplies in Q1, coupled with the realignment of our Denison and Dakota City plants, moderately improved our capacity utilization. 
We feel good about our Beef business and the team is executing very well. Cattle supplies appear to be growing, and the recent semiannual Cattle on Feed report indicated the total inventory is up 3.2% over the previous year; however, there is still regional disparity in the location of the cattle. Q2 can be a little uneven due to the weather and consumption around Lent. So we're going to remain conservative with our guidance of an operating margin at or above the low end of 1.5% to 3% normalized range. 
I will add that I'm pleased about repeal of M-COOL. Our contention was that it added incremental costs with no real consumer benefit. And now that it's been repealed, we're able to reduce the complexity of our business by eliminating around 800 SKUs. 
In the Pork segment, operating income was $158 million, with a 13% return on sales. Volume was down 2.2%, with pricing down 19.5%. Volume was down due to the divestiture of our Heinold Hog Markets business in Q1 of last year. Excluding this, Pork volume was up 5.5%. 
There were plenty of hogs on the market in Q1, which lowered our hog costs, as well as our average selling price. With more hogs, we improved capacity utilization, which helped widen the margin spread. Our Prepared Foods segment benefits from lower pork raw material prices as well. 
We expect hog industry supplies to be up around 2% to 3% for the fiscal year, so we should be able to continue with good capacity utilization. We haven't seen any significant improvement in export markets; however, domestic pork demand is good. With near-record results in Q1, we are increasing our Pork segment outlook for the fiscal year, which should produce returns above 8%. 
Now, let's move from the segments to our view of consumer demand. Lower gas prices and unemployment at the lowest levels since 2008 are translating into some growth into the perimeter of the grocery store and more consumer spending on eating away from home. With the diversity of our portfolio, we're prepared to respond to this shift in consumer behaviors. In the last 3 months, foodservice traffic was up 1%, while check size was up 2%. While we play across all areas of foodservice, we're especially well-aligned with the categories in the national foodservice chains that are showing the most growth. 
On the retail side. Overall grocery trips are down, but shoppers are spending more on our Core 9 product lines compared to total food and beverage and overall packaged meats. This is important because our Core 9 product lines are the primary drivers of sales and profitability within our packaged retail offering and includes brands like Jimmy Dean, Tyson, Hillshire Farm, Ball Park and Aidells. 
I'd like to talk a little more about volume, specifically at retail, and what you might be seeing reported by Nielsen and IRI. Although the top 10 branded food companies, including us, lost volume in calendar year 2015, our Core 9 product lines grew 1.2%. We are now seeing the price investments we've made begin to take hold, as sales volume was up 2% in the latest 12-week period, but accelerated to a 4% increase in the latest 4-week comparison. 
I also want to point out that the Core 9 product lines, in aggregate, grew in Q1 ahead of the categories. In total, our share of these categories was up, and where our leading brands grew the most, the categories performed the best. Additionally, our volume growth improved through the quarter and on into January. I feel really good about our retail brands and expect to see the recent trends continue for the remainder of the year, as we see the full impact from pricing, recovery from AI and strong brand support. 
So all that's to say, a volume decline at the total Tyson level isn't indicative of the health of our business, and I think the overall returns we delivered this quarter and the optimism around our outlook give us confidence for another record setting year, which is why we're raising our fiscal 2016 EPS guidance by 35% -- $0.35 on the low end to $3.85 to $3.95. 
We have a consumer-relevant portfolio packed with advantaged brands in advantaged categories. We have a superior supply chain. We have a high-performing team focused on execution. I like the position Tyson Foods is in, I like where we're headed, and I like the momentum that's building towards fiscal '17. Dennis?"

We've been repeating over the past several years the value in our diversified portfolio, which has been evident in strong, steady returns. With our first quarter results, you can see our earnings potential, when all segments performed well and finished within or above their normalized ranges. With record EPS, record operating income and record operating cash flows, we were able to repurchase 6.4 million shares for $300 million in Q1. 
So far, through the second quarter of this year, we've repurchased 3.9 million shares for $200 million. In total, over the past 7 months, we have now repurchased 16.2 million shares for $750 million. 
I'm also pleased to announce that yesterday, our Board of Directors increased the shares authorized for repurchase under this program by 50 million shares, underscoring our commitment to continue returning cash to shareholders. 
First quarter revenues were $9.2 billion, which is a decrease of 15% from Q1 a year ago, due to significant declines in beef, pork and feed prices. Sales volumes declined 7% as reported. However, when excluding the divestitures of the Brazil and Mexico chicken operations and the Heinold Hog Market business, our total company sales volume decreased 1%. Despite this small decline in volume, we are continuing to execute our strategy of growing in value-added categories, which is evident in our first quarter results. 
Total company return on sales was a record 8.5%. Operating income was a record $776 million, representing a 38% increase over adjusted operating income from Q1 a year ago. 
Our record earnings of $1.15 per share represents a 49% increase over $0.77 adjusted earnings per share in Q1 last year. 
I would also like to note that on an adjusted basis, our last 12 months' EPS is $3.53. 
Our operating cash flow for the first quarter was a record $1.1 billion, and we spent $188 million on capital expenditures. This outpaced our depreciation by $37 million, as we continued to invest in projects with a focus on delivering high ROIC. 
Our effective tax rate in the first quarter was 35.2%. Net debt-to-EBITDA for the past 12 months was 1.7x, and on a gross debt-to-EBITDA basis, this measure was 2.1x. 
Including cash of $1.2 billion, net debt was $5.5 billion. Total liquidity was over $2.4 billion, significantly above our goal of $1.2 billion. Total liquidity at the end of the first quarter was enhanced by cash held for payments to livestock producers deferred to calendar 2016, as well as cash held for the retirement of $638 million in notes coming due in the second quarter. 
When these notes are retired, we will have paid down $2.4 billion of gross debt since the acquisition of Hillshire in August 2014. 
Our rapid leverage reduction in only 19 months reflects our commitment to maintaining investment-grade credit metrics. 
Net interest expense was $65 million during Q1. For the quarter, our diluted shares outstanding were $400 million. 
Now here are some additional thoughts on fiscal 2016. We now expect revenues of approximately $37 billion, which includes the impact of fiscal 2015 divestitures and expected declines in beef, pork and feed prices. We expect to capture more than $500 million of synergies in fiscal '16, which includes more than $200 million of incremental synergies over fiscal '15 from our Prepared Foods profit improvement initiatives and Hillshire brand synergies. 
Net interest expense should approximate $245 million. 
We currently estimate our effective tax rate to be around 35%. CapEx is expected to be $900 million, as we continue to focus on projects that will create long-term shareholder value. 
Prior to adjusting for any additional share repurchases subsequent to this call, and based on our average share price in Q1, we expect our diluted shares to be around 394 million. 
As we have demonstrated, our capital allocation priorities are governed by our disciplined focus on driving long-term shareholder value. Our priorities for deploying these significant cash flows that our operations generate are for growing our businesses organically through operational efficiency and capital expansion projects, along with investing in innovation and brand building; acquiring businesses that support our strategic objectives; and returning cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, all while maintaining plenty of liquidity, investment-grade ratings and continuing to expand our debt capacity. 
In closing, our Q2 should beat last year, but will be less than Q1 due to our typical seasonality. And the third and fourth quarters are expected to be strong. As mentioned in this morning's release, we are raising our EPS guidance range to $3.85 to $3.95 for fiscal 2016, up from $3.50 to $3.65. This represents a 4-year EPS compounded annual growth rate of more than 18% annually. With each of our segments demonstrating tremendous overall performance, we view Q1 not as an exception, but as a new foundation, which provides momentum for our continued growth.

I'm going to try to take that like from snacking through frozen into the Core 9 to kind of give you the full feel. So not all snacking's created equal, right? What continues to grow in the snacking category is protein snacking. If I've got my numbers right, total snacking's probably growing at around 6% or so year-over-year. And, as you know, that's a major focus for us in our innovation this year. Looking on into the frozen categories, breakfast and value-added poultry are 2 categories that are growing faster than total frozen and total food and beverage, and that's our key focus. But also look -- if you look at, 84% of the refrigerated categories in which we compete are growing, and then 87% of the fresh categories in which we compete are growing, and it really reinforces our statement around having advantaged brands in advantaged categories. So now let me loop over into the Core 9. So if you look at the Core 9 brands, or product lines really, those are so important because that's where we have the greatest value potential over the long term. Within the core, we have the highest growth potential. We've probably got the strongest position with both consumers and customers and great margins. So that's why we focus on what we call the Core 9, and we spelled those out in the last call, because they are categories in which are growing faster than other refrigerated meats and faster than total food and beverage over the long term. And then, we have advantaged positions within those categories."

So if you go back as far as Q3 when the feedlots started extending the turns, if you will, and keeping cattle in the feedlot longer, coupled with the heifer retention and the reduction in cow slaughter that we saw as the beginning parts of the supply chain, and the calf crop operator began to -- the effort to expand the herd, cattle supply dried up and strained margins. So as we moved out of Q4 into Q1 in -- there was some regional disparity, but overall, the feedlots began to market those cattle and become more current, if you will, with the inventory they have in the feedlots. That provided us the supply we needed to be able to improve our margins. Plus, if you'll remember back at the end of Q4, right in the last couple of weeks or so of the quarter, we had a lower cost of market adjustment and a mark-to-market adjustment that we made. And so we got about half of that back in Q1. Now the rest of that will keep coming back to us as we progress on through the year, because you had beef sold out front, and then you bought live cattle futures against it to hedge it. So put all that together, and we're kind of in the, well, we're at 2%, sort of towards the low end or getting towards the middle of that range. As we look forward, Q2 is always a tough quarter for us. You've got a lot of weather issues around, as we're seeing this week, up in the Midwest. Lent is kind of a low demand period for beef, particularly, so I want to see us get through that. But then, it feels like that after Easter, should see cattle supply improving, and the back half ought to improve. So I think, longer term, our beef margins should stay within that 1.5% to 3% range.

So those are what we call the Core 9, where we have the disproportionate ability to grow faster than the categories, and they're very meaningful categories. So if I look -- and what we've really been focused on is the recent trends in our volume versus the category volume. We were -- I think I mentioned in my comments. I think I said this, that we were a little bit slow in seeing the price declines reflected at retail. And now, through the last 4 weeks or so, we've pretty much seen the pricing get reflected on the retail shelf, and volume is responding. If I looked at, say, smoked sausage, in the last 4 weeks, our volume growth is up 4% versus -- that's the last 4 weeks, versus 2% for the 52-week and 2% for the 12. And last week, it was up double digits, like 10% or so. If I look at Jimmy Dean Breakfast Sausage, for example, we're up 2% in the latest 52, but 11% in the latest 4-week comparison. And that's what we've been looking for, to see momentum in volume as we see the price reflected on the shelf. So we feel really good about the core of our business. Also let me -- one on hot dogs real quick. We did see a little bit of impact, I think, from the IARC announcement in hot dogs. But we are seeing a response there. We feel great about the brand support for the summer grilling season and we're really, really anticipating a very, very strong grilling season this year, so feel great about that. Hope that helps."

We're selling fewer leg quarters today, and I've been here a long time, I can't ever remember us selling fewer leg quarters than we are today. And the buy versus grow certainly plays a part of that. But with great innovative capabilities, we're finding ways to upgrade that raw material into value-added, high-margin opportunities, and that's a real key.

And the early week -- during November and December, frankly, we didn't get the price realization on the shelf that we needed to drive volume. During the month of January, the pricing gaps were reflected on the shelf, and we saw the volume response that we were looking for. So I feel great about our growth going forward for the year. We have advantaged brands in advantaged categories, and we fully intend to take advantage of that because that's what the consumer wants us to do. So -- and you're right, we will be lapping the AI problems. We've got to get some points of distribution back, but we're -- we've got a great sales team working on that. We continue to improve the mix. One of the volume issues in Q1 was that we didn't repeat some private label volume. And frankly, it's like, I don't know, spiral-sliced hams and private label bacon. And we just have so much more opportunity in branded consumer pull categories, that it was the right thing to do for our business and for the customer to not repeat those very low, if not negative margin in private label sales and improve that into a..."

Obviously, you outperformed what the commodity markets did, in our estimates, by about 1,000 basis points. So I think what I'm seeing is, and just help me if I'm wrong here or if I'm reading it incorrectly, but relative to the market, your portfolio is more stable higher-margin products, and that's starting to play through on the revenue line. And clearly, this quarter, we saw that, right? And I think what we're seeing clearly is your big bird segment, if I may, where you're taking a lot of this cheap meat out of the big bird plants and adding value to it, that's been a great strategy. So my question really is more on the retail tray pack side of your business and potentially on the small bird side. Can you talk about the sustainability of the margins on those 2 sort of subcategories? Like a lot of people think your tray pack business is not as -- it can't maintain these margins at these levels if supply increases, right? So if you look at 3 segments for the Chicken market, it seems to me that whatever supply increase has been coming into the market, it's been on the big bird side. So what happens if and when the retail tray pack supply, industry-wise, increases? What does that do to your margin structure? And then similarly, on the small bird, I mean, I know it's not happening right now, right? We know that there's no new capacity coming in on those 2 segments. But just help me think through that for a second."

So first of all, as evidenced in South Georgia, we have the flexibility within our supply chain to move our mix to where the consumer's going. If you look at a macro view, although recent volumes because -- at fresh, for example, because you've got so much pork, price is way down and pork demand's up. But in general, remembering that chicken is twice the size of the category of both -- of beef or pork, chicken demand is really good, and it over indexes to the millennials as they enter the workplace and begin, in earnest, consuming food. So we feel great about the macro trends and where they're leading us. We have the flexibility within our supply chain to move within small bird, fresh, whatever we might do. Certainly, it's not in our business model to oversupply big bird. We'd rather buy that meat and add value to it, as you mentioned. The thing about our business to remember is we've got the #1 fresh brand at retail. We've got great penetration across a broad segment of customers nationally. And we have phenomenal quality, service and innovation. So I feel good that we will remain the leading fresh supplier as we move out front, whether it's a small bird into the retail deli or fast food cut up, or whether it's at retail, plus we've got a lot of innovation that we can continue to innovate in these fresh categories, and our customers rely on that. So I think that is a big portion of what stabilizes our fresh Chicken business, if you will, through the future."

It depends -- number one, it depends on your view of everything that you look at in Nielsen or IRI about our data, because there's 2 categories that if you do the kind of the macro view of everything Tyson in IRI, you've got 2 categories in there that would be IF Chicken, and then the UPC ground beef chubs also show up. So the 1- and 3-pound rolls of ground beef. That meat -- which is a huge portion, by the way, of the volume decline, or a huge proportion of the volume decline, that meat's going fresh. And frankly, for us, if the consumer would rather have that breast meat in a fresh tray versus having it in an IQF bag, we're going to go where the consumer is, because frankly, it margins us up a little bit. Same thing on ground beef. If they'd rather have it, that volume not in that UPC but in a non-UPC tray, we're going to do that. So first of all, bear that in mind. Backing up to your other question, the big revenue issue overall for the company really comes in 3 places. Beef and pork commodity prices are down a lot. And then the other thing is the divestitures of the Mexican business, the Brazilian business and our Heinold Hog Markets business. So that is the overwhelming majority of the revenue decline quarter-over-quarter, and it's driven primarily by beef prices and, by the way, will be for the year. So well, we would expect it to be for the year. Does that help?"

Our transformation continuous, and our momentum is building with another record setting quarter characterized by strong performances across all segments. Versus Q2 last year, operating income grew 27% to $704 million",1307,"Thanks, Jon. Good morning, everyone. 
Our transformation continuous, and our momentum is building with another record setting quarter characterized by strong performances across all segments. Versus Q2 last year, operating income grew 27% to $704 million with an operating margin of 7.7%, both records for a second quarter, which is typically our most challenging. We delivered adjusted EPS of $1.07. 
Our strategies for growth are working. Our team is focused on innovation and building our portfolio of leading products and brands. We're adjusting to consumer trends and shifts in the marketplace, and we're capturing synergies. 
Total synergies for the quarter were $144 million. Year-to-date, synergies are $265 million and are ahead of pace to exceed $500 million by the end of the fiscal year. Total synergies since the acquisition are $450 million.
Diving into the specifics for the quarter. Prepared Foods, Chicken and Pork were in or above their normalized margin ranges, while Beef just missed its range after recovering from losses a year ago. 
Total volume was up 2.1%, excluding the divestiture of our Mexico chicken operation. Top line sales were down across the board, as the deflationary environment continued for beef, pork and chicken prices. 
Prepared Foods operating income was $197 million with a 10.9% return on sales, tying the previous records. Operating income improved due to product mix changes and lower input costs. Total volume compared to Q2 last year was down 3/10 of a percent. Sales dollars were down 3.6% due to lower inputs and pricing actions at retail, as we positioned our portfolio to accelerate volume growth in the back half of the year. Our [indiscernible] indicates that our efforts to drive volume momentum is having the intended effect, as volumes are up 4% for the most recent 4-week period in the core 9 on the back of significant share gains, driven primarily by Ball Park hotdogs, Jimmy Dean breakfast sausage and Hillshire Farm Smoked Sausage and lunchmeat. 
In Q2, we captured $111 million in synergies in the preppy food segment, with $41 million incremental to Q2 of last year. We expect the segment's operating margin to be at the low end of the normalized range in fiscal 2016, as we continue putting a good portion of the synergies back into the business for innovation, new product launches and strengthening our brands to support long-term growth.
The Chicken segment produced operating income of $347 million, and a 12.7% return on sales was a Q2 record. Volume was up 1.7%, while sales dollars were down 3.3%. Over the past 5 years, we differentiated our Chicken business by being more consumer-driven. We've upgraded our mix to more value-added and branded products. We've diversified our pricing mechanisms. We've optimized our cost structure by investing in our operations with good ROI projects. We've implemented our Buy vs. Grow strategy, and we're providing industry-leading quality and customer service. Because of the actions we've taken and because they've proven to produce higher, more stable margins, we're raising the normalized range to 9% to 11%. Although we're taking the range up to 11% on the top end, I'll hurry on to say that we expect the Chicken segment to come in above 12% for 2016. And while it's early to talk about fiscal '17, we expect the similar operating environment next year. 
Moving on to the Beef segment. Despite a challenging quarter, Beef showed significant improvement over Q2 last year. Operating income was $46 million, with a 1.3% return on sales. Volume was up 2.8% due to an increase in live cattle prices as a result of higher fed cattle supplies, while sales dollars were down 11.9%. We're pleased with the performance of our Beef business, and we expect the segment's operating margin to be in its normalized range of 1.5% to 3%. 
Pork had a great quarter with $140 million in operating income and an 11% return on sales. Demand for pork was strong, and volume was up 3.1% compared to the same period last year, resulting in improved capacity utilization. As pricing declined, sales dollars were down 1.2%. With the increase of hog supplies in fiscal '16, we believe the Pork segment's operating margin will be above its normalized range at around 10%. 
Let's move from our segments to consumer and channel trends. As we mentioned last quarter, our efforts to expand retail-branded total points of distribution and closed pricing gaps were implemented slower than planned, but we see the tide turning. According to ROI, total Tyson retail volume, excluding raw frozen chicken and ground beef jobs, is up 3% in the latest 4-week period versus flat in the 52-week view, driven, of course, by growth in the core 9. So clearly, momentum is building, and we feel great about our growth-driving initiatives throughout the upcoming summer season.
In addition to volume, core 9 share is up as well. Dollar share's up 7/10 of a share point, and volumes share is up 1.6 share points in the most recent 4-week view. 
In the macro environment, consumer sentiment is strong, and disposable personal income continues to rise. Economic optimism is driving growth in the fresh department, and attractive fresh meat and poultry pricing is also a factor, as volumes are up nearly 3% for the latest 13 weeks. 
In foodservice, NPD is reporting growth in both traffic and check size. While we play across all areas of foodservice, we're especially well-aligned with the national foodservice chains that are showing the most growth. Within broad line distributors, chicken is up 6%. Among branded chicken companies, Tyson has the #1 share, by far, in each of the 8 major categories, and we're growing share in 5 of the 8 categories.
To keep our products relevant with consumers, we must keep refreshing our offerings through flavor and formula updates, line extensions and disruptive innovation. In July, we'll be introducing Jimmy Dean stuffed hashbrowns and Ball Park frozen sandwich meats, including both pork, meatballs and steakhouse burgers. Retailer acceptance has been very good, and sell-in is going well. 
In September, we're launching an extension of the Hillshire Snacking platform, and we'll roll out our new Tyson natural's line of frozen chicken products featuring all-natural ingredients and no antibiotics ever. 
As we innovate, we'll align with customers to grow where the growth is. Nonstore retail, or e-commerce, is projected to grow 3x faster than the rest of the market, so we've begun innovating with the e-commerce shopper and retailer in mind. We'll continue to partner with the leading U.S. retailers test click-and-collect models. 
Additionally, as we announced at CAGNY, we're expanding our relationship with Amazon Fresh to sell fresh protein as well as partner with them around innovation. We plan to launch Tyson Taste Makers, a line of chef-inspired middle kits and premium proteins for home deliveries with Amazon Fresh this fall. 
We have a lot to be excited about in 2016, and we're generating momentum to carry us through 2017. Our portfolio is aligned with consumer trends and marketplace shifts. 
The retail core 9 continues outpacing total food and beverage with volume growth accelerating. We're growing with growing customers. Our foodservice portfolio is positioned with growing national accounts and categories and broad line distribution. 
We're innovating, with new product across all channels. Our innovation pipeline is extensive and driven by consumer insights. We're valuing up our product mix. We're driving growth. We're in a good macro environment. We're capturing synergies. We are buying back stock. We're on track for another record year. And we're raising 2016 adjusted earnings guidance to $4.20 to $4.30 a share, which will give us a 4-year EPS CAGR of at least 21%. All that adds up to a great fiscal year, and we're expecting 2017 to be even better.
Through a game-changing acquisition and continued improvement, Tyson Foods is a different company. 
Now let's go to Dennis."
190636,310174423,977897,"Tyson Foods, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, May 09, 2016",2016-05-09,"Earnings Calls","Tyson Foods, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Donnie, and good morning, everyone. Q2 was another record quarter, as we delivered robust results across each of our segments.

Q2 was another record quarter, as we delivered robust results across each of our segments. With record second quarter EPS and operating income, we continue to deliver the growth, synergies, innovation and operating income that is transforming Tyson from a protein company to a demand-driven, protein-centric food company. 
We were able to repurchase 6.9 million shares for $400 million in Q2. So far, during the third quarter of this year, we repurchased approximately 3 million shares for $200 million. In total, over the past 10 months, we have now repurchased over 22 million shares for approximately $1.1 billion, underscoring our commitment to continue returning cash to shareholders. 
Q2 revenues were $9.2 billion, representing a decrease of 8% due to continued declines in beef, pork and chicken prices. However, volumes grew 2.1% when excluding the divestiture of our Mexico operation in the prior year. 
Total company return on sales was 7.7%, a record for a second quarter. Operating income was $704 million, representing a 27% increase over adjusted operating income from Q2 a year ago and is also a record for the second quarter. 
Our record second quarter adjusted EPS of $1.07 represents a 43% increase over $0.75 adjusted earnings per share in Q2 last year. I would also like to note that on an adjusted basis, our last 12 months EPS is $3.85.
Our operating cash flow through 2 quarters was $1.1 billion, and we spent $355 million on capital expenditures. This outpaced our depreciation by $50 million, as we continue to invest in projects with a focus on delivering high ROIC. 
Our effective tax rate in the second quarter was 32.7% on a GAAP basis and 34.5% on an adjusted basis. 
Net debt-to-EBITDA for the past 12 months was 1.8x. Including cash of $254 million, net debt was $6.1 billion. Total liquidity was $1.2 billion, which is in line with our minimum liquidity target. 
During the second quarter, we retired the 6.6%, $638 million 2016 notes that were due. And since the acquisition of Hillshire in August 2014, we have reduced our gross debt by about $2.1 billion. Our rapid leverage reduction in under 2 years reflects our commitment to maintaining investment-grade credit ratings.
Net interest expense was $63 million during Q2. For the quarter, our diluted shares outstanding were 393 million. 
Now here are some additional thoughts on fiscal 2016. We expect revenues of approximately $37 billion, which includes the impact of our fiscal 2015 divestitures and declines in beef, pork and chicken prices. 
Through 6 months, we captured $265 million of synergies and are ahead of pace to exceed $500 million by the end of the fiscal year. Additionally, total synergies since the Hillshire acquisition are $450 million. 
Net interest expense should approximate $245 million. We currently estimate our adjusted effective tax rate to be around 35%. CapEx is expected to approximate $850 million as we continue to focus on projects that create long-term shareholder value.
Prior to adjusting for any additional share repurchases subsequent to this call and based on our average share price in Q2, we expect our average diluted shares to be around 390 million. 
As we have demonstrated, our capital allocation priorities are governed by our disciplined focus on driving long-term shareholder value. Our priorities for deploying our significant operating cash flow are for investing in consumer preferred driven -- portfolio, driven by innovation and brand building, along with growing our businesses organically through operational efficiency and capital expansion projects; acquiring businesses that support our strategic objectives and returning cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividend, all while maintaining plenty of liquidity, investment-grade credit ratings and continuing to expand our debt capacity. 
As we have discussed on our earnings calls over the past few years, we have been transforming our Chicken business. We've grown our branded products, which are anchored ion consumer insights and innovation. We've reduced our commodity sales as we've created a model that's 90% pull and only 10% push to the market. And we have implemented our Buy vs. Grow strategy, where we can purchase up to 10% of our chicken meat in the open-market to margin up. 
These initiatives have helped transform our Chicken business to create a higher, more stable margin structure for what we believe is a new level of profitability for the segment. As a result, we are increasing the Chicken segment's normalized range to 9% to 11%, as this will more accurately reflect the impact of the sustainable fundamental business improvements in our Chicken segment as we accelerate growth. 
In closing, we delivered record results in our second quarter, which is typically softer and seasonally more challenging. As mentioned in this morning's release, we are raising our adjusted EPS guidance range to $4.20 to $4.30 per share in fiscal 2016, up from our previous range of $3.85 to $3.95. This new range is up more than 30% over 2015 adjusted EPS.
This new range also represents a compounded annual growth rate of at least 21% adjusted EPS for the 4-year period of 2012 to 2016. 
We are excited about the momentum we have going into fiscal 2017, as we continue to transform our business with leading brands in advantaged categories that put us in a unique position to drive long-term shareholder value. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. Charmaine, we're ready to begin Q&A."

So let's talk a little bit about what we know. So we know we're driving growth. If we see in the most recent 4-week data in IRI, we're gaining momentum as we move into and closer to Memorial Day and on through the summer season. That feels really good. Our mix is improved. We've -- there was some private label volume that we did not renew, but we feel great about our opportunities to grow going forward. So we like our mix. We're investing a lot in growth, great advertising, a lot of investment in innovation. We announced a new processing plant for our Chicken business. We needed some further processing capacity in the fry arena. We're getting that around us now. We've got good capacity in fully cooked, so we feel great about that. As we look into our Prepared Foods group, we've got really strong merchandising lined up for the summer season. I think that will help carry a lot of momentum into the fall and into next year. Great innovation pipeline. So we'll have some good innovation to continue to add next year. Our Chicken business has really improved. I feel real good about volume growth in the back half of our year in Chicken. Pork looks like it's going to have another good year in '17. We've got what looks like to be good supply of hogs coming our way. Beef, same story. We've got good supply of cattle coming out way, it looks like, in '17. So if you add all that up, with great cash flow and our ability to continue to invest in the business, it feels really solid for '17. Now for the stuff we don't know, the commodity-related stuff, grain, et cetera, we don't know that yet. But no reason to believe that we won't have -- you got a plan going ahead for a normal crop year. So no reason not to believe that wouldn't happen now."

They would include mix, various pricing mechanisms, the supply and demand environment around gain and that kind of thing. And they look at all of those fundamentals over the very long term. And so in looking at the model, it showed clearly that it was time for us to raise our normalized range. As far as the overperformance goes, we've got very strong volume this year. We feel good about that. Obviously, our position is favorable this year with the low end of what we expect, the 5-year range of grain to be, and that helps over delivery a bit. And if you look going forward at what might cause any dip, it's that level of fundamentals, primarily driven around the grain. But I tell you, we've done a very good job of utilizing the price discovery mechanisms afforded us to be able to take a lot of the grain volatility out of our business. We price much more of our product off in some kind of a grain-based mechanism. So we feel good about the diversity of our pricing mechanisms, the price discovery mechanisms that we can employ on the grain side to stabilize those margins. So that's our view on that guidance."

And Akshay, we spend about 5% or so on MAP, and we're investing really heavily in growth. We've got a lot of innovation. We've talked about our price gaps right. We've gotten our price gaps right, and we're seeing the volume response that we suspected we would see. So that's a great investment for us. And we'll continue to do that to grow our Prepared Foods business. That business is built for growth. We've got great brands in great categories. And we've got a very good growth story, and we're going to continue to invest in growth."

So -- and I'm looking at -- if we look just at the -- well, what I'm going to",329,"Yes. So again, I'm going to use the -- I'll go to the last 12-week data and if we had the exact same spread between the 12-week data and the 52-week data as we did the 4 weeks. So -- and I'm looking at -- if we look just at the -- well, what I'm going to do, let me use all of our branded portfolio, minus the raw, frozen, IQF, and then I'm going to take out ground beef chubs. Both of those are UPC-d, but the consumer is wanting those in a tray instead of the UPC items. And so that volume is moving out of the IRI data. Well, it's showing negative in the IRI data, but we're not losing the sale. We're just selling in the fresh category. So when I look at our branded business, minus IQF and ground beef chubs for the 12-week period, we're showing 3% volume growth versus being flat in the 52-week view. So we see the exact same thing. And looking back at Q2, it took us a little longer than we wanted to get the pricing gaps realized on the shelf. And now that we're there, I expect to see good momentum all through the summer selling season, especially in light of the merchandising we've got set up and the advertising that we've got employed. So I feel really good about that growth prospect. Longer term, our brands, we use the phrase, we have advantaged brands and advantaged categories, and we do. The categories we're in outpace food and beverage growth. And I think, over time, you should expect us to grow at about 1.5x the category growth. And so when you run that algorithm, you're in categories that are outgrowing total food and beverage, and you're out as the band leader in a lot of those categories, you're outrunning that growth by 1.5x. That sets up very well to add a lot of shareholder value over time."

So with the drop in the cutout and a little bit more stabilization, if you can call it that, and [indiscernible] features, it feels like that the retailers have been much more willing to feature beef coming up from Memorial Day forward. 50s have been pretty cheap, so ground beef is a good value. If you look at the latest 13 weeks, ground beef is up about 6% or so on a 15% decrease in price. And you continue actually to accelerate. It's just [indiscernible] to about 6.5% in the 4-week view on about the same kind of a price decline. So this cheaper cutout is going to mean better Beef volume, I think. Plus, we've got supply around us. There's still a bit of heifer retention. You're seeing heifer's about 44% or so of the slaughter, so we're still growing herd a bit. It looks like to us that for the year, now it's be obviously bigger in the back half for the year, we ought to see about 2% increase in the fed cattle supply this year. And we think that's the number for the next 2 years. Again, as we know, we're very well positioned where the big feedlots are, where the big, high-capacity feedlots are. So yes, it feels good to have the worst over -- the worst behind us in Beef and good supply coming to us, and that'll help certainly our margins."

Good morning, everyone.Our transformation continues, and our momentum is building with another record-setting quarter characterized by strong performances across all segments.

Our transformation continues, and our momentum is building with another record-setting quarter characterized by strong performances across all segments. Versus Q2 last year, operating income grew 27% to $704 million with an operating margin of 7.7%, both records for a second quarter, which is typically our most challenging. We delivered adjusted EPS of $1.07.
Our strategies for growth are working. Our team is focused on innovation and building our portfolio of leading products and brands. We're adjusting to consumer trends and shifts in the marketplace, and we're capturing synergies. Total synergies for the quarter were $144 million. Year-to-date, synergies are $265 million and are ahead of pace to exceed $500 million by the end of the fiscal year. Total synergies since the acquisition are $450 million.
Diving into the specifics for the quarter.
Prepared Foods, Chicken and Pork were in or above their normalized margin ranges, while Beef just missed its range after recovering from losses a year ago. Total volume was up 2.1%, excluding the divestiture of our Mexico chicken operation. Top line sales were down across-the-board, as the deflationary environment continued for beef, pork and chicken prices.
Prepared Foods operating income was $197 million with a 10.9% return on sales, tying the previous record. Operating income improved due to product mix changes and lower input cost. Total volume compared to Q2 last year was down 0.3% of a percent. Sales dollars were down 3.6% due to lower inputs and pricing actions at retail as we positioned our portfolio to accelerate volume growth in the back half of the year. IRI data indicates that our efforts to drive volume momentum is having the intended effect, as volumes are up 4% for the most recent 4-week period in the Core 9 on the back of significant share gains driven primarily by Ball Park hotdogs, Jimmy Dean breakfast sausage and Hillshire Farm smoked sausage and lunchmeat.
In Q2, we captured $111 million in synergies in the Prepared Foods segment, with $41 million incremental to Q2 of last year. We expect the segment's operating margin to be at the low end of the normalized range in fiscal 2016 as we continue putting a good portion of the synergies back into the business for innovation, new product launches and strengthening our brands to support long-term growth.
The Chicken segment produced operating income of $347 million, and a 12.7% return on sales was a Q2 record. Volume was up 1.7%, while sales dollars were down 3.3%.
Over the past 5 years, we've differentiated our Chicken business by being more consumer driven. We've upgraded our mix to more value-added and branded products. We've diversified our pricing mechanisms. We've optimized our cost structure by investing in our operations with good-ROI projects. We've implemented our buy versus grow strategy, and we're providing industry-leading quality and customer service. Because of the actions we've taken and because they've proven to produce higher, more stable margins, we're raising the normalized range to 9% to 11%. Although we're taking the range up to 11% on the top end, I'll hurry on to say that we expect the Chicken segment to come in above 12% for 2016. And while it's early to talk about fiscal '17, we expect a similar operating environment next year.
Moving on to the Beef segment. Despite a challenging quarter, Beef showed significant improvement over Q2 last year. Operating income was $46 million, with a 1.3% return on sales. Volume was up 2.8% due to an increase in live cattle process as a result of higher fed cattle supplies, while sales dollars were down 11.9%. We're pleased with the performance of our Beef business, and we expect the segment's operating margin to be in its normalized range of 1.5% to 3%.
Pork had a great quarter with $140 million in operating income and an 11.8% return on sales. Demand for pork was strong, and volume was up 3.1% compared to the same period last year, resulting in improved capacity utilization. As pricing declined, sales dollars were down 1.2%. With the increased hog supplies in fiscal '16, we believe the Pork segment's operating margin will be above its normalized range at around 10%.
Let's move from our segments to consumer and channel trends. As we mentioned last quarter, our efforts to expand retail-branded total points of distribution and close pricing gaps were implemented slower than planned, but we see the tide turning. According to IRI, total Tyson retail volume, excluding raw frozen chicken and ground beef chubs, is up 3% in the latest 4-week period versus flat in the 52-week view, driven of course by growth in the Core 9. So clearly, momentum is building. And we feel great about our growth-driving initiatives throughout the upcoming summer season.
In addition to volume, Core 9's share is up as well. Dollar share is up 0.7 of a share point, and volumes share is up 1.6 share points in the most recent 4-week view. 
In the macro environment, consumer sentiment is strong and disposable personal income continues to rise. Economic optimism is driving growth in the fresh department. And attractive fresh meat and poultry pricing is also a factor, as volumes are up nearly 3% for the latest 13 weeks. In food service, NPD is reporting growth in both traffic and check size. While we play across all areas of food service, we're especially well aligned with the national food service chains that are showing the most growth. Within broadline distributors, Chicken is up 6%. Among branded chicken companies, Tyson has the #1 share, by far, in each of the 8 major categories; and we're growing share in 5 of 8 categories.
To keep our products relevant with consumers, we must keep refreshing our offerings through flavor and formula updates, line extensions and disruptive innovation. In July, we'll be introducing Jimmy Dean stuffed hash browns; and Ball Park frozen sandwich meats, including pulled pork, meatballs and steakhouse burgers. Retailer acceptance has been very good, and sell-in is going well. In September, we're launching an extension of the Hillshire Snacking platform. And we'll roll out our new Tyson naturals line of frozen chicken products featuring all-natural ingredients and no antibiotics ever. As we innovate, we'll align with customers to grow where the growth is. Nonstore retail or e-commerce is projecting to grow 3x faster than the rest of the market, so we've begun innovating with the e-commerce shopper and retailer in mind. We'll continue to partner with the leading U.S. retailers testing click-and-collect models.
Additionally, as we announced at CAGNY, we're expanding our relationship with AmazonFresh to sell fresh protein as well as partner with them around innovation. We plan to launch Tyson Tastemakers, a line of chef-inspired meal kits and premium proteins, for home delivery with AmazonFresh this fall.
We have a lot to be excited about in 2016, and we're generating momentum to carry us through 2017. Our portfolio is aligned with consumer trends and marketplace shifts. The retail Core 9 continues outpacing total food and beverage with volume growth that's accelerating. We're growing with growing customers. Our food service portfolio is positioned with growing national accounts and categories in broadline distribution.
We're innovating, with new product across all channels. Our innovation pipeline is extensive and driven by consumer insights. We're valuing up our product mix. We're driving growth. We're in a good macro environment. We're capturing synergies. We're buying back stock. We're on track for another record year. And we're raising 2016 adjusted earnings guidance to $4.20 to $4.30 a share, which would give us a 4-year EPS CAGR of at least 21%.
All that adds up to a great fiscal year, and we expect 2017 to be even better.
Through a game-changing acquisition and continuous improvement, Tyson Foods is a different company.
And now let's go to Dennis."
190636,310174423,978273,"Tyson Foods, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, May 09, 2016",2016-05-09,"Earnings Calls","Tyson Foods, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Donnie.

Q2 was another record quarter, as we delivered robust results across each of our segments. With record second quarter EPS and operating income, we continued to deliver the growth, synergies, innovation and operating income that is transforming Tyson from a protein company to a demand-driven, protein-centric food company.
We were able to repurchase 6.9 million shares for $400 million in Q2. So far during the third quarter of this year, we repurchased approximately 3 million shares for $200 million. In total, over the past 10 months, we have now repurchased over 22 million shares for approximately $1.1 billion, underscoring our commitment to continue returning cash to shareholders.
Q2 revenues were $9.2 billion, representing a decrease of 8% due to continued declines in beef, pork and chicken prices. However, volumes grew 2.1% when excluding the divestiture of our Mexico operation in the prior year. Total company return on sales was 7.7%, a record for the second quarter. Operating income was $704 million, representing a 27% increase over adjusted operating income from Q2 a year ago and is also a record for the second quarter. 
Our record second quarter adjusted EPS of $1.07 represents a 43% increase over $0.75 adjusted earnings per share in Q2 last year. I would also like to note that, on an adjusted basis, our last 12 months EPS is $3.85.
Our operating cash flow through 2 quarters was $1.1 billion, and we spent $355 million on capital expenditures. This outpaced our depreciation by $50 million as we continue to invest in projects with a focus on delivering high ROIC.
Our effective tax rate in the second quarter was 32.7% on a GAAP basis and 34.5% on an adjusted basis.
Net debt-to-EBITDA for the past 12 months was 1.8x. Including cash of $254 million, net debt was $6.1 billion. Total liquidity was $1.2 billion, which is in line with our minimum liquidity target. During the second quarter, we retired the 6.6% $638 million 2016 notes that were due. And since the acquisition of Hillshire in August 2014, we have reduced our gross debt by about $2.1 billion. Our rapid leverage reduction in under 2 years reflects our commitment to maintaining investment-grade credit ratings.
Net interest expense was $63 million during Q2.
For the quarter, our diluted shares outstanding were 393 million.
Now here are some additional thoughts on fiscal 2016. We expect revenues of approximately $37 billion, which includes the impact of our fiscal 2015 divestitures; and declines in beef, pork and chicken prices. Through 6 months, we captured $265 million of synergies and are ahead of pace to exceed $500 million by the end of the fiscal year. Additionally, total synergies since the Hillshire acquisition are $450 million. Net interest expense should approximate $245 million. We currently estimate our adjusted effective tax rate to be around 35%. CapEx is expected to approximate $850 million as we continue to focus on projects that create long-term shareholder value. Prior to adjusting for any additional share repurchases subsequent to this call and based on our average share price in Q2, we expect our average diluted shares to be around 390 million.
As we have demonstrated, our capital allocation priorities are governed by our disciplined focus on driving long-term shareholder value. Our priorities for deploying our significant operating cash flow are for investing in consumer-preferred driven -- portfolio driven by innovation and brand building, along with growing our businesses organically through our operational efficiency and capital expansion process -- projects; acquiring businesses that support our strategic objectives; and returning cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, all while maintaining plenty of liquidity, investment-grade credit ratings and continuing to expand our debt capacity.
As we have discussed on our earnings calls over the past few years, we have been transforming our Chicken business. We have grown our branded products, which are anchored in consumer insights and innovation. We have reduced our commodity sales, and so we've created a model that is 90% pull and only 10% push to the market. And we've implemented our buy versus grow strategy, where we can purchase up to 10% of our chicken meat on the open market to margin up. These initiatives have helped transform our Chicken business to create a higher, more-stable-margin structure for what we believe is a new level of profitability for the segment. As a result, we are increasing the Chicken segment's normalized range to 9% to 11%, as this will more accurately reflect the impact of the sustainable fundamental business improvements in our Chicken segment as we accelerate growth.
In closing. We delivered record results in our second quarter, which is typically softer and seasonally more challenging. As mentioned in this morning's release, we are raising our adjusted EPS guidance range to $4.20 to $4.30 per share for fiscal 2016, up from our previous range of $3.85 to $3.95. This new range is up more than 30% over 2015 adjusted EPS. This new range also represents a compounded annual growth rate of at least 21% adjusted EPS for the 4-year period of 2012 to 2016.
We are excited about the momentum we have going into fiscal 2017 as we continue to transform our business with leading brands in advantaged categories that put us in a unique position to drive long-term shareholder value. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. Charmaine, we're ready to begin Q&A."

If we see in the most recent 4-week data in IRI, we're gaining momentum as we move into and closer to Memorial Day and on through the summer season. That feels really good. Our mix is improved. We've -- there was some private label volume that we did not renew, but we feel great about our opportunities to grow going forward. So we like our mix. We're investing a lot in long-term growth, great advertising, a lot of investment in innovation. We announced a new processing plant for our Chicken business. We needed some further processing capacity in the par-fried arena. We're getting that around us now. We've got good capacity in fully cooked, so we feel great about that. As we look into our Prepared Foods group, we got, we've got really strong merchandising lined up for the summer season. I think that will help carry a lot of momentum into the fall and into next year, a great innovation pipeline. So we'll have some good innovation to continue to add next year. Our Chicken business has really improved. I feel real good about volume growth in the back half of our year in Chicken. Pork looks like it's going to have another good year in '17. We've got what looks like to be good supply of hogs coming our way; Beef, same story. We've got a good supply of cattle coming our way, it looks like, in '17. So if you add all that up with great cash flow and our ability to continue to invest in the business, it feels really solid for '17. Now for the stuff we don't know, the commodity-related stuff, grain et cetera, we don't know that yet, but no reason to believe that we won't have -- you got to plan going ahead in a -- for a normal crop year, so no reason not to believe that wouldn't happen now."

And so in looking at the model, it showed clearly that it was time for us to raise our normalized range. As far as the overperformance goes, we've got very strong volume this year. We feel good about that. Obviously, our grain position is favorable this year with the low end of what we expect the 5-year range of grain to be, and that helps over-deliver a bit. And if you look going forward at what might cause any dip, it's that level of fundamentals primarily driven around the grain. But I'll tell you we've done a very good job of utilizing the price discovery mechanisms afforded us to be able to take a lot of the grain volatility out of our business. We've priced much more of our product off in some kind of a grain-based mechanism. So we feel good about the diversity of our pricing mechanisms, the price discovery mechanisms that we can employ on the grain side to stabilize those margins. So that's our view on that guidance."

That's the same terminology used at CAGNY, but it is a little different than what Tyson previously said, which was for 10%-plus every single year. I think -- so I just wanted to clarify. Personally for me, it's more reasonable to expect 10%-plus on average than every single year, but I just wanted to again clarify. Is the goal double-digit growth '16, '17, '18 every single year? Or is it more of that sort of CAGR over a longer period you expect to get that?"

And then I'm going to take out ground beef chubs. Both of those are UPC-d, but the consumer is wanting those in a tray instead of the UPC items. And so that volume is moving out of the IRI data -- well, it's showing negative in the IRI data, but we're not losing the sale. We're just selling it in the fresh category. So when I look at our branded business, minus IQF and ground beef chubs for the 12-week period, we're showing 3% volume growth versus being flat in a 52-week view. So we see the exact same thing. And looking back at Q2, it took us a little longer than we wanted to get the pricing gaps realized on the shelf. And now that we're there, I expect to see good momentum all through the summer selling season, especially in light of the merchandising we've got set up and the advertising that we've got employed. So I feel really good about that growth prospect. Longer term, our brands, we use the phrase,""We have advantaged brands and advantaged categories,"" and we do. The categories we're in an outpaced food and beverage growth. And I think, over time, you should expect us to grow at about 1.5x the category growth.

It's just deterred [ph] to about 6.5% in the 4-week view on about the same kind of a price decline. So this cheaper cutout is going to mean better Beef volume, I think. Plus, we've got supply around us. There's still a bit of heifer retention. You're seeing heifers about 44% or so of the slaughter. So we're still growing herd a bit. It looks like to us that, for the year, now it'll be obviously bigger in the back half. For the year, we ought to see about 2% increase in the fed cattle supply this year. And we think that's the number for the next 2 years. Again, as we know, we're very well positioned where the big feedlots are; where the big, high-capacity feedlots are.

Good morning, everyone.Our transformation continues, and our momentum is building with another record-setting quarter characterized by strong performances across all segments. Versus Q2 last year, operating income grew 27% to $704 million w",1305,"Thanks, Jon. Good morning, everyone.
Our transformation continues, and our momentum is building with another record-setting quarter characterized by strong performances across all segments. Versus Q2 last year, operating income grew 27% to $704 million with an operating margin of 7.7%, both records for a second quarter, which is typically our most challenging. We delivered adjusted EPS of $1.07.
Our strategies for growth are working. Our team is focused on innovation and building our portfolio of leading products and brands. We're adjusting to consumer trends and shifts in the marketplace, and we're capturing synergies. Total synergies for the quarter were $144 million. Year-to-date, synergies are $265 million and are ahead of pace to exceed $500 million by the end of the fiscal year. Total synergies since the acquisition are $450 million.
Diving into the specifics for the quarter.
Prepared Foods, Chicken and Pork were in or above their normalized margin ranges, while Beef just missed its range after recovering from losses a year ago. Total volume was up 2.1%, excluding the divestiture of our Mexico chicken operation. Top line sales were down across-the-board, as the deflationary environment continued for beef, pork and chicken prices.
Prepared Foods operating income was $197 million with a 10.9% return on sales, tying the previous record. Operating income improved due to product mix changes and lower input cost. Total volume compared to Q2 last year was down 0.3% of a percent. Sales dollars were down 3.6% due to lower inputs and pricing actions at retail as we positioned our portfolio to accelerate volume growth in the back half of the year. IRI data indicates that our efforts to drive volume momentum is having the intended effect, as volumes are up 4% for the most recent 4-week period in the Core 9 on the back of significant share gains driven primarily by Ball Park hotdogs, Jimmy Dean breakfast sausage and Hillshire Farm smoked sausage and lunchmeat.
In Q2, we captured $111 million in synergies in the Prepared Foods segment, with $41 million incremental to Q2 of last year. We expect the segment's operating margin to be at the low end of the normalized range in fiscal 2016 as we continue putting a good portion of the synergies back into the business for innovation, new product launches and strengthening our brands to support long-term growth.
The Chicken segment produced operating income of $347 million, and a 12.7% return on sales was a Q2 record. Volume was up 1.7%, while sales dollars were down 3.3%.
Over the past 5 years, we've differentiated our Chicken business by being more consumer driven. We've upgraded our mix to more value-added and branded products. We've diversified our pricing mechanisms. We've optimized our cost structure by investing in our operations with good-ROI projects. We've implemented our buy versus grow strategy, and we're providing industry-leading quality and customer service. Because of the actions we've taken and because they've proven to produce higher, more stable margins, we're raising the normalized range to 9% to 11%. Although we're taking the range up to 11% on the top end, I'll hurry on to say that we expect the Chicken segment to come in above 12% for 2016. And while it's early to talk about fiscal '17, we expect a similar operating environment next year.
Moving on to the Beef segment. Despite a challenging quarter, Beef showed significant improvement over Q2 last year. Operating income was $46 million, with a 1.3% return on sales. Volume was up 2.8% due to an increase in live cattle process as a result of higher fed cattle supplies, while sales dollars were down 11.9%. We're pleased with the performance of our Beef business, and we expect the segment's operating margin to be in its normalized range of 1.5% to 3%.
Pork had a great quarter with $140 million in operating income and an 11.8% return on sales. Demand for pork was strong, and volume was up 3.1% compared to the same period last year, resulting in improved capacity utilization. As pricing declined, sales dollars were down 1.2%. With the increased hog supplies in fiscal '16, we believe the Pork segment's operating margin will be above its normalized range at around 10%.
Let's move from our segments to consumer and channel trends. As we mentioned last quarter, our efforts to expand retail-branded total points of distribution and close pricing gaps were implemented slower than planned, but we see the tide turning. According to IRI, total Tyson retail volume, excluding raw frozen chicken and ground beef chubs, is up 3% in the latest 4-week period versus flat in the 52-week view, driven of course by growth in the Core 9. So clearly, momentum is building. And we feel great about our growth-driving initiatives throughout the upcoming summer season.
In addition to volume, Core 9's share is up as well. Dollar share is up 0.7 of a share point, and volumes share is up 1.6 share points in the most recent 4-week view. 
In the macro environment, consumer sentiment is strong and disposable personal income continues to rise. Economic optimism is driving growth in the fresh department. And attractive fresh meat and poultry pricing is also a factor, as volumes are up nearly 3% for the latest 13 weeks. In food service, NPD is reporting growth in both traffic and check size. While we play across all areas of food service, we're especially well aligned with the national food service chains that are showing the most growth. Within broadline distributors, Chicken is up 6%. Among branded chicken companies, Tyson has the #1 share by far in each of the 8 major categories; and we're growing share in 5 of 8 categories.
To keep our products relevant with consumers, we must keep refreshing our offerings through flavor and formula updates, line extensions and disruptive innovation. In July, we'll be introducing Jimmy Dean stuffed hash browns; and Ball Park frozen sandwich meats, including pulled pork, meatballs and steakhouse burgers. Retailer acceptance has been very good, and sell-in is going well. In September, we're launching an extension of the Hillshire Snacking platform. And we'll roll out our new Tyson naturals line of frozen chicken products featuring all-natural ingredients and no antibiotics ever. As we innovate, we'll align with customers to grow where the growth is. Nonstore retail or e-commerce is projecting to grow 3x faster than the rest of the market, so we've begun innovating with the e-commerce shopper and retailer in mind. We'll continue to partner with the leading U.S. retailers testing click-and-collect models.
Additionally, as we announced at CAGNY, we're expanding our relationship with AmazonFresh to sell fresh protein as well as partner with them around innovation. We plan to launch Tyson Tastemakers, a line of chef-inspired meal kits and premium proteins, for home delivery with AmazonFresh this fall.
We have a lot to be excited about in 2016, and we're generating momentum to carry us through 2017. Our portfolio is aligned with consumer trends and marketplace shifts. The retail Core 9 continues outpacing total food and beverage with volume growth that's accelerating. We're growing with growing customers. Our food service portfolio is positioned with growing national accounts and categories in broadline distribution.
We're innovating, with new product across all channels. Our innovation pipeline is extensive and driven by consumer insights. We're valuing up our product mix. We're driving growth. We're in a good macro environment. We're capturing synergies. We're buying back stock. We're on track for another record year. And we're raising 2016 adjusted earnings guidance to $4.20 to $4.30 a share, which would give us a 4-year EPS CAGR of at least 21%.
All that adds up to a great fiscal year, and we expect 2017 to be even better.
Through a game-changing acquisition and continuous improvement, Tyson Foods is a different company.
And now let's go to Dennis."

Q2 was another record quarter, as we delivered robust results across each of our segments. With record second quarter EPS and operating income, we continued to deliver the growth, synergies, innovation and operating income that is transforming Tyson from a protein company to a demand-driven, protein-centric food company.
We were able to repurchase 6.9 million shares for $400 million in Q2. So far during the third quarter of this year, we repurchased approximately 3 million shares for $200 million. In total, over the past 10 months, we have now repurchased over 22 million shares for approximately $1.1 billion, underscoring our commitment to continue returning cash to shareholders.
Q2 revenues were $9.2 billion, representing a decrease of 8% due to continued declines in beef, pork and chicken prices. However, volumes grew 2.1% when excluding the divestiture of our Mexico operation in the prior year. Total company return on sales was 7.7%, a record for the second quarter. Operating income was $704 million, representing a 27% increase over adjusted operating income from Q2 a year ago and is also a record for the second quarter. 
Our record second quarter adjusted EPS of $1.07 represents a 43% increase over $0.75 adjusted earnings per share in Q2 last year. I would also like to note that, on an adjusted basis, our last 12 months EPS is $3.85.
Our operating cash flow through 2 quarters was $1.1 billion, and we spent $355 million on capital expenditures. This outpaced our depreciation by $50 million as we continue to invest in projects with a focus on delivering high ROIC.
Our effective tax rate in the second quarter was 32.7% on a GAAP basis and 34.5% on an adjusted basis.
Net debt-to-EBITDA for the past 12 months was 1.8x. Including cash of $254 million, net debt was $6.1 billion. Total liquidity was $1.2 billion, which is in line with our minimum liquidity target. During the second quarter, we retired the 6.6% $638 million 2016 notes that were due. And since the acquisition of Hillshire in August 2014, we have reduced our gross debt by about $2.1 billion. Our rapid leverage reduction in under 2 years reflects our commitment to maintaining investment-grade credit ratings.
Net interest expense was $63 million during Q2.
For the quarter, our diluted shares outstanding were 393 million.
Now here are some additional thoughts on fiscal 2016. We expect revenues of approximately $37 billion, which includes the impact of our fiscal 2015 divestitures; and declines in beef, pork and chicken prices. Through 6 months, we captured $265 million of synergies and are ahead of pace to exceed $500 million by the end of the fiscal year. Additionally, total synergies since the Hillshire acquisition are $450 million. Net interest expense should approximate $245 million. We currently estimate our adjusted effective tax rate to be around 35%. CapEx is expected to approximate $850 million as we continue to focus on projects that create long-term shareholder value. Prior to adjusting for any additional share repurchases subsequent to this call and based on our average share price in Q2, we expect our average diluted shares to be around 390 million.
As we have demonstrated, our capital allocation priorities are governed by our disciplined focus on driving long-term shareholder value. Our priorities for deploying our significant operating cash flow are for investing in consumer-preferred driven -- portfolio driven by innovation and brand building, along with growing our businesses organically through our operational efficiency and capital expansion process -- projects; acquiring businesses that support our strategic objectives; and returning cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, all while maintaining plenty of liquidity, investment-grade credit ratings and continuing to expand our debt capacity.
As we have discussed on our earnings calls over the past few years, we have been transforming our Chicken business. We have grown our branded products, which are anchored in consumer insights and innovation. We have reduced our commodity sales, and so we've created a model that is 90% pull and only 10% push to the market. And we've implemented our buy versus grow strategy, where we can purchase up to 10% of our chicken meat on the open market to margin up. These initiatives have helped transform our Chicken business to create a higher, more stable margin structure for what we believe is a new level of profitability for the segment. As a result, we are increasing the Chicken segment's normalized range to 9% to 11%, as this will more accurately reflect the impact of the sustainable fundamental business improvements in our Chicken segment as we accelerate growth.
In closing. We delivered record results in our second quarter, which is typically softer and seasonally more challenging. As mentioned in this morning's release, we are raising our adjusted EPS guidance range to $4.20 to $4.30 per share for fiscal 2016, up from our previous range of $3.85 to $3.95. This new range is up more than 30% over 2015 adjusted EPS. This new range also represents a compounded annual growth rate of at least 21% adjusted EPS for the 4-year period of 2012 to 2016.
We are excited about the momentum we have going into fiscal 2017 as we continue to transform our business with leading brands in advantaged categories that put us in a unique position to drive long-term shareholder value. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. Charmaine, we're ready to begin Q&A."

So first of all, yes, it's great to finish what looks like will be another record year for us in '16; something of a, what, 30% increase over last year and well beyond our stated goal of at least 10% EPS growth over time. So as we look forward, we feel great about the momentum that we're generating. So let's talk a little bit about what we know: So we know we're driving growth. If we see in the most recent 4-week data in IRI, we're gaining momentum as we move into and closer to Memorial Day and on through the summer season. That feels really good. Our mix is improved. We've -- there was some private label volume that we did not renew, but we feel great about our opportunities to grow going forward. So we like our mix. We're investing a lot in long-term growth, great advertising, a lot of investment in innovation. We announced a new processing plant for our Chicken business. We needed some further processing capacity in the par-fried arena. We're getting that around us now. We've got good capacity in fully cooked, so we feel great about that. As we look into our Prepared Foods group, we got, we've got really strong merchandising lined up for the summer season. I think that will help carry a lot of momentum into the fall and into next year, a great innovation pipeline. So we'll have some good innovation to continue to add next year. Our Chicken business has really improved. I feel real good about volume growth in the back half of our year in Chicken. Pork looks like it's going to have another good year in '17. We've got what looks like to be good supply of hogs coming our way. Beef, same story. We've got a good supply of cattle coming our way, it looks like, in '17. So if you add all that up with great cash flow and our ability to continue to invest in the business, it feels really solid for '17. Now for the stuff we don't know, the commodity-related stuff, grain et cetera, we don't know that yet, but no reason to believe that we won't have -- you got to plan going ahead in a -- for a normal crop year, so no reason not to believe that wouldn't happen now."

They would include mix, various pricing mechanisms, the supply-and-demand environment around grain and that kind of thing. And they look at all of those fundamentals over the very long term. And so in looking at the model, it showed clearly that it was time for us to raise our normalized range. As far as the overperformance goes, we've got very strong volume this year. We feel good about that. Obviously, our grain position is favorable this year with the low end of what we expect the 5-year range of grain to be, and that helps over-deliver a bit. And if you look going forward at what might cause any dip, it's that level of fundamentals primarily driven around the grain. But I'll tell you we've done a very good job of utilizing the price discovery mechanisms afforded us to be able to take a lot of the grain volatility out of our business. We've priced much more of our product off in some kind of a grain-based mechanism. So we feel good about the diversity of our pricing mechanisms, the price discovery mechanisms that we can employ on the grain side to stabilize those margins. So that's our view on the guidance."

And so that volume is moving out of the IRI data -- well, it's showing negative in the IRI data, but we're not losing the sale. We're just selling it in the fresh category.

And now that we're there, I expect to see good momentum all through the summer selling season, especially in light of the merchandising we've got set up and the advertising that we've got employed. So I feel really good about that growth prospect. Longer term, our brands, we use the phrase, “We have advantaged brands and advantaged categories,"" and we do. The categories we're in outpace food and beverage growth. And I think, over time, you should expect us to grow at about 1.5x the category growth.

You -- and it -- you continue -- actually it accelerates just a tad to about 6.5% in the 4-week view on about the same kind of a price decline. So this cheaper cutout is going to mean better Beef volume, I think. Plus, we've got supply around us. There's still a bit of heifer retention. You're seeing heifers about 44% or so of the slaughter. So we're still growing the herd a bit. It looks like to us that, for the year, now it'll be obviously bigger in the back half. For the year, we ought to see about 2% increase in the fed cattle supply this year. And we think that's the number for the next 2 years.

And so as we look at the landscape, no need for us to push into a deal that doesn't fit us strategically or that kind of thing. So although the landscape is a little thinner than it has been, we continue to look. We want to grow. And we want to grow organically, and we want to grow inorganically. And Dennis has got us a great balance sheet and a lot of capacity to be able to do that. In the meantime, I think buying back our stock is a great way to return cash to shareholders, and we'll stay on that and stay pretty consistent with our uses of capital, like we have been for the last 3 or 4 years."

We did say -- we did have a lot of extra cash going into this quarter on purpose because we intended to pay off the 2016 notes, which were $638 million. So that answers that part of the question. As far as net debt for the rest of the year, I would say that it'll be generally in the area of where we are now, maybe up or down $50 million or $100 million.

We delivered adjusted EPS of $1.07.
Our strategies for growth are working. Our team is focused on innovation and building our portfolio of leading products and brands. We're adjusting to consumer trends and shifts in the marketplace, and we're capturing synergies. Total synergies for the quarter were $144 million. Year-to-date, synergies are $265 million and are ahead of pace to exceed $500 million by the end of the fiscal year. Total synergies since the acquisition are $450 million.
Diving into the specifics for the quarter.
Prepared Foods, Chicken and Pork were in or above their normalized margin ranges, while Beef just missed its range after recovering from losses a year ago. Total volume was up 2.1%, excluding the divestiture of our Mexico chicken operation. Top line sales were down across-the-board, as the deflationary environment continued for beef, pork and chicken prices.
Prepared Foods operating income was $197 million with a 10.9% return on sales, tying the previous record. Operating income improved due to product mix changes and lower input cost. Total volume compared to Q2 last year was down 0.3% of a percent. Sales dollars were down 3.6% due to lower inputs and pricing actions at retail as we positioned our portfolio to accelerate volume growth in the back half of the year. IRI data indicates that our efforts to drive volume momentum is having the intended effect, as volumes are up 4% for the most recent 4-week period in the Core 9 on the back of significant share gains driven primarily by Ball Park hotdogs, Jimmy Dean breakfast sausage and Hillshire Farm smoked sausage and lunchmeat.
In Q2, we captured $111 million in synergies in the Prepared Foods segment, with $41 million incremental to Q2 of last year. We expect the segment's operating margin to be at the low end of the normalized range in fiscal 2016 as we continue putting a good portion of the synergies back into the business for innovation, new product launches and strengthening our brands to support long-term growth.
The Chicken segment produced operating income of $347 million, and a 12.7% return on sales was a Q2 record. Volume was up 1.7%, while sales dollars were down 3.3%.
Over the past 5 years, we've differentiated our Chicken business by being more consumer driven. We've upgraded our mix to more value-added and branded products. We've diversified our pricing mechanisms. We've optimized our cost structure by investing in our operations with good-ROI projects. We've implemented our buy versus grow strategy, and we're providing industry-leading quality and customer service. Because of the actions we've taken and because they've proven to produce higher, more stable margins, we're raising the normalized range to 9% to 11%. Although we're taking the range up to 11% on the top end, I'll hurry on to say that we expect the Chicken segment to come in above 12% for 2016. And while it's early to talk about fiscal '17, we expect a similar operating environment next year.
Moving on to the Beef segment. Despite a challenging quarter, Beef showed significant improvement over Q2 last year. Operating income was $46 million, with a 1.3% return on sales. Volume was up 2.8% due to an increase in live cattle process as a result of higher fed cattle supplies, while sales dollars were down 11.9%. We're pleased with the performance of our Beef business, and we expect the segment's operating margin to be in its normalized range of 1.5% to 3%.
Pork had a great quarter with $140 million in operating income and an 11.8% return on sales. Demand for pork was strong, and volume was up 3.1% compared to the same period last year, resulting in improved capacity utilization. As pricing declined, sales dollars were down 1.2%. With the increased hog supplies in fiscal '16, we believe the Pork segment's operating margin will be above its normalized range at around 10%.
Let's move from our segments to consumer and channel trends. As we mentioned last quarter, our efforts to expand retail-branded total points of distribution and close pricing gaps were implemented slower than planned, but we see the tide turning. According to IRI, total Tyson retail volume, excluding raw frozen chicken and ground beef chubs, is up 3% in the latest 4-week period versus flat in the 52-week view, driven of course by growth in the Core 9. So clearly, momentum is building. And we feel great about our growth-driving initiatives throughout the upcoming summer season.
In addition to volume, Core 9's share is up as well. Dollar share is up 0.7 of a share point, and volumes share is up 1.6 share points in the most recent 4-week view. 
In the macro environment, consumer sentiment is strong and disposable personal income continues to rise. Economic optimism is driving growth in the fresh department. And attractive fresh meat and poultry pricing is also a factor, as volumes are up nearly 3% for the latest 13 weeks. In food service, NPD is reporting growth in both traffic and check size. While we play across all areas of food service, we're especially well aligned with the national food service chains that are showing the most growth. Within broadline distributors, Chicken is up 6%. Among branded chicken companies, Tyson has the #1 share by far in each of the 8 major categories; and we're growing share in 5 of 8 categories.
To keep our products relevant with consumers, we must keep refreshing our offerings through flavor and formula updates, line extensions and disruptive innovation. In July, we'll be introducing Jimmy Dean stuffed hash browns; and Ball Park frozen sandwich meats, including pulled pork, meatballs and steakhouse burgers. Retailer acceptance has been very good, and sell-in is going well. In September, we're launching an extension of the Hillshire Snacking platform. And we'll roll out our new Tyson naturals line of frozen chicken products featuring all-natural ingredients and no antibiotics ever. As we innovate, we'll align with customers to grow where the growth is. Nonstore retail or e-commerce is projecting to grow 3x faster than the rest of the market, so we've begun innovating with the e-commerce shopper and retailer in mind. We'll continue to partner with the leading U.S. retailers testing click-and-collect models.
Additionally, as we announced at CAGNY, we're expanding our relationship with AmazonFresh to sell fresh protein as well as partner with them around innovation. We plan to launch Tyson Tastemakers, a line of chef-inspired meal kits and premium proteins, for home delivery with AmazonFresh this fall.
We have a lot to be excited about in 2016, and we're generating momentum to carry us through 2017. Our portfolio is aligned with consumer trends and marketplace shifts. The retail Core 9 continues outpacing total food and beverage with volume growth that's accelerating. We're growing with growing customers. Our food service portfolio is positioned with growing national accounts and categories in broadline distribution.
We're innovating, with new product across all channels. Our innovation pipeline is extensive and driven by consumer insights. We're valuing up our product mix. We're driving growth. We're in a good macro environment. We're capturing synergies. We're buying back stock. We're on track for another record year. And we're raising 2016 adjusted earnings guidance to $4.20 to $4.30 a share, which would give us a 4-year EPS CAGR of at least 21%.
All that adds up to a great fiscal year, and we expect 2017 to be even better.
Through a game-changing acquisition and continuous improvement, Tyson Foods is a different company.
And now let's go to Dennis."

And good morning, everyone.Q2 was another record quarter, as we delivered robust results across each of our segments. With record second quarter EPS and operating income, we continued to deliver the growth, synergies, innovation and oper",901,"Thanks, Donnie. And good morning, everyone.
Q2 was another record quarter, as we delivered robust results across each of our segments. With record second quarter EPS and operating income, we continued to deliver the growth, synergies, innovation and operating income that is transforming Tyson from a protein company to a demand-driven, protein-centric food company.
We were able to repurchase 6.9 million shares for $400 million in Q2. So far during the third quarter of this year, we repurchased approximately 3 million shares for $200 million. In total, over the past 10 months, we have now repurchased over 22 million shares for approximately $1.1 billion, underscoring our commitment to continue returning cash to shareholders.
Q2 revenues were $9.2 billion, representing a decrease of 8% due to continued declines in beef, pork and chicken prices. However, volumes grew 2.1% when excluding the divestiture of our Mexico operation in the prior year. Total company return on sales was 7.7%, a record for the second quarter. Operating income was $704 million, representing a 27% increase over adjusted operating income from Q2 a year ago and is also a record for the second quarter. 
Our record second quarter adjusted EPS of $1.07 represents a 43% increase over $0.75 adjusted earnings per share in Q2 last year. I would also like to note that, on an adjusted basis, our last 12 months EPS is $3.85.
Our operating cash flow through 2 quarters was $1.1 billion, and we spent $355 million on capital expenditures. This outpaced our depreciation by $50 million as we continue to invest in projects with a focus on delivering high ROIC.
Our effective tax rate in the second quarter was 32.7% on a GAAP basis and 34.5% on an adjusted basis.
Net debt-to-EBITDA for the past 12 months was 1.8x. Including cash of $254 million, net debt was $6.1 billion. Total liquidity was $1.2 billion, which is in line with our minimum liquidity target. During the second quarter, we retired the 6.6% $638 million 2016 notes that were due. And since the acquisition of Hillshire in August 2014, we have reduced our gross debt by about $2.1 billion. Our rapid leverage reduction in under 2 years reflects our commitment to maintaining investment-grade credit ratings.
Net interest expense was $63 million during Q2.
For the quarter, our diluted shares outstanding were 393 million.
Now here are some additional thoughts on fiscal 2016. We expect revenues of approximately $37 billion, which includes the impact of our fiscal 2015 divestitures; and declines in beef, pork and chicken prices. Through 6 months, we captured $265 million of synergies and are ahead of pace to exceed $500 million by the end of the fiscal year. Additionally, total synergies since the Hillshire acquisition are $450 million. Net interest expense should approximate $245 million. We currently estimate our adjusted effective tax rate to be around 35%. CapEx is expected to approximate $850 million as we continue to focus on projects that create long-term shareholder value. Prior to adjusting for any additional share repurchases subsequent to this call and based on our average share price in Q2, we expect our average diluted shares to be around 390 million.
As we have demonstrated, our capital allocation priorities are governed by our disciplined focus on driving long-term shareholder value. Our priorities for deploying our significant operating cash flow are for investing in consumer-preferred driven -- portfolio driven by innovation and brand building, along with growing our businesses organically through our operational efficiency and capital expansion process -- projects; acquiring businesses that support our strategic objectives; and returning cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, all while maintaining plenty of liquidity, investment-grade credit ratings and continuing to expand our debt capacity.
As we have discussed on our earnings calls over the past few years, we have been transforming our Chicken business. We have grown our branded products, which are anchored in consumer insights and innovation. We have reduced our commodity sales, and so we've created a model that is 90% pull and only 10% push to the market. And we've implemented our buy versus grow strategy, where we can purchase up to 10% of our chicken meat on the open market to margin up. These initiatives have helped transform our Chicken business to create a higher, more stable margin structure for what we believe is a new level of profitability for the segment. As a result, we are increasing the Chicken segment's normalized range to 9% to 11%, as this will more accurately reflect the impact of the sustainable fundamental business improvements in our Chicken segment as we accelerate growth.
In closing. We delivered record results in our second quarter, which is typically softer and seasonally more challenging. As mentioned in this morning's release, we are raising our adjusted EPS guidance range to $4.20 to $4.30 per share for fiscal 2016, up from our previous range of $3.85 to $3.95. This new range is up more than 30% over 2015 adjusted EPS. This new range also represents a compounded annual growth rate of at least 21% adjusted EPS for the 4-year period of 2012 to 2016.
We are excited about the momentum we have going into fiscal 2017 as we continue to transform our business with leading brands in advantaged categories that put us in a unique position to drive long-term shareholder value. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. Charmaine, we're ready to begin Q&A."

So as we look forward, we feel great about the momentum that we're generating. So let's talk a little bit about what we know: So we know we're driving growth. If we see in the most recent 4-week data in IRI, we're gaining momentum as we move into and closer to Memorial Day and on through the summer season. That feels really good. Our mix is improved. We've -- there was some private label volume that we did not renew, but we feel great about our opportunities to grow going forward. So we like our mix. We're investing a lot in long-term growth, great advertising, a lot of investment in innovation. We announced a new processing plant for our Chicken business. We needed some further processing capacity in the par-fried arena. We're getting that around us now. We've got good capacity in fully cooked, so we feel great about that. As we look into our Prepared Foods group, we got, we've got really strong merchandising lined up for the summer season. I think that will help carry a lot of momentum into the fall and into next year, a great innovation pipeline. So we'll have some good innovation to continue to add next year. Our Chicken business has really improved. I feel real good about volume growth in the back half of our year in Chicken. Pork looks like it's going to have another good year in '17. We've got what looks like to be good supply of hogs coming our way. Beef, same story. We've got a good supply of cattle coming our way, it looks like, in '17. So if you add all that up with great cash flow and our ability to continue to invest in the business, it feels really solid for '17. Now for the stuff we don't know, the commodity-related stuff, grain et cetera, we don't know that yet, but no reason to believe that we won't have -- you got to plan going ahead in a -- for a normal crop year, so no reason not to believe that wouldn't happen now."

And so in looking at the model, it showed clearly that it was time for us to raise our normalized range. As far as the overperformance goes, we've got very strong volume this year. We feel good about that. Obviously, our grain position is favorable this year with the low end of what we expect the 5-year range of grain to be, and that helps over-deliver a bit. And if you look going forward at what might cause any dip, it's that level of fundamentals primarily driven around the grain. But I'll tell you we've done a very good job of utilizing the price discovery mechanisms afforded us to be able to take a lot of the grain volatility out of our business. We've priced much more of our product off in some kind of a grain-based mechanism. So we feel good about the diversity of our pricing mechanisms, the price discovery mechanisms that we can employ on the grain side to stabilize those margins. So that's our view on the guidance."

And then I'm going to take out ground beef chubs. Both of those are UPC-d, but the consumer is wanting those in a tray instead of the UPC items. And so that volume is moving out of the IRI data -- well, it's showing negative in the IRI data, but we're not losing the sale. We're just selling it in the fresh category. So when I look at our branded business, minus IQF and ground beef chubs for the 12-week period, we're showing 3% volume growth versus being flat in the 52-week view. So we see the exact same thing. And looking back at Q2, it took us a little longer than we wanted to get the pricing gaps realized on the shelf. And now that we're there, I expect to see good momentum all through the summer selling season, especially in light of the merchandising we've got set up and the advertising that we've got employed. So I feel really good about that growth prospect. Longer term, our brands, we use the phrase, “We have advantaged brands and advantaged categories,"" and we do. The categories we're in outpace food and beverage growth. And I think, over time, you should expect us to grow at about 1.5x the category growth. And so when you run that algorithm, you're in categories that are outgrowing total food and beverage, and you're out as the brand leader in a lot of those categories. You're outrunning that growth by 1.5x. That sets up very well to add a lot of shareholder value over time."

If you look at the latest 13 weeks, ground beef is up about 6% or so on a 15% decrease in price. You -- and it -- you continue -- actually it accelerates just a tad to about 6.5% in the 4-week view on about the same kind of a price decline. So this cheaper cutout is going to mean better Beef volume, I think. Plus, we've got supply around us. There's still a bit of heifer retention. You're seeing heifers about 44% or so of the slaughter. So we're still growing the herd a bit. It looks like to us that, for the year, now it'll be obviously bigger in the back half. For the year, we ought to see about 2% increase in the fed cattle supply this year. And we think that's the number for the next 2 years. Again, as we know, we're very well positioned where the big feedlots are; where the big, high-capacity feedlots are. So yes, it feels good to have the worst over, the worst behind us in Beef and some -- and good supply coming to us. And that will help certainly our margins."

We delivered record third quarter earnings, operating income and return on sales, and as a result, we're raising fiscal 2016 adjusted earnings guidance to $4.40 to $4.50 a share. 
Synergies for the quarter were $150 million or $63 million incremental over Q3 of '15. Year-to-date, synergies totaled $415 million, with a $191 million incremental versus the same period last year and will exceed the $500 million target as planned. We bought back 6.6 million shares in Q3 and another 5.4 million so far in Q4, bringing our total shares repurchased to just over 31 million during the past 12 months.

I'm really excited to be on the call and looking forward to a lot of interaction, more interaction, with our investors and analysts and in addition to leading our amazing team. As Donnie said, I'",682,"Great. Good morning, everybody, and thanks a lot, Donnie. I'm really excited to be on the call and looking forward to a lot of interaction, more interaction, with our investors and analysts and in addition to leading our amazing team. 
As Donnie said, I'll take you through the segments and provide color around the results as well as some initial thoughts on 2017. 
First, let's look at Prepared Foods segment. Operating income in the third quarter was $197 million, with a 10.9% operating margin. Volume compared to Q3 last year was up 1.9%, and sales dollars were virtually flat. The lower average selling price resulted from decreased raw material costs and successful pricing strategies to drive volume. We're particularly pleased with the volume increases in Ball Park hotdogs, Hillshire Farm Smoked Sausage and lunchmeat. 
In Q3, we captured $116 million in synergies in the Prepared Foods segment, with $37 million incremental to third quarter last year. As we look towards 2017, we expect Prepared Foods to remain at the lower end of the 10% to 12% operating margin range, as we continue to invest heavily in innovation, new product launches and supporting the growth of our leading brand. 
Turning to the Chicken segment. Chicken produced operating income of $380 million, with a 13.9% return on sales. The important call-out in chicken is that we've continued to improve our product mix. We've grown value-added sales by 5% and reduced commodity sales by 10%, which is why the average selling price was up 40 basis points in the quarter, where our volume was down 90 basis points versus the same quarter last year.
We're being really strategic about our growth. We're growing where we want to grow, and it's reflected in our record return on sales. We've restructured our Chicken business to produce higher, more stable margins over time. And as a quick reminder, here's how we've done this. 
First, we've optimized our cost structure by investing in our operations, with good ROIC projects and by taking out more than $1 billion of inefficiencies from our systems. Second, we've diversified our pricing mechanisms. Third, we've upgraded our mix to more value-added, branded products to meet demand from our retail and foodservice customers. Fourth, we've implemented the buy-versus-grow strategy. And finally, we're providing industry-leading quality and customer service day in and day out. 
We expect to finish the fiscal year with an operating margin of more than 12% in the Chicken segment, and we think fiscal 2017 will be similar. 
Turning to the Beef segment. Operating income was $91 million, with a 2.4% return on sales compared to a $7 million loss in the third quarter last year. Volume was up 2.9% as more cattle were available to process, while the average selling price declined 14.6%.
Although we expect fed cattle supplies to increase 2% to 3% in fiscal 2017, domestic availability should increase only slightly due to reduced imports and some export demand improvement. 
Finally, in the Pork segment, we had another great quarter, with $122 million in operating income and a 9.6% return on sales. This compares to $64 million and a 5.3% return in Q3 of '15. 
Despite increased production, volume was down 1.7% due to reduced inventories as well as product mix changes. The average selling price was up 7.2%. Our Pork segment should finish fiscal 2016 with an operating margin above 10%, and in 2017, it should be above its 6% to 8% normalized range. 
So overall, we expect supplies of chicken, beef and pork to be up 2% to 3% next year. However, domestic demand for protein has been strong. We expect it to continue as prices decline. We'll stay focused on growing sales volume and shifting our mix to more value-added products. And we have the unique ability to access multiple channels to meet consumer and customer demand wherever food is sold. This allows us to drive growth and remain a preferred provider with leading brands. 
I'm going to turn back it over to Donnie, who's going to expand and give us his thoughts on the macro environment."

I want to build on what Tom said about growing where we want to grow. 
Consumer sentiment is mildly positive as unemployment and gasoline prices have decreased, while real GDP and disposable personal income have moved up slightly. In this environment, foodservice traffic remains about flat, and average check size is up about 2%. QSR change, which typically drive demand for value-added chicken and Prepared Foods, are showing the most growth. We're well-aligned with those national account customers as well as other growing channels in Foodservice. 
At retail, efforts to support our brands are paying off. Our Core 9 volume is up 6% for the 13 weeks ended July 24, and our retail fresh volume continues to grow as consumers shift towards the perimeter of the store. 
We partner with our customers to grow their businesses, which is why our retailers rely on us as category captains for consumer and category insights. Since Tyson and Hillshire came together 2 years ago, we've more than doubled our category captaincies with retailers to the total of 143. Innovation also plays a key role in customer growth and, therefore, ours. Our Vitality Index, which measures the percent of sales from products launched within the previous 3 years, is projected to exceed 21% for foodservice and 13% for retail this fiscal year. Those rates are considered best-in-class and include new products like Hillshire Farm chicken Apple sausage for convenient stores, cleaner label, all-natural chicken for foodservice distributors, Jimmy Dean potatoes hashbrowns and Ball Park frozen meat for retail and club stores. 
We're on track to launch Tyson Tastemakers in e-commerce in the fall and, later this month, Tyson naturals, frozen value-added chicken and new varieties of Hillshire Snacking will roll out at retail. 
Our differentiated capabilities in both our scalable supply chain and customer and consumer demand expertise are driving profitable growth in the marketplace. We see this across the key metrics, including the category captaincies and the product Vitality Index that I mentioned earlier. And we expect this to continue as we have the organizational capacity and the resources to drive growth and higher, more stable margins.
Through our strong sales team, we continue to foster strategic customer relationships and leverage our consumer insights, innovation, culinary expertise, service and quality to grow with our customers, develop channels and build brands that will propel us forward. Obviously, we have a lot to be excited about as we finish fiscal '16 and move into fiscal '17, which we expect to be another record year and another year of growth. 
Now I'll turn it over to Dennis, who will report on the quarter and give you some early thoughts on next year."

Q3 was another great quarter, as we delivered record earnings due to strong results across each of our segments. The investments we have made in our brands and optimizing mix across the entire portfolio has been evident in the growth of our earnings in 2016. Being a growth company, we see tremendous value in our shares. In Q3, we were able to repurchase 6.6 million shares for $425 million. So far, during the fourth quarter of this year, we've repurchased over 5 million shares for $380 million. In total, since August of last year, we have repurchased over 31 million shares for just under $1.8 billion at an average price of about $56 per share, which underscores our commitment to continue returning cash to shareholders. 
Total company return on sales was 8.2%, a record for our third quarter. Operating income was $767 million, representing a 35% increase over adjusted operating income from Q3 a year ago and also a record for the third quarter. 
Our record third quarter EPS of $1.25 represents a 51% increase over $0.83 per share in Q3 last year. On an adjusted basis, Q3 EPS of $1.21 was also a record and a 51% increase over last year as well. It's important to note that on an adjusted basis, our last 12 months EPS is $4.26. 
Our operating cash flow through 3 quarters was $1.9 billion, and we spent $515 million on capital expenditures. This outpaced our depreciation by $55 million as we continue to invest in projects with a focus on delivering high ROIC. Our effective tax rate in the third quarter was 31.8% and 33.9% on an adjusted basis. 
Net debt-to-EBITDA for the past 12 months was 1.7x. Including cash of $197 million, net debt was $6 billion and total liquidity was $1.3 billion. Net interest expense was $58 million during Q3. For the quarter, average diluted shares outstanding were 388 million. 
Now here are some thoughts on full year fiscal '16 and some early thoughts on fiscal '17.
We expect revenues of approximately $37 billion for fiscal '16 and growth in revenues for fiscal '17. Net interest expense should approximate $245 million in fiscal '16 and $225 million in fiscal '17. We currently estimate our adjusted effective tax rate to be around 34.8% for fiscal '16 and 35% for fiscal '17. 
In fiscal '16, CapEx is expected to approximate $725 million. In fiscal '17, we expect CapEx to increase as we continue to focus on projects that create long-term shareholder value.
Prior to adjusting for any additional share repurchases subsequent to this call, and based on our average share price so far in Q4, we expect our average diluted shares to be around 381 million. 
Our last 12 months adjusted ROIC is 17.5% and is expected to be over 18% by the end of this fiscal year. This is approaching our pre-Hillshire acquisition ROIC of 20.5%, which further illustrates not only the strength of our earnings power but also our commitment to create incremental shareholder value.
We generated a record $2.8 billion in operating cash flow these past 12 months, which we used to invest in our over $730 million in CapEx projects; retire $638 million in notes, which matured in Q2 at coupon of 6.6%. We also returned approximately $200 million in dividends to our shareholders and repurchased over 31 million shares for just under $1.8 billion, including repurchases so far in Q4. 
So far, in fiscal '16, each segment is operating within or above their normalized ranges. The strong performance of each of our segments gives us confidence to raise our adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $4.40 to $4.50 for fiscal '16. This new range is 40% over our fiscal 2015 adjusted EPS and represents a 4-year CAGR of 22%. And while we stay focused on wrapping up a record year for fiscal 2016, we expect growth in sales, operating income and EPS in fiscal 2017, as we believe the Chicken segment should be over 12% again; Prepared Foods margin should be near the low end of its normalized range of 10% to 12% as we continue to invest heavily in innovation, new product launches and the growth there of our brands; our Pork segment should be above its normalized range of 6% to 8%; and the Beef segment should be toward the upper end of its normalized range of 1.5% to 3%. 
In closing, the evolution of our business model to produce strong, stable margins has set us up for another record year. The bar is set high for 2017 as we've come off 40% EPS growth in fiscal '16, but we are excited about the momentum we are generating, which gives us confidence to achieve high signal-digit growth for fiscal 2017. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. Tony, we are ready to begin Q&A."

With what I know today, I'm very confident in saying high single-digit EPS growth. Potential is there for more, so the short answer is yes, we can. Keep in mind, as you mentioned, that is coming off a year of EPS growth over 40%, and as Dennis mentioned in his comments, like 4-year compounded growth rate of 22%. So here's the way we're thinking about how '17 is shaping up. So in Prepared Foods, we're now seeing really solid volume gains across foodservice and retail just like we thought we would when we got our price gaps right, when our merchandising took effect, when our advertising hit. And of course, we're driving really strong innovation, as I mentioned in our comments. So we feel really good about the momentum we have now and taking that through back-to-school into our fiscal '17. Our Chicken business is -- it continues to do great. We continue to value up our mix, as Tom mentioned in his comments. And we continue to drive out inefficiencies from the business. So I think Chicken looks it's set up to have another good year of very solid growth and great earnings. In Pork, as we look at that segment, we hear a lot and it's true that there is more capacity coming online. But we see that capacity coming late in calendar '17, probably more affecting our '18 than our fiscal '17. And we do see about 2%, maybe a little bit more increase in hog numbers out there. So there's going to be plenty of hogs around. And typically, when the supply is good, then that means another good year for us, and that's certainly what we're expecting. Similar story in Beef. Beef supply continues to grow. We think the fed supply will be up about 2% to 3% next year. Fed supply is moving. We think that the increase will be probably felt greater in the North, which probably benefits us a bit. And then on top of all that, David, we've got the ability, great cash flow, and we'll be returning a lot of cash to shareholders and buybacks. So that's why we continue to have a lot of confidence about '17. We feel very good about upper single digits now. And certainly, if there's more there, we're going to get it."

But there are other cyclical factors like corn prices or whether those small, midsized bird prices continue to hold up. How are you thinking in terms of what is controllable and what is perhaps a big macro variable?"

Coming up in, I believe, it's October, there is a new regulation on retailers around having to keep up with where the raw material comes from as they ground ground beef back of house.

And like I said, trying to make that less volatile over time in terms of our earnings is all about brand investments, innovation investment and continuing to drive the agenda there. And that's sort of the way we think about fluctuations in commodity cost inputs through the Prepared Foods business."

At 10.9% and sitting out sort of the lower end of the range for us is the right spot to be right now, given the investments that we're seeing with those investments in the business. As it relates to where we start to hit the ceiling, we have a different MAP objective, marketing advertising promotional spend, by brand and some of their our son went Jimmy Dean as we called out the past is continue to invest heavily against. Lots of ROI there. And our intent is to get more brands to that same tradition over time, and it will be done by continuing to innovate and bring the investment up. So no guidance forward as where we think the ceiling is. What I would just say is as we start to see the progress, that we will get us closer to the top end of that range.

So our pricing mechanisms reflect that. Our move to more value-added products, whether it's par-fried products, fully cut, we're building capacity against those because we continue to see tremendous demand. The buy-versus-grow strategy, we've talked a lot about. And then just staying on top of all those things that give us the best supply base that can make sure our customers are served excellently with great services is really what we're about.

Our remarks today include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements reflect current views with respect to future events, such as Tyson's outlook for future performance on sales, margin, earnings growth and various other aspects of its business. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. I encourage you to read the release issued earlier this morning and our filings with the SEC for a discussion of the risks that can affect our business. 
During the call, there will be a discussion of some items that do not conform to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, including adjusted EPS. Tyson has reconciled these items to the most comparable GAAP measures in the earnings release and on our website at ir.tyson.com. [Operator Instructions]

As Donnie said, I'll take you through the segments and provide color around the results as well as some initial thoughts on 2017. 
First, let's look at Prepared Foods segment. Operating income in the third quarter was $197 million, with a 10.9% operating margin. Volume compared to Q3 last year was up 1.9%, and sales dollars were virtually flat. The lower average selling price resulted from decreased raw material costs and successful pricing strategies to drive volume. We're particularly pleased with the volume increases in Ball Park hotdogs, Hillshire Farm Smoked Sausage and lunchmeat. 
In Q3, we captured $116 million in synergies in the Prepared Foods segment with $37 million incremental to third quarter last year. As we look towards 2017, we expect Prepared Foods to remain at the lower end of the 10% to 12% operating margin range as we continue to invest heavily in innovation, new product launches and supporting the growth of our leading brand. 
Turning to the Chicken segment. Chicken produced operating income of $380 million with a 13.9% return on sales. The important call-out in chicken is that we've continued to improve our product mix. We've grown value-added sales by 5% and reduced commodity sales by 10%, which is why the average selling price was up 40 basis points in the quarter, where our volume was down 90 basis points versus the same quarter last year.  We're being really strategic about our growth. We're growing where we want to grow. And it's reflected in the record return on sales. 
We've restructured our Chicken business to produce higher, more stable margins over time. And as a quick reminder, here's how we've done this. First, we've optimized our cost structure by investing in our operations with good ROIC projects and by taking out more than $1 billion of inefficiencies from our systems. Second, we've diversified our pricing mechanisms. Third, we've upgraded our mix to more value-added branded products to meet demand from our retail and foodservice customers. Fourth, we've implemented the buy-versus-grow strategy. And finally, we're providing industry-leading quality and customer service day in and day out. We expect to finish the fiscal year with an operating margin of more than 12% in the Chicken segment. And we think fiscal 2017 will be similar. 
Turning to the Beef segment. Operating income was $91 million, with a 2.4% return on sales compared to a $7 million loss in the third quarter last year. Volume was up 2.9% as more cattle were available to process, while the average selling price declined 14.6%. Although we expect fed cattle supplies to increase 2% to 3% in fiscal 2017, domestic availability should increase only slightly due to reduced imports and some export demand improvement. 
Finally, in the Pork segment, we had another great quarter with $122 million in operating income and a 9.6% return on sales. This compares to $64 million and a 5.3% return in Q3 of '15. 
Despite increased production, volume was down 1.7% due to reduced inventories as well as product mix changes. The average selling price was up 7.2%. Our Pork segment should finish fiscal 2016 with an operating margin above 10%. And in 2017, it should be above its 6% to 8% normalized range. 
So overall, we expect supplies of chicken, beef and pork to be up 2% to 3% next year. However, domestic demand for protein has been strong. We expect it to continue as prices decline. We'll stay focused on growing sales volume and shifting our mix to more value-added products. And we have the unique ability to access multiple channels to meet consumer and customer demand wherever food is sold. This allows us to drive growth and remain a preferred provider with leading brands. 
I'm going to turn it back over to Donnie. He's going to expand and give us his thoughts on the macro environment."

I want to build on what Tom said about growing where we want to grow. 
Consumer sentiment is mildly positive as unemployment and gasoline prices have decreased, while real GDP and disposable personal income have moved up slightly. In this environment, foodservice traffic remains about flat, and average check size is up about 2%. QSR change, which typically drive demand for value-added chicken and Prepared Foods, are showing the most growth. We're well-aligned with those national account customers as well as other growing channels in foodservice. 
At retail, efforts to support our brands are paying off. Our Core 9 volume is up 6% for the 13 weeks ended July 24. And our retail fresh volume continues to grow as consumers shift towards the perimeter of the store. We partner with our customers to grow their businesses, which is why our retailers rely on us as category captains for consumer and category insights. 
Since Tyson and Hillshire came together 2 years ago, we've more than doubled our category captaincies with retailers to the total of 143. Innovation also plays a key role in customer growth, and therefore, ours. Our Vitality Index, which measures the percent of sales from products launched within the previous 3 years, is projected to exceed 21% for foodservice and 13% for retail this fiscal year. Those rates are considered best-in-class and include new products like Hillshire Farm Chicken Apple Sausage for convenience stores, cleaner label, All Natural chicken for foodservice distributors, Jimmy Dean frittatas and stuffed hashbrowns and Ball Park frozen meat for retail and club stores. 
We're on track to launch Tyson Tastemakers in e-commerce in the fall. And later this month, Tyson naturals, frozen value-added chicken and new varieties of Hillshire Snacking will roll out at retail. 
Our differentiated capabilities in both our scalable supply chain and customer and consumer demand expertise are driving profitable growth in the marketplace. We see this across the key metrics, including the category captaincies and the product Vitality Index that I mentioned earlier. And we expect this to continue as we have the organizational capacity and the resources to drive growth and higher, more stable margins.
Through our strong sales team, we continue to foster strategic customer relationships and leverage our consumer insights, innovation, culinary expertise, service and quality to grow with our customers, develop channels and build brands that will propel us forward. Obviously, we have a lot to be excited about as we finish fiscal '16 and move into fiscal '17, which we expect to be another record year and another year of growth. 
Now I'll turn it over to Dennis, who will report on the quarter and give you some early thoughts on next year."
190636,310174441,1029854,"Tyson Foods, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 08, 2016",2016-08-08,"Earnings Calls","Tyson Foods, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Donnie, and good morning, everyone. Q3 was another great quarter as we delivered record earnings due to strong results across each of our segments.

Q3 was another great quarter as we delivered record earnings due to strong results across each of our segments. The investments we have made in our brands and optimizing mix across the entire portfolio has been evident in the growth of our earnings in 2016. 
Being a growth company, we see tremendous value in our shares. In Q3, we were able to repurchase 6.6 million shares for $425 million. So far, during the fourth quarter of this year, we've repurchased over 5 million shares for $380 million. In total, since August of last year, we have repurchased over 31 million shares for just under $1.8 billion at an average price of about $56 per share, which underscores our commitment to continue returning cash to shareholders. 
Total company return on sales was 8.2%, a record for our third quarter. Operating income was $767 million, representing a 35% increase over adjusted operating income from Q3 a year ago and also a record for the third quarter. 
Our record third quarter EPS of $1.25 represents a 51% increase over $0.83 per share in Q3 last year. On an adjusted basis, Q3 EPS of $1.21 was also a record and a 51% increase over last year as well. It's important to note that on an adjusted basis, our last 12 months EPS is $4.26. 
Our operating cash flow through 3 quarters was $1.9 billion. And we spent $515 million on capital expenditures. This outpaced our depreciation by $55 million as we continue to invest in projects with a focus on delivering high ROIC. Our effective tax rate in the third quarter was 31.8% and 33.9% on an adjusted basis. 
Net debt-to-EBITDA for the past 12 months was 1.7x. Including cash of $197 million, net debt was $6 billion, and total liquidity was $1.3 billion. Net interest expense was $58 million during Q3. For the quarter, average diluted shares outstanding were 388 million. 
Now here are some thoughts on full year fiscal '16 and some early thoughts on fiscal '17. We expect revenues of approximately $37 billion for fiscal '16 and growth in revenues for fiscal '17. Net interest expense should approximate $245 million in fiscal '16 and $225 million in fiscal '17. We currently estimate our adjusted effective tax rate to be around 34.8% for fiscal '16 and 35% for fiscal '17. 
In fiscal '16, CapEx is expected to approximate $725 million. In fiscal '17, we expect CapEx to increase as we continue to focus on projects that create long-term shareholder value. Prior to adjusting for any additional share repurchases subsequent to this call and based on our average share price so far in Q4, we expect our average diluted shares to be around 381 million. 
Our last 12 months adjusted ROIC is 17.5% and is expected to be over 18% by the end of this fiscal year. This is approaching our pre-Hillshire acquisition ROIC of 20.5%, which further illustrates, not only the strength of our earnings power, but also our commitment to create incremental shareholder value.
We generated a record $2.8 billion in operating cash flows the past 12 months, which we used to invest in our over $730 million in CapEx projects; retire $638 million in notes, which matured in Q2 at coupon of 6.6%. We also returned approximately $200 million in dividends to our shareholders and repurchased over 31 million shares for just under $1.8 billion, including repurchases so far in Q4. 
So far, in fiscal '16, each segment is operating within or above their normalized ranges. The strong performance of each of our segments gives us confidence to raise our adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $4.40 to $4.50 for fiscal '16. This new range is 40% over our fiscal 2015 adjusted EPS and represents a 4-year CAGR of 22%. And while we stay focused on wrapping up a record year for fiscal 2016, we expect growth in sales, operating income and EPS in fiscal 2017, as we believe the Chicken segment should be over 12% again; Prepared Foods margin should be near the low end of its normalized range of 10% to 12% as we continue to invest heavily in innovation, new product launches and the growth there of our brands; our Pork segment should be above its normalized range of 6% to 8%; and the Beef segment should be toward the upper end of its normalized range of 1.5% to 3%. 
In closing, the evolution of our business model to produce strong, stable margins has set us up for another record year. The bar is set high for 2017 as we've come off 40% EPS growth in fiscal '16, but we are excited about the momentum we are generating, which gives us confidence to achieve high single-digit growth for fiscal 2017. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. Tony, we are ready to begin Q&A."

With what I know today, I'm very confident in saying high single-digit EPS growth. The potential is there for more, so the short answer is yes, we can. Keep in mind, as you mentioned, that is coming off a year of EPS growth over 40%. And as Dennis mentioned in his comments, like 4-year compounded growth rate of 22%. So here's the way we're thinking about how '17 is shaping up. So in Prepared Foods, we're now seeing really solid volume gains across foodservice and retail just like we thought we would when we got our price gaps right, when our merchandising took effect, when our advertising hit. And of course, we're driving really strong innovation, as I mentioned in our comments. So we feel really good about the momentum we have now and taking that through back-to-school into our fiscal '17. Our Chicken business is -- it continues to do great. We continue to value up our mix, as Tom mentioned in his comments. And we continue to drive out inefficiencies from the business. So I think Chicken looks like it's set up to have another good year of very solid growth and great earnings. In Pork, as we look at that segment, we hear a lot. And it's true that there is more capacity coming online. But we see that capacity coming late in calendar '17, probably more affecting our '18 than our fiscal '17. And we do see about 2%, maybe a little bit more increase in hog numbers out there. So there's going to be plenty of hogs around. And typically, when the supply is good, then that means another good year for us, and that's certainly what we're expecting. Similar story in Beef. Beef supply continues to grow. We think the fed supply will be up about 2% to 3% next year. Fed supply is moving. We think that the increase will be probably felt greater in the north, which probably benefits us a bit. And then on top of all that, David, we've got the ability, great cash flow. And we'll be returning a lot of cash to shareholders and buybacks. So that's why we continue to have a lot of confidence about '17. We feel very good about upper single digits now. And certainly, if there's more there, we're going to get it."

So leg quarters, byproducts, that's a part of our business that we just aren't focusing on. And we actually have been doing great. I'm internalizing more of those leg quarters for our own use on first order of value-added products. So as Donnie said, the pricing mechanism, that's a huge driver for us. We've been doing a lot of work on that. And so continuing to drive value-added should give you the confidence. We'll continue to talk about that. You'll see it in the numbers. It turns into the right margins. We're focused on volume and margin and executing buy versus grow and continuing to focus on innovation, value-added service, quality.

When you layer on top of how the consumer is shifting, our ability to understand the insights and how you use those insights to drive innovation, those are really key building points to continue in this organic growth story. Of course, we're going to be focusing, as Tom mentioned, on growing at both retail and foodservice and value-added poultry and in Prepared Foods.

We don't really use -- we said that years ago, we don't really use the freezer as a customer. And we don't. We have a plan for physical hedges on bellies where you continue to execute that plan. And then the raw material favorability will work its way in through the pricing over time. Foodservice reacts a little faster than certainly the retail does. But ultimately, that raw material cost will find its way back to the customer. So yes, echo the volatility, we're weathering it just fine.

There's another thing that, I think, helps us with our outlook or feel more and more positive about our outlook on Beef. And that is the continued growth of our Case Ready offerings. Coming up in, I believe, it's October, there is a new regulation on retailers around having to keep up with where the raw material comes from as they grind ground beef back of house. And I think that portends a bright future for our Case Ready grind business. We've certainly been in lots of conversations. And we have the capability to do a lot more of that business than we're doing today. So that could also help improve our beef margins over time.

But there's another factor, I think, that needs to be weighed in. If you look at the regional disparities in, let's call it, the southern region of cattle procurement in the northern region, we way over-index in terms of our slaughter capacity in the north. And cattle in the south have been about $1, 100-weight, so somewhere in the order of $8 ahead cheaper than cattle had been in the north. We think that, that will change over time as some of the smaller feedlots that tend to be in the north closer to the grain begin to increase capacity as the supply of cattle increases. So we think that favors us going forward, certainly, from where we have been. So I think those are the really the 2 biggest factors. Our plants are running great, our efficiencies. All the stuff that Steve and his great group are doing to manage the business are in good shape. Those environmental factors are what they are. And we'll continue to manage them over time."

Corn and soybean meal are significantly higher in China than they are here in the United States. And the wholesale markets, we're still somewhat beholden to the wholesale markets because we haven't made a full switch into value-added at retail yet. So the wholesale markets continue to be weak and quite a bit weaker than we would have thought the wholesale pork market would have indicate. Usually, those 2 markets move in concert.

We couldn't describe any certain amount of basis points that are -- you can drive any one part of the model.

The idea that we have done things like we don't have unprotected fixed prices, we continue to drive our business throughout the channels that we have access to. There's a lot of reasons to be happy with the model that we have here at Tyson as it relates to chicken because we aren't just a one-trick pony. We have a lot of focus channels that we do really well in, and we're continuing to drive our expertise in those category captaincies. We're up to 143, I mean which I think is about double from where we were at the time of the acquisition. Things that are -- were working with our customers to get to a better place, those are the things that we'll focus on. Grains, we've looked at us -- have the same margins, whether up or down. And are we going to have some periods of time based on the slope of the curve. That, of course, is going to affect margins. But on balance, we look to make sure that we run our model with no excess. And that's where we've been, and that's what's been the driver of our success."

We continue to build momentum. Our differentiated business model and our strong performance across all segments are contributing to higher, more stable margins. We delivered record third quarter earnings, operating income and return on sales, and as a result, we're raising fiscal 2016 adjusted earnings guidance to $4.40 to $4.50 a share. 
Synergies for the quarter were $150 million with $63 million incremental over Q3 of '15. Year-to-date, synergies total $415 million with $191 million incremental versus the same period last year and will exceed the $500 million target as planned. We bought back 6.6 million shares in Q3 and another 5.4 million so far in Q4, bringing our total shares repurchased to just over 31 million during the past 12 months.

I'm really excited to be on the call and looking forward to a lot of interaction -- more interaction with our investors and analysts and in addition to leading our amazing team. As Donnie said, I'l",684,"Great. Good morning, everybody, and thanks a lot, Donnie. I'm really excited to be on the call and looking forward to a lot of interaction -- more interaction with our investors and analysts and in addition to leading our amazing team. As Donnie said, I'll take you through the segments and provide color around the results as well as some initial thoughts on 2017. 
First, let's look at the Prepared Foods segment. Operating income in the third quarter was $197 million, with a 10.9% operating margin. Volume compared to Q3 last year was up 1.9%, and sales dollars were virtually flat. The lower average selling price resulted from decreased raw material costs and successful pricing strategies to drive volume. We're particularly pleased with the volume increases in Ball Park hotdogs, Hillshire Farm Smoked Sausage and lunchmeat. 
In Q3, we captured $116 million in synergies in the Prepared Foods segment with $37 million incremental to third quarter last year. As we look towards 2017, we expect Prepared Foods to remain at the lower end of the 10% to 12% operating margin range as we continue to invest heavily in innovation, new product launches and supporting the growth of our leading brands. 
Turning to the Chicken segment. Chicken produced operating income of $380 million with a 13.9% return on sales. The important call-out in chicken is that we've continued to improve our product mix. We've grown value-added sales by 5% and reduced commodity sales by 10%, which is why the average selling price was up 40 basis points in the quarter, where our volume was down 90 basis points versus the same quarter last year.  We're being really strategic about our growth. We're growing where we want to grow. And it's reflected in the record return on sales. 
We've restructured our Chicken business to produce higher, more stable margins over time. And as a quick reminder, here's how we've done this. First, we've optimized our cost structure by investing in our operations with good ROIC projects and by taking out more than $1 billion of inefficiencies from our systems. Second, we've diversified our pricing mechanisms. Third, we've upgraded our mix to more value-added branded products to meet demand from our retail and foodservice customers. Fourth, we've implemented the buy-versus-grow strategy. And finally, we're providing industry-leading quality and customer service day in and day out. We expect to finish the fiscal year with an operating margin of more than 12% in the Chicken segment. And we think fiscal 2017 will be similar. 
Turning to the Beef segment. Operating income was $91 million, with a 2.4% return on sales compared to a $7 million loss in the third quarter last year. Volume was up 2.9% as more cattle were available to process, while the average selling price declined 14.6%. Although we expect fed cattle supplies to increase 2% to 3% in fiscal 2017, domestic availability should increase only slightly due to reduced imports and some export demand improvement. 
Finally, in the Pork segment, we had another great quarter with $122 million in operating income and a 9.6% return on sales. This compares to $64 million and a 5.3% return in Q3 of '15. 
Despite increased production, volume was down 1.7% due to reduced inventories as well as product mix changes. The average selling price was up 7.2%. Our Pork segment should finish fiscal 2016 with an operating margin above 10%. And in 2017, it should be above its 6% to 8% normalized range. 
So overall, we expect supplies of chicken, beef and pork to be up 2% to 3% next year. However, domestic demand for protein has been strong. We expect it to continue as prices decline. We'll stay focused on growing sales volume and shifting our mix to more value-added products. And we have the unique ability to access multiple channels to meet consumer and customer demand wherever food is sold. This allows us to drive growth and remain a preferred provider with leading brands. 
I'm going to turn it back over to Donnie. He's going to expand and give us his thoughts on the macro environment."

I want to build on what Tom said about growing where we want to grow. 
Consumer sentiment is mildly positive as unemployment and gasoline prices have decreased, while real GDP and disposable personal income have moved up slightly. In this environment, foodservice traffic remains about flat, and average check size is up about 2%. QSR chains, which typically drive demand for value-added chicken and Prepared Foods, are showing the most growth. We're well-aligned with those national account customers as well as other growing channels in foodservice. 
At retail, efforts to support our brands are paying off. Our Core 9 volume is up 6% for the 13 weeks ended July 24. And our retail fresh volume continues to grow as consumers shift towards the perimeter of the store. We partner with our customers to grow their businesses, which is why our retailers rely on us as category captains for consumer and category insights. 
Since Tyson and Hillshire came together 2 years ago, we've more than doubled our category captaincies with retailers to a total of 143. Innovation also plays a key role in customer growth, and therefore, ours. Our Vitality Index, which measures the percent of sales from products launched within the previous 3 years, is projected to exceed 21% for foodservice and 13% for retail this fiscal year. Those rates are considered best-in-class and include new products like Hillshire Farm Chicken Apple Sausage for convenience stores, cleaner label, All Natural chicken for foodservice distributors, Jimmy Dean frittatas and stuffed hash browns and Ball Park frozen meats for retail and club stores. 
We're on track to launch Tyson Tastemakers in e-commerce in the fall. And later this month, Tyson naturals, frozen value-added chicken and new varieties of Hillshire Snacking will roll out at retail. 
Our differentiated capabilities in both our scalable supply chain and customer and consumer demand expertise are driving profitable growth in the marketplace. We see this across the key metrics, including the category captaincies and the product Vitality Index that I mentioned earlier. And we expect this to continue as we have the organizational capacity and the resources to drive growth and higher, more stable margins.
Through our strong sales team, we continue to foster strategic customer relationships and leverage our consumer insights, innovation, culinary expertise, service and quality to grow with our customers, develop channels and build brands that will propel us forward. Obviously, we have a lot to be excited about as we finish fiscal '16 and move into fiscal '17, which we expect to be another record year and another year of growth. 
Now I'll turn it over to Dennis, who will report on the quarter and give you some early thoughts on next year."

Q3 was another great quarter as we delivered record earnings due to strong results across each of our segments. The investments we have made in our brands and optimizing mix across the entire portfolio has been evident in the growth of our earnings in 2016. 
Being a growth company, we see tremendous value in our shares. In Q3, we were able to repurchase 6.6 million shares for $425 million. So far, during the fourth quarter of this year, we've repurchased over 5 million shares for $380 million. In total, since August of last year, we have repurchased over 31 million shares for just under $1.8 billion at an average price of about $56 per share, which underscores our commitment to continue returning cash to shareholders. 
Total company return on sales was 8.2%, a record for a third quarter. Operating income was $767 million, representing a 35% increase over adjusted operating income from Q3 a year ago and also a record for the third quarter. 
Our record third quarter EPS of $1.25 represents a 51% increase over $0.83 per share in Q3 last year. On an adjusted basis, Q3 EPS of $1.21 was also a record and a 51% increase over last year as well. It's important to note that on an adjusted basis, our last 12 months EPS is $4.26. 
Our operating cash flow through 3 quarters was $1.9 billion. And we spent $515 million on capital expenditures. This outpaced our depreciation by $55 million as we continue to invest in projects with a focus on delivering high ROIC. Our effective tax rate in the third quarter was 31.8% and 33.9% on an adjusted basis. 
Net debt-to-EBITDA for the past 12 months was 1.7x. Including cash of $197 million, net debt was $6 billion, and total liquidity was $1.3 billion. Net interest expense was $58 million during Q3. For the quarter, average diluted shares outstanding were 388 million. 
Now here are some thoughts on full year fiscal '16 and some early thoughts on fiscal '17. We expect revenues of approximately $37 billion for fiscal '16 and growth in revenues for fiscal '17. Net interest expense should approximate $245 million in fiscal '16 and $225 million in fiscal '17. We currently estimate our adjusted effective tax rate to be around 34.8% for fiscal '16 and 35% for fiscal '17. 
In fiscal '16, CapEx is expected to approximate $725 million. In fiscal '17, we expect CapEx to increase as we continue to focus on projects that create long-term shareholder value. Prior to adjusting for any additional share repurchases subsequent to this call and based on our average share price so far in Q4, we expect our average diluted shares to be around 381 million. 
Our last 12 months adjusted ROIC is 17.5% and is expected to be over 18% by the end of this fiscal year. This is approaching our pre-Hillshire acquisition ROIC of 20.5%, which further illustrates not only the strength of our earnings power but also our commitment to create incremental shareholder value.
We generated a record $2.8 billion in operating cash flows the past 12 months, which we used to invest in our over $730 million in CapEx projects; retire $638 million in notes, which matured in Q2 at a coupon of 6.6%. We also returned approximately $200 million in dividends to our shareholders and repurchased over 31 million shares for just under $1.8 billion, including repurchases so far in Q4. 
So far, in fiscal '16, each segment is operating within or above their normalized ranges. The strong performance of each of our segments gives us confidence to raise our adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $4.40 to $4.50 for fiscal '16. This new range is 40% over our fiscal 2015 adjusted EPS and represents a 4-year CAGR of 22%. And while we stay focused on wrapping up a record year for fiscal 2016, we expect growth in sales, operating income and EPS in fiscal 2017, as we believe the Chicken segment should be over 12% again; Prepared Foods margin should be near the low end of its normalized range of 10% to 12% as we continue to invest heavily in innovation, new product launches and the growth of our brands; our Pork segment should be above its normalized range of 6% to 8%; and the Beef segment should be toward the upper end of its normalized range of 1.5% to 3%. 
In closing, the evolution of our business model to produce strong, stable margins has set us up for another record year. The bar is set high for 2017 as we've come off 40% EPS growth in fiscal '16, but we are excited about the momentum we are generating, which gives us confidence to achieve high single-digit growth for fiscal 2017. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. Tony, we are ready to begin Q&A."

And specifically, what are the key variables in your mind that will help or hurt you with regard to getting back to -- or getting another year of growth or maybe even that 10% next year?"

So if the question is, is it possible to do better than high single digits, let me put it this way. With what I know today, I'm very confident in saying high single-digit EPS growth. The potential is",422,"Yes. Sure, David. Let me take that one. So it's early. So if the question is, is it possible to do better than high single digits, let me put it this way. With what I know today, I'm very confident in saying high single-digit EPS growth. The potential is there for more, so the short answer is yes, we can. Keep in mind, as you mentioned, that is coming off a year of EPS growth over 40%. And as Dennis mentioned in his comments, a 4-year compounded growth rate of 22%. So here's the way we're thinking about how '17 is shaping up. So in Prepared Foods, we're now seeing really solid volume gains across foodservice and retail just like we thought we would when we got our price gaps right, when our merchandising took effect, when our advertising hit. And of course, we're driving really strong innovation, as I mentioned in our comments. So we feel really good about the momentum we have now and taking that through back-to-school into our fiscal '17. Our Chicken business is -- it continues to do great. We continue to value up our mix, as Tom mentioned in his comments. And we continue to drive out inefficiencies from the business. So I think Chicken looks like it's set up to have another good year of very solid growth and great earnings. In Pork, as we look at that segment, we hear a lot. And it's true that there is more capacity coming online. But we see that capacity coming late in calendar '17, probably more affecting our '18 than our fiscal '17. And we do see about 2%, maybe a little bit more, increase in hog numbers out there. So there's going to be plenty of hogs around. And typically, when the supply is good, then that means another good year for us, and that's certainly what we're expecting. Similar story in Beef. Beef supply continues to grow. We think the fed supply will be up about 2% to 3% next year. Fed supply is moving. We think that the increase will be probably felt greater in the north, which probably benefits us a bit. And then on top of all that, David, we've got the ability, great cash flow. And we'll be returning a lot of cash to shareholders in buybacks. So that's why we continue to have a lot of confidence about '17. We feel very good about upper single digits now. And certainly, if there's more there, we're going to get it."

And cattle in the south have been about $1 a 100-weight, so somewhere on the order of $8 ahead cheaper than cattle have been in the north. We think that, that will change over time as some of the smaller feedlots that tend to be in the north closer to the grain begin to increase capacity as the supply of cattle increases.

We've got a very, very strong team in China. And I'm very optimistic about their ability to continue to improve over time. I will say though that the dynamics in that market are very difficult. Corn and soybean meal are significantly higher in China than they are here in the United States. And the wholesale markets, we're still somewhat beholden to the wholesale markets because we haven't made a full switch into value-added at retail yet. So the wholesale markets continue to be weak and quite a bit weaker than we would have thought the wholesale pork market would have indicated. Usually, those 2 markets move in concert. The wholesale pork market has moved up, and chicken has not moved up near as fast as the wholesale pork market has. So very difficult operating environment, but the team's doing a great job strategically turning that business. Now, there's some other stuff in Other, and I'll let Dennis address that."

As it relates to where we start to hit the ceiling, we have different MAP objectives, marketing, advertising, promotional spend by brand and some of them are more ready than others. So Jimmy Dean, as we've called out in the past, is something that we continue to invest highly against, lots of ROI there. And our intent is to get more brands to that same position over time.

And the operations improvements, we don't typically talk a lot about, but it's been really, really impressive what we've done. And we're really thinking about what's the headline there? What have we done that is going to be notable or should be notable is that we feel the Chicken business is now in a spot where it's a pull business versus we're pushing supply on the market. So our pricing mechanisms reflect that. Our move to more value-added products, whether it's par-fried products, fully cooked, we're building capacity against those because we continue to see tremendous demand. The buy-versus-grow strategy, we've talked a lot about. And then just staying on top of all those things that give us the best supply base that can make sure our customers are served excellently with great service is really what we're about.

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. 
We continue to build momentum. Our differentiated business model and our strong performance across all segments are contributing to higher, more stable margins. We delivered record third quarter earnings, operating income and return on sales, and as a result, we're raising fiscal 2016 adjusted earnings guidance to $4.40 to $4.50 a share. 
Synergies for the quarter were $150 million with $63 million incremental over Q3 of '15. Year-to-date, synergies total $415 million with $191 million incremental versus the same period last year and will exceed the $500 million target as planned. We bought back 6.6 million shares in Q3 and another 5.4 million so far in Q4, bringing our total shares repurchased to just over 31 million during the past 12 months.
Q3 was an outstanding quarter in what will be a record year. And now Tom Hayes, who's on his first earnings call as our new President, will report on our operating segments."

I'm really excited to be on the call and looking forward to a lot of interaction -- more interaction with our investors and analysts and in addition to leading our amazing team. As Donnie said, I'l",684,"Great. Good morning, everybody, and thanks a lot, Donnie. I'm really excited to be on the call and looking forward to a lot of interaction -- more interaction with our investors and analysts and in addition to leading our amazing team. As Donnie said, I'll take you through the segments and provide color around the results as well as some initial thoughts on 2017. 
First, let's look at the Prepared Foods segment. Operating income in the third quarter was $197 million, with a 10.9% operating margin. Volume compared to Q3 last year was up 1.9%, and sales dollars were virtually flat. The lower average selling price resulted from decreased raw material costs and successful pricing strategies to drive volume. We're particularly pleased with the volume increases in Ball Park hotdogs, Hillshire Farm Smoked Sausage and lunchmeat. 
In Q3, we captured $116 million in synergies in the Prepared Foods segment with $37 million incremental to third quarter last year. As we look towards 2017, we expect Prepared Foods to remain at the lower end of the 10% to 12% operating margin range as we continue to invest heavily in innovation, new product launches and supporting the growth of our leading brands. 
Turning to the Chicken segment. Chicken produced operating income of $380 million with a 13.9% return on sales. The important call-out in chicken is that we've continued to improve our product mix. We've grown value-added sales by 5% and reduced commodity sales by 10%, which is why the average selling price was up 40 basis points in the quarter, where our volume was down 90 basis points versus the same quarter last year. We're being really strategic about our growth. We're growing where we want to grow. And it's reflected in the record return on sales. 
We've restructured our Chicken business to produce higher, more stable margins over time. And as a quick reminder, here's how we've done this. First, we've optimized our cost structure by investing in our operations with good ROIC projects and by taking out more than $1 billion of inefficiencies from our systems. Second, we've diversified our pricing mechanisms. Third, we've upgraded our mix to more value-added branded products to meet demand from our retail and foodservice customers. Fourth, we've implemented the buy-versus-grow strategy. And finally, we're providing industry-leading quality and customer service day in and day out. We expect to finish the fiscal year with an operating margin of more than 12% in the Chicken segment. And we think fiscal 2017 will be similar. 
Turning to the Beef segment. Operating income was $91 million, with a 2.4% return on sales compared to a $7 million loss in the third quarter last year. Volume was up 2.9% as more cattle were available to process, while the average selling price declined 14.6%. Although we expect fed cattle supplies to increase 2% to 3% in fiscal 2017, domestic availability should increase only slightly due to reduced imports and some export demand improvement. 
Finally, in the Pork segment, we had another great quarter with $122 million in operating income and a 9.6% return on sales. This compares to $64 million and a 5.3% return in Q3 of '15. 
Despite increased production, volume was down 1.7% due to reduced inventories as well as product mix changes. The average selling price was up 7.2%. Our Pork segment should finish fiscal 2016 with an operating margin above 10%. And in 2017, it should be above its 6% to 8% normalized range. 
So overall, we expect supplies of chicken, beef and pork to be up 2% to 3% next year. However, domestic demand for protein has been strong. We expect it to continue as prices decline. We'll stay focused on growing sales volume and shifting our mix to more value-added products. And we have the unique ability to access multiple channels to meet consumer and customer demand wherever food is sold. This allows us to drive growth and remain a preferred provider with leading brands. 
I'm going to turn it back over to Donnie. He's going to expand and give us his thoughts on the macro environment."

I want to build on what Tom said about growing where we want to grow. 
Consumer sentiment is mildly positive as unemployment and gasoline prices have decreased, while real GDP and disposable personal income have moved up slightly. In this environment, foodservice traffic remains about flat, and average check size is up about 2%. QSR chains, which typically drive demand for value-added chicken and Prepared Foods, are showing the most growth. We're well-aligned with those national account customers as well as other growing channels in foodservice. 
At retail, efforts to support our brands are paying off. Our Core 9 volume is up 6% for the 13 weeks ended July 24. And our retail fresh volume continues to grow as consumers shift towards the perimeter of the store. We partner with our customers to grow their businesses, which is why our retailers rely on us as category captains for consumer and category insights. 
Since Tyson and Hillshire came together 2 years ago, we've more than doubled our category captaincies with retailers to a total of 143. Innovation also plays a key role in customer growth, and therefore, ours. Our Vitality Index, which measures the percent of sales from products launched within the previous 3 years, is projected to exceed 21% for foodservice and 13% for retail this fiscal year. Those rates are considered best-in-class and include new products like Hillshire Farm Chicken Apple Sausage for convenience stores, cleaner label, All Natural chicken for foodservice distributors, Jimmy Dean frittatas and stuffed hash browns and Ball Park frozen meats for retail and club stores. 
We're on track to launch Tyson Tastemakers in e-commerce in the fall. And later this month, Tyson naturals, frozen value-added chicken and new varieties of Hillshire Snacking will roll out at retail. 
Our differentiated capabilities in both our scalable supply chain and customer and consumer demand expertise are driving profitable growth in the marketplace. We see this across the key metrics, including the category captaincies and the product Vitality Index that I mentioned earlier. And we expect this to continue as we have the organizational capacity and the resources to drive growth and higher, more stable margins.
Through our strong sales team, we continue to foster strategic customer relationships and leverage our consumer insights, innovation, culinary expertise, service and quality to grow with our customers, develop channels and build brands that will propel us forward. Obviously, we have a lot to be excited about as we finish fiscal '16 and move into fiscal '17, which we expect to be another record year and another year of growth. 
Now I'll turn it over to Dennis, who will report on the quarter and give you some early thoughts on next year."

Q3 was another great quarter as we delivered record earnings due to strong results across each of our segments. The investments we have made in our brands and optimizing mix across the entire portfolio has been evident in the growth of our earnings in 2016. 
Being a growth company, we see tremendous value in our shares. In Q3, we were able to repurchase 6.6 million shares for $425 million. So far, during the fourth quarter of this year, we've repurchased over 5 million shares for $380 million. In total, since August of last year, we have repurchased over 31 million shares for just under $1.8 billion at an average price of about $56 per share, which underscores our commitment to continue returning cash to shareholders. 
Total company return on sales was 8.2%, a record for a third quarter. Operating income was $767 million, representing a 35% increase over adjusted operating income from Q3 a year ago and also a record for the third quarter. 
Our record third quarter EPS of $1.25 represents a 51% increase over $0.83 per share in Q3 last year. On an adjusted basis, Q3 EPS of $1.21 was also a record and a 51% increase over last year as well. It's important to note that on an adjusted basis, our last 12 months EPS is $4.26. 
Our operating cash flow through 3 quarters was $1.9 billion. And we spent $515 million on capital expenditures. This outpaced our depreciation by $55 million as we continue to invest in projects with a focus on delivering high ROIC. Our effective tax rate in the third quarter was 31.8% and 33.9% on an adjusted basis. 
Net debt-to-EBITDA for the past 12 months was 1.7x. Including cash of $197 million, net debt was $6 billion, and total liquidity was $1.3 billion. Net interest expense was $58 million during Q3. For the quarter, average diluted shares outstanding were 388 million. 
Now here are some thoughts on full year fiscal '16 and some early thoughts on fiscal '17. We expect revenues of approximately $37 billion for fiscal '16 and growth in revenues for fiscal '17. Net interest expense should approximate $245 million in fiscal '16 and $225 million in fiscal '17. We currently estimate our adjusted effective tax rate to be around 34.8% for fiscal '16 and 35% for fiscal '17. 
In fiscal '16, CapEx is expected to approximate $725 million. In fiscal '17, we expect CapEx to increase as we continue to focus on projects that create long-term shareholder value. Prior to adjusting for any additional share repurchases subsequent to this call and based on our average share price so far in Q4, we expect our average diluted shares to be around 381 million. 
Our last 12 months adjusted ROIC is 17.5% and is expected to be over 18% by the end of this fiscal year. This is approaching our pre-Hillshire acquisition ROIC of 20.5%, which further illustrates not only the strength of our earnings power but also our commitment to create incremental shareholder value.
We generated a record $2.8 billion in operating cash flows the past 12 months, which we used to invest in our over $730 million in CapEx projects; retire $638 million in notes, which matured in Q2 at a coupon of 6.6%. We also returned approximately $200 million in dividends to our shareholders and repurchased over 31 million shares for just under $1.8 billion, including repurchases so far in Q4. 
So far, in fiscal '16, each segment is operating within or above their normalized ranges. The strong performance of each of our segments gives us confidence to raise our adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $4.40 to $4.50 for fiscal '16. This new range is 40% over our fiscal 2015 adjusted EPS and represents a 4-year CAGR of 22%. And while we stay focused on wrapping up a record year for fiscal 2016, we expect growth in sales, operating income and EPS in fiscal 2017, as we believe the Chicken segment should be over 12% again; Prepared Foods margin should be near the low end of its normalized range of 10% to 12% as we continue to invest heavily in innovation, new product launches and the growth of our brands; our Pork segment should be above its normalized range of 6% to 8%; and the Beef segment should be toward the upper end of its normalized range of 1.5% to 3%. 
In closing, the evolution of our business model to produce strong, stable margins has set us up for another record year. The bar is set high for 2017 as we've come off 40% EPS growth in fiscal '16, but we are excited about the momentum we are generating, which gives us confidence to achieve high single-digit growth for fiscal 2017. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. Tony, we are ready to begin Q&A."

With what I know today, I'm very confident in saying high single-digit EPS growth. The potential is there for more, so the short answer is yes, we can. Keep in mind, as you mentioned, that is coming off a year of EPS growth over 40%. And as Dennis mentioned in his comments, a 4-year compounded growth rate of 22%. So here's the way we're thinking about how '17 is shaping up. So in Prepared Foods, we're now seeing really solid volume gains across foodservice and retail just like we thought we would when we got our price gaps right, when our merchandising took effect, when our advertising hit. And of course, we're driving really strong innovation, as I mentioned in our comments. So we feel really good about the momentum we have now and taking that through back-to-school into our fiscal '17. Our Chicken business is -- it continues to do great. We continue to value up our mix, as Tom mentioned in his comments. And we continue to drive out inefficiencies from the business. So I think Chicken looks like it's set up to have another good year of very solid growth and great earnings. In Pork, as we look at that segment, we hear a lot. And it's true that there is more capacity coming online. But we see that capacity coming late in calendar '17, probably more affecting our '18 than our fiscal '17. And we do see about 2%, maybe a little bit more, increase in hog numbers out there. So there's going to be plenty of hogs around. And typically, when the supply is good, then that means another good year for us, and that's certainly what we're expecting. Similar story in Beef. Beef supply continues to grow. We think the fed supply will be up about 2% to 3% next year. Fed supply is moving. We think that the increase will be probably felt greater in the north, which probably benefits us a bit. And then on top of all that, David, we've got the ability, great cash flow. And we'll be returning a lot of cash to shareholders in buybacks. So that's why we continue to have a lot of confidence about '17. We feel very good about upper single digits now. And certainly, if there's more there, we're going to get it."

And we actually have been doing great internalizing more of those leg quarters for our own use on first-order value-added products. So as Donnie said, the pricing mechanism, that's a huge driver for us. We've been doing a lot of work on that. And so continuing to drive value-added should give you the confidence. We'll continue to talk about that. You'll see it in the numbers. It turns into the right margins. We're focused on volume and margin and executing buy versus grow and continuing to focus on innovation, value-added service, quality. That's the answer, but that's where we're going."

And then with the synergies that you should have incrementally in '17, can you scope kind of -- it seems like a really big step-up in new product innovation and marketing spend there, but help scope some of the spending bridge for '17 in Prepared Foods."

I think '17 is setting up to be a year where there's going to be a lot of protein available. We want to make sure we have the right shelf position. And innovation, as you called out, is going to be significant. So for the quarter, I'd say there's a bit of noise, but it's really investment we put in the business and showing the volume results.

We don't really use -- we've said back years ago; we don't really use the freezer as a customer. And we don't. We have a plan for physical hedges on bellies. We continue to execute that plan. And then the raw material favorability will work its way in through the pricing over time. Foodservice reacts a little faster than certainly the retail does. But ultimately, that raw material cost will find its way back to the customer. So yes, echo the volatility, we're weathering it just fine. We're getting into a better demand period certainly than what we've come through. So we feel good about our Pork business on through '16 and then another really, really solid year in '17."

There's another thing that, I think, helps us with our outlook or feel more and more positive about our outlook on Beef. And that is for continued growth of our Case Ready offerings. Coming up in, I believe, it's October, there is a new regulation on retailers around having to keep up with where the raw material comes from as they grind ground beef back of house. And I think that portends a bright future for our Case Ready grinds business. We've certainly been in lots of conversations. And we have the capability to do a lot more of that business than we're doing today. So that could also help improve our beef margins over time.

But there's another factor, I think, that needs to be weighed in. If you look at the regional disparities in, let's call it, the southern region of cattle procurement and the northern region, we way over-index in terms of our slaughter capacity in the north. And cattle in the south have been about $1 a 100-weight, so somewhere on the order of $8 ahead cheaper than cattle have been in the north. We think that, that will change over time as some of the smaller feedlots that tend to be in the north closer to the grain begin to increase capacity as the supply of cattle increases. So we think that favors us going forward, certainly, from where we have been. So I think those are the really the 2 biggest factors. Our plants are running great, our efficiencies. All the stuff that Steve and his great group are doing to manage the business are in good shape. Those environmental factors are what they are. And we'll continue to manage them over time."

There's a lot of great things that are already out there in the marketplace, Jimmy Dean hash browns, Jimmy Dean frittatas, a new Hillshire Snacking platform. Which Hillshire Snacking is going very well, by the way. So it's going to be definitely on the back of innovation. There is no question about that. And applying that to the Chicken segment, your question in particular, we see there's going to be plenty of opportunity for us to drive growth in areas that, right now, are -- there hasn't been a lot of innovation. You think of the fresh tray packed chicken. It's been relatively static for years and years, and we like that opportunity for us to continue to think about how it can be different. And so I would expect you to expect that our innovation efforts against the entire portfolio of Chicken and Prepared Foods will deliver some significant benefits.

Corn and soybean meal are significantly higher in China than they are here in the United States. And the wholesale markets, we're still somewhat beholden to the wholesale markets because we haven't made a full switch into value-added at retail yet.

The buy-versus-grow strategy, we've talked a lot about. And then just staying on top of all those things that give us the best supply base that can make sure our customers are served excellently with great service is really what we're about. I don't know if that's satisfying you or not, but it's really -- it's those 5 things we talked about in combination. I can't point to any one that's going to be the silver bullet or the panacea for somebody that competes with us to get right, but that's what we're proud of and that's what we continue to stay focused on."

And I don't mean to oversimplify, but if we were to isolate the margins you were able to deliver from growing and selling chicken from the margins on your buying platform, under the current conditions, is it reasonable to assume that the buy-versus-grow model is delivering a margin premium somewhere around 300, 400 bps just based on your change in guidance? And what's implicit in the fiscal '17 guidance? Is that level of premium achievable in the market only when there's a significant excess supply of breast meat?"

Before we get into our earnings discussion, I'd like to comment on this morning's other announcement. As you may have heard, Tom Hayes will be succeeding me as CEO effective at calendar year-end. 
The board and I agree that now is the excellent time to make this transition. The company's performing exceptionally well and realizing significant growth and shareholder returns through our hybrid strategy of branded prepared foods and fresh meats. Simply put, I believe the company has a bright future and that Tom is the right leader for this next phase of our development. We've worked hard to create a strong platform that will take Tyson into the future and we have an impressive pipeline of talented management to help us do that. We're leveraging scale, developing our brands and building value for shareholders. 
Since his promotion to President earlier this year, Tom has reminded me, the board and the rest of the management team on a daily basis exactly why we hold him in such high regard. He's a capable leader, a strategic thinker and a team player who's ready to build on what we've accomplished to date and drive this company forward. He has the skills to deliver on our strategic goals and complete the transition toward our hybrid model. I've committed to him I will remain available as consultant for the next 3 years. 
As you can imagine, it's a time of mixed emotions for me. I joined Tyson Foods 36 years ago and has spent my entire professional life here. In return, I've been given opportunities I could never have imagined. At Tyson, I have worked alongside some of the best, most impressive people you could ever hope to meet. And together, we worked tirelessly to build a great company. I'd like to thank both the board and the Tyson family for their encouragement and support, without which I could have not succeeded. More than just delivering good financial results, we've been able to make a positive difference in people's lives. I'm thankful for the 7 years I had the opportunity to serve Tyson as its CEO. And I'm excited about its future and confident that Tom is the right leader for the next chapter. 
And with that, let's now turn to the quarter. Fiscal 2016 was our fourth consecutive year of record results with record operating income, operating margin, adjusted EPS, cash flow, Pork segment margins and Prepared Foods segment margins. Adjusted EPS grew 39% versus the prior year. Using the midpoint of our fiscal 2017 guidance of $4.70 to $4.85, the projected EPS 5-year CAGR would be 19%, which is outstanding. 
Fourth quarter results were slightly below our internal expectations, impacted largely by $35 million or $0.06 a share in mark-to-market and lower cost of market accounting treatments, primarily in Beef and Pork, a production issue in Prepared Foods and one-time factors in Chicken that Tom will go into in more detail shortly. 
Synergies for the fourth quarter were $165 million with $67 million incremental over Q4 of last year. Synergies for the year were $580 million with $258 million incremental to last year and well exceeding our $500 million target. We currently expect synergies of approximately $675 million in fiscal 2017, below our previous estimate of $700 million. While we still expect to achieve at least $700 million in total, due to the timing of some projects, we now expect some of the synergies to fall into fiscal '18. 
We bought back 8.3 million shares of stock for $600 million in Q4, excluding repurchases to offset dilution from equity compensation. For the fiscal year, share repurchases totaled 28.2 million for $1.7 billion. We were able to repurchase this level due to our record operating cash flows of more than $2.7 billion. 
2016 was a great year. Beyond setting records, we made tremendous progress, leveraging the combined strength of the Tyson team. And we're well positioned for even more success in fiscal '17. 
Now let's go to Tom for a report on our operating segments."
190636,310174461,1089891,"Tyson Foods, Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 21, 2016",2016-11-21,"Earnings Calls","Tyson Foods, Inc.","Executives","Thanks a lot, Donnie. Let's begin with the Prepared Foods segment. Operating income in the fourth quarter was $133 million with a 7.2% operating margin. Average price was down 3.9%, primarily reflecting the pass-through of overall lower raw material costs",1783,"Thanks a lot, Donnie. Let's begin with the Prepared Foods segment. Operating income in the fourth quarter was $133 million with a 7.2% operating margin. Average price was down 3.9%, primarily reflecting the pass-through of overall lower raw material costs. Adjusting for the additional week in 2015, volume compared to Q4 last year was up 2.6%. Margin in the Prepared Foods segment were lower year-over-year primarily due to a sharp increase in pork and raw material costs in Q4 that were not passed through to customers within the quarter and increased marketing spending. 
In the foodservice portion of Prepared Foods in Q4, we had strong results in our bakery business but softer-than-expected results in prepared meats. As a part of our efforts to improve our production network, we closed a plant and transferred production to newer facilities. Unfortunately, this transition wasn't seamless, causing us to incur overtime in our operations and higher distribution costs in an attempt to satisfy our customers' needs. We've since taken steps to improve production efficiency and are building additional network capacity for long-term growth. 
Despite these challenges, Prepared Foods had a record year and delivered planned synergies. Synergies for the segment were $119 million for the quarter and $38 million incremental to Q4 last year. For the full year, Prepared Foods synergies were $441 million with $156 million incremental to fiscal 2015. For the fiscal year, Prepared Foods operating income was $734 million with a record 10% margin. Pricing was down 3.4% on lower raw materials. Adjusted volume was down 1% for the year, primarily due to the rationalization of some unprofitable ingredient meat SKUs. We're growing volume where we want to grow by focusing on strategic brands and categories to increase operating income over time. 
We supported our brand equities across Prepared Foods through marketing, advertising and promotional spending to grow volume and secure our position on the shelves of retailers and restaurants. For example, we increased our support behind the Jimmy Dean frozen breakfast franchise and Hillshire Farm lunchmeat. And in our fourth quarter, volume was up 9% and 28%, respectively. We also grew our share by 1.5 points in the Frozen Protein Breakfast category and by 2.3 points in lunchmeat. We expect beef and pork raw material to be deflationary to input cost in addition to pricing in 2017. We'll continue to invest in innovation, new product launches and MAP to grow our brands. We're expecting margins in 2017 to be similar to those in 2016 with solid volume growth that outperforms the categories where we compete. 
In the Chicken segment for the fourth quarter, operating income was $220 million with a 7.8% operating margin. Adjusted volume was down 3.2% due to a planned temporary decrease in production. And average price was up 3.5% as we focused on selling higher-margin products. There were 3 factors leading to lower-than-expected results in the fourth quarter in Chicken. 
First, our production forecasts are based on consumer demand. And through our sales and operations planning process, we received indications of lower demand in July and August. As our business model dictates, we reduced production in response to softening consumer demand. Secondly, we absorbed a sharp spike in soybean milk input costs within the quarter that affected margins in the short term. And third, having completed the restaging of the Tyson brand, we turned MAP back on to grow points of distribution, heading into the new fiscal year. As a result, our Tyson brand frozen and value-added chicken volume was up 6% in Q4 of 2016 and is gaining momentum, portending very strong Chicken segment volume in our first quarter of 2017. 
Chicken segment results for the year were outstanding. With an 11.9% operating margin, we were just shy of last year's record return. Operating income was $1.3 billion. Adjusted volume was down 0.7% due to the reduced demand in the fourth quarter that I just spoke to. Average pricing was down for the year by 1.5% as some input cost deflation was passed on to the customers. 
The USDA is now projecting for chicken supply to be in the U.S. to increase by 2% in 2017. And our input costs should be flat. We'll continue growing where we want to grow by selling more Tyson-branded value-added chicken. We expect the returns for the Chicken segment to be at or above the upper end of our normalized range of 9% to 11% again in fiscal 2017. 
Moving on to the Beef segment. Operating income was $139 million in Q4 with a 4% operating margin. Adjusted volume was down slightly by 0.3% while average sales price declined 14.9%, reflecting reduced cattle costs. For the fiscal year, operating income was $347 million with a 2.4% operating margin. Adjusted volume was up slightly by 0.8% while pricing declined 14.9%, again on lower cattle costs. Following a rocky start to the year, the Beef segment finished strong with favorable pricing environment continuing into our Q1. We're expecting our Beef margin to be at the upper end of its normalized range of 1.5% to 3% in fiscal '17, reflecting the favorable environment that we expect to continue for some time. 
I'll wrap up the segment performance by recapping the Pork segment results. Operating income was $108 million with an 8.7% operating margin. Adjusted volume was up slightly at 0.4% while average pricing was up 1% in the quarter. For the year, operating income was $528 million with a record 10.8% margin. Excluding the additional week in fiscal 2015 and the divestiture of our Heinold business in Q1 of last year, Pork volume was up 1.2% and average price was down 4.4%, reflecting lower hog costs. 
In fiscal 2017, we expect the favorable operating environment to continue and are estimating operating margin of at least 10% for the year. Currently, the USDA is projecting supplies of our protein categories to be up 2% to 3% next year with moderate export growth. Domestic demand for protein has been strong. And we expect it will continue in a deflationary environment. And we're very well positioned across all proteins and customer channels to respond to the changing demands of consumers. 
We're making significant investments in consumer insights, innovation, our brands, our customer relationships, our facilities and our people. In addition to $1 billion in CapEx in '17, we're investing on improving safety, animal well-being, warehousing and distribution and attracting and retaining talent throughout the organization. These investments should improve costs and turnover as well as continue to drive long-term sustainable growth. 
While protein demand overall is strong and growing, we're seeing a shift in how consumers spend, specifically in retail. When beef prices decline, more consumers buy beef as relative price premium versus other forms of protein narrows. This interaction is especially pronounced in the dynamic between ground beef and hot dogs. While the hot dog category overall was down in the 13 weeks ended October 2, we grew Ball Park volume by 11% and increased volume of share by 2.5 points. This is a great example of the power of a strong, leading brand like Ball Park and the consumer loyalty and strong customer support it garners. 
Overall, Tyson Foods is performing very well at retail. In the 13-week period roughly corresponding with our fourth quarter, our Core 9 product lines grew dollar share in all 9 categories and grew volume share in 8 of 9 categories. In total, we grew volume 9.6%, 8 points ahead of total food and beverage. If you take a look at the slides that we posted online, you'll see that both the Core 9 and total Tyson at retail are outpacing growth among the top 10 branded food-only companies in both sales and volume dollars. 
In sales volume, Tyson is only 1 of 3 companies that posted positive volume growth. In sales dollars, we are the only company to show positive growth with a 4.7% in the Core 9 and 2.1% overall. And that's in a deflationary protein pricing environment. I want to extend my congratulations to Andy Callahan and the entire retail package brands team for their outstanding performance. 
Turning to the foodservice channel. Traffic remains roughly flat and growth is driven by average check size, which is up about 2%. That was the case in calendar year 2015 and thus far in 2016 and is expected to continue through 2017. And despite a lackluster environment, Tyson Foods is doing well at foodservice. 
Our insights team, using data provided by NPD, has developed analytic tools that give us a better look in the broad line distribution sector within foodservice. Broad line distribution has long been an important channel to us. But now we're getting a better perspective on the role we play, the importance of value-added chickens and the strength of the Tyson brand. For the 52 weeks ended in July, the most recent data available, our volume grew 3.9%, more than double the category growth rate. By far, Tyson is the largest brand with a 33% share and growing. The next closest competitor is private label with a 20% share. 
And it's worth noting, we're a substantial producer of private label value-added chicken for our distributor customers. We look forward to being able to give you more and more insight into our foodservice business as our insights team continues to build out more analytic tools, which is a great example of the strength of our combined capabilities across the company. 
I continue to be encouraged by the pace of new product innovation as we extend our brands into adjacencies. Sales from new products launched in the previous 3 years has resulted in a Vitality Index of 14% in retail and 21% in foodservice. When we think about innovation, it's not only about new products. It really starts to understand how people shop and how shopper behavior opens up new platforms for innovation. 
Partnering with our customers to leverage the opportunities of the e-commerce space is a great example of this. We began selling Tyson Tastemaker meal kits through e-commerce in September. While it's still early, we're very encouraged by the initial consumer acceptance and feedback. This platform combines our innovation capabilities, supply chain at scale and leading brands in a way no other food company can. Expect to hear more in 2017 as we extend this platform into multiple formats in e-commerce and traditional retail. 
2016 was a great year. But more importantly, we laid the foundation for 2017 and beyond. We're capitalizing on our momentum and taking a systematic approach to success. 
Now I'm going to turn it over to Dennis, who will report on the fourth quarter and the year as well as our expectations for fiscal 2017."
190636,310174461,1089891,"Tyson Foods, Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 21, 2016",2016-11-21,"Earnings Calls","Tyson Foods, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Fiscal '16 was our fourth consecutive year of record earnings as we continue to demonstrate the power of our diversified business model, producing strong, stable margins. We are investing our cash flows back into o",765,"Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Fiscal '16 was our fourth consecutive year of record earnings as we continue to demonstrate the power of our diversified business model, producing strong, stable margins. We are investing our cash flows back into our businesses as we focus on long-term sustainable growth. 
Total company return on sales was a record 7.7% for fiscal '16. Operating income was also a record at $2.8 billion, representing a 26% increase over adjusted operating income a year ago. On an adjusted basis, this represents our fourth consecutive year of growth in operating income and return on sales. Our record adjusted EPS of $4.39 represents a 39% increase over $3.15 per share last year. Our operating cash flow was a record $2.7 billion. And we have invested $695 million in capital expenditures. This outpaced our depreciation by $78 million as we continue to invest in projects with a focus on delivering high ROIC. 
We also used our record cash flow in fiscal '16 to return cash to shareholders and to retire debt. We increased the dividend for fiscal '16 by 50% from the prior year. We also repurchased 28.2 million shares for $1.7 billion during the year. Combined, we returned over $1.9 billion to shareholders in share repurchases and dividends. And that's after we retired to some high-coupon debt during the year, which further strengthened our balance sheet. 
In fiscal '16, our effective tax rate was 31.8% and on an adjusted basis was 33.8%. Net debt-to-EBITDA for the past 12 months was 1.7x. Including cash of $349 million, net debt was $5.9 billion and total liquidity was $1.3 billion. Net interest expense was $57 million during the fourth quarter and $243 million during fiscal 2016. For the quarter, average diluted shares outstanding were 381 million. ROIC was 18.1% and is approaching the pre-Hillshire acquisition level of 20.5%, which illustrates the strength and stability of our earnings as well as our commitment to creating incremental shareholder value. 
Now looking forward, here are some thoughts on fiscal '17. We expect similar revenues as we grow volume across each segment, offset by the impact of lower beef prices. Net interest expense should approximate $225 million. We currently estimate our effective tax rate to be around 35%. CapEx is expected to approximate $1 billion as we focus on capacity expansion and operational improvements that create long-term shareholder value. Prior to adjusting for any additional share repurchases subsequent to this call and based on our average share price so far in Q1, we expect our average diluted shares to be around 376 million. 
This morning, we reported our Board of Directors again increased our regular quarterly dividend by another 50% from $0.15 to $0.225 per share on our Class A common stock payable on December 15. This increase brings our dividend to $0.90 per share annually for Class A shares from $0.60. As we stated last year, we expect to increase future dividends for Class A shares by at least $0.10 per share annually. This increase and our commitment to steady future dividend increases demonstrates our confidence in the enduring strength and stability of our cash-generation capabilities. 
We have a tremendous amount of momentum going into fiscal '17 as we come off a year of 39% EPS growth. Our fiscal first quarter in '17 is off to a phenomenal start, which gives us confidence in achieving annual adjusted EPS growth of 7% to 10% to a range of $4.70 to $4.85 per share. This new guidance range represents a 5-year adjusted compounded annual growth rate of at least 19%. While we are pleased with the growth we have achieved, we're excited about the significant increase in investments in fiscal '17 that will drive growth of the future. In addition to $1 billion in CapEx, we are planning heavy investments, as Tom mentioned previously, while we continue to grow organically. 
Additionally, in fiscal '17, we expect to return even more cash to shareholders by our announced increased dividend and additional share repurchases. We see compelling value in our shares. And so far in the first quarter of fiscal '17, we've repurchased another 3.4 million shares for $240 million. While some of our investments will not immediately fall to the bottom line, we are creating a sustainable blueprint for success that will allow us to grow in a responsible way for the future. 
In closing, we take a long-term view toward investing in our people, our brands and our facilities, which will drive value and generate attractive shareholder returns. That concludes our prepared remarks. Denise, we're ready to begin Q&A."

But I think we're in a great shape, particularly in Beef and Pork, which I think shouldn't surprise you. As it relates to the Georgia Dock, this is what we talked about before several times is that we really don't use it that much. It's about 4%, maybe a little less our total Chicken volume sales that are priced off the Georgia dock. We have talked several times that we use a lot of different pricing mechanisms.

And then in addition to that, I'd say there's a lot of discussion which we've also spoken about this. It's less about price than it is about everything else we offer as a company.

We had a good S&OP process. We think it probably goodness we ever experience. And having those signals allows us to modify production in advance of seeing that now. As Dennis had said and talked about, we've seen that come back in the first quarter here. So the volume was off, and it now has come back. And the other thing that we want to make sure that we do is we have lower inventories. We want to make sure that we don't run into a seasonal high inventories, and that certainly helped us. We're selling through the inventory to a large degree in Q1. So there was the right thing to certainly pull back in production. As it relates to the trim pricing, so if you look at 72s and 42s trim for the Prepared Foods segment, and particularly as it relates to hotdogs and grain materials for sausage and so forth, there's a sharp spike and then I dropped off dramatically. As the trim is dropping off, we have it sit for us because crops are going down our prices up with a shoot up in any given period, the slope of the chains is going to cost us, particularly on the foodservice business for formula price that have our raw material costs higher, and our formula price is lagging by about 30 days. So that was a short-term impact. We're through that, but that's the situation there."

Before we get into our earnings discussion, I'd like to comment on this morning's other announcement. As you may have heard, Tom Hayes will be succeeding me as CEO effective at calendar year-end. 
The board and I agree that now is the excellent time to make this transition. The company's performing exceptionally well and realizing significant growth and shareholder returns through our hybrid strategy of branded prepared foods and fresh meats. Simply put, I believe the company has a bright future and that Tom is the right leader for this next phase of our development. We've worked hard to create a strong platform that will take Tyson into the future and we have an impressive pipeline of talented management to help us do that. We're leveraging scale, developing our brands and building value for shareholders. 
Since his promotion to President earlier this year, Tom has reminded me, the board and the rest of the management team on a daily basis exactly why we hold him in such high regard. He's a capable leader, a strategic thinker and a team player who's ready to build on what we've accomplished to date and drive this company forward. He has the skills to deliver on our strategic goals and complete the transition toward our hybrid model. I've committed to him I will remain available as consultant for the next 3 years. 
As you can imagine, it's a time of mixed emotions for me. I joined Tyson Foods 36 years ago and has spent my entire professional life here. In return, I've been given opportunities I could never have imagined. At Tyson, I have worked alongside some of the best, most impressive people you could ever hope to meet. And together, we worked tirelessly to build a great company. I'd like to thank both the board and the Tyson family for their encouragement and support, without which I could have not succeeded. More than just delivering good financial results, we've been able to make a positive difference in people's lives. I'm thankful for the 7 years I had the opportunity to serve Tyson as its CEO. And I'm excited about its future and confident that Tom is the right leader for the next chapter. 
And with that, let's now turn to the quarter. Fiscal 2016 was our fourth consecutive year of record results with record operating income, operating margin, adjusted EPS, cash flow, Pork segment margins and Prepared Foods segment margins. Adjusted EPS grew 39% versus the prior year. Using the midpoint of our fiscal 2017 guidance of $4.70 to $4.85, the projected EPS 5-year CAGR would be 19%, which is outstanding. 
Fourth quarter results were slightly below our internal expectations, impacted largely by $35 million or $0.06 a share in mark-to-market and lower cost of market accounting treatments, primarily in Beef and Pork, a production issue in Prepared Foods and one-time factors in Chicken that Tom will go into in more detail shortly. 
Synergies for the fourth quarter were $165 million with $67 million incremental over Q4 of last year. Synergies for the year were $580 million with $258 million incremental to last year and well exceeding our $500 million target. We currently expect synergies of approximately $675 million in fiscal 2017, below our previous estimate of $700 million. While we still expect to achieve at least $700 million in total, due to the timing of some projects, we now expect some of the synergies to fall into fiscal '18. 
We bought back 8.3 million shares of stock for $600 million in Q4, excluding repurchases to offset dilution from equity compensation. For the fiscal year, share repurchases totaled 28.2 million for $1.7 billion. We were able to repurchase this level due to our record operating cash flows of more than $2.7 billion. 
2016 was a great year. Beyond setting records, we made tremendous progress, leveraging the combined strength of the Tyson team. And we're well positioned for even more success in fiscal '17. 
Now let's go to Tom for a report on our operating segments."
190636,310174461,1089952,"Tyson Foods, Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 21, 2016",2016-11-21,"Earnings Calls","Tyson Foods, Inc.","Executives","Thanks a lot, Donnie. Let's begin with the Prepared Foods segment. Operating income in the fourth quarter was $133 million with a 7.2% operating margin. Average price was down 3.9%, primarily reflecting the pass-through of overall lower raw material costs",1783,"Thanks a lot, Donnie. Let's begin with the Prepared Foods segment. Operating income in the fourth quarter was $133 million with a 7.2% operating margin. Average price was down 3.9%, primarily reflecting the pass-through of overall lower raw material costs. Adjusting for the additional week in 2015, volume compared to Q4 last year was up 2.6%. Margin in the Prepared Foods segment were lower year-over-year primarily due to a sharp increase in pork and raw material costs in Q4 that were not passed through to customers within the quarter and increased marketing spending. 
In the foodservice portion of Prepared Foods in Q4, we had strong results in our bakery business but softer-than-expected results in prepared meats. As a part of our efforts to improve our production network, we closed a plant and transferred production to newer facilities. Unfortunately, this transition wasn't seamless, causing us to incur overtime in our operations and higher distribution costs in an attempt to satisfy our customers' needs. We've since taken steps to improve production efficiency and are building additional network capacity for long-term growth. 
Despite these challenges, Prepared Foods had a record year and delivered planned synergies. Synergies for the segment were $119 million for the quarter and $38 million incremental to Q4 last year. For the full year, Prepared Foods synergies were $441 million with $156 million incremental to fiscal 2015. For the fiscal year, Prepared Foods operating income was $734 million with a record 10% margin. Pricing was down 3.4% on lower raw materials. Adjusted volume was down 1% for the year, primarily due to the rationalization of some unprofitable ingredient meat SKUs. We're growing volume where we want to grow by focusing on strategic brands and categories to increase operating income over time. 
We supported our brand equities across Prepared Foods through marketing, advertising and promotional spending to grow volume and secure our position on the shelves of retailers and restaurants. For example, we increased our support behind the Jimmy Dean frozen breakfast franchise and Hillshire Farm lunchmeat. And in our fourth quarter, volume was up 9% and 28%, respectively. We also grew our share by 1.5 points in the Frozen Protein Breakfast category and by 2.3 points in lunchmeat. We expect beef and pork raw material to be deflationary to input cost in addition to pricing in 2017. We'll continue to invest in innovation, new product launches and MAP to grow our brands. We're expecting margins in 2017 to be similar to those in 2016 with solid volume growth that outperforms the categories where we compete. 
In the Chicken segment for the fourth quarter, operating income was $220 million with a 7.8% operating margin. Adjusted volume was down 3.2% due to a planned temporary decrease in production. And average price was up 3.5% as we focused on selling higher-margin products. There were 3 factors leading to lower-than-expected results in the fourth quarter in Chicken. 
First, our production forecasts are based on consumer demand. And through our sales and operations planning process, we received indications of lower demand in July and August. As our business model dictates, we reduced production in response to softening consumer demand. Secondly, we absorbed a sharp spike in soybean milk input costs within the quarter that affected margins in the short term. And third, having completed the restaging of the Tyson brand, we turned MAP back on to grow points of distribution, heading into the new fiscal year. As a result, our Tyson brand frozen and value-added chicken volume was up 6% in Q4 of 2016 and is gaining momentum, portending very strong Chicken segment volume in our first quarter of 2017. 
Chicken segment results for the year were outstanding. With an 11.9% operating margin, we were just shy of last year's record return. Operating income was $1.3 billion. Adjusted volume was down 0.7% due to the reduced demand in the fourth quarter that I just spoke to. Average pricing was down for the year by 1.5% as some input cost deflation was passed on to the customers. 
The USDA is now projecting for chicken supply to be in the U.S. to increase by 2% in 2017. And our input costs should be flat. We'll continue growing where we want to grow by selling more Tyson-branded value-added chicken. We expect the returns for the Chicken segment to be at or above the upper end of our normalized range of 9% to 11% again in fiscal 2017. 
Moving on to the Beef segment. Operating income was $139 million in Q4 with a 4% operating margin. Adjusted volume was down slightly by 0.3% while average sales price declined 14.9%, reflecting reduced cattle costs. For the fiscal year, operating income was $347 million with a 2.4% operating margin. Adjusted volume was up slightly by 0.8% while pricing declined 14.9%, again on lower cattle costs. Following a rocky start to the year, the Beef segment finished strong with favorable pricing environment continuing into our Q1. We're expecting our Beef margin to be at the upper end of its normalized range of 1.5% to 3% in fiscal '17, reflecting the favorable environment that we expect to continue for some time. 
I'll wrap up the segment performance by recapping the Pork segment results. Operating income was $108 million with an 8.7% operating margin. Adjusted volume was up slightly at 0.4% while average pricing was up 1% in the quarter. For the year, operating income was $528 million with a record 10.8% margin. Excluding the additional week in fiscal 2015 and the divestiture of our Heinold business in Q1 of last year, Pork volume was up 1.2% and average price was down 4.4%, reflecting lower hog costs. 
In fiscal 2017, we expect the favorable operating environment to continue and are estimating operating margin of at least 10% for the year. Currently, the USDA is projecting supplies of our protein categories to be up 2% to 3% next year with moderate export growth. Domestic demand for protein has been strong. And we expect it will continue in a deflationary environment. And we're very well positioned across all proteins and customer channels to respond to the changing demands of consumers. 
We're making significant investments in consumer insights, innovation, our brands, our customer relationships, our facilities and our people. In addition to $1 billion in CapEx in '17, we're investing on improving safety, animal well-being, warehousing and distribution and attracting and retaining talent throughout the organization. These investments should improve costs and turnover as well as continue to drive long-term sustainable growth. 
While protein demand overall is strong and growing, we're seeing a shift in how consumers spend, specifically in retail. When beef prices decline, more consumers buy beef as relative price premium versus other forms of protein narrows. This interaction is especially pronounced in the dynamic between ground beef and hot dogs. While the hot dog category overall was down in the 13 weeks ended October 2, we grew Ball Park volume by 11% and increased volume of share by 2.5 points. This is a great example of the power of a strong, leading brand like Ball Park and the consumer loyalty and strong customer support it garners. 
Overall, Tyson Foods is performing very well at retail. In the 13-week period roughly corresponding with our fourth quarter, our Core 9 product lines grew dollar share in all 9 categories and grew volume share in 8 of 9 categories. In total, we grew volume 9.6%, 8 points ahead of total food and beverage. If you take a look at the slides that we posted online, you'll see that both the Core 9 and total Tyson at retail are outpacing growth among the top 10 branded food-only companies in both sales and volume dollars. 
In sales volume, Tyson is only 1 of 3 companies that posted positive volume growth. In sales dollars, we are the only company to show positive growth with a 4.7% in the Core 9 and 2.1% overall. And that's in a deflationary protein pricing environment. I want to extend my congratulations to Andy Callahan and the entire retail package brands team for their outstanding performance. 
Turning to the foodservice channel. Traffic remains roughly flat and growth is driven by average check size, which is up about 2%. That was the case in calendar year 2015 and thus far in 2016 and is expected to continue through 2017. And despite a lackluster environment, Tyson Foods is doing well at foodservice. 
Our insights team, using data provided by NPD, has developed analytic tools that give us a better look in the broad line distribution sector within foodservice. Broad line distribution has long been an important channel to us. But now we're getting a better perspective on the role we play, the importance of value-added chickens and the strength of the Tyson brand. For the 52 weeks ended in July, the most recent data available, our volume grew 3.9%, more than double the category growth rate. By far, Tyson is the largest brand with a 33% share and growing. The next closest competitor is private label with a 20% share. 
And it's worth noting, we're a substantial producer of private label value-added chicken for our distributor customers. We look forward to being able to give you more and more insight into our foodservice business as our insights team continues to build out more analytic tools, which is a great example of the strength of our combined capabilities across the company. 
I continue to be encouraged by the pace of new product innovation as we extend our brands into adjacencies. Sales from new products launched in the previous 3 years has resulted in a Vitality Index of 14% in retail and 21% in foodservice. When we think about innovation, it's not only about new products. It really starts to understand how people shop and how shopper behavior opens up new platforms for innovation. 
Partnering with our customers to leverage the opportunities of the e-commerce space is a great example of this. We began selling Tyson Tastemaker meal kits through e-commerce in September. While it's still early, we're very encouraged by the initial consumer acceptance and feedback. This platform combines our innovation capabilities, supply chain at scale and leading brands in a way no other food company can. Expect to hear more in 2017 as we extend this platform into multiple formats in e-commerce and traditional retail. 
2016 was a great year. But more importantly, we laid the foundation for 2017 and beyond. We're capitalizing on our momentum and taking a systematic approach to success. 
Now I'm going to turn it over to Dennis, who will report on the fourth quarter and the year as well as our expectations for fiscal 2017."

Fiscal '16 was our fourth consecutive year of record earnings as we continue to demonstrate the power of our diversified business model, producing strong, stable margins. We are investing our cash flows back into our businesses as we focus on long-term sustainable growth. 
Total company return on sales was a record 7.7% for fiscal '16. Operating income was also a record at $2.8 billion, representing a 26% increase over adjusted operating income a year ago. On an adjusted basis, this represents our fourth consecutive year of growth in operating income and return on sales. Our record adjusted EPS of $4.39 represents a 39% increase over $3.15 per share last year. Our operating cash flow was a record $2.7 billion. And we have invested $695 million in capital expenditures. This outpaced our depreciation by $78 million as we continue to invest in projects with a focus on delivering high ROIC. 
We also used our record cash flow in fiscal '16 to return cash to shareholders and to retire debt. We increased the dividend for fiscal '16 by 50% from the prior year. We also repurchased 28.2 million shares for $1.7 billion during the year. Combined, we returned over $1.9 billion to shareholders in share repurchases and dividends. And that's after we retired to some high-coupon debt during the year, which further strengthened our balance sheet. 
In fiscal '16, our effective tax rate was 31.8% and on an adjusted basis was 33.8%. Net debt-to-EBITDA for the past 12 months was 1.7x. Including cash of $349 million, net debt was $5.9 billion and total liquidity was $1.3 billion. Net interest expense was $57 million during the fourth quarter and $243 million during fiscal 2016. For the quarter, average diluted shares outstanding were 381 million. ROIC was 18.1% and is approaching the pre-Hillshire acquisition level of 20.5%, which illustrates the strength and stability of our earnings as well as our commitment to creating incremental shareholder value. 
Now looking forward, here are some thoughts on fiscal '17. We expect similar revenues as we grow volume across each segment, offset by the impact of lower beef prices. Net interest expense should approximate $225 million. We currently estimate our effective tax rate to be around 35%. CapEx is expected to approximate $1 billion as we focus on capacity expansion and operational improvements that create long-term shareholder value. Prior to adjusting for any additional share repurchases subsequent to this call and based on our average share price so far in Q1, we expect our average diluted shares to be around 376 million. 
This morning, we reported our Board of Directors again increased our regular quarterly dividend by another 50% from $0.15 to $0.225 per share on our Class A common stock payable on December 15. This increase brings our dividend to $0.90 per share annually for Class A shares from $0.60. As we stated last year, we expect to increase future dividends for Class A shares by at least $0.10 per share annually. This increase and our commitment to steady future dividend increases demonstrates our confidence in the enduring strength and stability of our cash-generation capabilities. 
We have a tremendous amount of momentum going into fiscal '17 as we come off a year of 39% EPS growth. Our fiscal first quarter in '17 is off to a phenomenal start, which gives us confidence in achieving annual adjusted EPS growth of 7% to 10% to a range of $4.70 to $4.85 per share. This new guidance range represents a 5-year adjusted compounded annual growth rate of at least 19%. While we are pleased with the growth we have achieved, we're excited about the significant increase in investments in fiscal '17 that will drive growth of the future. In addition to $1 billion in CapEx, we are planning heavy investments, as Tom mentioned previously, while we continue to grow organically. 
Additionally, in fiscal '17, we expect to return even more cash to shareholders by our announced increased dividend and additional share repurchases. We see compelling value in our shares. And so far in the first quarter of fiscal '17, we've repurchased another 3.4 million shares for $240 million. While some of our investments will not immediately fall to the bottom line, we are creating a sustainable blueprint for success that will allow us to grow in a responsible way for the future. 
In closing, we take a long-term view toward investing in our people, our brands and our facilities, which will drive value and generate attractive shareholder returns. That concludes our prepared remarks. Denise, we're ready to begin Q&A."

It's about 4%, maybe a little less our total Chicken volume sales that are priced off the Georgia dock. We have talked several times that we use a lot of different pricing mechanisms. And we are diversified. We don't feel like it has a significant impact to us. But the Georgia Dock has had very little influence on our pricing strategy.

As Dennis has said and talked about, we've seen that come back in the first quarter here. So the volume was off. And it now has come back. And the other thing that we want to make sure that we do is we have lower inventories. We want to make sure that we don't run into a season of high inventories. And that certainly helped us. We're selling through the inventory to a large degree in Q1. So it was the right thing to certainly pull back in production. As it relates to the trim pricing, so if you look at 72s [ph] and 42s [ph] trim for the Prepared Foods business, and particularly as it relates to hot dogs and grinding materials for sausage and so forth, there was a sharp spike, and then it dropped off dramatically. As the trim is dropping off, we have it -- it's good for us because costs are going down, our price is up. But when they shoot up in any given period, the slope of the change is going to cause us, particularly on the foodservice business where we're formula priced, to have our raw material cost higher and our formula price is lagging by about 30 days. So that was a short-term impact. We're through that. But that's the situation there."

So it was not our finest hour in terms of how we execute. And we are in a much better position now because we have -- the good news is we have strong customer demand and we are building capacity to meet that customer demand. And it was a one-time issue that's going be -- certainly, as we ramp up to serve the volume, we're going to see some continued at-capacity numbers.

Our remarks today include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements reflect current views with respect to future events, such as Tyson's outlook for future performance on sales, margin, earnings growth and various other aspects of its business. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. I encourage you to read the release issued earlier this morning and our filings with the SEC for a discussion of the risks that can affect our business. 
During the call, there will be a discussion of some items that do not conform to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, including adjusted EPS. Tyson has reconciled these items to the most comparable GAAP measures in the earnings release and on our website at ir.tyson.com. 
I would like to remind everyone that this call is being recorded on Monday, November 21, 2016, at 9 a.m., Eastern Time.

Before we get into our earnings discussion, I'd like to comment on this morning's other announcement. As you may have heard, Tom Hayes will be succeeding me as CEO effective at calendar year-end. 
The board and I agree that now is an excellent time to make this transition. The company's performing exceptionally well and realizing significant growth and shareholder returns through our hybrid strategy of branded prepared foods and fresh meats. Simply put, I believe the company has a bright future and that Tom is the right leader for this next phase of our development. We've worked hard to create a strong platform that will take Tyson into the future and we have an impressive pipeline of talented management to help us do that. We're leveraging scale, developing our brands and building value for shareholders. 
Since his promotion to President earlier this year, Tom has reminded me, the board and the rest of the management team on a daily basis exactly why we hold him in such high regard. He's a capable leader, a strategic thinker and a team player who's ready to build on what we've accomplished to date and drive this company forward. He has the skills to deliver on our strategic goals and complete the transition toward our hybrid model. I've committed to him I will remain available as a consultant for the next 3 years. 
As you can imagine, it's a time of mixed emotions for me. I joined Tyson Foods 36 years ago and has spent my entire professional life here. In return, I've been given opportunities I could never have imagined. At Tyson, I have worked alongside some of the best, most impressive people you could ever hope to meet. And together, we've worked tirelessly to build a great company. I'd like to thank both the board and the Tyson family for their encouragement and support, without which I could have not succeeded. More than just delivering good financial results, we've been able to make a positive difference in people's lives. I'm thankful for the 7 years I had the opportunity to serve Tyson as its CEO. And I'm excited about its future and confident that Tom is the right leader for the next chapter. 
And with that, let's now turn to the quarter. Fiscal 2016 was our fourth consecutive year of record results with record operating income, operating margin, adjusted EPS, cash flow, Pork segment margins and Prepared Foods segment margins. Adjusted EPS grew 39% versus the prior year. Using the midpoint of our fiscal 2017 guidance of $4.70 to $4.85, the projected EPS 5-year CAGR would be 19%, which is outstanding. 
Fourth quarter results were slightly below our internal expectations, impacted largely by $35 million or $0.06 a share in mark-to-market and lower cost of market accounting treatments, primarily in Beef and Pork, a production issue in Prepared Foods and one-time factors in Chicken that Tom will go into in more detail shortly. 
Synergies for the fourth quarter were $165 million with $67 million incremental over Q4 of last year. Synergies for the year were $580 million with $258 million incremental to last year and well exceeding our $500 million target. We currently expect synergies of approximately $675 million in fiscal 2017, below our previous estimate of $700 million. While we still expect to achieve at least $700 million in total, due to the timing of some projects, we now expect some of the synergies to fall into fiscal '18. 
We bought back 8.3 million shares of stock for $600 million in Q4, excluding repurchases to offset dilution from equity compensation. For the fiscal year, share repurchases totaled 28.2 million for $1.7 billion. We were able to repurchase this level due to our record operating cash flows of more than $2.7 billion. 
2016 was a great year. Beyond setting records, we made tremendous progress leveraging the combined strength of the Tyson team. And we're well positioned for even more success in fiscal '17. 
Now let's go to Tom for a report on our operating segments."

As a part of our efforts to improve our production network, we closed a plant and transferred production to newer facilities. Unfortunately, this transition wasn't seamless, causing us to incur overtime in our operations and higher distribution costs in an attempt to satisfy our customers' needs. We've since taken steps to improve production efficiency and are building additional network capacity for long-term growth. 
Despite these challenges, Prepared Foods had a record year and delivered planned synergies. Synergies for the segment were $119 million for the quarter and $38 million incremental to Q4 last year. For the full year, Prepared Foods synergies were $441 million with $156 million incremental to fiscal 2015. For the fiscal year, Prepared Foods operating income was $734 million with a record 10% margin. Pricing was down 3.4% on lower raw materials. Adjusted volume was down 1% for the year, primarily due to the rationalization of some unprofitable ingredient meat SKUs. We're growing volume where we want to grow by focusing on strategic brands and categories to increase operating income over time. 
We've supported our brand equities across Prepared Foods through marketing, advertising and promotional spending to grow volume and secure our position on the shelves of retailers and restaurants. For example, we've increased our support behind the Jimmy Dean frozen breakfast franchise and Hillshire Farm lunchmeat. And in our fourth quarter, volume was up 9% and 28%, respectively. We also grew our share by 1.5 points in the Frozen Protein Breakfast category and by 2.3 points in lunchmeat. We expect beef and pork raw materials to be deflationary to input costs in addition to pricing in 2017. We'll continue to invest in innovation, new product launches and MAP to grow our brands. We're expecting margins in 2017 to be similar to those in 2016 with solid volume growth that outperforms the categories where we compete. 
In the Chicken segment for the fourth quarter, operating income was $220 million with a 7.8% operating margin. Adjusted volume was down 3.2% due to a planned temporary decrease in production. And average price was up 3.5% as we focused on selling higher-margin products. There were 3 factors leading to the lower-than-expected results in the fourth quarter in Chicken. 
First, our production forecasts are based on consumer demand. And through our sales and operations planning process, we received indications of lower demand in July and August. As our business model dictates, we reduced production in response to softening consumer demand. Secondly, we absorbed a sharp spike in soybean meal input costs within the quarter that affected margins in the short term. And third, having completed the restaging of the Tyson brand, we turned MAP back on to grow points of distribution, heading into the new fiscal year. As a result, our Tyson brand frozen and value-added chicken volume was up 6% in Q4 of 2016 and is gaining momentum, portending very strong Chicken segment volume in our first quarter of 2017. 
Chicken segment results for the year were outstanding. With an 11.9% operating margin, we were just shy of last year's record return. Operating income was $1.3 billion. Adjusted volume was down 0.7% due to the reduced demand in the fourth quarter that I just spoke to. Average pricing was down for the year by 1.5% as some input cost deflation was passed on to the customers. 
The USDA is now projecting for chicken supply to be -- in the U.S. to increase by 2% in 2017. And our input costs should be flat. We'll continue growing where we want to grow by selling more Tyson-branded value-added chicken. We expect the returns for the Chicken segment to be at or above the upper end of our normalized range of 9% to 11% again in fiscal 2017. 
Moving on to the Beef segment. Operating income was $139 million in Q4 with a 4% operating margin. Adjusted volume was down slightly by 0.3% while average sales price declined 14.9%, reflecting reduced cattle costs. For the fiscal year, operating income was $347 million with a 2.4% operating margin. Adjusted volume was up slightly by 0.8% while pricing declined 14.9%, again on lower cattle costs. Following a rocky start to the year, the Beef segment finished strong with favorable pricing environment continuing into our Q1. We're expecting our Beef margin to be at the upper end of its normalized range of 1.5% to 3% in fiscal '17, reflecting the favorable environment that we expect to continue for some time. 
I'll wrap up the segment performance by recapping the Pork segment results. Operating income was $108 million with an 8.7% operating margin. Adjusted volume was up slightly at 0.4% while average pricing was up 1% in the quarter. For the year, operating income was $528 million with a record 10.8% margin. Excluding the additional week in fiscal 2015 and the divestiture of our Heinold business in Q1 of last year, Pork volume was up 1.2% and average price was down 4.4%, reflecting lower hog costs. 
In fiscal 2017, we expect the favorable operating environment to continue and are estimating an operating margin of at least 10% for the year. Currently, the USDA is projecting supplies of our protein categories to be up 2% to 3% next year with moderate export growth. Domestic demand for protein has been strong. And we expect it will continue in a deflationary environment. And we're very well positioned across all proteins and customer channels to respond to the changing demands of consumers. 
We're making significant investments in consumer insights, innovation, our brands, our customer relationships, our facilities and our people. In addition to $1 billion in CapEx in '17, we're investing in improving safety, animal well-being, warehousing and distribution and attracting and retaining talent throughout the organization. These investments should improve costs and turnover as well as continue to drive long-term sustainable growth. 
While protein demand overall is strong and growing, we're seeing a shift in how consumers spend, specifically in retail. When beef prices decline, more consumers buy beef as relative price premium versus other forms of protein narrows. This interaction is especially pronounced in the dynamic between ground beef and hot dogs. While the hot dog category overall was down in the 13 weeks ended October 2, we grew Ball Park volume by 11% and increased volume share by 2.5 points. This is a great example of the power of a strong, leading brand like Ball Park and the consumer loyalty and strong customer support it garners. 
Overall, Tyson Foods is performing very well at retail. In the 13-week period roughly corresponding with our fourth quarter, our Core 9 product lines grew dollar share in all 9 categories and grew volume share in 8 of 9 categories. In total, we grew volume 9.6%, 8 points ahead of total food and beverage. If you take a look at the slides that we posted online, you'll see that both the Core 9 and total Tyson at retail are outpacing growth among the top 10 branded food-only companies in both sales and volume dollars. 
In sales volume, Tyson is only 1 of 3 companies that posted positive volume growth. In sales dollars, we are the only company to show positive growth with a 4.7% in the Core 9 and 2.1% overall. And that's in a deflationary protein pricing environment. I want to extend my congratulations to Andy Callahan and the entire retail packaged brands team for their outstanding performance. 
Turning to the foodservice channel. Traffic remains roughly flat and growth is driven by average check size, which is up about 2%. That was the case in calendar year 2015 and thus far in 2016 and is expected to continue through 2017. And despite a lackluster environment, Tyson Foods is doing well at foodservice. 
Our insights team, using data provided by NPD, has developed analytic tools that give us a better look into the broadline distribution sector within foodservice. Broadline distribution has long been an important channel to us, but now we're getting a better perspective on the role we play, the importance of value-added chicken and the strength of the Tyson brand. For the 52 weeks ended in July, the most recent data available, our volume grew 3.9%, more than double the category growth rate. By far, Tyson is the largest brand with a 33% share and growing. The next closest competitor is private label with a 20% share. 
And it's worth noting, we're a substantial producer of private label value-added chicken for our distributor customers. We look forward to being able to give you more and more insight into our foodservice business as our insights team continues to build out more analytic tools, which is a great example of the strength of our combined capabilities across the company. 
I continue to be encouraged by the pace of new product innovation as we extend our brands into adjacencies. Sales from new products launched in the previous 3 years has resulted in a Vitality Index of 14% in retail and 21% in foodservice. When we think about innovation, it's not only about new products, we really start to understand how people shop and how shopper behavior opens up new platforms for innovation. 
Partnering with our customers to leverage the opportunities of the e-commerce space is a great example of this. We began selling Tyson Tastemaker meal kits through e-commerce in September and, while it's still early, we're very encouraged by the initial consumer acceptance and feedback. This platform combines our innovation capabilities, supply chain at scale and leading brands in a way no other food company can. Expect to hear more in 2017 as we extend this platform into multiple formats in e-commerce and traditional retail. 
2016 was a great year. But more importantly, we laid the foundation for 2017 and beyond. We're capitalizing on our momentum and taking a systematic approach to success. 
I'm now going to turn it over to Dennis, who will report on the fourth quarter and the year as well as our expectations for fiscal 2017."

Fiscal '16 was our fourth consecutive year of record earnings as we continue to demonstrate the power of our diversified business model, producing strong, stable margins.

Fiscal '16 was our fourth consecutive year of record earnings as we continue to demonstrate the power of our diversified business model, producing strong, stable margins. We are investing our cash flows back into our businesses as we focus on long-term sustainable growth. 
Total company return on sales was a record 7.7% for fiscal '16. Operating income was also a record at $2.8 billion, representing a 26% increase over adjusted operating income a year ago. On an adjusted basis, this represents our fourth consecutive year of growth in operating income and return on sales. Our record adjusted EPS of $4.39 represents a 39% increase over $3.15 per share last year. Our operating cash flow was a record $2.7 billion. And we have invested $695 million in capital expenditures. This outpaced our depreciation by $78 million as we continue to invest in projects with a focus on delivering high ROIC. 
We also used our record cash flow in fiscal '16 to return cash to shareholders and to retire debt. We increased the dividend for fiscal '16 by 50% from the prior year. We also repurchased 28.2 million shares for $1.7 billion during the year. Combined, we returned over $1.9 billion to shareholders in share repurchases and dividends. And that's after we retired some high-coupon debt during the year, which further strengthened our balance sheet. 
In fiscal '16, our effective tax rate was 31.8% and on an adjusted basis was 33.8%. Net debt-to-EBITDA for the past 12 months was 1.7x. Including cash of $349 million, net debt was $5.9 billion and total liquidity was $1.3 billion. Net interest expense was $57 million during the fourth quarter and $243 million during fiscal 2016. For the quarter, average diluted shares outstanding were 381 million. ROIC was 18.1% and is approaching the pre-Hillshire acquisition level of 20.5%, which illustrates the strength and stability of our earnings as well as our commitment to creating incremental shareholder value. 
Now looking forward, here are some thoughts on fiscal '17. We expect similar revenues as we grow volume across each segment, offset by the impact of lower beef prices. Net interest expense should approximate $225 million. We currently estimate our effective tax rate to be around 35%. CapEx is expected to approximate $1 billion as we focus on capacity expansion and operational improvements that create long-term shareholder value. Prior to adjusting for any additional share repurchases subsequent to this call and based on our average share price so far in Q1, we expect our average diluted shares to be around 376 million. 
This morning, we reported our Board of Directors again increased our regular quarterly dividend by another 50% from $0.15 to $0.225 per share on our Class A common stock payable on December 15. This increase brings our dividend to $0.90 per share annually for Class A shares from $0.60. As we stated last year, we expect to increase future dividends for Class A shares by at least $0.10 per share annually. This increase and our commitment to steady future dividend increases demonstrates our confidence in the enduring strength and stability of our cash-generation capabilities. 
We have a tremendous amount of momentum going into fiscal '17 as we come off a year of 39% EPS growth. Our fiscal first quarter in '17 is off to a phenomenal start, which gives us confidence in achieving annual adjusted EPS growth of 7% to 10% to a range of $4.70 to $4.85 per share. This new guidance range represents a 5-year adjusted compounded annual growth rate of at least 19%. While we are pleased with the growth we have achieved, we are excited about the significant increase in investments in fiscal '17 that will drive growth for the future. In addition to $1 billion in CapEx, we are planning heavy investments, as Tom mentioned previously, while we continue to grow organically. 
Additionally, in fiscal '17, we expect to return even more cash to shareholders by our announced increased dividend and additional share repurchases. We see compelling value in our shares. And so far in the first quarter of fiscal '17, we've repurchased another 3.4 million shares for $240 million. While some of our investments will not immediately fall to the bottom line, we are creating a sustainable blueprint for success that will allow us to grow in a responsible way for the future. 
In closing, we take a long-term view toward investing in our people, our brands and our facilities, which will drive value and generate attractive shareholder returns. That concludes our prepared remarks. Denise, we're ready to begin Q&A."

But I think we're in a great shape, particularly in Beef and Pork, which I think shouldn't surprise you. As it relates to the Georgia Dock, this is what we talked about before several times is that we really don't use it that much. It's about 4%, maybe a little less, of our total Chicken volume sales that are priced off the Georgia Dock. We have talked several times that we use a lot of different pricing mechanisms.

But we think that what we want to make sure that we continue to do is focus on volume. Hopefully, you see in those charts, if you were able to, those online, the investments are paying off. So we have significant investment going into, not the least of which is MAP, in Q4 that was a big impact on the rate. But then as you look at what we're doing for preparing ourselves for '17, it's all about making sure that we have the shelf space, we are driving innovation and we continue to invest and frankly lift the investment in some of the categories that weren't ready for and some of the brands that weren't ready for the MAP spending as much as they are today. So we think in terms of the fourth quarter, it played out pretty much as we thought it would. And as we talked on the last call, we're executing that strategy that we want to be continually at 10%. And we did it in 2016. With more protein on the market next year, we want to make sure we're in a good position that I spoke to and we want to continue to drive category growth with our customers. So we're continuing to invest significantly and growing where we want to grow, which is in the Core 9 as we've demonstrated."

And then I had a follow-up on trim prices, which we track. Other than a little bit of a spike in July, I really didn't see anything else for the quarter.

As Dennis has said and we've talked about, we've seen that come back in the first quarter here. So the volume was off. And it now has come back. And the other thing that we want to make sure that we do is we have lower inventories. We want to make sure that we don't run into a season with high inventories and that certainly helped us. We're selling through the inventory to a large degree in Q1. So it was the right thing to certainly pull back on production. As it relates to the trim pricing, so if you look at 72s [ph] and 42s [ph] trim for the Prepared Foods business, and particularly as it relates to hot dogs and grinding materials for sausage and so forth, there was a sharp spike, and then it dropped off dramatically. As the trim is dropping off, we have -- it's good for us because costs are going down, our price is up. But when they shoot up in any given period, the slope of the change is going to cause us, particularly on the foodservice business where we're formula priced, to have our raw material costs higher and our formula price is lagging by about 30 days. So that was a short-term impact. We're through that. But that's the situation there."

So if we have a customer that's willing to lock for a period of time, then it's smart for us to lock the grain underneath to make sure we have a margin that's locked up. Beyond that, I would say, you continue to see our portfolio move more and more to what I'll call list pricing, list pricing with a promotional element on top of it. So regardless of whether it's foodservice or retail, that's the model that we have within Prepared Foods. A lot of the chicken value-add acts like Prepared Foods. So I'd say that's the predominant model beyond locking it against a grain underlying input cost."

Before we get into our earnings discussion, I'd like to comment on this morning's other announcement. As you may have heard, Tom Hayes will be succeeding me as CEO effective at calendar year-end. 
The board and I agree that now is an excellent time to make this transition. The company's performing exceptionally well and realizing significant growth and shareholder returns through our hybrid strategy of branded prepared foods and fresh meats. Simply put, I believe the company has a bright future and that Tom is the right leader for this next phase of our development. We've worked hard to create a strong platform that will take Tyson into the future and we have an impressive pipeline of talented management to help us do that. We're leveraging scale, developing our brands and building value for shareholders. 
Since his promotion to President earlier this year, Tom has reminded me, the board and the rest of the management team on a daily basis exactly why we hold him in such high regard. He's a capable leader, a strategic thinker and a team player who's ready to build on what we've accomplished to date and drive this company forward. He has the skills to deliver on our strategic goals and complete the transition toward our hybrid model. I've committed to him I will remain available as a consultant for the next 3 years. 
As you can imagine, it's a time of mixed emotions for me. I joined Tyson Foods 36 years ago and has spent my entire professional life here. In return, I've been given opportunities I could never have imagined. At Tyson, I have worked alongside some of the best, most impressive people you could ever hope to meet. And together, we've worked tirelessly to build a great company. I'd like to thank both the board and the Tyson family for their encouragement and support, without which I could have not succeeded. More than just delivering good financial results, we've been able to make a positive difference in people's lives. I'm thankful for the 7 years I had the opportunity to serve Tyson as its CEO. And I'm excited about its future and confident that Tom is the right leader for the next chapter. 
And with that, let's now turn to the quarter. Fiscal 2016 was our fourth consecutive year of record results with record operating income, operating margin, adjusted EPS, cash flow, Pork segment margins and Prepared Foods segment margins. Adjusted EPS grew 39% versus the prior year. Using the midpoint of our fiscal 2017 guidance of $4.70 to $4.85, the projected EPS 5-year CAGR would be 19%, which is outstanding. 
Fourth quarter results were slightly below our internal expectations, impacted largely by $35 million or $0.06 a share in mark-to-market and lower cost of market accounting treatments, primarily in Beef and Pork, a production issue in Prepared Foods and one-time factors in Chicken that Tom will go into in more detail shortly. 
Synergies for the fourth quarter were $165 million with $67 million incremental over Q4 of last year. Synergies for the year were $580 million with $258 million incremental to last year and well exceeding our $500 million target. We currently expect synergies of approximately $675 million in fiscal 2017, below our previous estimate of $700 million. While we still expect to achieve at least $700 million in total, due to the timing of some projects, we now expect some of the synergies to fall into fiscal '18. 
We bought back 8.3 million shares of stock for $600 million in Q4, excluding repurchases to offset dilution from equity compensation. For the fiscal year, share repurchases totaled 28.2 million for $1.7 billion. We were able to repurchase this level due to our record operating cash flows of more than $2.7 billion. 
2016 was a great year. Beyond setting records, we made tremendous progress leveraging the combined strength of the Tyson team. And we're well positioned for even more success in fiscal '17. 
Now let's go to Tom for a report on our operating segments."
190636,310174461,1090612,"Tyson Foods, Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 21, 2016",2016-11-21,"Earnings Calls","Tyson Foods, Inc.","Executives","Thanks a lot, Donnie. Let's begin with the Prepared Foods segment. Operating income in the fourth quarter was $133 million with a 7.2% operating margin. Average price was down 3.9%, primarily reflecting the pass-through of overall lower raw material costs",1784,"Thanks a lot, Donnie. Let's begin with the Prepared Foods segment. Operating income in the fourth quarter was $133 million with a 7.2% operating margin. Average price was down 3.9%, primarily reflecting the pass-through of overall lower raw material costs. Adjusting for the additional week in 2015, volume compared to Q4 last year was up 2.6%. Margin in the Prepared Foods segment were lower year-over-year primarily due to a sharp increase in pork trim raw material costs in Q4 that were not passed through to customers within the quarter and increased marketing spending. 
In the foodservice portion of Prepared Foods in Q4, we had strong results in our bakery business but softer-than-expected results in prepared meats. As a part of our efforts to improve our production network, we closed a plant and transferred production to newer facilities. Unfortunately, this transition wasn't seamless, causing us to incur overtime in our operations and higher distribution costs in an attempt to satisfy our customers' needs. We've since taken steps to improve production efficiency and are building additional network capacity for long-term growth. 
Despite these challenges, Prepared Foods had a record year and delivered planned synergies. Synergies for the segment were $119 million for the quarter and $38 million incremental to Q4 last year. For the full year, Prepared Foods synergies were $441 million with $156 million incremental to fiscal 2015. For the fiscal year, Prepared Foods operating income was $734 million with a record 10% margin. Pricing was down 3.4% on lower raw materials. Adjusted volume was down 1% for the year, primarily due to the rationalization of some unprofitable ingredient meat SKUs. We're growing volume where we want to grow by focusing on strategic brands and categories to increase operating income over time. 
We've supported our brand equities across Prepared Foods through marketing, advertising and promotional spending to grow volume and secure our position on the shelves of retailers and restaurants. For example, we've increased our support behind the Jimmy Dean frozen breakfast franchise and Hillshire Farm lunchmeat. And in our fourth quarter, volume was up 9% and 28%, respectively. We also grew our share by 1.5 points in the Frozen Protein Breakfast category and by 2.3 points in lunchmeat. We expect beef and pork raw materials to be deflationary to input costs in addition to pricing in 2017. We'll continue to invest in innovation, new product launches and MAP to grow our brands. We're expecting margins in 2017 to be similar to those in 2016 with solid volume growth that outperforms the categories where we compete. 
In the Chicken segment for the fourth quarter, operating income was $220 million with a 7.8% operating margin. Adjusted volume was down 3.2% due to a planned temporary decrease in production. And average price was up 3.5% as we focused on selling higher-margin products. There were 3 factors leading to the lower-than-expected results in the fourth quarter in Chicken. 
First, our production forecasts are based on consumer demand. And through our sales and operations planning process, we received indications of lower demand in July and August. As our business model dictates, we reduced production in response to softening consumer demand. Secondly, we absorbed a sharp spike in soybean meal input costs within the quarter that affected margins in the short term. And third, having completed the restaging of the Tyson brand, we turned MAP back on to grow points of distribution, heading into the new fiscal year. As a result, our Tyson brand frozen and value-added chicken volume was up 6% in Q4 of 2016 and is gaining momentum, portending very strong Chicken segment volume in our first quarter of 2017. 
Chicken segment results for the year were outstanding. With an 11.9% operating margin, we were just shy of last year's record return. Operating income was $1.3 billion. Adjusted volume was down 0.7% due to the reduced demand in the fourth quarter that I just spoke to. Average pricing was down for the year by 1.5% as some input cost deflation was passed on to the customers. 
The USDA is now projecting for chicken supply to be -- in the U.S. to increase by 2% in 2017. And our input costs should be flat. We'll continue growing where we want to grow by selling more Tyson-branded value-added chicken. We expect the returns for the Chicken segment to be at or above the upper end of our normalized range of 9% to 11% again in fiscal 2017. 
Moving on to the Beef segment. Operating income was $139 million in Q4 with a 4% operating margin. Adjusted volume was down slightly by 0.3% while average sales price declined 14.9%, reflecting reduced cattle costs. For the fiscal year, operating income was $347 million with a 2.4% operating margin. Adjusted volume was up slightly by 0.8% while pricing declined 14.9%, again on lower cattle costs. Following a rocky start to the year, the Beef segment finished strong with favorable pricing environment continuing into our Q1. We're expecting our Beef margin to be at the upper end of its normalized range of 1.5% to 3% in fiscal '17, reflecting the favorable environment that we expect to continue for some time. 
I'll wrap up the segment performance by recapping the Pork segment results. Operating income was $108 million with an 8.7% operating margin. Adjusted volume was up slightly at 0.4% while average pricing was up 1% in the quarter. For the year, operating income was $528 million with a record 10.8% margin. Excluding the additional week in fiscal 2015 and the divestiture of our Heinold business in Q1 of last year, Pork volume was up 1.2% and average price was down 4.4%, reflecting lower hog costs. 
In fiscal 2017, we expect the favorable operating environment to continue and are estimating an operating margin of at least 10% for the year. Currently, the USDA is projecting supplies of our protein categories to be up 2% to 3% next year with moderate export growth. Domestic demand for protein has been strong. And we expect it will continue in a deflationary environment. And we're very well positioned across all proteins and customer channels to respond to the changing demands of consumers. 
We're making significant investments in consumer insights, innovation, our brands, our customer relationships, our facilities and our people. In addition to $1 billion in CapEx in '17, we're investing in improving safety, animal well-being, warehousing and distribution and attracting and retaining talent throughout the organization. These investments should improve costs and turnover as well as continue to drive long-term sustainable growth. 
While protein demand overall is strong and growing, we're seeing a shift in how consumers spend, specifically in retail. When beef prices decline, more consumers buy beef as relative price premium versus other forms of protein narrows. This interaction is especially pronounced in the dynamic between ground beef and hot dogs. While the hot dog category overall was down in the 13 weeks ended October 2, we grew Ball Park volume by 11% and increased volume share by 2.5 points. This is a great example of the power of a strong, leading brand like Ball Park and the consumer loyalty and strong customer support it garners. 
Overall, Tyson Foods is performing very well at retail. In the 13-week period roughly corresponding with our fourth quarter, our Core 9 product lines grew dollar share in all 9 categories and grew volume share in 8 of 9 categories. In total, we grew volume 9.6%, 8 points ahead of total food and beverage. If you take a look at the slides that we posted online, you'll see that both the Core 9 and total Tyson at retail are outpacing growth among the top 10 branded food-only companies in both sales and volume dollars. 
In sales volume, Tyson is only 1 of 3 companies that posted positive volume growth. In sales dollars, we are the only company to show positive growth with a 4.7% in the Core 9 and 2.1% overall. And that's in a deflationary protein pricing environment. I want to extend my congratulations to Andy Callahan and the entire retail packaged brands team for their outstanding performance. 
Turning to the foodservice channel. Traffic remains roughly flat and growth is driven by average check size, which is up about 2%. That was the case in calendar year 2015 and thus far in 2016 and is expected to continue through 2017. And despite a lackluster environment, Tyson Foods is doing well at foodservice. 
Our insights team, using data provided by NPD, has developed analytic tools that give us a better look into the broadline distribution sector within foodservice. Broadline distribution has long been an important channel to us, but now we're getting a better perspective on the role we play, the importance of value-added chicken and the strength of the Tyson brand. For the 52 weeks ended in July, the most recent data available, our volume grew 3.9%, more than double the category growth rate. By far, Tyson is the largest brand with a 33% share and growing. The next closest competitor is private label with a 20% share. 
And it's worth noting, we're a substantial producer of private label value-added chicken for our distributor customers. We look forward to being able to give you more and more insight into our foodservice business as our insights team continues to build out more analytic tools, which is a great example of the strength of our combined capabilities across the company. 
I continue to be encouraged by the pace of new product innovation as we extend our brands into adjacencies. Sales from new products launched in the previous 3 years has resulted in a Vitality Index of 14% in retail and 21% in foodservice. When we think about innovation, it's not only about new products, we really start to understand how people shop and how shopper behavior opens up new platforms for innovation. 
Partnering with our customers to leverage the opportunities of the e-commerce space is a great example of this. We began selling Tyson Tastemaker meal kits through e-commerce in September and, while it's still early, we're very encouraged by the initial consumer acceptance and feedback. This platform combines our innovation capabilities, supply chain at scale and leading brands in a way no other food company can. Expect to hear more in 2017 as we extend this platform into multiple formats in e-commerce and traditional retail. 
2016 was a great year. But more importantly, we laid the foundation for 2017 and beyond. We're capitalizing on our momentum and taking a systematic approach to success. 
I'm now going to turn it over to Dennis, who will report on the fourth quarter and the year as well as our expectations for fiscal 2017."

Fiscal '16 was our fourth consecutive year of record earnings as we continue to demonstrate the power of our diversified business model, producing strong, stable margins. We are investing our cash flows back into our businesses as we focus on long-term sustainable growth. 
Total company return on sales was a record 7.7% for fiscal '16. Operating income was also a record at $2.8 billion, representing a 26% increase over adjusted operating income a year ago. On an adjusted basis, this represents our fourth consecutive year of growth in operating income and return on sales. Our record adjusted EPS of $4.39 represents a 39% increase over $3.15 per share last year. Our operating cash flow was a record $2.7 billion. And we have invested $695 million in capital expenditures. This outpaced our depreciation by $78 million as we continue to invest in projects with a focus on delivering high ROIC. 
We also used our record cash flow in fiscal '16 to return cash to shareholders and to retire debt. We increased the dividend for fiscal '16 by 50% from the prior year. We also repurchased 28.2 million shares for $1.7 billion during the year. Combined, we returned over $1.9 billion to shareholders in share repurchases and dividends. And that's after we retired some high-coupon debt during the year, which further strengthened our balance sheet. 
In fiscal '16, our effective tax rate was 31.8% and on an adjusted basis was 33.8%. Net debt-to-EBITDA for the past 12 months was 1.7x. Including cash of $349 million, net debt was $5.9 billion and total liquidity was $1.3 billion. Net interest expense was $57 million during the fourth quarter and $243 million during fiscal 2016. For the quarter, average diluted shares outstanding were 381 million. ROIC was 18.1% and is approaching the pre-Hillshire acquisition level of 20.5%, which illustrates the strength and stability of our earnings as well as our commitment to creating incremental shareholder value. 
Now looking forward, here are some thoughts on fiscal '17. We expect similar revenues as we grow volume across each segment, offset by the impact of lower beef prices. Net interest expense should approximate $225 million. We currently estimate our effective tax rate to be around 35%. CapEx is expected to approximate $1 billion as we focus on capacity expansion and operational improvements that create long-term shareholder value. Prior to adjusting for any additional share repurchases subsequent to this call and based on our average share price so far in Q1, we expect our average diluted shares to be around 376 million. 
This morning, we reported our Board of Directors again increased our regular quarterly dividend by another 50% from $0.15 to $0.225 per share on our Class A common stock payable on December 15. This increase brings our dividend to $0.90 per share annually for Class A shares from $0.60. As we stated last year, we expect to increase future dividends for Class A shares by at least $0.10 per share annually. This increase and our commitment to steady future dividend increases demonstrates our confidence in the enduring strength and stability of our cash-generation capabilities. 
We have a tremendous amount of momentum going into fiscal '17 as we come off a year of 39% EPS growth. Our fiscal first quarter in '17 is off to a phenomenal start, which gives us confidence in achieving annual adjusted EPS growth of 7% to 10% to a range of $4.70 to $4.85 per share. This new guidance range represents a 5-year adjusted compounded annual growth rate of at least 19%. While we are pleased with the growth we have achieved, we are excited about the significant increase in investments in fiscal '17 that will drive growth for the future. In addition to $1 billion in CapEx, we are planning heavy investments, as Tom mentioned previously, while we continue to grow organically. 
Additionally, in fiscal '17, we expect to return even more cash to shareholders by our announced increased dividend and additional share repurchases. We see compelling value in our shares. And so far in the first quarter of fiscal '17, we've repurchased another 3.4 million shares for $240 million. While some of our investments will not immediately fall to the bottom line, we are creating a sustainable blueprint for success that will allow us to grow in a responsible way for the future. 
In closing, we take a long-term view toward investing in our people, our brands and our facilities, which will drive value and generate attractive shareholder returns. That concludes our prepared remarks. Denise, we're ready to begin Q&A."

With that, Donnie, I have to say your timing of your retirement may not be perceived as optimal. Tyson is in the middle of a class action suit. Earnings fell short of expectations on the perception that you've kind of reached peak earnings. And you're in a debate over your Georgia Dock pricing, it seems like. So let me just tackle one issue at a time. Why not hand the reins over once the dust settles a little bit? Second, how much of the earnings shortfall in the quarter will be recaptured in the first quarter? Third, if Georgia Dock prices go away, how much would Tyson's outlook actually change? And then Dennis, just to kind of go back on this, on the share repurchases, given that your stock seems to be probably pricing down at least 10% to 15% today, what is the expectation for share repurchases going into this first quarter?"

But I think we're in a great shape, particularly in Beef and Pork, which I think shouldn't surprise you. As it relates to the Georgia Dock, this is what we talked about before several times is that we really don't use it that much. It's about 4%, maybe a little less, of our total Chicken volume sales that are priced off the Georgia Dock. We have talked several times that we use a lot of different pricing mechanisms.

And then in addition to that, I'd say there's a lot of discussions, which we've also spoken about this, it's less about price than it is about everything else we offer as a company.

As Dennis has said and we've talked about, we've seen that come back in the first quarter here. So the volume was off. And it now has come back. And the other thing that we want to make sure that we do is we have lower inventories. We want to make sure that we don't run into a season with high inventories and that certainly helped us. We're selling through the inventory to a large degree in Q1. So it was the right thing to certainly pull back on production. As it relates to the trim pricing, so if you look at 72s [ph] and 42s [ph] trim for the Prepared Foods business, and particularly as it relates to hot dogs and grinding materials for sausage and so forth, there was a sharp spike, and then it dropped off dramatically. As the trim is dropping off, we have -- it's good for us because costs are going down, our price is up. But when they shoot up in any given period, the slope of the change is going to cause us, particularly on the foodservice business where we're formula priced, to have our raw material costs higher and our formula price is lagging by about 30 days. So that was a short-term impact. We're through that. But that's the situation there."

So yes, it has come back down and is staying down, so that is helping our cost base. And I'd say, as it relates to the feed cost in Q4, it's always a lag in our COGS. So now -- and speaking to the profit, we are going to be in a much better shape based on doing a couple things. One is reducing the amount that we produce, so our inventories we're drawing down and also continuing to do what I said, which is focused on driving growth at retail through the Tyson brand and driving growth at the new foodservice customer places."
