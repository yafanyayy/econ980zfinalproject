We also posted a series of slides that detail operating results by company for the quarter. Our 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2015 is expected to be filed shortly. I don't go through the full disclaimer statement or the comments we have on the difference between operating earnings and GAAP results, but I do ask that you all read those comments contained in our slides and on our website. The disclaimer statement regards forward-looking statements detailing the number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements made therein. And although we may elect to update forward-looking statements from time to time, we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so even if estimates change, unless, of course, required by applicable securities laws. We also provide commentary with regard to the difference between operating earnings and net income reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. PSEG believes that the non-GAAP financial measure of operating earnings provides a consistent and comparable measure of performance to help shareholders understand trends. 
I'm now going to turn the call over to Ralph Izzo, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Public Service Enterprise Group, and joining Ralph on the call is Dan Cregg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

This morning, we reported operating earnings for the full year 2015, and I'm pleased to report that it was a year of significant accomplishment. As you saw this morning, we reported operating earnings for the fourth quarter of $0.50 per share versus $0.49 per share earned in the fourth quarter of 2014 despite the unseasonably mild weather this past December. Results for the full year were $2.91 per share or 5% greater than 2014's operating earnings of $2.76 per share. This is at the upper half of our guidance of $2.85 to $2.95 per share, and it was also higher than the midpoint of our original guidance of $2.85 per share. Our souls reflect the benefits of excellent performance and robust organic growth, which offset the impact of low energy prices on earnings. We have continued to successfully deploy our strong free cash flow into customer-oriented investment programs that have supported both. 2015's operating earnings represented the third year of growth in earnings, now let me just mention a few of the year's highlight. 
PSE&G was named Electric Light and Power's Utility of the Year and was named the Most Reliable Utility in the Mid-Atlantic for the 14th consecutive year. But we're not resting on those laurels. PSE&G invested approximately $2.7 billion during 2015 on programs to further enhance the system's resiliency and its reliability. During the year, PSE&G placed into service key backbone transmission lines such as the Susquehanna Road line as well as at the Nicholson Glouster Camden line which are designed to meet the need of customers today and well into the future. PSE&G invested over $550 million on programs under its $1.2 billion Energy Strong initiative. These programs are designed to strengthen and protect the electric and gas distribution systems from the impacts of extreme weather. During the year, PSE&G also received approval from the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities to invest an additional $95 million and its award-winning energy efficiency programs and to continue the work under Energy Strong, replacing aging cast iron natural gas pipe. The $905 million Gas System Modernization Program represented the 14th multiyear investment program approved by the BPU since PSE&G's last base rate case, and this speaks to the state's support of infrastructure investment that meets the needs of customer. PSE&G's investment program supported recovery -- revenue recovery mechanisms and tight control of O&M expenses have provided growth in PSE&G's operating earnings of approximately 13% per year for the 5-year period ended 2015. During this period PSE&G's rate base expanded at a rate of 11% per year, and importantly, we have been able to support this growth as customer builds have declined. 
But 2015 was not just a year of PSE&G accomplishment. PSE&G Power's strong operating per supported earnings in line with guidance for the full year despite very difficult market conditions. The nuclear fleet, operated at a capacity factor of greater than 90% for the year and accounted for 54% of the fleet's output. Power's gas-fired combustion turbine fleet set a new record for output. This improves on the prior record established in 2014. The fleet's performance is benefiting from investments that have improved the efficiency, increased its capacity and provided greater access to low-cost gas supplies. The flexibility and diversity of Power's fleet have allowed us to provde approximately $500 million of positive free cash flow in 2015, even during soft energy market conditions. Power also plans to invest $2 billion over the next 3 to 4 years to add approximately 1,800 megawatts of new, efficient combined cycle gas-fired turbine efficiency. That's at turbine capacity. The Keys Energy Station, which is located in Southwestern, will extend Power's footprint in this core PGM footprint. A new efficient unit at the Sewaren in New Jersey will replace old inefficient capacity. And after clearing the most recent capacity auction in New England, Power will construct a new 485-megawatt combined cycle unit at its existing Bridgeport Harbor existing site, giving us unenviable and growing position in both energy and capacity markets in Southwestern Connecticut.  The addition of these units will transform Power's generation mix as its ownership of efficient, reliable gas-fired capacity will grow to exceed 5,000 megawatts in 2019. At that time, the combined cycle gas turbine fleet will surpass the size of Power's ownership and nuclear capacity and secure Power's position as the low-cost generator, with modern, flexible, clean assets that remain capable of meeting the demands for reliability in today's market. 
Power also grew its investment in contracted solar energy. In 2015, Power added 2 projects representing an investment of approximately $75 million in utility scale grid connected solar energy. And earlier this year, Power announced that it will invest an additional $150 million in 3 projects that bring its portfolio of solar projects to 240 megawatts DC of clean renewable energy. All projects in this portfolio are under long-term contracts with credit-worthy customers. So as you can see, we continue to explore opportunities to expand and optimize Power's fleet. Although I will add that we do not see any new generation built in the foreseeable future, although you never say never, but we don't plan any at this point in time. 
Our balance sheet continues to provide us with a competitive advantage to finance our capital program without the need to excess the equity markets. We ended 2015 with strong credit metrics and an extension of bonus depreciation through 2019 and expect it to provide enterprise an additional $1.7 billion of cash during this period. Our investment program calls for 21% increase in capital spending to $11.5 billion for the 3 years ended 2018 from capital invested during the 3-year period ended 2015. Approximately 72% of that amount, or $8.3 billion over this time frame, will be invested by PSE&G on transmission and distribution infrastructure programs that customers will require for reliability. This level of investment is expected to yield growth in PSE&G's rate base for the 3 years ended 2018 of 10% per year, even after taking into account the impact of bonus depreciation on rate base. The remaining approximate 27% or $3.2 billion of expected capital investment will be made at Power. The majority of Power's investments will be devoted to expanding its position in new, efficient, clean gas-fired generating capacities, as mentioned already, all of which, Keys, C1 and Bridgeport Harbor are expected to exceed our long-standing and unchanged financial returns expectations. 
With our strong balance sheet, we remain in the position to increase our capital investment across the company. We have a robust pipeline of opportunities and plan on providing you with an update of our 5 year outlook for capital spending at our annual financial conference on March 11. In total, the investment program in PSE&G and Power are focused on meeting customer needs and market requirements, with an energy platform that is reliable, efficient and clean. The strategy we implemented is yielding growth for our shareholders as we have met the needs of our customers. The continued successful deployment of strong free cash flow and to customer-oriented regulated investment program is expected to support 14% growth in the utility's earnings to 60% of enterprises 2016 operating earnings as the results for the full year are forecast at $2.80 to $3 per share. Our guidance for 2016 takes into account the impact on demand from the continuation of unseasonably mild weather conditions in January and early February. The Board of Directors' recent decision to increase the common dividend by 5.1% to the indicative annual dividend of $1.64 per share is an expression of our confidence in our outlook, the continued growth of our regulated business and an acknowledgment of our strong financial position. We see the potential for consistent and sustainable growth in the dividend as an important means of returning cash to our shareholders. Of course, none of our success would be possible without the contribution made by PSEG's dedicated workforce. 
I look forward to discussing our investment outlook in greater detail with you on our March 11th annual financial conference, but for now, I'll turn the call over to Dan for more details on our operating results and we'll be available to answer your question after his remarks"

As Ralph said, PSEG reported operating earnings for the fourth quarter of $0.50 per share versus $0.49 per share for the fourth quarter of 2014. Earnings in the quarter brought operating earnings for the full year to $2.91 per share or 5.4% greater than 2014's operating earnings of $2.76 per share, and at the upper half of our guidance of $2.85 to $2.95 per share.  And on Slide 4, we provide you with a reconciliation of operating earnings to net income for the quarter. 
We've also provided you with information on Slide 10 regarding the contribution to operating earnings by business for the quarter. And Slides 11 and 13 contain waterfall charts that take you through the net changes, quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year changes in operating earnings by major business. And I'll review each company in more detail starting with PSE&G. PSE&G reported operating earnings for the fourth quarter of 2015 of $0.31 per share compared to $0.32 per share for the fourth quarter of 2014, and that's shown on Slide 15. PSE&G's full year 2015 operating earnings were $787 million or $1.55 per share compared with operating earnings of $725 million or $1.43 per share for 2014, reflecting a growth of 8.6%. PSE&G's earnings for the fourth quarter benefited from a return on its expanded capital program, which partially offset the impact of earnings from unseasonably mild weather conditions and an increase in operating expenses. PSE&G's return on unexpanded investment transmission and distribution programs increased quarter-over-quarter earnings by $0.03 per share. Mild weather conditions relative to normal and relative to last year reduced electric sales and lowered earnings comparisons by $0.01 per share. Recovery of gas revenue under the weather normalization clause offset the impact on earnings of abnormally warm weather on sales of gas. And higher expenses, including pension and other items, reduced quarter-over-quarter earnings comparisons by $0.03 per share. 
Economic conditions in the service area continued to improve. On a weather-normalized basis, gas deliveries are estimated to have increased 2.1% in the quarter and 2.2% for the year. Demand continues to benefit from an improving economy, and also from the impact of both commodity prices on customers' bills. Electric sales, on a weather-normalized basis, are estimated to have increased by 0.8% and 0.5% for the fourth quarter and for the year respectively. The estimated year-over-year growth and the electric sales is more representative of our long-term expectations for growth. PSE&G implemented a $146 million increase in Transmission revenue under the company's Transmission formula rate for 2016 on January 1. PSE&G investment in Transmission grew to $5.7 billion at the end of 2015 or 43% of the company's consolidated rate base of $13.4 billion at year-end. As you know, Transmission revenues are adjusted each year to reflect an update of data that was estimated in the Transmission formula rate filing. The adjustment for 2016, which we will file in mid-2017, will include the impact of the extension of bonus depreciation, which was executed after our Transmission formula rate filing. This adjustment will reduce Transmission revenue as filed by about $27 million, but we will accrue that for cutting purposes in anticipation of reduction of revenue as we report our 2016 results.  We are forecasting growth in PSE&G's operating earnings for 2016 to a range of $875 million to $925 million, and the forecast reflects the benefits of continued growth in PSE&G's rate base and a decline in pension expense. 
Turning to Power as shown on Slide 19, Power reported operating earnings for the fourth quarter of $0.19 per share compared to $0.18 per share a year ago. The results for the quarter brought Power's full year operating earnings to $653 million or $1.29 per share compared to 2014's operating earnings of $642 million or $1.27 per share. Power's adjusted EBITDA for the quarter and the year amounted to $235 million and $1.563 billion respectively, which compares to adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2014 of $271 million and adjusted EBITDA for the full year of 2014 of $1.584 billion. The earnings release as well as the earnings slides on Pages 11 and 13 provide you with a detailed analysis on the impact of Power's operating earnings quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year from changes in revenue and cost. And we've also provided more detail on generation for the quarter and for the year on Slides 21 and 22. 
Power's operating earnings in the fourth quarter reflect the impact of strong hedging and tight control on operating expenses, which offset any anticipated decline in capacity revenue and the impact of unseasonably warm weather on wholesale energy prices. A decline in capacity revenue associated with the May 2015 retirement of the high electric demand day, or ATDP peaking capacity in PGM, reduced quarter-over-quarter earning comparisons by $0.04 per share. Increase in the average price received on energy hedges, coupled with a decline in fuel cost, more than offset the impact on earnings from a reduction in gas sales. And these 2 items together netted to a quarter-over-quarter improvement in earnings of $0.02 per share. Power's O&M expense for the quarter was unchanged relative to year ago levels. And increase in depreciation expense and other miscellaneous items was more than offset by the absence of the charge in the year ago quarter resulting in net improvement in quarterly earnings comparisons of $0.03 per share. 
Turning to Power's operations, Power's output during the quarter was in line with year-ago levels. For the year, output increased 2% to 55.2 terawatt hours, and the level of production achieved by the fleet in 2015 represented the second-highest level of output in the fleet's history as a merchant generator. Also, supported the improvement in the fleet's availability and efficiency. The nuclear fleet operator had an average capacity factor of 90.4% for the year, producing 30 terawatt hours or 54% of total generation. Efficient cycle gas turbine capacity was rewarded in the market with an increase in dispatch levels. And Power CCG fleet set a record generation during the year at each of the stage and upping energy center set individual records. Output from the combined cycle fleet grew 11% to 18.4 terawatt hours or 33% of total output during the year. 
Lower market demand for our coal units, reduced output for those stations 5.8 terawatt hours per year or 11% of output. And lastly the fleet's peaking capacity produced just under 1 terawatt hour or 2% of output for the year. Power's gas-fired combined cycle fleet continues to benefit from its access to lower price gas supplies in the Marcellus region and for the year, gas from the Marcellus supplied 70% of the fuel requirements for the PJM gas-fired assets. This supply supports higher support spread than implied by market pricing and allowed Power fuel savings in the fourth quarter similar to the levels it enjoyed in the year-ago quarter despite weak energy prices. And for the full year, Power enjoyed positive spreads relative to the market, a year-over-year realized spreads in 2015 were lower than what was realized in 2014 given the decline in energy prices. 
Overall, Power's gross margin improved slightly to $38.83 per megawatt hour in fourth quarter versus $37.40 per megawatt hour in the year-ago quarter. And for the year, Power's gross margin amounted to $42.25  per megawatt versus $42.41 per megawatt hour last year. And Slide 24 provides detail on Power's gross margins for the quarter and for the year. Power's expecting output for 2016 remains unchanged at 54 to 56 terawatt hours. Following the completion of the Basic Generation Service for BGS auction in New Jersey earlier this month, Power has 100% of its 2016 baseload generation hedged. Approximately 70% to 75% of Power's anticipated total production is hedged on an average price of $51 per megawatt hour, and Power has hedged approximately 45% to 55% of its forecast generation in 2017 of 54 to 56 terawatt hours at an average price of $50 per megawatt hour. 
Looking forward to 2018, Power's forecasting an improvement in output of 59 to 61 terawatt hours with the commercial start up in mid-2018 of the Keys and Sewaren stations that Ralph mentioned earlier. Approximately 15% to 20% of 2018's output is hedged at an average price of $54 per megawatt hour, and Power's BGS volumes will continue to represent approximately 11 to 12 terawatt hours of deliveries. And this number is very consistent with the 11.5 terawatt hours of deliveries we saw in 2015 under the BGS contract. Our average hedge position at this point in time, represents a slightly smaller percentage of hedged versus what you saw a year ago, and at that time, Power is able to take advantage of market prices influenced by the colder than normal weather conditions over last winter. Average hedge pricing includes the impact of recently concluded  BGS auction. And the auction for the 3-year period beginning June 1, 2016 ending May 31, 2019, was priced at $96.38 per megawatt hour in the zone. This contract for 1/3 of the load will replace the 2013 contract for $92.18 per megawatt hour which expires on May 31, 2016. And we do remind you from time to time that there are items included in the average hedge price which influence Power's revenue but don't support Power's gross margin. Our average hedge price for 2016 a $51 per megawatt reflects an increase in the cost of elements such as Transmission and renewables associated with serving our full requirements hedge obligations. Based on our current hedge position for 2016, each $2 change in spark spreads will impact earnings by about $0.04 per share. 
Power's operating earnings for 2016 are forecasted at a range of 490 -- $490 million to $540 million. That forecast includes an adjusted EBITDA of $1.320 billion to $1.4 billion. The forecast reflects a year-over-year decline in capacity revenues associated with the May 2015 retirement of the ATTD peaking capacity. Operating earnings for the year will also be influenced by the recontracting of hedges at lower average price and a decline in gas sales, and most of the decline in Power's operating earnings forecast for the full year 2016 is expected to be experienced in the early part of 2016. With respect to Enterprise and Other, we reported operating earnings in the fourth quarter of $4 million which compares to a loss in operating earnings of $4 million or $0.01 per share for the fourth quarter of 2014, and results for the fourth quarter brought full year 2015 operating earnings to $36 million or $0.07 per share compared with 2014's operating earnings of $33 million or $0.06 per share. The difference in quarter-over-quarter operating earnings reflects the absence of prior year tax adjustments, as well as other parent-related expenses in 2015.  For the year, PSEG Long Island's earnings contributions of $0.02 per share was in line with expectations. And looking forward to 2016, operating earnings for PSEG Enterprise and Other are forecast at $60 million. 
Next, I want to provide an update on our pension. Beginning with 2016, PSEG has elected to measure service and interest cost per pension and other postretirement benefits by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve to the plan's liability cash flows rather than the prior use of a single weighted average rate. We believe the new approach provides a precise measurement of service and interest cost by aligning the timing of the plan's liability cash flows to the corresponding spot rates on the yield curve. The change does not affect the measurement of the plan obligations, and we estimate this change will reduce 2016 pension and OPEB expense by approximately $34 million and $13 million respectively net of amounts capitalized from what would have been without this change. On a year-over-year basis, the pension expense is expected to decline -- pension and OPEB expense is expected to decline by $25 million from 2015's level of expense. 
We ended 2015 with 91% of our pension obligations funded and minimum need of cash funding of obligations over the next several years. With respect to our financial condition, that remains strong. We closed 2015 with $394 million of cash on hand and debt representing 43% of our consolidated capital position and debt at Power representing 27% of our capital base. PSEG's capital program for the 3 years ended 2018 is currently expected to approximate 11.5 billion. This represents a 21% increase over the level of capital investment over the prior 3-year period as PSE&G can Power focus on modernizing their Infrastructure to meet the needs of today's marketplace. We have ample capacity to finance our current capital program. In addition, we estimate that the change in bonus depreciation, as Ralph mentioned, will provide an additional $1.7 billion of cash through 2019, with most of this cash received under the 3 years ending 2018. And of this amount, $1.2 billion of the cash will be on PSE&G and $500 million will be at Power. And as mentioned, our forecast for double-digit growth in PSE&G's rate base through 2018 does take into account the impact of bonus depreciation on rate base. And we plan to provide an updated 5-year view of capital spending at the annual conference on March 11. 
So regarding to earnings for 2016 of $2.80 to $3 per share in line with our 2015 operating results as forecast growth at PSE&G offsets the impact of lower energy prices on Power's operating earnings. The company remains on solid footing, and we continue to focus on operational excellence, remain disciplined in our approach to investment strategy and maintain our financial strength. Common dividend was recently increased 5.1% to the indicative annual level of $1.64 per share and we believe we can provide shareholders with consistent and sustainable growth in the dividend going forward. 
And with that, we're ready to answer your questions."

So you can track the green costs and the New Jersey SREX and you can track the transmission. I think the BPU even sent out some of the Transmission costs and they ultimately get embedded in.

I'm talking about replacing the cast iron. We'd like to break away from this incremental approach and into more of a long standing approach. If for no other reason that it would be beneficial to develop the infrastructure, primarily people, that will need to sustain these programs, right. So right now, the way we run the programs is we work with contractors and we bring in folks that are needed and we enter into this conversation 6 months before the program expires. But will you need more? Am not sure, we have to wait until basis points ask, when can you find out? I'll get back to you as soon as possible. And that's not the way we typically run a 110-year-old company. We like to have training programs bring people and as an apprentice and has climbed the technical ladder and have a nice, long career, and that's a much more efficient way to use customer rates. So I think that program in particular could be a template for the type of ongoing things we want to do. A close second to that, as you may recall, Energy Strong, we have put forth a 10 year plan that got approved for 3 years, and some of the cleaner technologies, whether it's solar or energy efficiency that will be needed to meet the state's own renewables target portfolio or whatever becomes of CPP and whatever reincarnation it takes. I think all lend themselves to more problematic and long-standing programs that we can anticipate and rationally equip ourselves to execute. So those conversations are going above the board staff now. And to their credit, the response is well, you should have confidence, you, and 14 times and 14 times we said yes, and that's true. So the question is how much of an investment risk are you willing to make an equipment and training programs and people. Yes, it's pretty much assured but has different forms, right. Half the program, half the duration, maybe 3/4 of the run rate. So it's a very constructive dialogue right now to be continued."

And simply in our coal assets, we have [indiscernible]  which this slide, rightfully described as base load, and Bridgeport stations has become more peaking with Hudson and Mercer having additional flexibility to be able to run on gas. So it's not just a question of fuel diversity, it is what part in the dispatch queue the asset can play and whether its start/stop features and in that respect, our diversity is served as well. Now you probably picked up that we would anticipate retiring the Bridgeport Harbor coal unit in 5 years provided that we are successful at securing the permits for the new 500 minus combined cycle unit at Bridgeport Harbor, which we don't anticipate any difficulties in doing so given the community benefits agreement we achieved with this important stakeholder groups in Bridgeport.

Secondly, the complement that Power need to provide on the customer bill is a huge advantage to us. And the support cost synergies that exist between the 2 companies are big advantage to us as well. But as Power grows in New England and as it grows in New York state and in other places, it really to use its own FFO for investment opportunities and that free cash flow that remains help the utility will be decreased.

There's not a refueling outage like you see out of a nuclear plant where you have to shut the unit down to refuel it but periodically there's a major maintenance that goes on in these facilities, where the unit needs to be worked on. I think we have the advantage as well with the new units that we have of having a kind of clean and new unit that won't have that effect for a period of time when it starts up."

So we've talked a lot about, hey, we're building 3 combined cycle units and let's make sure we have the team in place to manage those because they're not all within a city block of each other. We got one in Maryland, one in New Jersey, one in Connecticut. I spent 1.5 hours yesterday with our head of fossil talking about what his needs are, how we can make sure that those are met. So I'd say, in general it's mandates that don't produce the customer or shareholder benefit that the regulator thinks that they do. Fortunately, most of those are behind us. And to the extent that if we didn't respond to the expanded construction program in Power, I would be nervous about that. But we are responding.

But really, I hope there are 3 key points you take away from what Dan and I talked about. So first of all, we are genuinely excited about Power's positioning. We've long had low-cost nuclear, and we've had a pretty good, highly efficient combined cycle fleet but in 3 years, we've been have just an outstanding highly efficient combined cycle fleet. And all of our assets are going to be well-positioned. And, I mean, well-positioned in the broadest sense of the word. There will be near load, it will be clean, there will be diverse fleet. We'll continue to look at opportunities to improve upon that fleet, but you really should recognize that we've talked for a long time now about these 3 new units, and I don't foresee any circumstances at present that would suggest any additional new build on the horizon for us. Second point is the utility growth continues. I mean we averaged 13% growth over the last 5 years and if you just take our '15 results in the midpoint of the utility guidance for '16, we're going to grow it 14%. And yet utility builds go down yet again this year because the expiration of some charges. So the utility will represent 16% of earnings at that point and it's doing stuff that's a very important to customers, and we'll just continue marching along that path. 
So we had a good year is the final point, and I think you will find that when we get together on March 11, the next 5 years look even better. So look forward to explaining that further when we see you in New York. Thanks, everyone."

This morning, we reported operating earnings for the full year 2015, and I'm pleased to report that it was a year of significant accomplishment. 
As you saw this morning, we reported operating earnings for the fourth quarter of $0.50 per share versus $0.49 per share earned in the fourth quarter of 2014 despite the unseasonably mild weather this past December. Results for the full year were $2.91 per share or 5% greater than 2014's operating earnings of $2.76 per share. This is at the upper half of our guidance of $2.85 to $2.95 per share, and it was also higher than the midpoint of our original guidance of $2.85 per share. 
Our results reflect the benefits of excellent performance and robust organic growth, which offset the impact of low energy prices on earnings. We have continued to successfully deploy our strong free cash flow into customer-oriented investment programs that have supported growth. 2015's operating earnings represented the third year of growth in earnings. 
Now let me just mention a few of the year's highlight. PSE&G was named Electric Light & Power's Utility of the Year and was named the Most Reliable Utility in the Mid-Atlantic for the 14th consecutive year. But we're not resting on those laurels. PSE&G invested approximately $2.7 billion during 2015 on programs to further enhance the system's resiliency and its reliability. During the year, PSE&G placed into service key backbone transmission lines such as the Susquehanna-Roseland line as well as at the Mickleton-Gloucester-Camden line, which is designed to meet the need of customers today and well into the future. PSE&G invested over $550 million on programs under its $1.2 billion Energy Strong initiative. These programs are designed to strengthen and protect the electric and gas distribution systems from the impacts of extreme weather. 
During the year, PSE&G also received approval from the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities to invest an additional $95 million in its award-winning energy efficiency programs and to continue the work we got under Energy Strong, replacing aging cast iron natural gas pipe. The $905 million Gas System Modernization Program represented the 14th multiyear investment program approved by the BPU since PSE&G's last base rate case, and this speaks to the state's support of infrastructure investment that meets the needs of customers. PSE&G's investment program supported recovery -- revenue recovery mechanisms and tight control of O&M expenses have provided growth in PSE&G's operating earnings of approximately 13% per year for the 5-year period ended 2015. During this period PSE&G's rate base expanded at a rate of 11% per year, and importantly, we have been able to support this growth as customer builds have declined. 
But 2015 was not just a year of PSE&G accomplishment. PSE&G Power's strong operating performance supported earnings in line with guidance for the full year despite very difficult market conditions. The nuclear fleet operated at a capacity factor of greater than 90% for the year and accounted for 54% of the fleet's output. Power's gas-fired combustion turbine fleet set a new record for output. This improves on the prior record established in 2014. The fleet's performance is benefiting from investments that have improved its efficiency, increased its capacity and provided greater access to low-cost gas supplies. The flexibility and diversity of Power's fleet have allowed us to provide approximately $500 million of positive free cash flow in 2015, even during soft energy market conditions. 
Power also plans to invest $2 billion over the next 3 to 4 years to add approximately 1,800 megawatts of new, efficient combined cycle gas-fired turbine efficiency. That's at turbine capacity. The Keys Energy Station, which is located in Southwestern MAAC will extend Power's footprint in this core PJM market. A new efficient unit at the Sewaren station in New Jersey will replace old inefficiency in capacity. And after clearing the most recent capacity auction in New England, Power will construct a new 485-megawatt combined cycle unit at its existing Bridgeport Harbor station site, giving us unenviable and growing position in both energy and capacity markets in Southwestern Connecticut.  
The addition of these units will transform Power's generation mix as its ownership of efficient, reliable gas-fired capacity will grow to exceed 5,000 megawatts in 2019. At that time, the combined cycle gas turbine fleet will surpass the size of Power's ownership in nuclear capacity and secure Power's position as the low-cost generator with modern, flexible, clean assets that remain capable of meeting the demands for reliability in today's market. 
Power also grew its investment in contracted solar energy. In 2015, Power added 2 projects representing an investment of approximately $75 million in utility-scale grid-connected solar energy. And earlier this year, Power announced that it will invest an additional $150 million in 3 projects that bring its portfolio of solar projects to 240 megawatts-dc of clean renewable energy. 
All projects in this portfolio are under long-term contracts with credit-worthy customers. So as you can see, we continue to explore opportunities to expand and optimize Power's fleet. Although I will add that we do not see any new generation build in the foreseeable future, although you never say never, but we don't plan any at this point in time. 
Our balance sheet continues to provide us with a competitive advantage to finance our capital program without the need to excess the equity markets. We ended 2015 with strong credit metrics, and the extension of bonus depreciation through 2019 is expected to provide Enterprise with an additional $1.7 billion of cash during this period. Our investment program calls for 21% increase in capital spending to $11.5 billion for the 3 years ended 2018 from capital invested during the 3-year period ended 2015. Approximately 72% of that amount, or $8.3 billion over this time frame, will be invested by PSE&G on transmission and distribution infrastructure programs that customers will require for reliability. This level of investment is expected to yield growth in PSE&G's rate base for the 3 years ended 2018 of 10% per year, even after taking into account the impact of bonus depreciation on rate base. The remaining approximate 27% or $3.2 billion of expected capital investment will be made at Power. The majority of Power's investments will be devoted to expanding its position in new, efficient, clean gas-fired generating capacities, as I mentioned already. All of which, Keys, Sewaren and Bridgeport Harbor are expected to exceed our long-standing and unchanged financial returns expectations. 
With our strong balance sheet, we remain in the position to increase our capital investment across the company. We have a robust pipeline of opportunities and plan on providing you with an update of our 5 year outlook for capital spending at our annual financial conference on March 11. 
In total, the investment programs at PSE&G and Power are focused on meeting customer needs and market requirements, with an energy platform that is reliable, efficient and clean. The strategy we implemented is yielding growth for our shareholders as we have met the needs of our customers. The continued successful deployment of strong free cash flow and the customer-oriented regulated investment program is expected to support 14% growth in Utility's earnings to 60% of Enterprise's 2016 operating earnings as the results for the full year are forecast at $2.80 to $3 per share. 
Our guidance for 2016 takes into account the impact on demand from the continuation of unseasonably mild weather conditions in January and early February. The Board of Directors' recent decision to increase the common dividend by 5.1% to the indicative annual level of $1.64 per share is an expression of our confidence in our outlook, the continued growth of our regulated business and an acknowledgment of our strong financial position. We see the potential for consistent and sustainable growth in the dividend as an important means of returning cash to our shareholders. Of course, none of our success would be possible without the contribution made by PSEG's dedicated workforce. 
I look forward to discussing our investment outlook in greater detail with you at our March 11th annual financial conference. But for now, I'll turn the call over to Dan for more details on our operating results, and we'll be available to answer your questions after his remarks."

As Ralph said, PSEG reported operating earnings for the fourth quarter of $0.50 per share versus $0.49 per share for the fourth quarter of 2014. Earnings in the quarter brought operating earnings for the full",2326,"Thank you, Ralph, and good morning, everyone. As Ralph said, PSEG reported operating earnings for the fourth quarter of $0.50 per share versus $0.49 per share for the fourth quarter of 2014. Earnings in the quarter brought operating earnings for the full year to $2.91 per share or 5.4% greater than 2014's operating earnings of $2.76 per share, and at the upper half of our guidance of $2.85 to $2.95 per share.  And on Slide 4, we provided you with a reconciliation of operating earnings to net income for the quarter. 
We've also provided you with information on Slide 10 regarding the contribution to operating earnings by business for the quarter. And Slides 11 and 13 contain waterfall charts that take you through the net changes, and quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year changes in operating earnings by major business. And I'll review each company in more detail starting with PSE&G. 
PSE&G reported operating earnings for the fourth quarter of 2015 of $0.31 per share compared to $0.32 per share for the fourth quarter of 2014, and that's shown on Slide 15. PSE&G's full year 2015 operating earnings were $787 million or $1.55 per share compared with operating earnings of $725 million or $1.43 per share for 2014, reflecting a growth of 8.6%. PSE&G's earnings for the fourth quarter benefited from a return on its expanded capital program, which partially offset the impact of earnings from unseasonably mild weather conditions and an increase in operating expenses. PSE&G's return on the expanded investment in transmission and distribution programs increased quarter-over-quarter earnings by $0.03 per share. Mild weather conditions relative to normal and relative to last year reduced electric sales and lowered earnings comparisons by $0.01 per share. Recovery of gas revenue under the weather normalization clause offset the impact on earnings of the abnormally warm weather on sales of gas. And higher expenses, including pension and other items, reduced quarter-over-quarter earnings comparisons by $0.03 per share. 
Economic conditions in the service area continued to improve. On a weather-normalized basis, gas deliveries are estimated to have increased 2.1% in the quarter and 2.2% for the year. Demand continues to benefit from an improving economy, and also from the impact of world commodity prices on customers' bills. Electric sales, on a weather-normalized basis, are estimated to have increased by 0.8% and 0.5% for the fourth quarter and for the year, respectively. The estimated year-over-year growth on electric sales is more representative of our long-term expectations for growth. 
PSE&G implemented a $146 million increase in Transmission revenue under the company's Transmission formula rate for 2016 on January 1. PSE&G's investment in Transmission grew to $5.7 billion at the end of 2015 or 43% of the company's consolidated rate base of $13.4 billion at year-end. As you know, Transmission revenues are adjusted each year to reflect an update of data that was estimated in the Transmission formula rate filing. The adjustment for 2016, which we will file in mid-2017, will include the impact of the extension of bonus depreciation, which was executed after our Transmission formula rate filing. This adjustment will reduce Transmission revenue as filed by about $27 million, but we will accrue that for accounting purposes in anticipation of the reduction of revenue as we report our 2016 results.  
We are forecasting growth in PSE&G's operating earnings for 2016 to a range of $875 million to $925 million, and the forecast reflects the benefits of continued growth in PSE&G's rate base and a decline in pension expense. 
Turning to Power. As shown on Slide 19, Power reported operating earnings for the fourth quarter of $0.19 per share compared to $0.18 per share a year ago. The results for the quarter brought Power's full year operating earnings to $653 million or $1.29 per share compared to 2014's operating earnings of $642 million or $1.27 per share. Power's adjusted EBITDA for the quarter and the year amounted to $235 million and $1.563 billion, respectively, which compares to adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2014 of $271 million and adjusted EBITDA for the full year of 2014 of $1.584 billion. 
The earnings release as well as the earnings slides on Pages 11 and 13 provide you with a detailed analysis of the impact on Power's operating earnings quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year from changes in revenue and cost. And we've also provided more detail on generation for the quarter and for the year on Slides 21 and 22. 
Power's operating earnings in the fourth quarter reflect the impact of strong hedging and tight control on operating expenses, which offset any anticipated decline in capacity revenue and the impact of unseasonably warm weather on wholesale energy prices. A decline in capacity revenue is associated with the May 2015 retirement of the high electric demand day or HEDD peaking capacity in PJM, reduced quarter-over-quarter earning comparisons by $0.04 per share. Increase in the average price received on energy hedges, coupled with a decline in fuel cost, more than offset the impact on earnings from a reduction in gas sales. And these 2 items together netted to a quarter-over-quarter improvement in earnings of $0.02 per share. 
Power's O&M expense for the quarter was unchanged relative to year ago levels. And an increase in depreciation expense and other miscellaneous items was more than offset by the absence of the charge in the year-ago quarter resulting in a net improvement in quarterly earnings comparisons of $0.03 per share. 
Turning to Power's operations, Power's output during the quarter was in line with year-ago levels. For the year, output increased 2% to 55.2 terawatt hours. And the level of production achieved by the fleet in 2015 represented the second-highest level of output in the fleet's history as a merchant generator, also, supported by improvements in the fleet's availability and efficiency. The nuclear fleet operator had an average capacity factor of 90.4% for the year, producing 30 terawatt hours or 54% of total generation. Efficient combined cycle gas turbine capacity was rewarded in the market with an increase in dispatch levels. And Power's CCGT  fleet set a generation record during the year and each of the winning station end up on energy center set individual records. Output from the combined cycle fleet grew 11% to 18.4 terawatt hours or 33% of total output during the year. Lower market demand for our coal units reduced output from those stations to 5.8 terawatt hours per year or 11% of output. And lastly, the fleet's peaking capacity produced just under 1 terawatt hour or 2% of output for the year. 
Power's gas-fired combined cycle fleet continues to benefit from its access to lower price gas supplies in the Marcellus region. And for the year, gas from the Marcellus supplied 75% of the fuel requirements for the PJM gas-fired assets. This supply supports higher support spread than implied by market pricing and allowed Power to enjoy fuel cost savings in the fourth quarter, similar to the levels it enjoyed in the year-ago quarter despite weak energy prices. And for the full year, Power enjoyed positive spreads relative to the market, a year-over-year realized spark spread in 2015, were lower than what was realized in 2014 given the decline in energy prices. 
Overall, Power's gross margin improved slightly to $38.83 per megawatt hour in fourth quarter versus $37.40 per megawatt hour in the year-ago quarter. And for the year, Power's gross margin amounted to $42.25  per megawatt versus the $42.41 per megawatt hour last year. And Slide 24 provides detail on Power's gross margins for the quarter and for the year. Power's expecting output for 2016 remains unchanged at 54 to 56 terawatt hours. Following the completion of the Basic Generation Service or BGS auction in New Jersey earlier this month, Power has 100% of its 2016 baseload generation hedged. Approximately 70% to 75% of Power's anticipated total production is hedged on an average price of $51 per megawatt hour, and Power has hedged approximately 45% to 55% of its forecast generation in 2017 of 54 to 56 terawatt hours at an average price of $50 per megawatt hour. 
Looking forward to 2018, Power's forecasting an improvement in output of 59 to 61 terawatt hours, with the commercial start-up in mid-2018 of the Keys and Sewaren stations that Ralph mentioned earlier. Approximately 15% to 20% of 2018's output is hedged at an average price of $54 per megawatt hour. And Power assumes BGS volumes will continue to represent approximately 11 to 12 terawatt hours of deliveries. And this number is very consistent with the 11.5 terawatt hours of deliveries we saw in 2015 under the BGS contract. 
Our average hedge position at this point in time represents a slightly smaller percentage of output hedged versus what you saw a year ago. And at that time, Power is able to take advantage of market prices influenced by the colder-than-normal weather conditions of last winter. Average hedge pricing includes the impact of recently concluded  BGS auction. And the auction for the 3-year period beginning June 1, 2016 ending May 31, 2019, was priced at $96.38 per megawatt hour in the peer zone. This contract for 1/3 of the load will replace the 2013 contract for $92.18 per megawatt hour, which expires on May 31, 2016. 
And we do remind you from time to time that there are items included in the average hedge price which influence Power's revenue, but don't support Power's gross margin. Our average hedge price for 2016 of $51 per megawatt reflects an increase in the cost of elements such as transmission and renewables associated with serving our full requirements hedge obligations. And based on our current hedge position for 2016, each $2 change in spark spreads will impact earnings by about $0.04 per share. 
Power's operating earnings for 2016 are forecasted at a range of $490 million to $540 million. That forecast includes an adjusted EBITDA of $1.320 billion to $1.4 billion. The forecast reflects a year-over-year decline in capacity revenues associated with the May 2015 retirement of the HEDD peaking capacity. Operating earnings for the year will also be influenced by the recontracting of hedges at lower average price and a decline in gas sales. And most of the decline in Power's operating earnings forecast for the full year 2016 is expected to be experienced in the early part of 2016. 
With respect to Enterprise and Other, we reported operating earnings in the fourth quarter of $4 million, which compares to a loss in operating earnings of $4 million or $0.01 per share for the fourth quarter of 2014. And results for the fourth quarter brought full year 2015 operating earnings to $36 million or $0.07 per share compared with 2014's operating earnings of $33 million or $0.06 per share. The difference in quarter-over-quarter operating earnings reflects the absence of prior year tax adjustments as well as other parent-related expenses in 2015.  For the year, PSEG-Long Island's earnings contributions of $0.02 per share was in line with expectations. And looking forward to 2016, operating earnings for PSEG Enterprise and Other are forecast at $60 million. 
Next, I want to provide an update on our pension. Beginning with 2016, PSEG has elected to measure service and interest cost per pension and other postretirement benefits by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve to the plan's liability cash flows rather than the prior use of a single-weighted average rate. We believe the new approach provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by aligning the timing of the plan's liability cash flows to the corresponding spot rates on the yield curve. The change does not affect the measurement of the plan obligations. And we estimate this change will reduce 2016 pension and OPEB expense by approximately $34 million and $13 million, respectively, net of amounts capitalized from what would have been without this change. On a year-over-year basis, the pension expense is expected to decline -- pension and OPEB expense is expected to decline by $25 million from 2015's level of expense. We ended 2015 with 91% of our pension obligations funded and minimal need for cash funding of obligations over the next several years. 
With respect to our financial condition, that remains strong. We closed 2015 with $394 million of cash on hand and debt representing 43% of our consolidated capital position and debt at Power representing 27% of our capital base. PSEG's capital program for the 3 years ended 2018 is currently expected to approximate 11.5 billion. This represents a 21% increase over the level of capital invested over the prior 3-year period as PSE&G and Power focus on modernizing their infrastructure to meet the needs of today's marketplace. 
We have ample capacity to finance our current capital program. In addition, we estimate that the change in bonus depreciation, as Ralph mentioned, will provide an additional $1.7 billion of cash through 2019, with most of this cash received over the 3 years ending 2018. And of this amount, $1.2 billion of the cash will be at PSE&G and $500 million will be at Power. And as mentioned, our forecast for double-digit growth in PSE&G's rate base through 2018 does take into account the impact of bonus depreciation on rate base. And we plan to provide an updated 5-year view of capital spending at the annual conference on March 11. 
Regarding to earnings for 2016 of $2.80 to $3 per share, in line with our 2015 operating results, as forecast growth at PSE&G offsets the impact of lower energy prices on Power's operating earnings. The company remains on solid footing, and we continue to focus on operational excellence, remain disciplined in our approach to investment strategy and maintain our financial strength. 
Common dividend was recently increased 5.1% to the indicative annual level of $1.64 per share. And we believe we can provide shareholders with consistent and sustainable growth in the dividend going forward. 
And with that, we are ready to answer your questions."

I'm talking about replacing the cast iron. But we'd like to break away from this incremental approach and into more of a long-standing approach. If for no other reason that it would be beneficial to develop the infrastructure, primarily, people, that one needs to sustain these programs, right. So right now, the way we run the programs is we work with contractors and we bring in the folks that are needed and we enter into this conversation 6 months before the program expires. But will you need more? I'm not quite sure. Well, we have to wait until BPU acts. So when can you find out? I'll get back to you as soon as possible. And that's not the way we typically run a 110-year-old company. We like to have training programs, bringing people in as an apprentice and have them climb the technical ladder and have a nice, long career. And that's a much more efficient way to use customer rates. And so I think that program in particular could be a template for the type of ongoing things we want to do. A close second to that, as you may recall, Energy Strong, we had put forth a 10-year plan that got approved for 3 years, and some of the cleaner technologies, whether it's solar or energy efficiency that will be needed to meet the state's own renewable portfolio standard or what eventually becomes of CPP [ph] and whatever carnation it takes -- reincarnation it takes. I think all lend themselves to more programmatic and long-standing programs that we can anticipate and rationally equip ourselves to execute. So those conversations are going on with the board staff now. And to their credit, their response is, well, you should have confidence. You come in 14 times, and 14 times we said yes. And that's true. So the question is how much of an investment risk are you willing to make in equipment and training programs and people. Well, yes, it's pretty much assured but has different forms, right. Half the program, half the duration, maybe 3/4 of the run rate. So it's a very constructive dialogue right now to be continued."

So, obviously, gas, we have some combined cycle gas turbines, which, once upon a time, we called load [indiscernible], which are looking more and more like base load. But we also have a pretty robust and healthy peaking fleet. And similarly, our coal assets, we have Keystone, which are rightfully described as base load. And [indiscernible] Hudson, Mercer and Bridgeport stations had become more peaking with Hudson and Mercer having the additional flexibility to be able to run on gas. So it's not just a question of fuel diversity, it's what part in the dispatch queue the asset can play and whether its start/stop features. And in that respect, our diversity is served as well. Now you probably picked up that we would anticipate retiring the Bridgeport Harbor coal unit in 5 years provided that we are successful at securing the permits for the new 500 minus combined cycle unit at Bridgeport Harbor, which we don't anticipate any difficulties in doing so, given the community benefits agreement we achieved with this important stakeholder groups in Bridgeport.

But I think as you do look forward, we will see a shift in fleet and maybe that's kind of what your question is getting at. We got 3 new efficient combined cycle plants, and if you look backwards, I said in some of my remarks that we have some of our HEDD units. Those were older peaking units that were retired from environmental purposes, and they're going to be replaced by new, efficient combined cycle clean gas units. So the fleet really will take on a different look into the future and will be more efficient. And we'll have a better profile and be more competitive in the market."

We've talked about Power's new plants, but for the past 5 years and for the next 5 years, it looks like the Utility will be outspending Power almost 3:1, and Power's a great source of equity for that with its funds from operation. Secondly, the complement that Power and Utility provide on the customer bill is a huge advantage to us. And the support cost synergies that exist between the 2 companies are a big advantage to us as well. But as Power grows in New England and as it grows in New York state and in other places, it will lead to use its own FFO for investment opportunities, and that free cash flow that remains -- help the Utility will be decreased. There'll be more customers that it'll be serving outside of the Utility's territories, so that complementary nature will decrease.

So I don't think anyone would ever accuse us of being bullish or undisciplined in how we spend our money. So -- and the good news is that most of that environmental spending is behind us. So we've talked a lot about, hey, we're building 3 combined cycle units and let's make sure we have the team in place to manage those, because they're not all within a city block of each other. We got one in Maryland, one in New Jersey, one in Connecticut. And I spent 1.5 hours yesterday with our head of fossil, talking about what his needs are, how we can make sure that those are met. So I'd say, in general, it's mandates that don't produce the customer or shareholder benefit that the regulator thinks that they do. Fortunately, most of those are behind us. And to the extent that if we didn't respond to the expanded construction program in Power, I would be nervous about that. But we are responding. And I guess, the proof that I'd put forth for you on that is we have quadrupled in the past 5 years that transmission program and we've delivered those projects on schedule and on budget. So..."

But really, I hope there are 3 key points you take away from what Dan and I talked about. So first of all, we are genuinely excited about Power's positioning. We've long had low-cost nuclear, and we've had a pretty good, highly efficient combined cycle fleet, but in 3 years, we're going to have just an outstanding highly efficient combined cycle fleet. And all of our assets are going to be well positioned. And I mean, well positioned in the broadest sense of the word. They'll be near load. They'll be clean. They'll be diverse fleet. And we'll continue to look at opportunities to improve upon that fleet, but you really should recognize that we've talked for a long time now about these 3 new units, and I don't foresee any circumstances at present that would suggest any additional new build on the horizon for us. Second point is the Utility growth continues. I mean, we averaged 13% growth over the last 5 years. And if you just take our '15 results in the midpoint of the Utility guidance for '16, we're going to grow it 14%. And yet Utility builds will go down yet again this year because of the expiration of some charges. So the Utility will represent 16% of earnings at the midpoint, and it's doing stuff that is very important to customers. And we'll just continue marching along that path. 
So we had a good year is the final point, and I think you'll find that when we get together on March 11, that our next 5 years will look even better. So I look forward to explaining that further when we see you in New York. Thanks, everyone."

This morning, we reported operating earnings for the full year 2015, and I'm pleased to report that it was a year of significant accomplishment. 
As you saw this morning, we reported operating earnings for the fourth quarter of $0.50 per share versus $0.49 per share earned in the fourth quarter of 2014 despite the unseasonably mild weather this past December. Results for the full year were $2.91 per share or 5% greater than 2014's operating earnings of $2.76 per share. This is at the upper half of our guidance of $2.85 to $2.95 per share, and it was also higher than the midpoint of our original guidance of $2.85 per share. 
Our results reflect the benefits of excellent performance and robust organic growth, which offset the impact of low energy prices on earnings. We have continued to successfully deploy our strong free cash flow into customer-oriented investment programs that have supported growth. 2015's operating earnings represented the third year of growth in earnings. 
Now let me just mention a few of the year's highlight. PSE&G was named Electric Light & Power's Utility of the Year and was named the Most Reliable Utility in the Mid-Atlantic for the 14th consecutive year. But we're not resting on those laurels. PSE&G invested approximately $2.7 billion during 2015 on programs to further enhance the system's resiliency and its reliability. During the year, PSE&G placed into service key backbone transmission lines such as the Susquehanna-Roseland line as well as at the Mickleton-Gloucester-Camden line, which is designed to meet the need of customers today and well into the future. PSE&G invested over $550 million on programs under its $1.2 billion Energy Strong initiative. These programs are designed to strengthen and protect the electric and gas distribution systems from the impacts of extreme weather. 
During the year, PSE&G also received approval from the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities to invest an additional $95 million in its award-winning energy efficiency programs and to continue the work begun under Energy Strong, replacing aging cast iron natural gas pipe. The $905 million Gas System Modernization Program represented the 14th multiyear investment program approved by the BPU since PSE&G's last base rate case, and this speaks to the state's support of infrastructure investment that meets the needs of customers. PSE&G's investment program, supportive recovery -- revenue recovery mechanisms and tight control of O&M expenses have provided growth in PSE&G's operating earnings of approximately 13% per year for the 5-year period ended 2015. During this period PSE&G's rate base expanded at a rate of 11% per year, and importantly, we have been able to support this growth as customer bills have declined. 
But 2015 was not just a year of PSE&G accomplishment. PSEG Power's strong operating performance supported earnings in line with guidance for the full year despite very difficult market conditions. The nuclear fleet operated at a capacity factor of greater than 90% for the year and accounted for 54% of the fleet's output. Power's gas-fired combustion turbine fleet set a new record for output. This improves on the prior record established in 2014. The fleet's performance is benefiting from investments that have improved its efficiency, increased its capacity and provided greater access to low-cost gas supplies. The flexibility and diversity of Power's fleet have allowed it to provide approximately $500 million of positive free cash flow in 2015, even during soft energy market conditions. 
Power also plans to invest $2 billion over the next 3 to 4 years to add approximately 1,800 megawatts of new, efficient combined cycle gas-fired turbine efficiency. That's at turbine capacity. The Keys Energy Station, which is located in Southwestern MAAC will extend Power's footprint in this core PJM market. A new efficient unit at the Sewaren station in New Jersey will replace old inefficiency in capacity. And after clearing the most recent capacity auction in New England, Power will construct a new 485-megawatt combined cycle unit at its existing Bridgeport Harbor station site, giving us an enviable and growing position in both energy and capacity markets in Southwestern Connecticut.  
The addition of these units will transform Power's generation mix as its ownership of efficient, reliable gas-fired capacity will grow to exceed 5,000 megawatts in 2019. At that time, the combined cycle gas turbine fleet will surpass the size of Power's ownership in nuclear capacity and secure Power's position as a low-cost generator with modern, flexible, clean assets that remain capable of meeting the demands for reliability in today's market. 
Power also grew its investment in contracted solar energy. In 2015, Power added 2 projects representing an investment of approximately $75 million in utility-scale grid-connected solar energy. And earlier this year, Power announced that it will invest an additional $150 million in 3 projects that bring its portfolio of solar projects to 240 megawatts-dc of clean renewable energy. 
All projects in this portfolio are under long-term contracts with credit-worthy customers. So as you can see, we continue to explore opportunities to expand and optimize Power's fleet. Although I will add that we do not see any new generation build in the foreseeable future, although you never say never, but we don't plan any at this point in time. 
Our balance sheet continues to provide us with a competitive advantage to finance our capital program without the need to access the equity markets. We ended 2015 with strong credit metrics, and the extension of bonus depreciation through 2019 is expected to provide Enterprise with an additional $1.7 billion of cash during this period. Our investment program calls for a 21% increase in capital spending to $11.5 billion for the 3 years ended 2018 from capital invested during the 3-year period ended 2015. Approximately 72% of that amount, or $8.3 billion over this time frame, will be invested by PSE&G on transmission and distribution infrastructure programs that customers will require for reliability. This level of investment is expected to yield growth in PSE&G's rate base for the 3 years ended 2018 of 10% per year, even after taking into account the impact of bonus depreciation on rate base. The remaining approximate 27% or $3.2 billion of expected capital investment will be made at Power. The majority of Power's investments will be devoted to expanding its position in new, efficient, clean gas-fired generating capacities, as I mentioned already. All of which, Keys, Sewaren and Bridgeport Harbor are expected to exceed our long-standing and unchanged financial returns expectations. 
With our strong balance sheet, we remain in a position to increase our capital investment across the company. We have a robust pipeline of opportunities and plan on providing you with an update of our 5 year outlook for capital spending at our annual financial conference on March 11. 
In total, the investment programs at PSE&G and Power are focused on meeting customer needs and market requirements, with an energy platform that is reliable, efficient and clean. The strategy we implemented has yielding growth for our shareholders as we have met the needs of our customers. The continued successful deployment of strong free cash flow into customer-oriented regulated investment programs is expected to support 14% growth in the Utility's earnings to 60% of Enterprise's 2016 operating earnings as the results for the full year are forecast at $2.80 to $3 per share. 
Our guidance for 2016 takes into account the impact on demand from the continuation of unseasonably mild weather conditions in January and early February. The Board of Directors' recent decision to increase the common dividend by 5.1% to the indicative annual level of $1.64 per share is an expression of our confidence in our outlook, the continued growth of our regulated business and an acknowledgment of our strong financial position. We see the potential for consistent and sustainable growth in the dividend as an important means of returning cash to our shareholders. Of course, none of our success would be possible without the contribution made by PSEG's dedicated workforce. 
I look forward to discussing our investment outlook in greater detail with you at our March 11th annual financial conference. But for now, I'll turn the call over to Dan for more details on our operating results, and we'll be available to answer your questions after his remarks."

As Ralph said, PSEG reported operating earnings for the fourth quarter of $0.50 per share versus $0.49 per share for the fourth quarter of 2014. Earnings in the quarter brought operating earnings for the full year to $2.91 per share or 5.4% greater than 2014's operating earnings of $2.76 per share, and at the upper half of our guidance of $2.85 to $2.95 per share.  And on Slide 4, we provided you with a reconciliation of operating earnings to net income for the quarter. 
We've also provided you with information on Slide 10 regarding the contribution to operating earnings by business for the quarter. And Slides 11 and 13 contain waterfall charts that take you through the net changes, and quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year changes in operating earnings by major business. And I'll review each company in more detail starting with PSE&G. 
PSE&G reported operating earnings for the fourth quarter of 2015 of $0.31 per share compared to $0.32 per share for the fourth quarter of 2014, and that's shown on Slide 15. PSE&G's full year 2015 operating earnings were $787 million or $1.55 per share compared with operating earnings of $725 million or $1.43 per share for 2014, reflecting a growth of 8.6%. PSE&G's earnings for the fourth quarter benefited from a return on its expanded capital program, which partially offset the impact of earnings from unseasonably mild weather conditions and an increase in operating expenses. PSE&G's return on the expanded investment in transmission and distribution programs increased quarter-over-quarter earnings by $0.03 per share. Mild weather conditions relative to normal and relative to last year reduced electric sales and lowered earnings comparisons by $0.01 per share. Recovery of gas revenue under the weather normalization clause offset the impact on earnings of the abnormally warm weather on sales of gas. And higher expenses, including pension and other items, reduced quarter-over-quarter earnings comparisons by $0.03 per share. 
Economic conditions in the service area continued to improve. On a weather-normalized basis, gas deliveries are estimated to have increased 2.1% in the quarter and 2.2% for the year. Demand continues to benefit from an improving economy, and also from the impact of lower commodity prices on customers' bills. Electric sales, on a weather-normalized basis, are estimated to have increased by 0.8% and 0.5% for the fourth quarter and for the year, respectively. The estimated year-over-year growth on electric sales is more representative of our long-term expectations for growth. 
PSE&G implemented a $146 million increase in Transmission revenue under the company's Transmission formula rate for 2016 on January 1. PSE&G's investment in Transmission grew to $5.7 billion at the end of 2015 or 43% of the company's consolidated rate base of $13.4 billion at year-end. As you know, Transmission revenues are adjusted each year to reflect an update of data that was estimated in the Transmission formula rate filing. The adjustment for 2016, which we will file in mid-2017, will include the impact of the extension of bonus depreciation, which was executed after our Transmission formula rate filing. This adjustment will reduce Transmission revenue as filed by about $27 million, but we will accrue that for accounting purposes in anticipation of the reduction of revenue as we report our 2016 results.  
We are forecasting growth in PSE&G's operating earnings for 2016 to a range of $875 million to $925 million, and the forecast reflects the benefits of continued growth in PSE&G's rate base and a decline in pension expense. 
Turning to Power. As shown on Slide 19, Power reported operating earnings for the fourth quarter of $0.19 per share compared to $0.18 per share a year ago. The results for the quarter brought Power's full year operating earnings to $653 million or $1.29 per share compared to 2014's operating earnings of $642 million or $1.27 per share. Power's adjusted EBITDA for the quarter and the year amounted to $235 million and $1.563 billion, respectively, which compares to adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2014 of $271 million and adjusted EBITDA for the full year of 2014 of $1.584 billion. 
The earnings release as well as the earnings slides on Pages 11 and 13 provide you with a detailed analysis of the impact on Power's operating earnings quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year from changes in revenue and cost. And we've also provided more detail on generation for the quarter and for the year on Slides 21 and 22. 
Power's operating earnings in the fourth quarter reflect the impact of strong hedging and tight control on operating expenses, which offset an anticipated decline in capacity revenue and the impact of unseasonably warm weather on wholesale energy prices. A decline in capacity revenue is associated with the May 2015 retirement of the high electric demand day or HEDD peaking capacity in PJM, reduced quarter-over-quarter earning comparisons by $0.04 per share. Increase in the average price received on energy hedges, coupled with a decline in fuel cost, more than offset the impact on earnings from a reduction in gas sales. And these 2 items together netted to a quarter-over-quarter improvement in earnings of $0.02 per share. 
Power's O&M expense for the quarter was unchanged relative to year ago levels. And an increase in depreciation expense and other miscellaneous items was more than offset by the absence of a charge in the year-ago quarter resulting in a net improvement in quarterly earnings comparisons of $0.03 per share. 
Turning to Power's operations, Power's output during the quarter was in line with year-ago levels. For the year, output increased 2% to 55.2 terawatt hours. And the level of production achieved by the fleet in 2015 represented the second-highest level of output in the fleet's history as a merchant generator, also supported by improvements in the fleet's availability and efficiency. The nuclear fleet operator had an average capacity factor of 90.4% for the year, producing 30 terawatt hours or 54% of total generation. Efficient combined cycle gas turbine capacity was rewarded in the market with an increase in dispatch levels. And Power's CCGT  fleet set a generation record during the year as each of the Linden station and the Bethlehem Energy Center set individual records. Output from the combined cycle fleet grew 11% to 18.4 terawatt hours or 33% of total output during the year. Lower market demand for our coal units reduced output from those stations to 5.8 terawatt hours to the year or 11% of output. And lastly, the fleet's peaking capacity produced just under 1 terawatt hour or 2% of output for the year. 
Power's gas-fired combined cycle fleet continues to benefit from its access to lower priced gas supplies in the Marcellus region. And for the year, gas from the Marcellus supplied 75% of the fuel requirements for the PJM gas-fired assets. This supply supports higher spark spread than implied by market pricing and allowed Power to enjoy fuel cost savings in the fourth quarter, similar to the levels it enjoyed in the year-ago quarter despite weak energy prices. And for the full year, Power enjoyed positive spreads relative to the market, but year-over-year realized spark spread in 2015, were lower than what was realized in 2014 given the decline in energy prices. 
Overall, Power's gross margin improved slightly to $38.83 per megawatt hour in fourth quarter versus $37.40 per megawatt hour in the year-ago quarter. And for the year, Power's gross margin amounted to $42.25  per megawatt versus the $42.41 per megawatt hour last year. And Slide 24 provides detail on Power's gross margins for the quarter and for the year. Power's expecting output for 2016 remains unchanged at 54 to 56 terawatt hours. Following the completion of the Basic Generation Service or BGS auction in New Jersey earlier this month, Power has 100% of its 2016 baseload generation hedged. Approximately 70% to 75% of Power's anticipated total production is hedged at an average price of $51 per megawatt hour, and Power has hedged approximately 45% to 55% of its forecast generation in 2017 of 54 to 56 terawatt hours at an average price of $50 per megawatt hour. 
Looking forward to 2018, Power's forecasting an improvement in output to 59 to 61 terawatt hours, with the commercial start-up in mid-2018 of the Keys and Sewaren stations that Ralph mentioned earlier. Approximately 15% to 20% of 2018's output is hedged at an average price of $54 per megawatt hour. And Power assumes BGS volumes will continue to represent approximately 11 to 12 terawatt hours of deliveries. And this number is very consistent with the 11.5 terawatt hours of deliveries we saw in 2015 under the BGS contract. 
Our average hedge position at this point in time represents a slightly smaller percentage of output hedged versus what you saw a year ago. And at that time, Power is able to take advantage of market prices influenced by the colder-than-normal weather conditions of last winter. Average hedge pricing includes the impact of recently concluded BGS auction. And the auction for the 3-year period beginning June 1, 2016 ending May 31, 2019, was priced at $96.38 per megawatt hour in the PS zone. This contract for 1/3 of the load will replace the 2013 contract for $92.18 per megawatt hour, which expires on May 31, 2016. 
And we do remind you from time to time that there are items included in the average hedge price which influence Power's revenue, but don't support Power's gross margin. Our average hedge price for 2016 of $51 per megawatt hour reflects an increase in the cost of elements such as transmission and renewables associated with serving our full requirements hedge obligations. And based on our current hedge position for 2016, each $2 change in spark spreads would impact earnings by about $0.04 per share. 
Power's operating earnings for 2016 are forecasted at a range of $490 million to $540 million. That forecast includes an adjusted EBITDA of $1.320 billion to $1.4 billion. The forecast reflects a year-over-year decline in capacity revenues associated with the May 2015 retirement of the HEDD peaking capacity. Operating earnings for the year will also be influenced by the recontracting of hedges at lower average price and a decline in gas sales. And most of the decline in Power's operating earnings forecast for the full year 2016 is expected to be experienced in the early part of 2016. 
With respect to Enterprise and Other, we reported operating earnings in the fourth quarter of $4 million, which compares to a loss in operating earnings of $4 million or $0.01 per share for the fourth quarter of 2014. And results for the fourth quarter brought full year 2015 operating earnings to $36 million or $0.07 per share compared with 2014's operating earnings of $33 million or $0.06 per share. The difference in quarter-over-quarter operating earnings reflects the absence of prior year tax adjustments as well as other parent-related expenses in 2015.  For the year, PSEG-Long Island's earnings contributions of $0.02 per share was in line with expectations. And looking forward to 2016, operating earnings for PSEG Enterprise and Other are forecast at $60 million. 
Next, I want to provide an update on our pension. Beginning with 2016, PSEG has elected to measure service and interest cost per pension and other postretirement benefits by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve to the plan's liability cash flows rather than the prior use of a single-weighted average rate. We believe the new approach provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by aligning the timing of the plan's liability cash flows to the corresponding spot rates on the yield curve. The change does not affect the measurement of the plan obligations. And we estimate this change will reduce 2016 pension and OPEB expense by approximately $34 million and $13 million, respectively, net of amounts capitalized from what would have been without this change. On a year-over-year basis, the pension expense is expected to decline -- pension and OPEB expense is expected to decline by $25 million from 2015's level of expense. We ended 2015 with 91% of our pension obligations funded and minimal need for cash funding of obligations over the next several years. 
With respect to our financial condition, it remains strong. We closed 2015 with $394 million of cash on hand and debt representing 43% of our consolidated capital position and debt at Power representing 27% of our capital base. PSEG's capital program for the 3 years ended 2018 is currently expected to approximate 11.5 billion. This represents a 21% increase over the level of capital invested over the prior 3-year period as PSE&G and Power focus on modernizing their infrastructure to meet the needs of today's marketplace. 
We have ample capacity to finance our current capital program. In addition, we estimate that the change in bonus depreciation, as Ralph mentioned, will provide an additional $1.7 billion of cash through 2019, with most of this cash received over the 3 years ending 2018. And of this amount, $1.2 billion of the cash will be at PSE&G and $500 million will be at Power. And as mentioned, our forecast for double-digit growth in PSE&G's rate base through 2018 does take into account the impact of bonus depreciation on rate base. And we plan to provide an updated 5-year view of capital spending at the annual conference on March 11. 
We're guiding to earnings for 2016 of $2.80 to $3 per share, in line with our 2015 operating results, as forecast growth at PSE&G offsets the impact of lower energy prices on Power's operating earnings. The company remains on solid footing, and we continue to focus on operational excellence, remain disciplined in our approach to investment strategy and maintain our financial strength. 
Common dividend was recently increased 5.1% to the indicative annual level of $1.64 per share. And we believe we can provide shareholders with consistent and sustainable growth in the dividend going forward. 
And with that, we are ready to answer your questions."

I'm talking about replacing the cast iron. But we'd like to break away from this incremental approach and into more of a long-standing approach. If for no other reason that it would be beneficial to develop the infrastructure, primarily, people, that one needs to sustain these programs, right. So right now, the way we run the programs is we work with contractors and we bring in the folks that are needed and we enter into this conversation 6 months before the program expires. But will you need more? I'm not quite sure. Well, we have to wait until BPU acts. So when can you find out? I'll get back to you as soon as possible. And that's not the way we typically run a 110-year-old company. We like to have training programs, bringing people in as an apprentice and have them climb the technical ladder and have a nice, long career. And that's a much more efficient way to use customer rates. And so I think that program in particular could be a template for the type of ongoing things we want to do. A close second to that, as you may recall, Energy Strong, we had put forth a 10-year plan that got approved for 3 years, and some of the cleaner technologies, whether it's solar or energy efficiency that will be needed to meet the state's own renewable portfolio standard or what eventually becomes of CPP and whatever carnation it takes -- reincarnation it takes. I think all lend themselves to more programmatic and long-standing programs that we can anticipate and rationally equip ourselves to execute. So those conversations are going on with the board staff now. And to their credit, their response is, well, you should have confidence. You've come in 14 times, and 14 times we said yes. And that's true. So the question is how much of an investment risk are you willing to make in equipment and training programs and people. When the yes, it's pretty much assured but has different forms, right. Half the program, half the duration, maybe 3/4 of the run rate. So it's a very constructive dialogue right now to be continued."

So, obviously, gas, we have some combined cycle gas turbines, which, once upon a time, we called load following, which are looking more and more like base load. But we also have a pretty robust and healthy peaking fleet. And similarly, in our coal assets, we have Keystone, Conemaugh, which are rightfully described as base load. And [indiscernible] Hudson, Mercer and Bridgeport stations had become more peaking with Hudson and Mercer having the additional flexibility to be able to run on gas. So it's not just a question of fuel diversity, it's what part in the dispatch queue the asset can play and what are its start/stop features. And in that respect, our diversity has served as well. Now you probably picked up that we would anticipate retiring the Bridgeport Harbor coal unit in 5 years provided that we are successful at securing the permits for the new 500 minus combined cycle unit at Bridgeport Harbor, which we don't anticipate any difficulties in doing so, given the community benefits agreement we achieved with some important stakeholder groups in Bridgeport.

We got 3 new efficient combined cycle plants, and if you look backwards, I said in some of my remarks that we have some of our HEDD units. Those were older peaking units that were retired for environmental purposes, and they're going to be replaced by new, efficient combined cycle clean gas units.

The strategic flexibility of both would be enhanced by doing that. The -- some of the tactical benefits of keeping them together right now, which is the financial synergy, the financial complement that Power provides the Utility. We've talked about Power's new plants, but for the past 5 years and for the next 5 years, it looks like the Utility will be outspending Power almost 3:1, and Power's a great source of equity for that with its funds from operation. Secondly, the complement that Power and Utility provide on the customer bill is a huge advantage to us. And the support cost synergies that exist between the 2 companies are a big advantage to us as well. But as Power grows in New England and as it grows in New York state and in other places, it will need to use its own FFO for investment opportunities, and that free cash flow that remains -- help the Utility will be decreased. There'll be more customers that it'll be serving outside of the Utility's territories, so that complementary nature will decrease. And as they both grow, the corporate overhead, the vital functions that corporate support groups provide will be a smaller piece of the overall operating budget. So I think over time, the tactical benefits of staying together decrease and the strategic advantages of separating will increase. But we're not there today. So..."

We've long had low-cost nuclear, and we've had a pretty good, highly efficient combined cycle fleet, but in 3 years, we're going to have just an outstanding highly efficient combined cycle fleet.

So the Utility will represent 60% of earnings at the midpoint, and it's doing stuff that is very important to customers. And we'll just continue marching along that path. 
So we had a good year is the final point, and I think you'll find that when we get together on March 11, that our next 5 years will look even better. So I look forward to explaining that further when we see you in New York. Thanks, everyone."

This morning, we reported operating earnings for the full year 2015, and I'm pleased to report that it was a year of significant accomplishment.

This morning, we reported operating earnings for the full year 2015, and I'm pleased to report that it was a year of significant accomplishment. 
As you saw this morning, we reported operating earnings for the fourth quarter of $0.50 per share versus $0.49 per share earned in the fourth quarter of 2014 despite the unseasonably mild weather this past December. Results for the full year were $2.91 per share or 5% greater than 2014's operating earnings of $2.76 per share. This is at the upper half of our guidance of $2.85 to $2.95 per share, and it was also higher than the midpoint of our original guidance of $2.85 per share. 
Our results reflect the benefits of excellent performance and robust organic growth, which offset the impact of low energy prices on earnings. We have continued to successfully deploy our strong free cash flow into customer-oriented investment programs that have supported growth. 2015's operating earnings represented the third year of growth in earnings. 
Now let me just mention a few of the year's highlight. PSE&G was named Electric Light & Power's Utility of the Year and was named the Most Reliable Utility in the Mid-Atlantic for the 14th consecutive year. But we're not resting on those laurels. PSE&G invested approximately $2.7 billion during 2015 on programs to further enhance the system's resiliency and its reliability. During the year, PSE&G placed into service key backbone transmission lines such as the Susquehanna-Roseland line as well as at the Mickleton-Gloucester-Camden line, which is designed to meet the need of customers today and well into the future. PSE&G invested over $550 million on programs under its $1.2 billion Energy Strong initiative. These programs are designed to strengthen and protect the electric and gas distribution systems from the impacts of extreme weather. 
During the year, PSE&G also received approval from the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities to invest an additional $95 million in its award-winning energy efficiency programs and to continue the work begun under Energy Strong, replacing aging cast iron natural gas pipe. The $905 million Gas System Modernization Program represented the 14th multiyear investment program approved by the BPU since PSE&G's last base rate case, and this speaks to the state's support of infrastructure investment that meets the needs of customers. PSE&G's investment program, supportive recovery -- revenue recovery mechanisms and tight control of O&M expenses have provided growth in PSE&G's operating earnings of approximately 13% per year for the 5-year period ended 2015. During this period PSE&G's rate base expanded at a rate of 11% per year, and importantly, we have been able to support this growth as customer bills have declined. 
But 2015 was not just a year of PSE&G accomplishment. PSEG Power's strong operating performance supported earnings in line with guidance for the full year despite very difficult market conditions. The nuclear fleet operated at a capacity factor of greater than 90% for the year and accounted for 54% of the fleet's output. Power's gas-fired combustion turbine fleet set a new record for output. This improves on the prior record established in 2014. The fleet's performance is benefiting from investments that have improved its efficiency, increased its capacity and provided greater access to low-cost gas supplies. The flexibility and diversity of Power's fleet have allowed it to provide approximately $500 million of positive free cash flow in 2015, even during soft energy market conditions. 
Power also plans to invest $2 billion over the next 3 to 4 years to add approximately 1,800 megawatts of new, efficient combined cycle gas-fired turbine efficiency. That's at turbine capacity. The Keys Energy Station, which is located in Southwestern MAAC will extend Power's footprint in this core PJM market. A new efficient unit at the Sewaren station in New Jersey will replace old inefficiency in capacity. And after clearing the most recent capacity auction in New England, Power will construct a new 485-megawatt combined cycle unit at its existing Bridgeport Harbor station site, giving us an enviable and growing position in both energy and capacity markets in Southwestern Connecticut.  
The addition of these units will transform Power's generation mix as its ownership of efficient, reliable gas-fired capacity will grow to exceed 5,000 megawatts in 2019. At that time, the combined cycle gas turbine fleet will surpass the size of Power's ownership in nuclear capacity and secure Power's position as a low-cost generator with modern, flexible, clean assets that remain capable of meeting the demands for reliability in today's market. 
Power also grew its investment in contracted solar energy. In 2015, Power added 2 projects representing an investment of approximately $75 million in utility-scale grid-connected solar energy. And earlier this year, Power announced that it will invest an additional $150 million in 3 projects that bring its portfolio of solar projects to 240 megawatts-dc of clean renewable energy. 
All projects in this portfolio are under long-term contracts with credit-worthy customers. So as you can see, we continue to explore opportunities to expand and optimize Power's fleet. Although I will add that we do not see any new generation build in the foreseeable future, although you never say never, but we don't plan any at this point in time. 
Our balance sheet continues to provide us with a competitive advantage to finance our capital program without the need to access the equity markets. We ended 2015 with strong credit metrics, and the extension of bonus depreciation through 2019 is expected to provide Enterprise with an additional $1.7 billion of cash during this period. Our investment program calls for a 21% increase in capital spending to $11.5 billion for the 3 years ended 2018 from capital invested during the 3-year period ended 2015. Approximately 72% of that amount, or $8.3 billion over this time frame, will be invested by PSE&G on transmission and distribution infrastructure programs that customers will require for reliability. This level of investment is expected to yield growth in PSE&G's rate base for the 3 years ended 2018 of 10% per year, even after taking into account the impact of bonus depreciation on rate base. The remaining approximate 27% or $3.2 billion of expected capital investment will be made at Power. The majority of Power's investments will be devoted to expanding its position in new, efficient, clean gas-fired generating capacities, as I mentioned already. All of which, Keys, Sewaren and Bridgeport Harbor are expected to exceed our long-standing and unchanged financial returns expectations. 
With our strong balance sheet, we remain in a position to increase our capital investment across the company. We have a robust pipeline of opportunities and plan on providing you with an update of our 5 year outlook for capital spending at our annual financial conference on March 11. 
In total, the investment programs at PSE&G and Power are focused on meeting customer needs and market requirements, with an energy platform that is reliable, efficient and clean. The strategy we implemented has yielding growth for our shareholders as we have met the needs of our customers. The continued successful deployment of strong free cash flow into customer-oriented regulated investment programs is expected to support 14% growth in the Utility's earnings to 60% of Enterprise's 2016 operating earnings as the results for the full year are forecast at $2.80 to $3 per share. 
Our guidance for 2016 takes into account the impact on demand from the continuation of unseasonably mild weather conditions in January and early February. The Board of Directors' recent decision to increase the common dividend by 5.1% to the indicative annual level of $1.64 per share is an expression of our confidence in our outlook, the continued growth of our regulated business and an acknowledgment of our strong financial position. We see the potential for consistent and sustainable growth in the dividend as an important means of returning cash to our shareholders. Of course, none of our success would be possible without the contribution made by PSEG's dedicated workforce. 
I look forward to discussing our investment outlook in greater detail with you at our March 11th annual financial conference. But for now, I'll turn the call over to Dan for more details on our operating results, and we'll be available to answer your questions after his remarks."

As Ralph said, PSEG reported operating earnings for the fourth quarter of $0.50 per share versus $0.49 per share for the fourth quarter of 2014. Earnings in the quarter brought operating earnings for the full year to $2.91 per share or 5.4% greater than 2014's operating earnings of $2.76 per share, and at the upper half of our guidance of $2.85 to $2.95 per share.  And on Slide 4, we provided you with a reconciliation of operating earnings to net income for the quarter. 
We've also provided you with information on Slide 10 regarding the contribution to operating earnings by business for the quarter. And Slides 11 and 13 contain waterfall charts that take you through the net changes, and quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year changes in operating earnings by major business. And I'll review each company in more detail starting with PSE&G. 
PSE&G reported operating earnings for the fourth quarter of 2015 of $0.31 per share compared to $0.32 per share for the fourth quarter of 2014, and that's shown on Slide 15. PSE&G's full year 2015 operating earnings were $787 million or $1.55 per share compared with operating earnings of $725 million or $1.43 per share for 2014, reflecting a growth of 8.6%. PSE&G's earnings for the fourth quarter benefited from a return on its expanded capital program, which partially offset the impact of earnings from unseasonably mild weather conditions and an increase in operating expenses. PSE&G's return on the expanded investment in transmission and distribution programs increased quarter-over-quarter earnings by $0.03 per share. Mild weather conditions relative to normal and relative to last year reduced electric sales and lowered earnings comparisons by $0.01 per share. Recovery of gas revenue under the weather normalization clause offset the impact on earnings of the abnormally warm weather on sales of gas. And higher expenses, including pension and other items, reduced quarter-over-quarter earnings comparisons by $0.03 per share. 
Economic conditions in the service area continued to improve. On a weather-normalized basis, gas deliveries are estimated to have increased 2.1% in the quarter and 2.2% for the year. Demand continues to benefit from an improving economy, and also from the impact of lower commodity prices on customers' bills. Electric sales, on a weather-normalized basis, are estimated to have increased by 0.8% and 0.5% for the fourth quarter and for the year, respectively. The estimated year-over-year growth on electric sales is more representative of our long-term expectations for growth. 
PSE&G implemented a $146 million increase in Transmission revenue under the company's Transmission formula rate for 2016 on January 1. PSE&G's investment in Transmission grew to $5.7 billion at the end of 2015 or 43% of the company's consolidated rate base of $13.4 billion at year-end. As you know, Transmission revenues are adjusted each year to reflect an update of data that was estimated in the Transmission formula rate filing. The adjustment for 2016, which we will file in mid-2017, will include the impact of the extension of bonus depreciation, which was executed after our Transmission formula rate filing. This adjustment will reduce Transmission revenue as filed by about $27 million, but we will accrue that for accounting purposes in anticipation of the reduction of revenue as we report our 2016 results.  
We are forecasting growth in PSE&G's operating earnings for 2016 to a range of $875 million to $925 million, and the forecast reflects the benefits of continued growth in PSE&G's rate base and a decline in pension expense. 
Turning to Power. As shown on Slide 19, Power reported operating earnings for the fourth quarter of $0.19 per share compared to $0.18 per share a year ago. The results for the quarter brought Power's full year operating earnings to $653 million or $1.29 per share compared to 2014's operating earnings of $642 million or $1.27 per share. Power's adjusted EBITDA for the quarter and the year amounted to $235 million and $1.563 billion, respectively, which compares to adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2014 of $271 million and adjusted EBITDA for the full year of 2014 of $1.584 billion. 
The earnings release as well as the earnings slides on Pages 11 and 13 provide you with a detailed analysis of the impact on Power's operating earnings quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year from changes in revenue and cost. And we've also provided more detail on generation for the quarter and for the year on Slides 21 and 22. 
Power's operating earnings in the fourth quarter reflect the impact of strong hedging and tight control on operating expenses, which offset an anticipated decline in capacity revenue and the impact of unseasonably warm weather on wholesale energy prices. A decline in capacity revenue is associated with the May 2015 retirement of the high electric demand day or HEDD peaking capacity in PJM, reduced quarter-over-quarter earning comparisons by $0.04 per share. Increase in the average price received on energy hedges, coupled with a decline in fuel cost, more than offset the impact on earnings from a reduction in gas sales. And these 2 items together netted to a quarter-over-quarter improvement in earnings of $0.02 per share. 
Power's O&M expense for the quarter was unchanged relative to year ago levels. And an increase in depreciation expense and other miscellaneous items was more than offset by the absence of a charge in the year-ago quarter resulting in a net improvement in quarterly earnings comparisons of $0.03 per share. 
Turning to Power's operations, Power's output during the quarter was in line with year-ago levels. For the year, output increased 2% to 55.2 terawatt hours. And the level of production achieved by the fleet in 2015 represented the second-highest level of output in the fleet's history as a merchant generator, also supported by improvements in the fleet's availability and efficiency. The nuclear fleet operator had an average capacity factor of 90.4% for the year, producing 30 terawatt hours or 54% of total generation. Efficient combined cycle gas turbine capacity was rewarded in the market with an increase in dispatch levels. And Power's CCGT  fleet set a generation record during the year as each of the Linden station and the Bethlehem Energy Center set individual records. Output from the combined cycle fleet grew 11% to 18.4 terawatt hours or 33% of total output during the year. Lower market demand for our coal units reduced output from those stations to 5.8 terawatt hours to the year or 11% of output. And lastly, the fleet's peaking capacity produced just under 1 terawatt hour or 2% of output for the year. 
Power's gas-fired combined cycle fleet continues to benefit from its access to lower priced gas supplies in the Marcellus region. And for the year, gas from the Marcellus supplied 75% of the fuel requirements for the PJM gas-fired assets. This supply supports higher spark spread than implied by market pricing and allowed Power to enjoy fuel cost savings in the fourth quarter, similar to the levels it enjoyed in the year-ago quarter despite weak energy prices. And for the full year, Power enjoyed positive spreads relative to the market, but year-over-year realized spark spread in 2015, were lower than what was realized in 2014 given the decline in energy prices. 
Overall, Power's gross margin improved slightly to $38.83 per megawatt hour in fourth quarter versus $37.40 per megawatt hour in the year-ago quarter. And for the year, Power's gross margin amounted to $42.25  per megawatt versus the $42.41 per megawatt hour last year. And Slide 24 provides detail on Power's gross margins for the quarter and for the year. Power's expecting output for 2016 remains unchanged at 54 to 56 terawatt hours. Following the completion of the Basic Generation Service or BGS auction in New Jersey earlier this month, Power has 100% of its 2016 baseload generation hedged. Approximately 70% to 75% of Power's anticipated total production is hedged at an average price of $51 per megawatt hour, and Power has hedged approximately 45% to 55% of its forecast generation in 2017 of 54 to 56 terawatt hours at an average price of $50 per megawatt hour. 
Looking forward to 2018, Power's forecasting an improvement in output to 59 to 61 terawatt hours, with the commercial start-up in mid-2018 of the Keys and Sewaren stations that Ralph mentioned earlier. Approximately 15% to 20% of 2018's output is hedged at an average price of $54 per megawatt hour. And Power assumes BGS volumes will continue to represent approximately 11 to 12 terawatt hours of deliveries. And this number is very consistent with the 11.5 terawatt hours of deliveries we saw in 2015 under the BGS contract. 
Our average hedge position at this point in time represents a slightly smaller percentage of output hedged versus what you saw a year ago. And at that time, Power is able to take advantage of market prices influenced by the colder-than-normal weather conditions of last winter. Average hedge pricing includes the impact of recently concluded BGS auction. And the auction for the 3-year period beginning June 1, 2016 ending May 31, 2019, was priced at $96.38 per megawatt hour in the PS zone. This contract for 1/3 of the load will replace the 2013 contract for $92.18 per megawatt hour, which expires on May 31, 2016. 
And we do remind you from time to time that there are items included in the average hedge price which influence Power's revenue, but don't support Power's gross margin. Our average hedge price for 2016 of $51 per megawatt hour reflects an increase in the cost of elements such as transmission and renewables associated with serving our full requirements hedge obligations. And based on our current hedge position for 2016, each $2 change in spark spreads would impact earnings by about $0.04 per share. 
Power's operating earnings for 2016 are forecasted at a range of $490 million to $540 million. That forecast includes an adjusted EBITDA of $1.320 billion to $1.4 billion. The forecast reflects a year-over-year decline in capacity revenues associated with the May 2015 retirement of the HEDD peaking capacity. Operating earnings for the year will also be influenced by the recontracting of hedges at lower average price and a decline in gas sales. And most of the decline in Power's operating earnings forecast for the full year 2016 is expected to be experienced in the early part of 2016. 
With respect to Enterprise and Other, we reported operating earnings in the fourth quarter of $4 million, which compares to a loss in operating earnings of $4 million or $0.01 per share for the fourth quarter of 2014. And results for the fourth quarter brought full year 2015 operating earnings to $36 million or $0.07 per share compared with 2014's operating earnings of $33 million or $0.06 per share. The difference in quarter-over-quarter operating earnings reflects the absence of prior year tax adjustments as well as other parent-related expenses in 2015.  For the year, PSEG-Long Island's earnings contributions of $0.02 per share was in line with expectations. And looking forward to 2016, operating earnings for PSEG Enterprise and Other are forecast at $60 million. 
Next, I want to provide an update on our pension. Beginning with 2016, PSEG has elected to measure service and interest cost per pension and other postretirement benefits by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve to the plan's liability cash flows rather than the prior use of a single-weighted average rate. We believe the new approach provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by aligning the timing of the plan's liability cash flows to the corresponding spot rates on the yield curve. The change does not affect the measurement of the plan obligations. And we estimate this change will reduce 2016 pension and OPEB expense by approximately $34 million and $13 million, respectively, net of amounts capitalized from what would have been without this change. On a year-over-year basis, the pension expense is expected to decline -- pension and OPEB expense is expected to decline by $25 million from 2015's level of expense. We ended 2015 with 91% of our pension obligations funded and minimal need for cash funding of obligations over the next several years. 
With respect to our financial condition, it remains strong. We closed 2015 with $394 million of cash on hand and debt representing 43% of our consolidated capital position and debt at Power representing 27% of our capital base. PSEG's capital program for the 3 years ended 2018 is currently expected to approximate 11.5 billion. This represents a 21% increase over the level of capital invested over the prior 3-year period as PSE&G and Power focus on modernizing their infrastructure to meet the needs of today's marketplace. 
We have ample capacity to finance our current capital program. In addition, we estimate that the change in bonus depreciation, as Ralph mentioned, will provide an additional $1.7 billion of cash through 2019, with most of this cash received over the 3 years ending 2018. And of this amount, $1.2 billion of the cash will be at PSE&G and $500 million will be at Power. And as mentioned, our forecast for double-digit growth in PSE&G's rate base through 2018 does take into account the impact of bonus depreciation on rate base. And we plan to provide an updated 5-year view of capital spending at the annual conference on March 11. 
We're guiding to earnings for 2016 of $2.80 to $3 per share, in line with our 2015 operating results, as forecast growth at PSE&G offsets the impact of lower energy prices on Power's operating earnings. The company remains on solid footing, and we continue to focus on operational excellence, remain disciplined in our approach to investment strategy and maintain our financial strength. 
Common dividend was recently increased 5.1% to the indicative annual level of $1.64 per share. And we believe we can provide shareholders with consistent and sustainable growth in the dividend going forward. 
And with that, we are ready to answer your questions."

In fact, I think the BPU even sends out some of the transmission costs that ultimately get embedded in. And then finally, the last big piece, which is also fairly transparent, is the capacity piece.

I'm talking about replacing the cast iron. But we'd like to break away from this incremental approach and into more of a long-standing approach. If for no other reason that it would be beneficial to develop the infrastructure, primarily, people, that one needs to sustain these programs, right. So right now, the way we run the programs is we work with contractors and we bring in the folks that are needed and we enter into this conversation 6 months before the program expires. But will you need more? I'm not quite sure. Well, we have to wait until BPU acts. So when can you find out? I'll get back to you as soon as possible. And that's not the way we typically run a 110-year-old company. We like to have training programs, bringing people in as an apprentice and have them climb the technical ladder and have a nice, long career. And that's a much more efficient way to use customer rates. And so I think that program in particular could be a template for the type of ongoing things we want to do. A close second to that, as you may recall, Energy Strong, we had put forth a 10-year plan that got approved for 3 years, and some of the cleaner technologies, whether it's solar or energy efficiency that will be needed to meet the state's own renewable portfolio standard or what eventually becomes of CPP and whatever carnation it takes -- reincarnation it takes. I think all lend themselves to more programmatic and long-standing programs that we can anticipate and rationally equip ourselves to execute. So those conversations are going on with the board staff now. And to their credit, their response is, well, you should have confidence. You've come in 14 times, and 14 times we said yes. And that's true. So the question is how much of an investment risk are you willing to make in equipment and training programs and people. When the yes, it's pretty much assured but has different forms, right. Half the program, half the duration, maybe 3/4 of the run rate. So it's a very constructive dialogue right now to be continued."

So, obviously, gas, we have some combined cycle gas turbines, which, once upon a time, we called load following, which are looking more and more like base load. But we also have a pretty robust and healthy peaking fleet. And similarly, in our coal assets, we have Keystone, Conemaugh, which are rightfully described as base load. And [indiscernible] Hudson, Mercer and Bridgeport stations had become more peaking with Hudson and Mercer having the additional flexibility to be able to run on gas. So it's not just a question of fuel diversity, it's what part in the dispatch queue the asset can play and what are its start/stop features. And in that respect, our diversity has served as well. Now you probably picked up that we would anticipate retiring the Bridgeport Harbor coal unit in 5 years provided that we are successful at securing the permits for the new 500 minus combined cycle unit at Bridgeport Harbor, which we don't anticipate any difficulties in doing so, given the community benefits agreement we achieved with some important stakeholder groups in Bridgeport. And I'll let Dan finish up on the leverage at power. But once again, our base FFO to debt expectations are 30%, and we'll give you more details when we see you in March.

But I think as you do look forward, we will see a shift in the fleet and maybe that's kind of what your question is getting at. We got 3 new efficient combined cycle plants, and if you look backwards, I said in some of my remarks that we have some of our HEDD units. Those were older peaking units that were retired for environmental purposes, and they're going to be replaced by new, efficient combined cycle clean gas units. So the fleet really will take on a different look into the future and will be more efficient. And we'll have a better profile and be more competitive in the market."

We've talked about Power's new plants, but for the past 5 years and for the next 5 years, it looks like the Utility will be outspending Power almost 3:1, and Power's a great source of equity for that with its funds from operation. Secondly, the complement that Power and Utility provide on the customer bill is a huge advantage to us. And the support cost synergies that exist between the 2 companies are a big advantage to us as well. But as Power grows in New England and as it grows in New York state and in other places, it will need to use its own FFO for investment opportunities, and that free cash flow that remains -- help the Utility will be decreased. There'll be more customers that it'll be serving outside of the Utility's territories, so that complementary nature will decrease. And as they both grow, the corporate overhead, the vital functions that corporate support groups provide will be a smaller piece of the overall operating budget.

But really, I hope there are 3 key points you take away from what Dan and I talked about. So first of all, we are genuinely excited about Power's positioning. We've long had low-cost nuclear, and we've had a pretty good, highly efficient combined cycle fleet, but in 3 years, we're going to have just an outstanding highly efficient combined cycle fleet. And all of our assets are going to be well positioned. And I mean, well positioned in the broadest sense of the word. They'll be near load. They'll be clean. They'll be diverse fleet. And we'll continue to look at opportunities to improve upon that fleet, but you really should recognize that we've talked for a long time now about these 3 new units, and I don't foresee any circumstances at present that would suggest any additional new build on the horizon for us. Second point is the Utility growth continues. I mean, we averaged 13% growth over the last 5 years. And if you just take our '15 results and the midpoint of the Utility guidance for '16, we're going to grow it 14%. And yet Utility bills will go down yet again this year because of the expiration of some charges. So the Utility will represent 60% of earnings at the midpoint, and it's doing stuff that is very important to customers. And we'll just continue marching along that path. 
So we had a good year is the final point, and I think you'll find that when we get together on March 11, that our next 5 years will look even better. So I look forward to explaining that further when we see you in New York. Thanks, everyone."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. PSEG delivered solid results for the first quarter in the face of rather mild winter temperatures and low prices for natural gas and energy. Earlier this morning, we reported",906,"Thank you, Kathleen. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. PSEG delivered solid results for the first quarter in the face of rather mild winter temperatures and low prices for natural gas and energy. Earlier this morning, we reported operating earnings for the first quarter of 2016 of $0.91 per share versus operating earnings of $1.04 per share in last year's first quarter. Extreme temperature differences between the first quarter of this year and the first quarter of last year provide the backdrop for this quarter's operating results. 
The first quarter of 2016 was 10% warmer than normal and the fifth warmest on record. The month of March in particular was extremely mild, with heating degree days 25% lower than normal. Weather for the first quarter was also 27% warmer than the first quarter of 2015, but last year was the coldest on record. 
Our results were strong in the face of this headwind. PSE&G's execution on its expanded capital investment program continues to provide a growing source of earnings. PSE&G is expected to invest $3 billion in 2016 as part of its 5-year $12 billion capital program. Transmission is the largest part of PSE&G's effort, representing 60% of planned spending. 
PSE&G's investment program and a continued focus on controlling costs will help drive our forecast for double-digit growth in PSE&G's 2016 operating earnings. 
PSE&G's execution of our capital program is expected to yield best-in-class growth rate in rate base of 8% per year for the 5-year period ending 2020. PSE&G continues to develop a pipeline of investment opportunities that also made New Jersey's policy objectives and has customer support. 
Now as for PSEG Power, it has been focused on operating in an environment of low gas prices for years. The availability and low price of gas and the need to meet more stringent reliability requirements has added new urgency to the company's efforts to improve its cost structure and efficiency. Power's capital program also represents an important response to today's market. Power's $2 billion of investment in 3 new combined cycle gas turbines will add approximately 1,800 megawatts of clean, reliable and efficient capacity to its fleet. 
Construction of the Keys plant in Maryland and the C1 unit in New Jersey are scheduled to meet their 2018 operating dates. Bridgeport Harbor is expected to be available for 2019 commercial operation date. The addition of this new capacity will transform Power's fleet. Power's baseload nuclear capacity will become limited by a flexible, low-cost fleet of combined cycle gas units capable of responding to the market. 
The fleet's carbon footprint is also expected to decline with the addition of the new clean gas-fired capacity as nuclear generation continues to represent approximately 50% of the fleet's output. As I said, we remain focused on operating efficiently and safely. PSEG Power resume judicious reductions in its nuclear workforce and is working closely with the industry to identify additional means of reducing its cost structure, to ensure the availability of this clean nuclear resource well into the future. 
Our goal is to capture these savings for the year to help offset the impact of lower gas prices on earnings. 
Separately from operations, we were very pleased with some recent actions in defense of competitive markets. In particular, we were delighted with the U.S. Supreme Court's unanimous decision, affirming the Fourth Circuit's decision in Hughes versus Maryland. Since that decision, the U.S. Supreme Court also dismissed the New Jersey case, allowing to stand the lower court ruling that the so-called contrast are unconstitutional. A recent passion action at FERC is also constructed. I'm referring to the orders issued by FERC earlier this week granting the complaints filed by EPSA and others, which called into question some approvals granted by the Public Utility Commission of Ohio. A separate complaint, brought by a number of generating companies regarding the scope of the minimum price rule under RPM, is still pending at FERC. While owners of existing assets with out-of-market contracts will not be directly restricted in the upcoming base residual auction regarding how they can bid the affected units, the lack of certainty regarding FERC approval of such contracts should at least neutralize some, if not all of the incentives under the contracts to bid without regard to the unit's actual cost of operations. 
We believe that a competitive market is the best approach for ensuring that there is a supply of electric capacity to meet customer demand at the lowest cost. 
Our company-wide efforts are focused on building an infrastructure that improve system reliability, reduces emissions and supports the needs of customers. Our strategy is working and it's made possible by the contribution from our dedicated employees who support our efforts in countless ways. Their focus on the mission of providing safe, reliable energy has allowed us to meet the needs of customers and shareholders. 
We are maintaining our operating earnings guidance for the full year of $2.80 to $3 per share. Our guidance assumes normal weather for the remainder of the year. As we move forward, the weather and market conditions during the third quarter will be important for both PSEG Power and PSE&G. Our current market conditions and the complete absence of a winter require that we maintain our relentless focus on identifying cost efficiencies and maintaining strong operating performance. With that, I'll turn the call over to Dan, who will discuss our financials in greater detail."

On Slide 4, we provided you with a reconcilia",1676,"Thank you, Ralph, and good morning, everyone. As Ralph said, PSEG reported operating earnings for the first quarter of 2016 of $0.91 per share versus operating earnings of $1.04 in last year's first quarter. 
On Slide 4, we provided you with a reconciliation of operating earnings to net income for the quarter, and we've provided you with information on Slide 8 regarding the contribution to operating earnings by business for the quarter. Additionally, Slide 9 contains a waterfall chart that takes you through the net changes quarter-over-quarter in operating earnings by major business. 
And I'll now walk through each company in more detail. For PSE&G, shown on Slide 11, we reported operating earnings for the first quarter of 2016 of $0.52 per share compared with $0.47 per share for the first quarter of 2015. PSE&G's first quarter results reflect the impact of revenue growth associated with an expansion of its capital investment program, which more than offset the effect of unfavorable weather conditions on electric and gas demand. 
Returns on PSE&G's expanded events in Transmission adding $0.04 per share to earnings in the quarter. And the first quarter also benefited from the recovery of revenue on PSE&G's Distribution investment under its Energy Strong program. 
These increases in revenue improved core your earnings comparisons by $0.01 per share. As Ralph mentioned, what are the first quarter was warmer than normal and significantly warmer than conditions experienced last year. The negative impact of the extreme differences in weather on gas demand in revenue, or you, was largely offset by the gas weather normalization for us. The decline in electric sales and revenue, however, as a result of the extreme differences in weather reduced quarterly earnings comparisons by $0.02 per share. 
Lower taxes more than offset an increase in O&M expense due to the absence of insurance recovery of storm costs received in the year-ago quarter. These items together added $0.02 per share to quarter-over-quarter earnings.
Economic indicators continue to improve. Employment in New Jersey has increased for 28 consecutive months, as the unemployment rate has declined to 4.3%. Housing market has also experienced an improvement. However, this improvement in economic growth was outweighed during the quarter by a mild weather. The variability in quarterly data for weather normalized electric and gas sales has been high, given the extreme weather conditions, making it difficult to discern a trend in demand when analyzing just the quarterly data. But data for the trailing 12 months indicates weather normalized electric sales were flat for the period ended March of 2016. 
And in terms of weather normalized gas demand, a 0.3% decline in sales in the first quarter was led by a 1.5% decline in heating demand from the residential sector, which also influenced by the large weather adjustment quarter-over-quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, gas sales increased by 1.8% year-over-year. 
PSE&G's capital program remains on schedule and PSE&G invested approximately $725 million in the first quarter as part of its planned $3 billion capital investment for 2016. 
Also as you may recall, PSE&G implemented a $146 million increase in annual Transmission revenue under the company's Transmission formula rate filing, which took effect this past January. This increase in revenue, adjusted to reflect the impact of bonus depreciation and updates of spending in prior years, will be reflected in PSE&G's earnings throughout the year. 
While we're maintaining our forecast for PSE&G's operating earnings for 2016 of $875 million to $925 million. 
Moving to Power, as shown on Slide 18, PSEG Power operated earnings for the first quarter of $0.36 per share and adjusted EBITDA of $416 million, compared with $0.55 per share and adjusted EBITDA of $626 million for the first quarter of 2015. Adjusted EBITDA excludes the same items as our operating earnings measure, as well as income tax expense, interest expense, depreciation and amortization and major maintenance expense at Power's fossil generating facilities. 
The earnings release and Slide 19 provide you with a detailed analysis of the impact on Power's operating earnings quarter-over-quarter. 
And we have also provided you with more detail on generation for the quarter on Slide 21. PSEG Power's first quarter results were impacted by the extremely mild weather conditions experienced this year in comparison to the year-ago period. 
The decline in capacity revenue associated with the June 2015 retirement of the HEDD, or high electric demand day peaking units in PJM reduced quarter-over-quarter earnings by $0.04 per share. Lower output due to the mild weather conditions, coupled with lower average prices on energy hedges, reduced quarter-over-quarter earnings by $0.09 per share. 
And a weather-related decline in total gas send out to and industrial customers and lower prices combined to reduced quarter-over-quarter earnings on gas sales by $0.12 per share. 
Lower O&M expense improved quarter-over-quarter earnings by $0.05 per share, and the reduction in interest expense added $0.01 to earnings per share. 
Now let's turn to Power's operations. Output from Power's fleet declined 9% as a result of the reduced demand and lower wholesale market prices. Output from the Cold fleet reduced during the first quarter, a decline of 1 terawatt hour from 2.5 terawatt hours in the year-ago quarter, as well, gas prices affected the dispatch of coal. Output from the combined cycle fleet declined 0.2 terawatt hours to 3.7 terawatt hours, with the decline in demand. The nuclear fleet, however, experienced a 0.6 terawatt hour improvement in output to 8.4 terawatt hours for the quarter. 
The fleet operated at an average capacity factor of 99.7% in the quarter, and the nuclear fleet's performance benefited from an improvement in availability at Salem, as well as an increase in capacity at Peach Bottom. You may recall that the expanded Power upgrade work was completed at Peach Bottom last year, and this work added 130 megawatts to our share of the station's capacity. 
Power's gas-fired combined cycle fleet has access to low-cost gas, which continues to provide it with an advantage relative to market prices. Towards the lack of demand and the lack of volatility in the market, given the mild weather and an excess supply of gas, pressured spark spreads, which were significantly lower compared to last year's level. 
Overall, Power's gross margin declined to $43.80 per megawatt hour from $47.32 in the year-ago quarter. Power's revising its forecast of output for 2016 to 52 to 54 terawatt hours from its prior forecast of 54 to 56 terawatt hours. The updated range for output incorporates the impact of the abnormally warm weather in the first quarter. 
This range also incorporates an anticipated expansion of the Salem 1 refueling outage. A visual inspection during the current refilling outage at Salem 1, which began in April 14, revealed damage to a series of bolts located inside the reactor vessel. We need to conduct further testing to repair and replace the bolts, as expected to extend the refueling outage. 
To provide some context, as the rule of thumb, a delay in Salem's refueling outage of 30 days would reduce generation by approximately 0.5 terawatt hour. And under this scenario, nuclear fleets capacity factor for the year would be reduced by about 1% to 91% from the current forecasted capacity factor of 92.5% for the year. And the actual outage duration will be determined after ongoing inspection work is completed. 
As shown on Slide 24, approximately 70% to 75% of anticipated production for the April to December period of 40 terawatt hours is hedged at an average price of $49 per megawatt hour. Our open position for the remainder of 2016 is more than adequate to cover the potential for a decline in output at Salem from our original forecast. 
For 2017, Power's hedged 50% to 55% of its forecast generation of 54 to 56 terawatt hours, at an average price of $49 per megawatt hour. And for 2018, approximately 20% to 25% of the forecast generation of 59 to 61 terawatt hours is hedged at an average price of $49 per megawatt hour. The forecast increase and generation in 2018 reflects the commercial operation of the Keys and Sewaren combined cycle unit. 
Hedged data for 2016 continues to assume BG representing 11 to 12 terawatt hours. As we mentioned to you last quarter, there are items included in our average hedge price, which influence Power's revenue but don't support Power's gross margin. Our average hedge price for the remainder of 2016 reflects an increase in cost elements such as transmission and renewables associated with serving our full requirements hedge obligations. The increase year-over-year and these non-margin revenue items is approximately down to 2 megawatt hours. 
We continue to forecast operating earnings for Power in 2016 of $490 million to $540 million. And the forecast for operating earnings represents adjusted EBITDA of $1,320,000,000 to $1.4 billion for the full year, which compares to $1,563,000,000 of adjusted EBITDA in 2015. 
I'll briefly address as well Enterprise and Other's operating results. And for the first quarter, we reported operating earnings of $0.03 per share compared with operating earnings of $0.02 per share for last year in the first quarter. The increase in operating earnings quarter-over-quarter reflects contractual payments associated with the operation of PSEG-Long Island and certain tax items at PSEG Energy Holdings. And we continue to forecast full year operating earnings for 2016 from PSEG Enterprise and Other of $60 million. 
And finally, with respect to financings and other, PSEG closed the quarter with $592 million of cash on the balance sheet, with debt at the end of March representing 44% of our consolidated capital. 
During the quarter, PSE&G issued $850 million of securities, consisting of $300 million of 5-year notes at 1.9% and $550 million of 30-year notes at 3.8% while redeeming $171 million of long-term debt. And we remain in a position to finance our current capital program without the need for the issuance of equity. We continue to forecast operating earnings for the full year of $2.80 to $3 per share. 
That concludes my comments and I will now turn the call back over to the operator for your questions."

However, the major backfill and the out years the plan will be announced in '16 because they're pretty new and that will be a continuation of our guest modernization plan and continuation and the reason why we won't announce those in '16 is because we're only 1.5 years into Energy Strong and we're only 6 months into GSMP, and that's both a 3-year program, give or take a few months on some of the unique aspects of it.

One is to the extent that we're has some localized distribution reinforcement that can be more economically achieve in storage rather than station enhancement. Second would be their classic arbitrage between peak and off-peak Power, which has become less of a economic driver nowadays, just given the abundance of natural gas. Third could be sort of a similarity to that, which is to offset the associated renewables. But in terms of using batteries as speakers, I mean, I think that we just have to take a look again dollars per kW, and my goodness, gas engine just keeps getting more and more efficient and storage seems to be losing in that race to keep up with them. So I think that there are multiple applications. I didn't mean to suggest only one. What I was trying to point out is whether the application is on the supply side or whether it's a customary reliability side, whether it's providing peaking services, other ancillary services.

As the financial synergies between Power's cash generation and Utility's cash needs. It's the customer bill synergies between the customers the Power serves and customers that PSE&G serves, and Power prices go down, PSE&G distribution rate go up quite candidly. And last but not least is the benefits of scale associated with the corporate support functions. And as Power continues to pursue growth opportunities outside PGME's, the first 2 issues become a less important. You have more customers that are not PSE&G customers that we will be serving in New England in New York State, you'll have more need for Power's funds from operations going to Power as opposed to going to the Utility and as both companies get bigger, the corporate support synergies becomes less on a percentage basis. And the reason why I say outside of PGME's is because we're pretty much preemptive from making any acquisitions within And given the slow growth and demand, we're of greenfield development you quickly run into an oversupply situation. Having said all that, we have demonstrated that we're pretty bad as acquiring assets. By that, I mean, we seem to have a more conservative view of where the market is going in keys being the one exception to that, which I believe was largely because of our confidence in our ability to manage construction risks that perhaps others did not possess and also some of the port for the benefit in terms of PJM West. So we look all the time at generation assets. I was about to say anti- coal bias, that sounds very political, and I didn't mean it that way. Just given the direction regulation you won't see us taking a look at any coal expansion in terms of new assets, but we do the in our target markets, which with the rest of PJM, New England and New York State. We just have to get at the right price, and we're going to remain disciplined and what that means for us."

298482,330477874,967823,"Public Service Enterprise Group Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2016",2016-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Kathleen. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. PSEG delivered solid results for the first quarter in the face of rather mild winter temperatures and low prices for natural gas and energy. Earlier this morning, we reported",909,"Thank you, Kathleen. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. PSEG delivered solid results for the first quarter in the face of rather mild winter temperatures and low prices for natural gas and energy. Earlier this morning, we reported operating earnings for the first quarter of 2016 of $0.91 per share versus operating earnings of $1.04 per share in last year's first quarter. Extreme temperature differences between the first quarter of this year and the first quarter of last year provide the backdrop for this quarter's operating results.
The first quarter of 2016 was 10% warmer than normal and the fifth warmest on record. The month of March, in particular was extremely mild with heating degree days 25% lower than normal. Weather for the first quarter was also 27% warmer than the first quarter of 2015, but last year was the coldest on record.
Our results were strong in the face of this headwind. PSE&G's execution on its expanded capital investment program continues to provide a growing source of earnings. PSE&G is expected to invest $3 billion in 2016 as part of its 5-year $12 billion capital program. Transmission is the largest part of PSE&G's effort, representing 60% of planned spending.
PSE&G's investment program and a continued focus on controlling costs will help drive our forecast for double-digit growth in PSE&G's 2016 operating earnings.
PSE&G's execution of our capital program is expected to yield best-in-class growth rate in rate base of 8% per year for the 5-year period ending 2020. PSE&G continues to develop a pipeline of investment opportunities that also made New Jersey's policy objectives and has customer support.
Now as for PSEG Power, it has been focused on operating in an environment of low gas prices for years. The availability and low price of gas, and the need to meet more stringent reliability requirements has added new urgency to the company's efforts to improve its cost structure and efficiency. Power's capital program also represents an important response to today's market. Power's $2 billion of investment in 3 new combined cycle gas turbines will add approximately 1,800 megawatts of clean, reliable and efficient capacity to its fleet. 
Construction of the Keys plant in Maryland and the C1 unit in New Jersey are on schedule to meet their 2018 operating dates. Bridgeport Harbor is expected to be available for 2019 commercial operation date. The addition of this new capacity will transform Power's fleet. Power's baseload nuclear capacity will be complemented by a flexible, low-cost fleet of combined cycle gas units capable of responding to the market.  The fleet's carbon footprint is also expected to decline with the addition of the new clean gas-fired capacity as nuclear generation continues to represent approximately 50% of the fleet's output. As I said, we remain focused on operating efficiently and safely. PSEG Power has made judicious reductions in its nuclear workforce, and is working closely with the industry to identify additional means of reducing its cost structure, to assure the availability of this clean nuclear resource well into the future.  Our goal is to capture these savings for the year to help offset the impact of low gas prices on earnings. 
Separately from operations, we were very pleased with some recent actions in defense of competitive markets. In particular, we were delighted with the U.S. Supreme Court's unanimous decision, affirming the Fourth Circuit's decision in Hughes versus Maryland. Since that decision, the U.S. Supreme Court also dismissed the New Jersey case, allowing to stand the lower court ruling that the so-called LCAPP contracts are unconstitutional. A recent action at FERC is also constructive. I'm referring to the orders issued by FERC earlier this week,, granting the complaints filed by EPSA and others, which called into question some approvals granted by the Public Utility Commission of Ohio. A separate complaint, brought by a number of generating companies regarding the scope of the minimum offer price rule under RPM, is still pending at FERC. While owners of existing assets with out-of-market contracts will not be directly restricted in the upcoming base residual auction regarding how they can bid the affected units, the lack of certainty regarding FERC approval of such contracts should at least neutralize some, if not all of the incentives under the contracts to bid without regard to the unit's actual cost of operations.
We believe that a competitive market is the best approach for ensuring that there is a supply of electric capacity to meet customer demand at the lowest cost.
Our company-wide efforts are focused on building an infrastructure that improves system reliability, reduces emissions and supports the needs of customers. Our strategy is working and it is made possible by the contribution from our dedicated employees, who support our efforts in countless ways. Their focus on the mission of providing safe, reliable energy has allowed us to meet the needs of customers and shareholders.
We are maintaining our operating earnings guidance for the full year of $2.80 to $3 per share. Our guidance assumes normal weather for the remainder of the year. As we move forward, the weather and market conditions during the third quarter will be important for both PSEG Power and PSE&G. Current market conditions and the complete absence of a winter require that we maintain our relentless focus on identifying cost efficiencies and maintaining strong operating performance. With that, I'll turn the call over to Dan, who will discuss our financials in greater detail."
298482,330477874,967823,"Public Service Enterprise Group Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2016",2016-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Ralph, and good morning, everyone. As Ralph said, PSEG reported operating earnings for the first quarter of 2016 of $0.91 per share versus operating earnings of $1.04 per share in last year's first quarter.On Slide 4, we provided you with a r",1690,"Thank you, Ralph, and good morning, everyone. As Ralph said, PSEG reported operating earnings for the first quarter of 2016 of $0.91 per share versus operating earnings of $1.04 per share in last year's first quarter.
On Slide 4, we provided you with a reconciliation of operating earnings to net income for the quarter, and we've provided you with information on Slide 8 regarding the contribution to operating earnings by business for the quarter. Additionally, Slide 9 contains a waterfall chart that takes you through the net changes quarter-over-quarter in operating earnings by major business.
And I'll now walk through each company in more detail. For PSE&G, shown on Slide 11, we reported operating earnings for the first quarter of 2016 of $0.52 per share compared with $0.47 per share for the first quarter of 2015. PSE&G's first quarter results reflect the impact of revenue growth associated with an expansion of its capital investment program, which more than offset the effect of unfavorable weather conditions on electric and gas demand.
Returns on PSE&G's expanded investment in transmission added $0.04 per share to earnings in the quarter. And the first quarter also benefited from the recovery of revenue on PSE&G's Distribution investment under its Energy Strong program. 
This increase in revenue improved quarter-over-quarter earnings comparisons by $0.01 a share. As Ralph mentioned, weather in the first quarter was warmer than normal and significantly warmer than conditions experienced last year. The negative impact of the extreme differences in weather on gas demand in revenue, quarter-over-quarter was largely offset by the gas weather normalization for us. The decline in electric sales and revenue, however, as a result of the extreme differences in weather reduced quarterly earnings comparisons by $0.02 per share.
Lower taxes more than offset an increase in O&M expense due to the absence of insurance recovery of storm costs received in the year ago quarter. These items together added $0.02 per share to quarter-over-quarter earnings.
Economic indicators continued to improve. Employment in New Jersey has increased for 28 consecutive months, as the unemployment rate has declined to 4.3%. And housing market has also experienced an improvement. However, this improvement in economic growth was outweighed during the quarter by a mild weather. The variability in quarterly data for weather normalized electric and gas sales has been high, given the extreme weather conditions, making it difficult to discern a trend in demand when analyzing just the quarterly data. But data for the trailing 12 months indicates weather normalized electric sales were flat for the period ended March of 2016.
And in terms of weather normalized gas demand, a 0.3% decline in sales in the first quarter was led by a 1.5% decline in heating demand from the residential sector, which also is influenced by the large weather adjustment quarter-over-quarter. And on a trailing 12-month basis, gas sales increased by 1.8% year-over-year.
PSE&G's capital program remains on schedule and PSE&G invested approximately $725 million in the first quarter as part of its planned $3 billion capital investment for 2016.
Also as you may recall, PSE&G implemented a $146 million increase in annual transmission revenue under the company's transmission formula rate filing, which took effect this past January. This increase in revenue, adjusted to reflect the impact of bonus depreciation and updates of spending in prior years, will be reflected in PSE&G's earnings throughout the year.  And we're maintaining our forecast of PSE&G's operating earnings for 2016 of $875 million to $925 million.
Moving to Power, as shown on Slide 18, PSEG Power reported operating earnings for the first quarter of $0.36 per share and adjusted EBITDA of $416 million, compared with $0.55 per share and adjusted EBITDA of $626 million for the first quarter of 2015. Adjusted EBITDA excludes the same items as our operating earnings measure as well as income tax expense, interest expense, depreciation and amortization and major maintenance expense at Power's fossil generating facilities.
The earnings release and Slide 19 provide you with a detailed analysis of the impact on Power's operating earnings quarter-over-quarter.
And we have also provided you with more detail on generation for the quarter on Slide 21. PSEG Power's first quarter results were impacted by the extremely mild weather conditions experienced this year in comparison to the year-ago period.
A decline in capacity revenue, associated with the June 2015 retirement of the HEDD, or High Electric Demand Day peaking units in PJM reduced quarter-over-quarter earnings by $0.04 per share. Lower output due to the mild weather conditions, coupled with lower average prices on energy hedges, reduced quarter-over-quarter earnings by $0.09 per share.
And a weather-related decline in total gas send out to commericial and industrial customers and lower prices combined to reduce quarter-over-quarter earnings on gas sales by $0.12 per share.
Lower O&M expense improved quarter-over-quarter earnings by $0.05 per share, and the reduction in interest expense added $0.01 to earnings per share.
Now let's turn to Power's operations. Output from Power's fleet declined 9% in the quarter as a result of the reduced demand and lower wholesale market prices. Output from the Cold fleet reduced during the first quarter, a decline of 1 terawatt hour from 2.5 terawatt hours in the year ago quarter, as low gas prices affected the dispatch of coal. Output from the combined cycle fleet declined 0.2 terawatt hours to 3.7 terawatt hours with the decline in demand. The nuclear fleet, however, experienced a 0.6 terawatt hour improvement in output to 8.4 terawatt hours for the quarter.
The fleet operated at an average capacity factor of 99.7% in the quarter, and the nuclear fleet's performance benefited from an improvement in availability at Salem as well as an increase in capacity at Peach Bottom. And you may recall that the extended Power upgrade work was completed at Peach Bottom last year, and this work added 130 megawatts to our share of the station's capacity.
Power's gas-fired combined cycle fleet has access to low-cost gas, which continues to provide it with an advantage relative to market prices. Towards the lack of demand and the lack of volatility in the market, given the mild weather and an excess supply of gas, pressured spark spreads, which were significantly lower compared to last year's levels. 
Overall, Power's gross margin declined to $43.80 per megawatt hour from $47.32 in the year ago quarter. Power's revising its forecast of output for 2016 to 52 to 54 terawatt hours from its prior forecast of 54 to 56 terawatt hours. The updated range for output incorporates the impact of the abnormally warm weather in the first quarter.
This range also incorporates an anticipated expansion of the Salem 1 refueling outage. A visual inspection during the current refueling outage at Salem 1, which began on April 14, revealed damage to a series of bolts located inside the reactor vessel. We need to conduct further testing to repair and replace the bolts, is expected to extend the refueling outage.
To provide some context, as the rule of thumb, a delay in Salem's refueling outage of 30 days would reduce generation by approximately 0.5 terawatt hour. And under this scenario, nuclear fleets capacity factor for the year would be reduced by about 1.5% to 91% from the current forecasted capacity factor of 92.5% for the year. And the actual outage duration will be determined after ongoing inspection work is completed.
As shown on Slide 24, approximately 70% to 75% of anticipated production for the April to December period of 40 terawatt hours is hedged at an average price of $49 per megawatt hour. Our open position for the remainder of 2016 is more than adequate to cover the potential for a decline in output at Salem from our original forecast.
For 2017, Power's hedged 50% to 55% of its forecast generation of 54 to 56 terawatt hours, at an average price of $49 per megawatt hour. And for 2018, approximately 20% to 25% of the forecast generation of 59 to 61 terawatt hours is hedged at an average price of $49 per megawatt hour. The forecast increase and generation in 2018 reflects the commercial operation of the Keys and Sewaren combined cycle units. 
The hedge data for 2016 continues to assume PGS hedges representing 11 to 12 terawatt hours. As we mentioned to you last quarter, there are items included in our average hedge price, which influence Power's revenue but don't support Power's gross margin. Our average hedge price for the remainder of 2016 reflects an increase in cost elements such as transmission and renewables associated with serving our full requirement hedge obligations. The increase year-over-year in these nonmargin revenue items is approximately 1 to 2 megawatt hours.
We continue to forecast operating earnings for Power in 2016 of $490 million to $540 million. And the forecast for operating earnings represents adjusted EBITDA of $1,320,000,000 to $1.4 billion for the full year, which compares to $1,563,000,000 of adjusted EBITDA in 2015.
I'll briefly address as well Enterprise and Other's operating results. And for the first quarter, we reported operating earnings of $0.03 per share compared with operating earnings of $0.02 per share across last year in the first quarter. The increase in operating earnings quarter-over-quarter reflects contractual payments associated with the operation of PSEG-Long Island and certain tax items at PSEG Energy Holdings. And we continue to forecast full year operating earnings for 2016 from PSEG Enterprise and Other of $60 million.
And finally, with respect to financings and other, PSEG closed the quarter with $592 million of cash on the balance sheet with debt at the end of March representing 44% of our consolidated capital.
During the quarter, PSE&G issued $850 million of securities, consisting of $300 million of 5-year notes at 1.9% and $550 million of 30-year notes at 3.8% while redeeming $171 million of long-term debt. And we remain in a position to finance our current capital program without the need for the issuance of equity. We continue to forecast operating earnings for the full year of $2.80 to $3 per share.

I serve on the board of a company that's involved in the pipeline business, and I just think we're really good at the knitting net we do and I'd like to stick to that. So I am not second-guessing others, please don't misinterpret. I mean they have their own unique reasons for moving in that direction. But typically, the corporate structure is different there, mostly MLPs. They have a fairly different financial proposition. And they're not without their challenges nowadays as well. So that may be a great time to go in, to buy in. There's a raft of sighting challenges associated with this. We're experiencing that in PennEast, there was a major pipeline, and I'm sure you're aware of in New York state. They officially had an unpleasant surprise. So it's a very challenging business with fairly different DNA than what we have in our company. And I like the DNA and the match that our company has with the operations that we're responsible for."

And simply paying a very, very rich premium and still having accretion may not be your best choice. And we've been very clear. Our priorities are: Number 1, organic growth. And number 2, supporting the dividend. and then number 3 will be share repurchase. As I have said to many people, paying a 20-plus PE to someone seems to me to a bad idea when I know a great company that's trading at a 14 or 15 PE that has the ticker symbol PEG.

These are not, to my knowledge, these are not life threatening issues, they are literally 800 volts, typically that secure these metal plates, we call them baffles to the reactor vessel and they are under pressure. There's a pressure gradient because of the high temperatures being that flows through the holes in these baffles and you just get a mechanical stress, in our case that's 832 bolts. They are typical of pressurized water reactors. So that's why I mentioned earlier, to Paul's question that we would have to look at Salem 2 again it is an extra feeling outage or little pass visual inspection in '15, it would not be an issue for Hope Creek because that's a boiling one reactor.

Right, one is to the extent that one has some localized distribution reinforcement that can be more economically achieved through storage rather than substation enhancement. Second would be, your classic arbitrage between peak and off-peak power, which has become less of a economic driver nowadays, just given the abundance of natural gas. Third could be, sort of a similarity to that, which is to offset the intermittency associated with renewables. But in terms of using batteries as speakers, I mean, I think that you just have to take a look again at the dollars per kW, and my goodness, the gas engine just keep getting more and more efficient and storage seems to be losing in that race to keep up with them.

Right that we see 3 very tangible, tactical reasons for remaining integrated. As the financial synergies between Power's cash generation and Utility's cash needs. It's the customer build synergies between the customers of Power serves and the customers that PSE&G serves, and Power's prices go down, PSE&G distribution rates go up quite candidly. And last but not the least is the benefits of scale associated with the corporate support functions. And as Power continues to pursue growth opportunities outside PGME's, the first 2 issues become a less important, right. You have more customers that are not PSE&G customers that we will be serving in New England and in New York State, you'll have more need for Power's funds from operations going to Power as opposed to going over to the Utility, and as both companies get bigger then the corporate support synergies become less on a percentage basis. And the reason why I say outside of PGME's is because we're pretty much preemptive from making any acquisitions within PGME's. And given the slow growth and demand, we're not big fans of greenfield development of PGME's. It just -- you quickly run into an oversupply situation. Having said all of that, we have demonstrated that we're pretty bad in acquiring assets. By that, I mean, we seem to have a more conservative view of where the market is going, and are consistently outbid, Keys being the one exception to that, which I believe was largely because of our confidence in our ability to manage construction risk that perhaps others did not possess and also some of the portfolio benefit it brought us in terms of PJM West. So we look all the time at generation assets. We have an anti -- I was  about to say anti- coal bias, that sounds very political, and I didn't mean it that way. But just given the direction environmental regulation you won't see us taking a look at any coal expansions in terms of new assets, but we do look in our target markets, which would be the rest of PJM, New England and New York State. We just have to get at the right price, and we're going to remain disciplined and what that means for us."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. PSEG delivered solid results for the first quarter in the face of rather mild winter temperatures and low prices for natural gas and energy. Earlier this morning, we reported",910,"Thank you, Kathleen. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. PSEG delivered solid results for the first quarter in the face of rather mild winter temperatures and low prices for natural gas and energy. Earlier this morning, we reported operating earnings for the first quarter of 2016 of $0.91 per share versus operating earnings of $1.04 per share in last year's first quarter. Extreme temperature differences between the first quarter of this year and the first quarter of last year provide the backdrop for this quarter's operating results.
The first quarter of 2016 was 10% warmer than normal and the fifth warmest on record. The month of March, in particular, was extremely mild with heating degree days 25% lower than normal. Weather for the first quarter was also 27% warmer than the first quarter of 2015, but last year was the coldest on record.
Our results were strong in the face of this headwind. PSE&G's execution on its expanded capital investment program continues to provide a growing source of earnings. PSE&G is expected to invest $3 billion in 2016 as part of its 5-year $12 billion capital program. Transmission is the largest part of PSE&G's effort, representing 60% of planned spending.
PSE&G's investment program and a continued focus on controlling costs will help drive our forecast for double-digit growth in PSE&G's 2016 operating earnings.
PSE&G's execution of our capital program is expected to yield best-in-class growth rate in rate base of 8% per year for the 5-year period ending 2020. PSE&G continues to develop a pipeline of investment opportunities that also made New Jersey's policy objectives and has customer support.
Now as for PSEG Power, it has been focused on operating in an environment of low gas prices for years. The availability and low price of gas, and the need to meet more stringent reliability requirements has added new urgency to the company's efforts to improve its cost structure and efficiency. Power's capital program also represents an important response to today's market. Power's $2 billion of investment in 3 new combined cycle gas turbines will add approximately 1,800 megawatts of clean, reliable and efficient capacity to its fleet. 
Construction of the Keys plant in Maryland and the Sewaren unit in New Jersey are on schedule to meet their 2018 operating dates. Bridgeport Harbor is expected to be available for a 2019 commercial operation date. The addition of this new capacity will transform Power's fleet. Power's baseload nuclear capacity will be complemented by a flexible, low-cost fleet of combined cycle gas units capable of responding to the market. The fleet's carbon footprint is also expected to decline with the addition of the new, clean gas-fired capacity as nuclear generation continues to represent approximately 50% of the fleet's output. As I said, we remain focused on operating efficiently and safely. PSEG Power has made judicious reductions in its nuclear workforce, and is working closely with the industry to identify additional means of reducing its cost structure, to assure the availability of this clean nuclear resource well into the future. Our goal is to capture these savings for the year to help offset the impact of low gas prices on earnings. 
Separately from operations, we were very pleased with some recent actions in defense of competitive markets. In particular, we were delighted with the U.S. Supreme Court's unanimous decision affirming the Fourth Circuit's decision in Hughes versus Maryland. Since that decision, the U.S. Supreme Court also dismissed the New Jersey case, allowing to stand the lower court ruling that the so-called LCAPP contracts are unconstitutional. A recent action at FERC is also constructive. I'm referring to the orders issued by FERC earlier this week granting the complaints filed by EPSA and others, which called into question some approvals granted by the Public Utility Commission of Ohio. A separate complaint, brought by a number of generating companies regarding the scope of the minimum offer price rule under RPM, is still pending at FERC. While owners of existing assets with out-of-market contracts will not be directly restricted in the upcoming base residual auction regarding how they can bid the affected units, the lack of certainty regarding FERC approval of such contracts should at least neutralize some, if not all of the incentives under the contracts to bid without regard to the unit's actual cost of operations.
We believe that a competitive market is the best approach for ensuring that there is a supply of electric capacity to meet customer demand at the lowest cost.
Our company-wide efforts are focused on building an infrastructure that improves system reliability, reduces emissions and supports the needs of customers. Our strategy is working and it is made possible by the contribution from our dedicated employees, who support our efforts in countless ways. Their focus on the mission of providing safe, reliable energy has allowed us to meet the needs of customers and shareholders.
We are maintaining our operating earnings guidance for the full year of $2.80 to $3 per share. Our guidance assumes normal weather for the remainder of the year. As we move forward, the weather and market conditions during the third quarter will be important for both PSEG Power and PSE&G. Current market conditions and the complete absence of a winter require that we maintain our relentless focus on identifying cost efficiencies and maintaining strong operating performance. With that, I'll turn the call over to Dan, who will discuss our financials in greater detail."
298482,330477874,968011,"Public Service Enterprise Group Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2016",2016-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Ralph, and good morning, everyone. As Ralph said, PSEG reported operating earnings for the first quarter of 2016 of $0.91 per share versus operating earnings of $1.04 per share in last year's first quarter.On Slide 4, we provided you with a r",1687,"Thank you, Ralph, and good morning, everyone. As Ralph said, PSEG reported operating earnings for the first quarter of 2016 of $0.91 per share versus operating earnings of $1.04 per share in last year's first quarter.
On Slide 4, we provided you with a reconciliation of operating earnings to net income for the quarter, and we've provided you with information on Slide 8 regarding the contribution to operating earnings by business for the quarter. Additionally, Slide 9 contains a waterfall chart that takes you through the net changes quarter-over-quarter in operating earnings by major business.
And I'll now walk through each company in more detail. For PSE&G, shown on Slide 11, we reported operating earnings for the first quarter of 2016 of $0.52 per share compared with $0.47 per share for the first quarter of 2015. PSE&G's first quarter results reflect the impact of revenue growth associated with an expansion of its capital investment program, which more than offset the effect of unfavorable weather conditions on electric and gas demand.
Returns on PSE&G's expanded investment in transmission added $0.04 per share to earnings in the quarter. And the first quarter also benefited from the recovery of revenue on PSE&G's Distribution investment under its Energy Strong program. 
This increase in revenue improved quarter-over-quarter earnings comparisons by $0.01 a share. As Ralph mentioned, weather in the first quarter was warmer than normal and significantly warmer than conditions experienced last year. The negative impact of the extreme differences in weather on gas demand in revenue quarter-over-quarter was largely offset by the gas weather normalization for us. The decline in electric sales and revenue, however, as a result of the extreme differences in weather reduced quarterly earnings comparisons by $0.02 per share.
Lower taxes more than offset an increase in O&M expense due to the absence of insurance recovery of storm costs received in the year-ago quarter. These items together added $0.02 per share to quarter-over-quarter earnings.
Economic indicators continued to improve. Employment in New Jersey has increased for 28 consecutive months, as the unemployment rate has declined to 4.3%. And the housing market has also experienced an improvement. However, this improvement in economic growth was outweighed during the quarter by mild weather. The variability in quarterly data for weather normalized electric and gas sales has been high, given the extreme weather conditions, making it difficult to discern a trend in demand when analyzing just the quarterly data. But data for the trailing 12 months indicates weather normalized electric sales were flat for the period ended March of 2016.
And in terms of weather normalized gas demand, a 0.3% decline in sales in the first quarter was led by a 1.5% decline in heating demand from the residential sector, which also is influenced by the large weather adjustment quarter-over-quarter. And on a trailing 12-month basis, gas sales increased by 1.8% year-over-year.
PSE&G's capital program remains on schedule and PSE&G invested approximately $725 million in the first quarter as part of its planned $3 billion capital investment for 2016.
Also as you may recall, PSE&G implemented a $146 million increase in annual transmission revenue under the company's transmission formula rate filing, which took effect this past January. This increase in revenue, adjusted to reflect the impact of bonus depreciation and updates of spending in prior years, will be reflected in PSE&G's earnings throughout the year. However, we're maintaining our forecast of PSE&G's operating earnings for 2016 of $875 million to $925 million.
Moving to Power, as shown on Slide 18, PSEG Power reported operating earnings for the first quarter of $0.36 per share and adjusted EBITDA of $416 million, compared with $0.55 per share and adjusted EBITDA of $626 million for the first quarter of 2015. Adjusted EBITDA excludes the same items as our operating earnings measure as well as income tax expense, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, and major maintenance expense at Power's fossil generating facilities.
The earnings release and Slide 19 provide you with a detailed analysis of the impact on Power's operating earnings quarter-over-quarter.
And we have also provided you with more detail on generation for the quarter on Slide 21. PSEG Power's first quarter results were impacted by the extremely mild weather conditions experienced this year in comparison to the year-ago period.
A decline in capacity revenue, associated with the June 2015 retirement of the HEDD, or High Electric Demand Day, peaking units in PJM reduced quarter-over-quarter earnings by $0.04 per share. Lower output due to the mild weather conditions, coupled with lower average prices on energy hedges, reduced quarter-over-quarter earnings by $0.09 per share.
And a weather-related decline in total gas send-out to commercial and industrial customers and lower prices combined to reduce quarter-over-quarter earnings on gas sales by $0.12 per share.
Lower O&M expense improved quarter-over-quarter earnings by $0.05 per share, and the reduction in interest expense added $0.01 to earnings per share.
Now let's turn to Power's operations. Output from Power's fleet declined 9% in the quarter as a result of the reduced demand and lower wholesale market prices. Output from the Cold fleet reduced, during the first quarter, a decline of 1 terawatt hour from 2.5 terawatt hours in the year ago quarter, as low gas prices affected the dispatch of coal. Output from the combined cycle fleet declined 0.2 terawatt hours to 3.7 terawatt hours, with the decline in demand. The nuclear fleet, however, experienced a 0.6 terawatt hour improvement in output to 8.4 terawatt hours for the quarter.
The fleet operated at an average capacity factor of 99.7% in the quarter, and the nuclear fleet's performance benefited from an improvement in availability at Salem as well as an increase in capacity at Peach Bottom. And you may recall that the extended Power upgrade work was completed at Peach Bottom last year, and this work added 130 megawatts to our share of the station's capacity.
Power's gas-fired combined cycle fleet has access to low-cost gas, which continues to provide it with an advantage relative to market prices. However, the lack of demand and the lack of volatility in the market, given the mild weather and an excess supply of gas, pressured spark spreads, which were significantly lower compared to last year's levels. 
Overall, Power's gross margin declined to $43.80 per megawatt hour from $47.32 in the year ago quarter. Power's revising its forecast of output for 2016 to 52 to 54 terawatt hours from its prior forecast of 54 to 56 terawatt hours. The updated range for output incorporates the impact of the abnormally warm weather in the first quarter.
This range also incorporates an anticipated extension of the Salem 1 refueling outage. A visual inspection during the current refueling outage at Salem 1, which began on April 14, revealed damage to a series of bolts located inside the reactor vessel. The need to conduct further testing to repair and replace the bolts is expected to extend the refueling outage.
To provide some context, as the rule of thumb, a delay in Salem's refueling outage of 30 days would reduce generation by approximately 0.5 terawatt hour. And under this scenario, nuclear fleets' capacity factor for the year would be reduced by about 1.5% to 91% from the current forecasted capacity factor of 92.5% for the year. And the actual outage duration will be determined after ongoing inspection work is completed.
As shown on Slide 24, approximately 70% to 75% of anticipated production for the April to December period of 40 terawatt hours is hedged at an average price of $49 per megawatt hour. Our open position for the remainder of 2016 is more than adequate to cover the potential for a decline in output at Salem from our original forecast.
For 2017, Power's hedged 50% to 55% of its forecast generation of 54 to 56 terawatt hours at an average price of $49 per megawatt hour. And for 2018, approximately 20% to 25% of the forecast generation of 59 to 61 terawatt hours is hedged at an average price of $49 per megawatt hour. The forecast increase in generation in 2018 reflects the commercial operation of the Keys and Sewaren combined cycle units. 
The hedge data for 2016 continues to assume PGS hedges representing 11 to 12 terawatt hours. As we mentioned to you last quarter, there are items included in our average hedge price, which influence Power's revenue but don't support Power's gross margin. Our average hedge price for the remainder of 2016 reflects an increase in cost elements such as transmission and renewables associated with serving our full requirement hedge obligations. The increase year-over-year in these nonmargin revenue items is approximately 1 to 2 megawatt hours.
We continue to forecast operating earnings for Power in 2016 of $490 million to $540 million. And the forecast for operating earnings represents adjusted EBITDA of $1,320,000,000 to $1.4 billion for the full year, which compares to $1,563,000,000 of adjusted EBITDA in 2015.
I'll briefly address as well Enterprise and Other's operating results. And for the first quarter, we reported operating earnings of $0.03 per share compared with operating earnings of $0.02 per share last year in the first quarter. The increase in operating earnings quarter-over-quarter reflects contractual payments associated with the operation of PSEG-Long Island and certain tax items at PSEG Energy Holdings. And we continue to forecast full year operating earnings for 2016 from PSEG Enterprise and Other of $60 million.
And finally, with respect to financings and other, PSEG closed the quarter with $592 million of cash on the balance sheet with debt at the end of March representing 44% of our consolidated capital.
During the quarter, PSE&G issued $850 million of securities, consisting of $300 million of 5-year notes at 1.9% and $550 million of 30-year notes at 3.8% while redeeming $171 million of long-term debt. And we remain in a position to finance our current capital program without the need for the issuance of equity. We continue to forecast operating earnings for the full year of $2.80 to $3 per share.

There's a pressure gradient because of the high temperatures being that flows through the holes in these baffles and you just get a mechanical stress. In our case, we have 832 bolts. They are typical of pressurized water reactors. So that's why I mentioned earlier, to Paul's question, that we would have to look at Salem 2 again at this next revealing outage, although it passed visual inspection in '15.

What are the types of projects? What do you have to do from the regulatory construct process to get those approved?"

There's ongoing renewable portfolio standard commitments that could result in some additional solar work. There are a couple of special projects that we haven't named publicly on the distribution system that involve major customers that would benefit the entire customer base that we'll be pursuing. There's always new and additional work that comes out of it, PJM-RTEP, and that's the kind of stuff you'll see us looking at and potentially announcing in '16. However, the major backfill in the out years of the plan will be announced in '16 because they're pretty new and that will be a continuation of our Gas System Modernization Plan, and a continuation of Energy Strong. And the reason why we won't announce those in '16 is because we're only 1.5 years into Energy Strong and we're only 6 months into GSMP, and both were both 3 year programs, give or take, a few months on some unique aspects of them. So you're right to say that we have historically backfilled the years 4 and 5. I think there's a very high probability we'll do the same this time. But I think that in terms of the goals for '16, it will be more -- some significant distribution projects that we have and potentially some solar work that -- to keep this data on its RPS targets, you'll see us pursuing in the near term."

Right, one is to the extent that one has some localized distribution reinforcement that can be more economically achieved through storage rather than substation enhancement. Second would be, your classic arbitrage between peak and off-peak power, which has become less of an economic driver nowadays, just given the abundance of natural gas. Third could be, sort of a similarity to that, which is to offset the intermittency associated with renewables. But in terms of using batteries as peakers, I mean, I think that you just have to take a look again at the dollars per kW, and my goodness, the gas engines just keep getting more and more efficient and Storage seems to be losing in that race to keep up with them. So I think there are multiple applications. I didn't mean to suggest that we would only consider one. What I was trying to point out is whether the application is on the supply side or whether it's a customer reliability side, whether it's providing peaking services, other ancillary services. We don't have a religious fervor around one technology or another. We look at all, all the time."

I mean, that's pretty much what we've told the world, right, that we see 3 very tangible, tactical reasons for remaining integrated. It's the financial synergy between Power's cash generation and Utility's cash needs. It's the customer build synergies between the customers that Power serves and the customers that PSE&G serves, and Power's prices go down, PSE&G distribution rates go up, quite candidly. And last but not the least is the benefits of scale associated with the corporate support functions. And as Power continues to pursue growth opportunities outside PGM East, the first 2 issues become less important, right? You have more customers that are not PSE&G customers that we will be serving in New England and in New York State. You have more need for Power's funds from operations going to Power as opposed to going over to the Utility. And as both companies get bigger then the corporate support synergies become less on a percentage basis. And the reason why I say outside of PGM East is because we're pretty much preemptive from making any acquisitions within PGM East. And given the slow growth and demand, we're not big fans of greenfield development in PGM East. It's just you quickly run into an oversupply situation. Having said all of that, we have demonstrated that we're pretty bad in acquiring assets. By that, I mean, we seem to have a more conservative view of where the market is going, and are consistently outbid, Keys being the one exception to that, which I believe was largely because of our confidence in our ability to manage construction risk that perhaps others did not possess and also some of the portfolio benefit it brought us in terms of PJM West. So we look all the time at generation assets. We have an anti -- I was about to say anti-coal bias, but that sounds very political, and I didn't mean it that way. But just given the direction environmental regulation you won't see us taking a look at any coal expansions in terms of new assets, but we do look in our target markets, which would be the rest of PJM, New England and New York State. We just have to get it at the right price, and we're going to remain disciplined and what that means for us."

PSEG's results for the second quarter were characterized by a tough environment for power markets, but also, with continued growth associated with PSE&G's expanded capital program. Earl",1156,"Thank you, Kathleen, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. PSEG's results for the second quarter were characterized by a tough environment for power markets, but also, with continued growth associated with PSE&G's expanded capital program. 
Earlier this morning, we reported net income for the quarter of $0.37 per share. Operating earnings for the second quarter of 2016 was $0.57 per share. Operating earnings were in line with the $0.57 per share earning in 2015 second quarter.
The results for the quarter bring operating earnings for the first half of 2016 to $1.48 per share, which compares with operating earnings of $1.61 per share earned in 2015's first half.
Slides 4 and 5 contain the detail on the results for the quarter and the first half. PSE&G's execution on its expanded capital investment program continues to provide a growing source of earnings, and powers prudent management of reductions in O&M minimize the impact of the extended outage at sale on earnings. 
PSE&G is on track to invest $3 billion in 2016 as part of its 5-year $12 billion capital program. PSE&G's ability to earn its authorized return on investment continues to drive our forecast for double-digit growth in PSE&G's 2016 earnings. 
We continue to look for opportunities to grow in a manner that meets customers' demand for reliable, efficient and clean energy and provides the risk-adjusted return demanded by shareholders. 
In the past quarter, we have identified more than $500 million of additional investment opportunities in our regulated utility company, PSE&G. During the past quarter, PSE&G requested an extension for the New Jersey board of public utilities of its existing landfill ground field solar program. The program would add 100 megawatts off grid connected solar facilities over 5-year period at the cost of approximately $240 million.
The program would also create 575 direct jobs in New Jersey during the construction period and allow all customers to share on the benefits of solar. We hope to see a decision on this request during the fourth quarter of this year.
In addition, PSE&G has increased its estimate of distribution capital expenditures over 2016 through '18 by $300 million to address what is commonly referred to as new business request and to replace certain aging equipment and infrastructure.
As I mentioned, these programs together would represent an increase of more than $500 million over PSE&G's current plans to invest $12 billion over the 5-year period ended 2020.
PSE&G's robust investment program will insure that remains one of the most reliable utilities in the nation as was demonstrated during the period of intense heat and activity experienced over the past 2 weeks.
The investment program will also improve on PSE&G's growth in rate base currently forecasted at 8% per year for the 5-year period ending 2020. 
The powers capital program is also an important response to the need of today's market, which requires that we operate at greater levels of reliability and efficiency. The planned replacement of older generating capacity at the seawall in Bridgeport station and new capacity at Keys amounts to 1,800 megawatts of new, clean and efficient gas pipe capacity over the next 3 years.
This will transform fleet and enhance its competitive position. We will see an increase in capacity, we will see an increase in reliability, we will see an increase in efficiency and we will see a reduction in carbon emission.
Although power has focused on the construction of the new combined cycle new units, power has also committed to improving the efficiency of existing capacity and ensuring its long-term availability. This can be seen through completion of a small upbreak at its peaking stations, which added 14 megawatts to capacity. Power also plans to increase the efficiency in capacity of the Bethlehem Energy Center through Advanced Gas Path subgrades in the turbines over 2017 and '18. When completed, this work is expected to have 58 megawatts to BEC's capacity. 
And the recent issuance of the final renewal permit for the sale at station that meets the requirements of Section 3 16 B of the Clean Water Act helps to assure the long-term availability of this 0 carbon generating resource. 
Finally, Power has made targeted reductions in its workforce and continues to identify additional means of reducing its cost structure to assure the availability and dispatch of the fleet in the current low price environment.
The power market over the short term continues to be characterized by an oversupply of gas. The market, however, has shown signs of improvement as gas prices have responded to a decline in production. 
The improvement in the supply picture and the development of more outlets for supply has also led to an improvement in forward basis. As we've indicated in the past, we continue to expect basis to be seasonal that is positive in the winter and neutral to negative in the summer, and so more takeaway capacity goes into operation. 
In May 2016, PSEG announced the results of the RPM auction for the 2019, 2020 -- to 2010 delivery year. Power cleared approximately 8,900 megawatts of its generating capacity at an average price of a $116 per megawatt day. The average price received by Power, while lower than prior auctions, continues to represent a premium to the average price per capacity in the RTO. 
Prices in the most recent auction reflects PSEG's downwardly revised demand forecast. Changes in the emergency transfer limits due to its transmission expansion and the effects for both new generation and unclear generation from the prior year's auction. 
However, the results from the RPM auction were in line with our expectations. Nearly all the powers clear capacity in the latest auction complies with PSEG's capacity performance requirements, and the fleet is expected to be in the position to meet PGM's requirement at 100% of capacity for 2020 to 2021 delivery year must meet those CP requirements. 
On the regulatory front, FERC has approved 2 of the 5 recommended steps to approve energy price formation. Further efforts to address transparency in the scheduling of capacity could lead to improved alignment of prices with costs. 
The EU has presented challenges. Looking forward to the second half of the year, we're maintaining operating earnings guidance for 2016 of $2.80 to $3 per share, but will be difficult to reach the upper end of the guidance even with an improvement in the Power markets, expectations for long summer weather, restoration of normal operations at Salem and ongoing cost control and management of O&M. 
Our highly skilled workforce has met the markets' challenges through the rightsizing of resources and by identifying investments that meet customers' needs. Our dedication to customer service, strong balance sheet and our ability to invest in the future of the company are expected to drive long-term value creation. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Dan who will discuss our financials in greater detail and then I'll be available for further questions."

As Ralph said, PSEG reported operating earnings for the second quarter of 2016 of $0.57 per share, the same as operating earnings of $0.57 per share in last year's second quarter. The reco",1806,"Thank you, Ralph, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. 
As Ralph said, PSEG reported operating earnings for the second quarter of 2016 of $0.57 per share, the same as operating earnings of $0.57 per share in last year's second quarter. The reconciliation of operating earnings to net income for the quarter can be found on Slide 4. 
We've also provided you with a waterfall chart on Slide 10 that takes you through the net changes in the quarter-over-quarter operating earnings by major business, and a similar chart on Slide 12 provides you with the changes in operating earnings by business on a year-to-date basis. 
I'll now review each company in a little bit more detail starting with PSE&G. PSE&G reported net income for the second quarter of 2016 of $0.35 per share compared with $0.33 per share for the second quarter of 2015 for a 6% improvement in earnings. 
Our results for the quarter are shown on Slide 14.
PSE&G's operating results for the second quarter reflect the impact of a revenue growth associated with the expansion of the company's capital investment program. Returns on PSE&G's expanded investment in transmission added $0.03 per share to earnings for the quarter. Increase and depreciation on O&M expense of $0.02 per share was partially offset by a decline in taxes and other items. The high level of depreciation is related to the growth in capital spending, and higher levels of OEM reflect spending on vegetation management. 
In New Jersey, economy continues to show steady growth and unemployment levels have shown improvement from a year ago. The variability and quarterly data for weather normalized electric and gas sales has been high, given extreme weather comparisons. Weather-normalized electric sales reflect growth in residential and commercial customers, which is offset by continuing decline in the industrial sector and increased energy efficiency measures. So our trailing 12-month basis, weather-normalized electric sales were essentially flat.
PSE&G's capital program remains on schedule. PSE&G investment approximately $1.4 billion during the first half of the year as part of its planned 2016 capital program of $3 billion.
As Ralph mentioned, PSE&G has identified investment opportunities, which if approved, will increase PSE&G's 5-year capital program by approximately $500 million to $12.5 billion, and you should expect the majority of this increase in spending will occur between 2016 and 2018.
Once again, all of these growth will be funded without the need to issue new equity. As you may recall, PSE&G implemented $146 million increase in annual transmission revenue under the company's transmission formula rate filing, which took effect this past January. This increase in revenue adjusted to reflect the impact of bonus depreciation and update suspending the prior years will be reflected in PSE&G's earnings throughout the year. We'll also remind you that the quarter-to-quarter earnings comparisons associated with PSE&G's investment in transmission are not expected to be even during the second half of the year. The recognition of bonus depreciation in 2015 and some other expenses at the end of the year reduced PSE&G's fourth quarter 2015 earnings by about $0.04 per share. The contributions to earnings from the Energy's strong capital program will also be more evident during the second of the year, given growth in the Energy Strong-related spending, the shape of the rate structure which places more emphasis on demand charges during the third quarter.
We are increasing our forecast of PSE&G's operating earnings for 2016 to $900 million to $935 million from $875 million to $925 million, and a change in corporate cost control efforts and a strong start to summer weather. 
Now let's turn to Power. PSE&G Power reported a net loss for the quarter of $11 million or $0.02 per share compared with net income of $166 million or $0.33 per share for the year ago quarter. Operating earnings were $0.18 per share for the second quarter of 2016 and adjusted EBITDA was $272 million as compared with operating earnings of $0.22 per share and adjusted EBITDA of $301 million for the second quarter of 2015.
And our adjusted EBITDA excludes the same items as operating earnings as well as income tax expense, interest expense, depreciation and amortization and major maintenance at Power's generating facilities. 
The earnings release in Slide 20 provide you with detailed analysis of Power's operating earnings quarter-over-quarter. We've also provided you with more detail on generation for the quarter and the first half of the year on Slide 22 and 23.
Power's operating results for the second quarter reflect the impact of the known decline in PJM capacity revenues and average prices and energy hedges, in addition to the effective and expanded refueling outage at Salem 1. Declining capacity revenue associated with the June 2015 retirement of capacity in PJM reduced quarter-over-quarter income by $0.02 per share, and capacity revenue during the second half of 2016 should approximate the revenues received during the last 6 months of 2015.
Earnings comparisons in the quarter were also impacted by a decline in the average price received on energy hedges as well as lower market prices and gas volumes, which together, reduced Power's quarter-over-quarter income by $0.03 per share and a decline of output reduced income by $0.01 per share. 
Our reduction in O&M expense improved Power's quarter-over-quarter income by $0.07 per share. This improvement reflects the absence in 2016 of costs incurred during the second quarter of 2015 for the refueling outage at the Hope Creek nuclear plant, which is 100% owned by Power and major maintenance work at our combined cycle units. And the quarterly comparisons also benefited from targeted reduction in O&M and Power's nuclear and fossil stations as well as from changes in the management of work schedules associated with the sale on one of the refueling outage, which will minimize the overall cost of the outage. 
As we mentioned during the first quarter earnings call, the Salem 1 refueling outage, which began on April 14, would be extended to repair degraded level holes. The volt replaement has been completed and the unit is in the process of returning to service. 
During the quarter, an increase in depreciation expense was offset by a decline in interest expense. However, in absence in 2016 of tax credits received in the year-ago quarter and other tax items contributed to a reduction in quarter-over-quarter income of $0.05 per share. 
Turning to Power's operations. Output at Power's generating facilities declined 6% in the quarter as a result of lower wholesale market prices and reduced demand. Output from the gas-fired combined cycle fleet declined slightly to 4.4 terawatt hours from 4.6 terawatt hours, given mild weather conditions relative to the year-ago quarter. Low gas prices impacted the dispatch of Power's coal-fired fleet and during the quarter, the output from the coal fleet declined to 0.9 terawatt hours from 1.3 terawatt hours.
Output from the nuclear fleet was largely unchanged in the quarter with 7 terawatt hours in this quarter versus 7.1 terawatt hours in the year-ago quarter. The impact of the extended outage at Salem was largely offset by an increase in output at Peach Bottom, and completion of the extended Power operated peach bottom aired at 130 megawatts in the aggregate to Power's interest in the station. 
Salem 2 is out of service for 3 days at the end of the quarter and remains out of service. The unplanned outage at Salem 2 is the result of an electrical fault and reactor's nonnuclear balance of plant. And the extension of the outage at Salem 1 into July and the unplanned outage at Salem 2 will have a continuing effect on performance in the third quarter. 
Power's gross margin in the second quarter declined to $38.54 per megawatt hour from $40.15 per megawatt hour. Power's margin in the quarter experienced only a modest benefit from the gas-fired combined cycle fleet access to low-cost gas. 
A lack of demand and low volatility in the market, given an excess supply of gas, pressured spark spreads. 
The power markets over the last month have seen prices move to higher levels, given the impact on gas supply from hotter-than-normal weather and declines in production. And improvement in lower end prizes will help margins on base load units as an increasing regional gas prices will also support margins at the gas-fired combined cycle fleet.
For the year, Power's providing forecast of output to 50 to 52 terawatt hours from a prior forecast of 52 to 54 terawatt hours, and the updated forecast incorporates the results for the first half of the year and takes into account the extension of the outage of both units at Salem.
As shown on Slide 26, approximately 75% to 80% of anticipated production for the second half of 2016 of 25 to 26 terawatt hours is hedged at an average price of $50 per megawatt hour. For 2017, Power has hedged 55% to 60% of its forecast generation of 53 to 55 terawatt hours at an average price of $48 a megawatt hour. And for 2018, Power has hedged approximately 25% to 30% of forecast generation of 58 to 60 terawatt hours at an average price of $46 per megawatt hour. 
The forecasted increase in output for 2018  reflects the commercial start-up of a new gas-fired combined cycle capacity at the keys and C1 stations. The percentage of energy hedge for 2017 and 2018 is slightly greater than what we communicated to you earlier this year and in line with our practice. We've adjusted our forecast to Power's full year 2016 operating earnings to $460 million to $525 million from $490 million to $540 million to incorporate the results for the first half of the year. 
The revised forecast represents an adjusted EBITDA of $1.27 billion to $1.375 billion. 
I'll turn to PSEG Enterprise and other. The net income for PSEG Energy Holdings and Enterprise in the second quarter of 2016 was $19 million or $0.04 per share versus net income of $12 million and $0.02 per share for the second quarter of 2015. The increase in quarter-over-quarter income reflects contractual payments associated with operation of PSEG Long Island and certain tax items at PSEG Energy Holdings. We raised our forecast for the full year of operations to $65 million.
Our financial position remains strong. PSEG closed the quarter ended June 30, 2016, with $648 million of cash on its balance sheet, with debt at the end of the quarter representing 45% of consolidated capital. And during the quarter, Power issued $700 million of 3% 5-year senior notes due in the year 2021. 
We do not foresee the need to issue equity to finance our expanded capital program. And as Rob mentioned, we are maintaining our forecast of operating earnings for the full year of $2.80 to $3 per share. And with that, we'll be happy to take any questions."

I don't know the latest numbers. I think 10 to 15 plants are rumored to be at risk of retiring, half a dozen have retired. Our dilemma is that as active industry participants frustrated by an absence of carbon value given to nuclear plant and seeing what's happening around us, as we're trying to engage policymakers in the conversation, that nuclear is not getting the credit that it deserves. Our challenge is quite was economically. So notwithstanding the importance of carbon, I think the motivation in other markets are some of the near-term economic consequences of shutting those plants given the lack of profitability. So we don't have that situation. We're glad we don't have that situation, but it does sort of impair our ability to have the same level of interest and participation in the discussion. So we've been talking about fuel diversity. We've been talking about 90-plus percent capacity factors and what it would mean should long-term forces require the replacement of that, whatever those long-term forces might be. But it is kind of a difficult conversation to have, given how many pressing problems are staring policymakers in the face right this minute. So on the 1 hand, I don't want to go on.

Power doesn't have a lot of megawatts, but it's financial strength and its profitability, I think, are quite unique. And we're very proud of and we work hard to preserve that in making our operating and investment decisions.

Number  two, in terms of renewables, we've been active on 2 fronts. On regulated side, we have about 300 megawatts that are in 12 or 14 states. I've lost track. And we specifically embarked on a crawl, walk,run strategy. Actually right now, we're jogging. And those projects have done well. Everyone in those have met their performance. In fact, most of them slightly exceeds the performance. Most of our solar investment, however, has been cut to trade in PSE&G, and that's been a blend of rooftop funded solar where we don't own the assets but we have regulatory assets that support the rooftop and then grid connected. As you know, in New Jersey, grid connected is measured in single-digit megawatts as opposed to a double or triple digit megawatts  Notwithstanding impressive price improvements on these installations, they still are substantially above conventional technology power prices. So our estimates right now are that in New Jersey, people pay anywhere from $4 to $6 a month for solar energy, and that's typical residential homeowner. Obviously, the average homeowner means that a bunch of people pay, more bunch of people pay less. And all our customers survey information suggest that, that is at or above the level that people are comfortable paying. So our pursuit of solar in PSE&G is really driven by the RPS and the desire to achieve those policy-mandated targets at as low a price as possible. And doing things 3 and 4 megawatts at a time on landfill is a lot less expensive than doing them 2 or 3 kilowatt hour at a time on rooftops. But one has to be careful even 3 and 5 megawatts at the time as still in practice. So long-standing fans of solar. We're not apologist for it, but we do have to balance the billing tax. And so we pursue those opportunities in State, in accordance with the RPS and in other states, in accordance with those utilities need to meet their RPS and secure those investments through Power purchase agreements."

The utility growth, driven by customer needs and policymaker priorities, is really continuing unabated. Rather than showing up the year after each estimating and telling you about what we found, we're trying to do a better job of keeping you appraised of things as we look at them. So you have a little bit over $500 million on this stuff that we've been doing, $300 million of which we're definitely going to do and a couple hundred million, which we're waiting for you to keep even on. 
Power remains quite focused on markets managing its cost, its performance and its investment decisions. With a real disciplined, what the markets telling us. So some challenging pricing environment, some great O&M control. And then third and final take away is that this balance sheet remained strong. There's no change in our dividend policy. We continue to have the belief for the opportunity, for sustained growth if that dividend that continues. And that these expanding investment needs at the utility and opportunities at the utility can be met without the equity. So I think we're on a little hiatus for a couple of weeks, and we'll be back on the road in September and certainly see all of you early in November at. So thanks very much for joining us. Have a very great rest of summer, folks."

PSE&G's execution on its expanded capital investment program continues to provide a growing source of earnings, and Power's prudent management of reductions in O&M minimized the impact of the extended outage at sale on earnings. 
PSE&G is on track to invest $3 billion in 2016 as part of its 5-year $12 billion capital program. PSE&G's ability to earn its authorized return on investment continues to drive our forecast for double-digit growth in PSE&G's 2016 earnings. 
We continue to look for opportunities to grow in a manner that meets customers' demand for reliable, efficient and clean energy and provides the risk-adjusted return demanded by shareholders. 
In the past quarter, we have identified more than $500 million of additional investment opportunities at our regulated utility company, PSE&G. During the past quarter, PSE&G requested an extension from the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities of its existing landfill/brownfield solar program. The program would add 100 megawatts of grid-connected solar facilities over a 5-year period at the cost of approximately $240 million. The program would also create 575 direct jobs in New Jersey during the construction period and allow all customers to share in the benefits of solar. We hope to see a decision on this request during the fourth quarter of this year.
In addition, PSE&G has increased its estimate of distribution capital expenditures over 2016 through '18 by $300 million to address what is commonly referred to as new business request and to replace certain aging equipment and infrastructure. As I mentioned, these programs together would represent an increase of more than $500 million over PSE&G's current plans to invest $12 billion over the 5-year period ended 2020.
PSE&G's robust investment program will ensure that remains one of the most reliable utilities in the nation as was demonstrated during the period of intense heat and thunderstorm activity experienced over the past 2 weeks. The investment program will also improve on PSE&G's growth in rate base, currently forecasted at 8% per year, for the 5-year period ending 2020. 
The Power's capital program is also an important response to the needs of today's market, which requires that we operate at greater levels of reliability and efficiency. The planned replacement of older generating capacity at the Sewaren and Bridgeport stations and new capacity at Keys amounts to 1,800 megawatts of new, clean and efficient gas-fired capacity over the next 3 years. This will transform Power's fleet and enhance its competitive position. We will see an increase in capacity. We will see an increase in reliability. We will see an increase in efficiency. And we will see a reduction in carbon emission.
Although Power has focused on the construction of the new combined cycle units, Power has also committed to improving the efficiency of existing capacity and ensuring its long-term availability. This can be seen through completion of a small uprate at its peaking stations, which adds 14 megawatts to capacity. Power also plans to increase the efficiency and capacity of the Bethlehem Energy Center through Advanced Gas Path uprates in the turbines over 2017 and '18. When completed, this work is expected to add 58 megawatts to BEC's capacity. 
And the recent issuance of a final renewal permit for the Salem station that meets the requirements of Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act helps to assure the long-term availability of this 0 carbon-generating resource. 
Finally, Power has made targeted reductions in its workforce and continues to identify additional means of reducing its cost structure to assure the availability and dispatch of the fleet in the current low price environment.
The power market, over the short term, continues to be characterized by an oversupply of gas. The market, however, has shown signs of improvement as gas prices have responded to a decline in production. 
The improvement in the supply picture and the development of more outlets for supply has also led to an improvement in forward basis. As we have indicated in the past, we continue to expect basis to be seasonal, that is positive in the winter and neutral to negative in the summer, and so more takeaway capacity goes into operation. 
In May 2016, PJM announced the results of the RPM auction for the 2019/20 -- 2020 delivery year. Power cleared approximately 8,900 megawatts of its generating capacity at an average price of $116 per megawatt day. The average price received by Power, while lower than prior auction, continues to represent a premium to the average price per capacity in the RTO. 
Prices in the most recent auction reflect PJM's downwardly revised demand forecast, changes in the emergency transfer limits due to its transmission expansion and the effects of both new generation and unclear generation from the prior year's auction. 
However, the results from the RPM auction were in line with our expectations. Nearly all of Power's cleared capacity in the latest auction complies with PJM's capacity performance requirements, and the fleet is expected to be in a position to meet PJM's requirement at 100% of capacity for 2020 to 2021 delivery year must meet those CP requirements. 
On the regulatory front, FERC has approved 2 of the 5 recommended steps to improve energy price formation. Further efforts to address transparency in the scheduling of capacity could lead to an improved alignment of prices with costs. 
The year has presented challenges. Looking forward to the second half of the year, we're maintaining operating earnings guidance for 2016 of $2.80 to $3 per share. But it will be difficult to reach the upper end of the guidance even with an improvement in the power markets, expectations for long summer weather, restoration of normal operations at Salem and ongoing cost control and management of O&M. 
Our highly skilled workforce has met the market's challenges through the rightsizing of resources and by identifying investments that meet customer needs. Our dedication to customer service, a strong balance sheet and our ability to invest in the future of the company are expected to drive long-term value creation. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Dan, who will discuss our financials in greater detail, and then I'll be available for your questions."
298482,369964525,1017963,"Public Service Enterprise Group Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2016",2016-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Ralph, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. As Ralph said, PSEG reported operating earnings for the second quarter of 2016 of $0.57 per share, the same as operating earnings of $0.57 per share in last year's second quarter. The reco",1811,"Thank you, Ralph, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. 
As Ralph said, PSEG reported operating earnings for the second quarter of 2016 of $0.57 per share, the same as operating earnings of $0.57 per share in last year's second quarter. The reconciliation of operating earnings to net income for the quarter can be found on Slide 4. 
We've also provided you with a waterfall chart on Slide 10 that takes you through the net changes in the quarter-over-quarter operating earnings by major business, and a similar chart on Slide 12 provides you with the changes in operating earnings by business on a year-to-date basis. 
I'll now review each company in a little bit more detail, starting with PSE&G. PSE&G reported net income for the second quarter of 2016 of $0.35 per share compared with $0.33 per share for the second quarter of 2015 for a 6% improvement in earnings. And results for the quarter are shown on Slide 14.
PSE&G's operating results for the second quarter reflect the impact of revenue growth associated with an expansion of the company's capital investment program. Returns on PSE&G's expanded investment in transmission added $0.03 per share to earnings for the quarter. Increase in depreciation and O&M expense of $0.02 per share was partially offset by a decline in taxes and other items. The high level of depreciation is related to the growth in capital spending, and higher levels of OEM reflect increased spending on vegetation management. 
The New Jersey economy continues to show steady growth and employment levels have shown improvement from a year ago. The variability and quarterly data for weather-normalized electric and gas sales has been high, given extreme weather comparisons. Weather-normalized electric sales reflect growth in residential and commercial customers, which is offset by the continuing decline in the industrial sector and increased energy efficiency measures. So on a trailing 12-month basis, weather-normalized electric sales were essentially flat.
PSE&G's capital program remains on schedule. PSE&G invested approximately $1.4 billion during the first half of the year as part of its planned 2016 capital program of $3 billion.
As Ralph mentioned, PSE&G has identified investment opportunities, which, if approved, will increase PSE&G's 5-year capital program by approximately $500 million to $12.5 billion, and you should expect the majority of this increase in spending will occur between 2016 and 2018. And once again, all of this growth will be funded without the need to issue new equity.
As you may recall, PSE&G implemented a $146 million increase in annual transmission revenue under the company's transmission formula rate filing, which took effect this past January. This increase in revenue, adjusted to reflect the impact of bonus depreciation and updates of spending in prior years, will be reflected in PSE&G's earnings throughout the year. But I'll also remind you that the quarter-to-quarter earnings comparisons associated with PSE&G's investment in transmission are not expected to be even during the second half of the year. The recognition of bonus depreciation for 2015 and some other expenses at the end of the year reduced PSE&G's fourth quarter 2015 earnings by about $0.04 per share. The contributions to earnings from the Energy's strong capital program will also be more evident during the second half of the year, given growth in the Energy Strong-related spending, the shape of the rate structure which places more emphasis on demand charges during the third quarter.
We are increasing our forecast of PSE&G's operating earnings for 2016 to $900 million to $935 million from $875 million to $925 million and a change in corporate's cost control efforts and a strong start to summer weather. 
Now let's turn to Power. PSE&G Power reported a net loss for the quarter of $11 million or $0.02 per share compared with net income of $166 million or $0.33 per share for the year-ago quarter. Operating earnings were $0.18 per share for the second quarter of 2016, and adjusted EBITDA was $272 million as compared with operating earnings of $0.22 per share and adjusted EBITDA of $301 million for the second quarter of 2015.
And our adjusted EBITDA excludes the same items as operating earnings, as well as income tax expense, interest expense, depreciation and amortization and major maintenance at Power's fossil-generating facilities. 
The earnings release in Slide 20 provide you with detailed analysis of Power's operating earnings quarter-over-quarter. We've also provided you with more detail on generation for the quarter and the first half of the year on Slides 22 and 23.
Power's operating results for the second quarter reflect the impact of the known decline in PJM capacity revenues and average prices on energy hedges, in addition to the effect of an extended refueling outage at Salem 1.
Decline in capacity revenue associated with the June 2015 retirement of peaking capacity in PJM reduced quarter-over-quarter income by $0.02 per share, and capacity revenue during the second half of 2016 should approximate the revenues received during the last 6 months of 2015. Earnings comparisons in the quarter were also impacted by a decline in the average price received on energy hedges as well as lower market prices and gas volumes, which, together, reduced Power's quarter-over-quarter income by $0.03 per share. And a decline in output reduced income by $0.01 per share. A reduction in O&M expense improved Power's quarter-over-quarter income by $0.07 per share. This improvement reflects the absence in 2016 of costs incurred during the second quarter of 2015 for the refueling outage at the Hope Creek nuclear plant, which is 100% owned by Power, and major maintenance work at our combined cycle units. And the quarterly comparisons also benefited from targeted reductions in O&M at Power's nuclear and fossil stations as well as from changes in the management of work schedules associated with the Salem 1 refueling outage, which minimized the overall cost of the outage. 
As we mentioned during the first quarter earnings call, the Salem 1 refueling outage, which began on April 14, would be extended to repair degraded baffle bolts. The bolt replacement has been completed and the unit is in the process of returning to service. 
During the quarter, an increase in depreciation expense was offset by a decline in interest expense. However, an absence in 2016 of tax credits received in the year-ago quarter and other tax items contributed to a reduction in quarter-over-quarter income of $0.05 per share. 
Turning to Power's operations. Output at Power's generating facilities declined 6% in the quarter as a result of lower wholesale market prices and reduced demand. Output from the gas-fired combined cycle fleet declined slightly to 4.4 terawatt hours from 4.6 terawatt hours, given mild weather conditions relative to the year-ago quarter. Low gas prices impacted the dispatch of Power's coal-fired fleet, and during the quarter, the output from the coal fleet declined to 0.9 terawatt hours from 1.3 terawatt hours.
Output from the nuclear fleet was largely unchanged in the quarter with 7 terawatt hours in this quarter versus 7.1 terawatt hours in the year-ago quarter. The impact of the extended outage at Salem was largely offset by an increase in output at Peach Bottom, and completion of the extended Power-operated Peach Bottom added at 130 megawatts in the aggregate to Power's interest in the station. 
Salem 2 is out of service for 3 days at the end of the quarter and remains out of service. The unplanned outage at Salem 2 is the result of an electrical fault in the reactor's nonnuclear balance of plant. And the extension of the outage at Salem 1 into July and the unplanned outage at Salem 2 will have a continuing effect on performance in the third quarter. 
Power's gross margin in the second quarter declined to $38.54 per megawatt hour from $40.15 per megawatt hour. Power's margin in the quarter experienced only a modest benefit from the gas-fired combined cycle fleet's access to low-cost gas. A lack of demand and low volatility in the market, given an excess supply of gas, pressured spark spreads. 
The power markets over the last month have seen prices move to higher levels, given the impact on gas supply from hotter-than-normal weather and declines in production. And improvement in load and prices will help margins on baseload units as an increase in regional gas prices would also support margins at the gas-fired combined cycle fleet.
For the year, Power's revising its forecast of output to 50 to 52 terawatt hours from a prior forecast of 52 to 54 terawatt hours, and the updated forecast incorporates the results for the first half of the year and takes into account the extension of the outage of both units at Salem.
As shown on Slide 26, approximately 75% to 80% of anticipated production for the second half of 2016 of 25 to 26 terawatt hours is hedged at an average price of $50 per megawatt hour. For 2017, Power has hedged 55% to 60% of its forecast generation of 53 to 55 terawatt hours at an average price of $48 a megawatt hour. And for 2018, Power has hedged approximately 25% to 30% of forecast generation of 58 to 60 terawatt hours at an average price of $46 per megawatt hour. The forecasted increase in output for 2018 reflects the commercial start-up of a new gas-fired combined cycle capacity at the Keys and Sewaren stations.
The percentage of energy hedged for 2017 and 2018 is slightly greater than what we communicated to you earlier this year and in line with our practice. We've adjusted our forecast to Power's full year 2016 operating earnings to $460 million to $525 million from $490 million to $540 million to incorporate the results for the first half of the year. The revised forecast represents an adjusted EBITDA of $1.27 billion to $1.375 billion. 
I'll turn to PSEG Enterprise and Other. The net income for PSEG Energy Holdings and Enterprise in the second quarter of 2016 was $19 million or $0.04 per share versus net income of $12 million or $0.02 per share for the second quarter of 2015. The increase in quarter-over-quarter income reflects contractual payments associated with the operation of PSEG-Long Island and certain tax items at PSEG Energy Holdings. We raised our forecast for the full year of operations to $65 million.
Our financial position remains strong. PSEG closed the quarter ended June 30, 2016, with $648 million of cash on its balance sheet, with debt at the end of the quarter representing 45% of consolidated capital. And during the quarter, Power issued $700 million of 3% 5-year senior notes due in the year 2021. 
We do not foresee the need to issue equity to finance our expanded capital program. And as Ralph mentioned, we are maintaining our forecast of operating earnings for the full year of $2.80 to $3 per share.
And with that, we'll be happy to take any questions."

There's a lot going on in the nation around nuclear, right? I don't know the latest numbers. I think 10 to 15 plants are rumored to be at risk of retiring. Half a dozen have retired. Our dilemma is that as active industry participants, frustrated by an absence of carbon value given to nuclear plant and seeing what's happening around us, as we're trying to engage policymakers in the conversation, that nuclear is not getting the credit it deserves. Our challenge is our plans are quite healthy economically. So notwithstanding the importance of carbon, I think the motivation in other markets are some of the near-term economic consequences of shutting those plants given their lack of profitability. So we don't have that situation. We're glad we don't have that situation, but it does sort of impair our ability to have the same level of interest and participation in the discussion. So we've been talking about fuel diversity. We've been talking about 90-plus percent capacity factors and what it would mean should long-term forces require the replacement of that, whatever those long-term forces might be. But it is kind of a difficult conversation to have, given how many pressing problems are staring policymakers in the face right this minute. So on the one hand, I don't want to go on.

From the point of view of Power's scale, I mean, in terms of its reach, I'd like to see it have a little bit more of a robust portfolio outside of PJM than it currently has, but it certainly would be one of the largest, if not the largest independent power producer on its own, if that's where you're headed with that question. Power doesn't have a lot of megawatts, but its financial strength and its profitability, I think, are quite unique and something that we're very proud of. And we work hard to preserve that in making our operating and investment decisions. So there's -- so the way we would intend in the near term to grow Power is the way we've been trying to, which is through selective acquisitions of existing supply.

Number one is the requirement that 100% of the assets be CP compliant. Number two, we will have a market effect due to a recent announcement, an April announcement by Con Edison that a wheel that they were party to, they will no longer make use of, and that wheel had the effect of a net transfer into our region of about 400 megawatts, which will now no longer be the case. Also, we don't anticipate the kind of step change in PJM's demand forecast that took place prior to the last auction. We have been the primary builder of major transmission, and while we still have a very, very robust transmission program, most of those projects are not involved in significant transfer capabilities. They're more at the 69 to 230 kV level within the zone. The second half of your question, what do we look at? So we do have an internal rate of return expectation. That is obviously well above our utility return expectations. And we look at the combination of energy margin and capacity margin when making that decision. Suffice to say, obviously, the fact that we're going ahead and building, the prices that we realized last year in the auction and this year in Connecticut were sufficient for us to go ahead. So there's no one magic number in terms of capacity that says go ahead and build. It's a combination of capacity and energy together over the long term that we look at."

Number two, in terms of renewables, we've been active on 2 fronts. On the unregulated side, we have about 300 megawatts that are in 12 or 14 states. I've lost track. And we specifically embarked on a crawl, walk, run strategy. Actually, right now, we're jogging. And those projects have done well. Every one of them has met their pro formas. In fact, most of them have slightly exceeded their pro formas. Most of our solar investment, however, has been cut to trade it in PSE&G, and that's been a blend of rooftop-funded solar where we don't own the assets but we have regulatory assets that support the rooftop and then grid connected. As you know, in New Jersey, grid connected is measured in single-digit megawatts as opposed to a double or triple-digit megawatts  Notwithstanding the impressive price improvements on these installations, they still are substantially above conventional technology power prices. So our estimates right now are that in New Jersey, people pay anywhere from $4 to $6 a month for solar energy and that's typical residential homeowner. Obviously, the average homeowner means that there's a bunch of people paying more and a bunch of people paying less. And all of our customer survey information suggest that, that is at or above the level that people are comfortable paying. So our pursuit of solar in PSE&G is really driven by the RPS and the desire to achieve those policy-mandated targets at as low a price as possible. And doing things 3 and 4 megawatts at a time on landfills is a lot less expensive than doing them 2 or 3 kilowatt hours at a time on rooftops. But one has to be careful, even 3 and 5 megawatts at a time as to what the bill and tax is. So we're long-standing fans of solar. We're not apologists for it, but we do have to balance the bill and tax. And so we pursue those opportunities in state, in accordance with the RPS, and in other states, in accordance with those utilities' need to meet their RPS and secure those investments through power purchase agreements."

The utility growth, driven by customer needs and policymaker priorities, is really continuing unabated. Rather than showing up a year after each investor meeting and telling you about what we found, we're trying to do a better job of keeping you apprised of things as we locate them. So you heard that a little bit over $500 million of new stuff that we'll been doing, $300 million of which we're definitely going to do and a couple hundred million of which we're waiting for BPU feedback on. 
Power remains quite focused on markets, managing its cost, its performance and its investment decisions with a real disciplined adherence to what the market's telling us. So some challenging price environment, some great O&M control. And then third and final takeaway is that this balance sheet remains strong. There's no change in our dividend policy. We continue to have the belief or the opportunity for sustained growth in that dividend continues and that these expanding investment needs at the utility and opportunities at the utility can be met without any new equities. So I think we're on a little hiatus for a couple of weeks, and we'll be back on the road in September and certainly see all of you early in November at EEI. So thanks very much for joining us. Have a great rest of summer, folks."

PSEG's results for the second quarter were characterized by a tough environment for power markets, but also with continued growth associated with PSE&G's expanded capital program. Earli",1150,"Thank you, Kathleen, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. PSEG's results for the second quarter were characterized by a tough environment for power markets, but also with continued growth associated with PSE&G's expanded capital program. 
Earlier this morning, we reported net income for the quarter of $0.37 per share. Operating earnings for the second quarter of 2016 was $0.57 per share. Operating earnings were in line with the $0.57 per share earnings in 2015 second quarter.
The results for the quarter bring operating earnings for the first half of 2016 to $1.48 per share, which compares with operating earnings of $1.61 per share earned in 2015's first half.
Slides 4 and 5 contain the detail on the results for the quarter and the first half. PSE&G's execution on its expanded capital investment program continues to provide a growing source of earnings, and Power's prudent management of reductions in O&M minimized the impact of the extended outage at Salem on earnings. 
PSE&G is on track to invest $3 billion in 2016 as part of its 5-year $12 billion capital program. PSE&G's ability to earn its authorized return on investment continues to drive our forecast for double-digit growth in PSE&G's 2016 earnings. 
We continue to look for opportunities to grow in a manner that meets customers' demand for reliable, efficient and clean energy and provides the risk-adjusted return demanded by shareholders. 
In the past quarter, we have identified more than $500 million of additional investment opportunities at our regulated utility company, PSE&G. During the past quarter, PSE&G requested an extension from the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities of its existing landfill/brownfield solar program. The program would add 100 megawatts of grid-connected solar facilities over a 5-year period at the cost of approximately $240 million. The program would also create 575 direct jobs in New Jersey during the construction period and allow all customers to share in the benefits of solar. We hope to see a decision on this request during the fourth quarter of this year.
In addition, PSE&G has increased its estimate of distribution capital expenditures over 2016 through '18 by $300 million to address what is commonly referred to as new business requests and to replace certain aging equipment and infrastructure. As I mentioned, these programs together would represent an increase of more than $500 million over PSE&G's current plans to invest $12 billion over the 5-year period ended 2020.
PSE&G's robust investment program will ensure that it remains one of the most reliable utilities in the nation as was demonstrated during periods of intense heat and thunderstorm activity experienced over the past 2 weeks. The investment program will also improve on PSE&G's growth in rate base, currently forecasted at 8% per year, for the 5-year period ending 2020. 
Now Power's capital program is also an important response to the needs of today's market, which requires that we operate at greater levels of reliability and efficiency. The planned replacement of older generating capacity at the Sewaren and Bridgeport stations and new capacity at Keys amounts to 1,800 megawatts of new, clean and efficient gas-fired capacity over the next 3 years. This will transform Power's fleet and enhance its competitive position. We will see an increase in capacity. We will see an increase in reliability. We will see an increase in efficiency. And we will see a reduction in carbon emission.
Although Power has focused on the construction of the new combined-cycle units, Power has also committed to improving the efficiency of existing capacity and ensuring its long-term availability. This can be seen through completion of a small uprate at its peaking stations, which adds 14 megawatts to capacity. Power also plans to increase the efficiency and capacity of the Bethlehem Energy Center through Advanced Gas Path uprates of the turbines over 2017 and '18. When completed, this work is expected to add 58 megawatts to BEC's capacity. 
And the recent issuance of a final renewal permit for the Salem station that meets the requirements of Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act helps to assure the long-term availability of this 0 carbon-generating resource. 
Finally, Power has made targeted reductions in its workforce and continues to identify additional means of reducing its cost structure to assure the availability and dispatch of the fleet in the current low price environment.
The power market, over the short term, continues to be characterized by an oversupply of gas. The market, however, has shown signs of improvement as gas prices have responded to a decline in production. 
The improvement in the supply picture and the development of more outlets for supply has also led to an improvement in forward basis. As we have indicated in the past, we continue to expect basis to be seasonal, that is positive in the winter and neutral to negative in the summer, until more takeaway capacity goes into operation. 
In May 2016, PJM announced the results of the RPM auction for the 2019/20 -- 2020 delivery year. Power cleared approximately 8,900 megawatts of its generating capacity at an average price of $116 per megawatt day. The average price received by Power, while lower than prior auctions, continues to represent a premium to the average price for capacity in the RTO. 
Prices in the most recent auction reflect PJM's downwardly revised demand forecast, changes in the emergency transfer limits due to its transmission expansion and the effects of both new generation and uncleared generation from the prior year's auction. 
However, the results from the RPM auction were in line with our expectations. Nearly all of Power's cleared capacity in the latest auction complies with PJM's capacity performance requirements, and the fleet is expected to be in a position to meet PJM's requirement that 100% of capacity for the 2020 to 2021 delivery year must meet those CP requirements. 
On the regulatory front, FERC has approved 2 of the 5 recommended steps to improve energy price formation. Further efforts to address transparency in the scheduling of capacity could lead to an improved alignment of prices with costs. 
The year has presented challenges. Looking forward to the second half of the year, we're maintaining operating earnings guidance for 2016 of $2.80 to $3 per share. But it will be difficult to reach the upper end of the guidance even with an improvement in the power markets, expectations for warm summer weather, restoration of normal operations at Salem and ongoing cost control and management of O&M. 
Our highly skilled workforce has met the market's challenges through the rightsizing of resources and by identifying investments that meet customer needs. Our dedication to customer service, a strong balance sheet and our ability to invest in the future of the company are expected to drive long-term value creation. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Dan, who will discuss our financials in greater detail, and then I'll be available for your questions."
298482,369964525,1018159,"Public Service Enterprise Group Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2016",2016-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Ralph, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. As Ralph said, PSEG reported operating earnings for the second quarter of 2016 of $0.57 per share, the same as operating earnings of $0.57 per share in last year's second quarter. The reco",1809,"Thank you, Ralph, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. 
As Ralph said, PSEG reported operating earnings for the second quarter of 2016 of $0.57 per share, the same as operating earnings of $0.57 per share in last year's second quarter. The reconciliation of operating earnings to net income for the quarter can be found on Slide 4. 
We've also provided you with a waterfall chart on Slide 10 that takes you through the net changes in the quarter-over-quarter operating earnings by major business, and a similar chart on Slide 12 provides you with the changes in operating earnings by business on a year-to-date basis. 
I'll now review each company in a little bit more detail, starting with PSE&G. PSE&G reported net income for the second quarter of 2016 of $0.35 per share compared with $0.33 per share for the second quarter of 2015 for a 6% improvement in earnings. And results for the quarter are shown on Slide 14.
PSE&G's operating results for the second quarter reflect the impact of revenue growth associated with an expansion of the company's capital investment program. Returns on PSE&G's expanded investment in transmission added $0.03 per share to earnings for the quarter. Increase in depreciation and O&M expense of $0.02 per share was partially offset by a decline in taxes and other items. The high level of depreciation is related to the growth in capital spending, and higher levels of O&M reflect increased spending on vegetation management. 
The New Jersey economy continues to show steady growth and employment levels have shown improvement from a year ago. The variability in quarterly data for weather-normalized electric and gas sales has been high, given extreme weather comparisons. Weather-normalized electric sales reflect growth in residential and commercial customers, which was offset by the continuing decline in the industrial sector and increased energy efficiency measures. So on a trailing 12-month basis, weather-normalized electric sales were essentially flat.
PSE&G's capital program remains on schedule. PSE&G invested approximately $1.4 billion during the first half of the year as part of its planned 2016 capital program of $3 billion.
As Ralph mentioned, PSE&G has identified investment opportunities, which, if approved, will increase PSE&G's 5-year capital program by approximately $500 million to $12.5 billion, and you should expect the majority of this increase in spending will occur between 2016 and 2018. And once again, all of this growth will be funded without the need to issue new equity.
As you may recall, PSE&G implemented a $146 million increase in annual transmission revenue under the company's transmission formula rate filing, which took effect this past January. This increase in revenue, adjusted to reflect the impact of bonus depreciation and updates of spending in prior years, will be reflected in PSE&G's earnings throughout the year. But I'll also remind you that the quarter-to-quarter earnings comparisons associated with PSE&G's investment in transmission are not expected to be even during the second half of the year. The recognition of bonus depreciation for 2015 and some other expenses at the end of the year reduced PSE&G's fourth quarter 2015 earnings by about $0.04 per share. The contributions to earnings from the Energy Strong capital program will also be more evident during the second half of the year, given growth in the Energy Strong-related spending and the shape of the rate structure, which places more emphasis on demand charges during the third quarter.
We are increasing our forecast of PSE&G's operating earnings for 2016 to $900 million to $935 million from $875 million to $925 million, and that change incorporates cost control efforts and a strong start to summer weather. 
Now let's turn to Power. PSE&G Power reported a net loss for the quarter of $11 million or $0.02 per share compared with net income of $166 million or $0.33 per share for the year-ago quarter. Operating earnings were $0.18 per share for the second quarter of 2016 and adjusted EBITDA was $272 million as compared with operating earnings of $0.22 per share and adjusted EBITDA of $301 million for the second quarter of 2015.
And our adjusted EBITDA excludes the same items as operating earnings, as well as income tax expense, interest expense, depreciation and amortization and major maintenance at Power's fossil-generating facilities. 
The earnings release and Slide 20 provide you with detailed analysis of Power's operating earnings quarter-over-quarter. We've also provided you with more detail on generation for the quarter and the first half of the year on Slides 22 and 23.
Power's operating results for the second quarter reflect the impact of the known decline in PJM capacity revenues and average prices on energy hedges in addition to the effect of an extended refueling outage at Salem 1.
Decline in capacity revenue associated with the June 2015 retirement of peaking capacity in PJM reduced quarter-over-quarter income by $0.02 per share, and capacity revenue during the second half of 2016 should approximate the revenues received during the last 6 months of 2015. Earnings comparisons in the quarter were also impacted by a decline in the average price received on energy hedges as well as lower market prices and gas volumes, which, together, reduced Power's quarter-over-quarter income by $0.03 per share. And a decline in output reduced income by $0.01 per share. A reduction in O&M expense improved Power's quarter-over-quarter income by $0.07 per share. This improvement reflects the absence in 2016 of costs incurred during the second quarter of 2015 for the refueling outage at the Hope Creek nuclear plant, which is 100% owned by Power, and major maintenance work at our combined-cycle units. And the quarterly comparisons also benefited from targeted reductions in O&M at Power's nuclear and fossil stations as well as from changes in the management of work schedules associated with the Salem 1 refueling outage, which minimized the overall cost of the outage. 
As we mentioned during the first quarter earnings call, the Salem 1 refueling outage, which began on April 14, would be extended to repair degraded baffle bolts. The bolt replacement has been completed and the unit is in the process of returning to service. 
During the quarter, an increase in depreciation expense was offset by a decline in interest expense. However, an absence in 2016 of tax credits received in the year-ago quarter and other tax items contributed to a reduction in quarter-over-quarter income of $0.05 per share. 
Turning to Power's operations. Output at Power's generating facilities declined 6% in the quarter as a result of lower wholesale market prices and reduced demand. Output from the gas-fired combined-cycle fleet declined slightly to 4.4 terawatt hours from 4.6 terawatt hours, given mild weather conditions relative to the year-ago quarter. Low gas prices impacted the dispatch of Power's coal-fired fleet, and during the quarter, the output from the coal fleet declined to 0.9 terawatt hours from 1.3 terawatt hours.
Output from the nuclear fleet was largely unchanged in the quarter with 7 terawatt hours in this quarter versus 7.1 terawatt hours in the year-ago quarter. The impact of the extended outage at Salem was largely offset by an increase in output at Peach Bottom, and completion of the extended Power uprate at Peach Bottom added at 130 megawatts in the aggregate to Power's interest in the station. 
Salem 2 was out of service for 3 days at the end of the quarter and remains out of service. The unplanned outage at Salem 2 is the result of an electrical fault in the reactor's nonnuclear balance of the plant. And the extension of the outage at Salem 1 into July and the unplanned outage at Salem 2 will have a continuing effect on performance in the third quarter. 
Power's gross margin in the second quarter declined to $38.54 per megawatt hour from $40.15 per megawatt hour. Power's margin in the quarter experienced only a modest benefit from the gas-fired combined-cycle fleet's access to low-cost gas. A lack of demand and low volatility in the market, given an excess supply of gas, pressured spark spreads. 
The power markets over the last month have seen prices move to higher levels, given the impact on gas supply from hotter-than-normal weather and declines in production. An improvement in load and prices will help margins on baseload units as an increase in regional gas prices would also support margins at the gas-fired combined-cycle fleet.
For the year, Power's revising its forecast of output to 50 to 52 terawatt hours from the prior forecast of 52 to 54 terawatt hours, and the updated forecast incorporates the results for the first half of the year and takes into account the extension of the outage of both units at Salem.
As shown on Slide 26, approximately 75% to 80% of anticipated production for the second half of 2016 of 25 to 26 terawatt hours is hedged at an average price of $50 per megawatt hour. For 2017, Power has hedged 55% to 60% of its forecast generation of 53 to 55 terawatt hours at an average price of $48 a megawatt hour. And for 2018, Power has hedged approximately 25% to 30% of forecast generation of 58 to 60 terawatt hours at an average price of $46 per megawatt hour. The forecasted increase in output for 2018 reflects the commercial start-up of the new gas-fired combined-cycle capacity at the Keys and Sewaren stations.
The percentage of energy hedged for 2017 and 2018 is slightly greater than what we communicated to you earlier this year and in line with our practice. We've adjusted our forecast of Power's full year 2016 operating earnings to $460 million to $525 million from $490 million to $540 million to incorporate the results for the first half of the year. The revised forecast represents an adjusted EBITDA of $1.27 billion to $1.375 billion. 
I'll turn to PSEG Enterprise and Other. The net income for PSEG Energy Holdings and Enterprise in the second quarter of 2016 was $19 million or $0.04 per share versus net income of $12 million or $0.02 per share for the second quarter of 2015. The increase in quarter-over-quarter income reflects contractual payments associated with the operation of PSEG-Long Island and certain tax items at PSEG Energy Holdings. We raised our forecast for the full year of operations to $65 million.
Our financial position remains strong. PSEG closed the quarter ended June 30, 2016, with $648 million of cash on its balance sheet, with debt at the end of the quarter representing 45% of consolidated capital. And during the quarter, Power issued $700 million of 3% 5-year senior notes due in the year 2021. 
We do not foresee the need to issue equity to finance our expanded capital program. And as Ralph mentioned, we are maintaining our forecast of operating earnings for the full year of $2.80 to $3 per share.
And with that, we'll be happy to take any questions."

Our dilemma is that as active industry participants, frustrated by an absence of carbon value given to nuclear plants and seeing what's happening around us, is we're trying to engage policymakers in the conversation that nuclear is not getting the credit it deserves. Our challenge is our plants are quite healthy economically. So notwithstanding the importance of carbon, I think the motivation in other markets are some of the near-term economic consequences of shutting those plants given their lack of profitability.

So we've been talking about fuel diversity. We've been talking about 90-plus percent capacity factors and what it would mean should long-term forces require the replacement of that, whatever those long-term forces might be. But it is kind of a difficult conversation to have, given how many pressing problems are staring policymakers in the face right this minute. So on the one hand, I don't want to go on ad nauseum. We feel strongly that nuclear is not getting the credit, i.e., price, it deserves, but we cannot and we do not make the claim that our plants are at any kind of economic risk in the near term the way others are."

We're talking to people who care about these things, about what the consequences have been in places were nothing took place and what would happen -- what's being proposed in other places. At PJM, I think there's much more of a focus on reliability associated with such large quantities of baseload power that don't have the seasonal challenges of access to gas and backup fuels. But I think that, historically, PJM, of course, has not viewed itself, nor should it, as an implementer of environmental policy.

We think that those are the most efficient markets, given the combination of energy and capacity value in all 3 of them. We have also said that we do not anticipate any new build. We felt we had 3 very unique situations. But in a flat demand world with pretty much an oversupply condition, arguably all 3 locations, but certainly in 2 them, injecting new supply does not appear to be a winning proposition. From the point of view of Power's scale, I mean, in terms of its reach, I'd like to see it have a little bit more of a robust portfolio outside of PJM than it currently has, but it certainly would be one of the largest, if not the largest independent power producer on its own, if that's where you're headed with that question. Power doesn't have a lot of megawatts, but its financial strength and its profitability, I think, are quite unique and something that we're very proud of. And we work hard to preserve that in making our operating and investment decisions. So there's -- so the way we would intend in the near term to grow Power is the way we've been trying to, which is through selective acquisitions of existing supply. As you know, we've not been successful at doing that. We -- the one project we landed was the Keys project, and there, probably because our perception of construction risk management was different than others. So I hope that answers your question."

Number one is the requirement that 100% of the assets be CP compliant. Number two, we will have a market effect due to a recent announcement, an April announcement by Con Edison that a wheel that they were party to, they will no longer make use of, and that wheel had the effect of a net transfer into our region of about 400 megawatts, which will now no longer be the case. Also, we don't anticipate the kind of step change in PJM's demand forecast that took place prior to the last auction. We have been the primary builder of major transmission, and while we still have a very, very robust transmission program, most of those projects are not involved in significant transfer capabilities. They're more at the 69 to 230 kV level, within the zone. The second half of your question, what do we look at? So we do have an internal rate-of-return expectation. That is obviously well above our utility return expectations. And we look at the combination of energy margin and capacity margin when making that decision. Suffice to say, obviously, the fact that we're going ahead and building, the prices that we realized last year in the auction and this year in Connecticut were sufficient for us to go ahead. So there's no one magic number in terms of capacity that says go ahead and build. It's a combination of capacity and energy together over the long term that we look at."

Number two, in terms of renewables, we've been active on 2 fronts. On the unregulated side, we have about 300 megawatts that are in 12 or 14 states. I've lost track. And we specifically embarked on a crawl, walk, run strategy. Actually, right now, we're jogging. And those projects have done well. Every one of them has met their pro formas. In fact, most of them have slightly exceeded their pro formas. Most of our solar investment, however, has been concentrated in PSE&G, and that's been a blend of rooftop-funded solar where we don't own the assets but we have regulatory assets that support the rooftop, and then grid connected. As you know, in New Jersey, grid connected is measured in single-digit megawatts as opposed to a double or triple-digit megawatts. Notwithstanding the impressive price improvements on these installations, they still are substantially above conventional technology power prices. So our estimates right now are that in New Jersey, people pay anywhere from $4 to $6 a month for solar energy, and that's typical residential homeowner. Obviously, the average homeowner means that there's a bunch of people paying more and a bunch of people paying less. And all of our customer survey information suggests that, that is at or above the level that people are comfortable paying. So our pursuit of solar in PSE&G is really driven by the RPS and the desire to achieve those policy-mandated targets at as low a price as possible. And doing things 3 and 4 megawatts at a time on landfills is a lot less expensive than doing them 2 or 3 kilowatt-hours at a time on rooftops. But one has to be careful, even 3 and 5 megawatts at a time, as to what the bill impact is. So we're long-standing fans of solar. We're not apologists for it, but we do have to balance the bill impacts. And so we pursue those opportunities in state, in accordance with the RPS, and in other states, in accordance with those utilities' need to meet their RPS and secure those investments through power purchase agreements."

So in keeping with prior practices, let me just summarize what I hope were the key takeaways for you. 
The utility growth, driven by customer needs and policymaker priorities, is really continuing unabated. Rather than showing up a year after each investor meeting and telling you about what we found, we're trying to do a better job of keeping you apprised of things as we locate them. So you heard about a little bit over $500 million of new stuff that we'll been doing, $300 million of which we're definitely going to do and a couple hundred million of which we're waiting for BPU feedback on. 
Power remains quite focused on markets, managing its cost, its performance and its investment decisions with a real disciplined adherence to what the market's telling us. So some challenging price environments, some great O&M control. And then third and final takeaway is that this balance sheet remains strong. There's no change in our dividend policy. We continue to have the belief for the opportunity for sustained growth in that dividend. That continues. And that these expanding investment needs at the utility and opportunities at the utility can be met without any new equity. So I think we're on a little hiatus for a couple of weeks, and we'll be back on the road in September and certainly see all of you early in November at EEI. So thanks very much for joining us. Have a great rest of summer, folks."

PSEG's results for the second quarter were characterized by a tough environment for power markets, but also with continued growth associated with PSE&G's expanded capital program. Earli",1150,"Thank you, Kathleen, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. PSEG's results for the second quarter were characterized by a tough environment for power markets, but also with continued growth associated with PSE&G's expanded capital program. 
Earlier this morning, we reported net income for the quarter of $0.37 per share. Operating earnings for the second quarter of 2016 was $0.57 per share. Operating earnings were in line with the $0.57 per share earnings in 2015 second quarter.
The results for the quarter bring operating earnings for the first half of 2016 to $1.48 per share, which compares with operating earnings of $1.61 per share earned in 2015's first half.
Slides 4 and 5 contain the detail on the results for the quarter and the first half. PSE&G's execution on its expanded capital investment program continues to provide a growing source of earnings, and Power's prudent management of reductions in O&M minimized the impact of the extended outage at Salem on earnings. 
PSE&G is on track to invest $3 billion in 2016 as part of its 5-year $12 billion capital program. PSE&G's ability to earn its authorized return on investment continues to drive our forecast for double-digit growth in PSE&G's 2016 earnings. 
We continue to look for opportunities to grow in a manner that meets customers' demand for reliable, efficient and clean energy and provides the risk-adjusted return demanded by shareholders. 
In the past quarter, we have identified more than $500 million of additional investment opportunities at our regulated utility company, PSE&G. During the past quarter, PSE&G requested an extension from the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities of its existing landfill/brownfield solar program. The program would add 100 megawatts of grid-connected solar facilities over a 5-year period at the cost of approximately $240 million. The program would also create 575 direct jobs in New Jersey during the construction period and allow all customers to share in the benefits of solar. We hope to see a decision on this request during the fourth quarter of this year.
In addition, PSE&G has increased its estimate of distribution capital expenditures over 2016 through '18 by $300 million to address what is commonly referred to as new business requests and to replace certain aging equipment and infrastructure. As I mentioned, these programs together would represent an increase of more than $500 million over PSE&G's current plans to invest $12 billion over the 5-year period ended 2020.
PSE&G's robust investment program will ensure that it remains one of the most reliable utilities in the nation as was demonstrated during periods of intense heat and thunderstorm activity experienced over the past 2 weeks. The investment program will also improve on PSE&G's growth in rate base, currently forecasted at 8% per year, for the 5-year period ending 2020. 
Now Power's capital program is also an important response to the needs of today's market, which requires that we operate at greater levels of reliability and efficiency. The planned replacement of older generating capacity at the Sewaren and Bridgeport stations and new capacity at Keys amounts to 1,800 megawatts of new, clean and efficient gas-fired capacity over the next 3 years. This will transform Power's fleet and enhance its competitive position. We will see an increase in capacity. We will see an increase in reliability. We will see an increase in efficiency. And we will see a reduction in carbon emission.
Although Power has focused on the construction of the new combined-cycle units, Power has also committed to improving the efficiency of existing capacity and ensuring its long-term availability. This can be seen through completion of a small uprate at its peaking stations, which adds 14 megawatts to capacity. Power also plans to increase the efficiency and capacity of the Bethlehem Energy Center through Advanced Gas Path uprates of the turbines over 2017 and '18. When completed, this work is expected to add 58 megawatts to BEC's capacity. 
And the recent issuance of a final renewal permit for the Salem station that meets the requirements of Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act helps to assure the long-term availability of this 0 carbon-generating resource. 
Finally, Power has made targeted reductions in its workforce and continues to identify additional means of reducing its cost structure to assure the availability and dispatch of the fleet in the current low price environment.
The power market, over the short term, continues to be characterized by an oversupply of gas. The market, however, has shown signs of improvement as gas prices have responded to a decline in production. 
The improvement in the supply picture and the development of more outlets for supply has also led to an improvement in forward basis. As we have indicated in the past, we continue to expect basis to be seasonal, that is positive in the winter and neutral to negative in the summer, until more takeaway capacity goes into operation. 
In May 2016, PJM announced the results of the RPM auction for the 2019/20 -- 2020 delivery year. Power cleared approximately 8,900 megawatts of its generating capacity at an average price of $116 per megawatt day. The average price received by Power, while lower than prior auctions, continues to represent a premium to the average price for capacity in the RTO. 
Prices in the most recent auction reflect PJM's downwardly revised demand forecast, changes in the emergency transfer limits due to its transmission expansion and the effects of both new generation and uncleared generation from the prior year's auction. 
However, the results from the RPM auction were in line with our expectations. Nearly all of Power's cleared capacity in the latest auction complies with PJM's capacity performance requirements, and the fleet is expected to be in a position to meet PJM's requirement that 100% of capacity for the 2020 to 2021 delivery year must meet those CP requirements. 
On the regulatory front, FERC has approved 2 of the 5 recommended steps to improve energy price formation. Further efforts to address transparency in the scheduling of capacity could lead to an improved alignment of prices with costs. 
The year has presented challenges. Looking forward to the second half of the year, we're maintaining operating earnings guidance for 2016 of $2.80 to $3 per share. But it will be difficult to reach the upper end of the guidance even with an improvement in the power markets, expectations for warm summer weather, restoration of normal operations at Salem and ongoing cost control and management of O&M. 
Our highly skilled workforce has met the market's challenges through the rightsizing of resources and by identifying investments that meet customer needs. Our dedication to customer service, a strong balance sheet and our ability to invest in the future of the company are expected to drive long-term value creation. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Dan, who will discuss our financials in greater detail, and then I'll be available for your questions."
298482,369964525,1018740,"Public Service Enterprise Group Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2016",2016-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Ralph, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. As Ralph said, PSEG reported operating earnings for the second quarter of 2016 of $0.57 per share, the same as operating earnings of $0.57 per share in last year's second quarter. The reco",1809,"Thank you, Ralph, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. 
As Ralph said, PSEG reported operating earnings for the second quarter of 2016 of $0.57 per share, the same as operating earnings of $0.57 per share in last year's second quarter. The reconciliation of operating earnings to net income for the quarter can be found on Slide 4. 
We've also provided you with a waterfall chart on Slide 10 that takes you through the net changes in the quarter-over-quarter operating earnings by major business, and a similar chart on Slide 12 provides you with the changes in operating earnings by business on a year-to-date basis. 
I'll now review each company in a little bit more detail, starting with PSE&G. PSE&G reported net income for the second quarter of 2016 of $0.35 per share compared with $0.33 per share for the second quarter of 2015 for a 6% improvement in earnings. And results for the quarter are shown on Slide 14.
PSE&G's operating results for the second quarter reflect the impact of revenue growth associated with an expansion of the company's capital investment program. Returns on PSE&G's expanded investment in transmission added $0.03 per share to earnings for the quarter. Increase in depreciation and O&M expense of $0.02 per share was partially offset by a decline in taxes and other items. The high level of depreciation is related to the growth in capital spending, and higher levels of O&M reflect increased spending on vegetation management. 
The New Jersey economy continues to show steady growth and employment levels have shown improvement from a year ago. The variability in quarterly data for weather-normalized electric and gas sales has been high, given extreme weather comparisons. Weather-normalized electric sales reflect growth in residential and commercial customers, which was offset by the continuing decline in the industrial sector and increased energy efficiency measures. So on a trailing 12-month basis, weather-normalized electric sales were essentially flat.
PSE&G's capital program remains on schedule. PSE&G invested approximately $1.4 billion during the first half of the year as part of its planned 2016 capital program of $3 billion.
As Ralph mentioned, PSE&G has identified investment opportunities, which, if approved, will increase PSE&G's 5-year capital program by approximately $500 million to $12.5 billion, and you should expect the majority of this increase in spending will occur between 2016 and 2018. And once again, all of this growth will be funded without the need to issue new equity.
As you may recall, PSE&G implemented a $146 million increase in annual transmission revenue under the company's transmission formula rate filing, which took effect this past January. This increase in revenue, adjusted to reflect the impact of bonus depreciation and updates of spending in prior years, will be reflected in PSE&G's earnings throughout the year. But I'll also remind you that the quarter-to-quarter earnings comparisons associated with PSE&G's investment in transmission are not expected to be even during the second half of the year. The recognition of bonus depreciation for 2015 and some other expenses at the end of the year reduced PSE&G's fourth quarter 2015 earnings by about $0.04 per share. The contributions to earnings from the Energy Strong capital program will also be more evident during the second half of the year, given growth in the Energy Strong-related spending and the shape of the rate structure, which places more emphasis on demand charges during the third quarter.
We are increasing our forecast of PSE&G's operating earnings for 2016 to $900 million to $935 million from $875 million to $925 million, and that change incorporates cost control efforts and a strong start to summer weather. 
Now let's turn to Power. PSE&G Power reported a net loss for the quarter of $11 million or $0.02 per share compared with net income of $166 million or $0.33 per share for the year-ago quarter. Operating earnings were $0.18 per share for the second quarter of 2016 and adjusted EBITDA was $272 million as compared with operating earnings of $0.22 per share and adjusted EBITDA of $301 million for the second quarter of 2015.
And our adjusted EBITDA excludes the same items as operating earnings, as well as income tax expense, interest expense, depreciation and amortization and major maintenance at Power's fossil-generating facilities. 
The earnings release and Slide 20 provide you with detailed analysis of Power's operating earnings quarter-over-quarter. We've also provided you with more detail on generation for the quarter and the first half of the year on Slides 22 and 23.
Power's operating results for the second quarter reflect the impact of the known decline in PJM capacity revenues and average prices on energy hedges in addition to the effect of an extended refueling outage at Salem 1.
Decline in capacity revenue associated with the June 2015 retirement of peaking capacity in PJM reduced quarter-over-quarter income by $0.02 per share, and capacity revenue during the second half of 2016 should approximate the revenues received during the last 6 months of 2015. Earnings comparisons in the quarter were also impacted by a decline in the average price received on energy hedges as well as lower market prices and gas volumes, which, together, reduced Power's quarter-over-quarter income by $0.03 per share. And a decline in output reduced income by $0.01 per share. A reduction in O&M expense improved Power's quarter-over-quarter income by $0.07 per share. This improvement reflects the absence in 2016 of costs incurred during the second quarter of 2015 for the refueling outage at the Hope Creek nuclear plant, which is 100% owned by Power, and major maintenance work at our combined-cycle units. And the quarterly comparisons also benefited from targeted reductions in O&M at Power's nuclear and fossil stations as well as from changes in the management of work schedules associated with the Salem 1 refueling outage, which minimized the overall cost of the outage. 
As we mentioned during the first quarter earnings call, the Salem 1 refueling outage, which began on April 14, would be extended to repair degraded baffle bolts. The bolt replacement has been completed and the unit is in the process of returning to service. 
During the quarter, an increase in depreciation expense was offset by a decline in interest expense. However, an absence in 2016 of tax credits received in the year-ago quarter and other tax items contributed to a reduction in quarter-over-quarter income of $0.05 per share. 
Turning to Power's operations. Output at Power's generating facilities declined 6% in the quarter as a result of lower wholesale market prices and reduced demand. Output from the gas-fired combined-cycle fleet declined slightly to 4.4 terawatt hours from 4.6 terawatt hours, given mild weather conditions relative to the year-ago quarter. Low gas prices impacted the dispatch of Power's coal-fired fleet, and during the quarter, the output from the coal fleet declined to 0.9 terawatt hours from 1.3 terawatt hours.
Output from the nuclear fleet was largely unchanged in the quarter with 7 terawatt hours in this quarter versus 7.1 terawatt hours in the year-ago quarter. The impact of the extended outage at Salem was largely offset by an increase in output at Peach Bottom, and completion of the extended Power uprate at Peach Bottom added at 130 megawatts in the aggregate to Power's interest in the station. 
Salem 2 was out of service for 3 days at the end of the quarter and remains out of service. The unplanned outage at Salem 2 is the result of an electrical fault in the reactor's nonnuclear balance of the plant. And the extension of the outage at Salem 1 into July and the unplanned outage at Salem 2 will have a continuing effect on performance in the third quarter. 
Power's gross margin in the second quarter declined to $38.54 per megawatt hour from $40.15 per megawatt hour. Power's margin in the quarter experienced only a modest benefit from the gas-fired combined-cycle fleet's access to low-cost gas. A lack of demand and low volatility in the market, given an excess supply of gas, pressured spark spreads. 
The power markets over the last month have seen prices move to higher levels, given the impact on gas supply from hotter-than-normal weather and declines in production. An improvement in load and prices will help margins on baseload units as an increase in regional gas prices would also support margins at the gas-fired combined-cycle fleet.
For the year, Power's revising its forecast of output to 50 to 52 terawatt hours from the prior forecast of 52 to 54 terawatt hours, and the updated forecast incorporates the results for the first half of the year and takes into account the extension of the outage of both units at Salem.
As shown on Slide 26, approximately 75% to 80% of anticipated production for the second half of 2016 of 25 to 26 terawatt hours is hedged at an average price of $50 per megawatt hour. For 2017, Power has hedged 55% to 60% of its forecast generation of 53 to 55 terawatt hours at an average price of $48 a megawatt hour. And for 2018, Power has hedged approximately 25% to 30% of forecast generation of 58 to 60 terawatt hours at an average price of $46 per megawatt hour. The forecasted increase in output for 2018 reflects the commercial start-up of the new gas-fired combined-cycle capacity at the Keys and Sewaren stations.
The percentage of energy hedged for 2017 and 2018 is slightly greater than what we communicated to you earlier this year and in line with our practice. We've adjusted our forecast of Power's full year 2016 operating earnings to $460 million to $525 million from $490 million to $540 million to incorporate the results for the first half of the year. The revised forecast represents an adjusted EBITDA of $1.27 billion to $1.375 billion. 
I'll turn to PSEG Enterprise and Other. The net income for PSEG Energy Holdings and Enterprise in the second quarter of 2016 was $19 million or $0.04 per share versus net income of $12 million or $0.02 per share for the second quarter of 2015. The increase in quarter-over-quarter income reflects contractual payments associated with the operation of PSEG-Long Island and certain tax items at PSEG Energy Holdings. We raised our forecast for the full year of operations to $65 million.
Our financial position remains strong. PSEG closed the quarter ended June 30, 2016, with $648 million of cash on its balance sheet, with debt at the end of the quarter representing 45% of consolidated capital. And during the quarter, Power issued $700 million of 3% 5-year senior notes due in the year 2021. 
We do not foresee the need to issue equity to finance our expanded capital program. And as Ralph mentioned, we are maintaining our forecast of operating earnings for the full year of $2.80 to $3 per share.
And with that, we'll be happy to take any questions."

The other boards [ph] are saying it could be as high as $23. So I mean, we certainly made these investment decisions on the expectation that the combination of either locked-in or anticipated capacity prices plus the spark spreads would allow us to recover our cost of capital and then some. So as you know, our history is we don't usually pick numbers that are different than what the markets are telling us. And right now, the local spark spreads, as defined region-by-region, is in the $20 range."

There's a lot going on in the nation around nuclear, right? I don't know the latest numbers. I think 10 to 15 plants are rumored to be at risk of retiring. Half a dozen have retired. Our dilemma is that as active industry participants, frustrated by an absence of carbon value given to nuclear plants and seeing what's happening around us, is we're trying to engage policymakers in the conversation that nuclear is not getting the credit it deserves. Our challenge is our plants are quite healthy economically. So notwithstanding the importance of carbon, I think the motivation in other markets are some of the near-term economic consequences of shutting those plants given their lack of profitability. So we don't have that situation. We're glad we don't have that situation, but it does sort of impair our ability to have the same level of interest and participation in the discussion. So we've been talking about fuel diversity. We've been talking about 90-plus percent capacity factors and what it would mean should long-term forces require the replacement of that, whatever those long-term forces might be. But it is kind of a difficult conversation to have, given how many pressing problems are staring policymakers in the face right this minute. So on the one hand, I don't want to go on ad nauseam. We feel strongly that nuclear is not getting the credit, i.e., price, it deserves, but we cannot and we do not make the claim that our plants are at any kind of economic risk in the near term the way others are."

From the point of view of Power's scale, I mean, in terms of its reach, I'd like to see it have a little bit more of a robust portfolio outside of PJM than it currently has, but it certainly would be one of the largest, if not the largest independent power producer on its own, if that's where you're headed with that question. Power doesn't have a lot of megawatts, but its financial strength and its profitability, I think, are quite unique and something that we're very proud of. And we work hard to preserve that in making our operating and investment decisions. So there's -- so the way we would intend in the near term to grow Power is the way we've been trying to, which is through selective acquisitions of existing supply. As you know, we've not been successful at doing that. We -- the one project we landed was the Keys project, and there, probably because our perception of construction risk management was different than others. So I hope that answers your question."

Number one is the requirement that 100% of the assets be CP compliant. Number two, we will have a market effect due to a recent announcement, an April announcement by Con Edison that a wheel that they were party to, they will no longer make use of, and that wheel had the effect of a net transfer into our region of about 400 megawatts, which will now no longer be the case. Also, we don't anticipate the kind of step change in PJM's demand forecast that took place prior to the last auction. We have been the primary builder of major transmission, and while we still have a very, very robust transmission program, most of those projects are not involved in significant transfer capabilities. They're more at the 69 to 230 kV level, within the zone. The second half of your question, what do we look at? So we do have an internal rate-of-return expectation. That is obviously well above our utility return expectations. And we look at the combination of energy margin and capacity margin when making that decision. Suffice to say, obviously, the fact that we're going ahead and building, the prices that we realized last year in the auction and this year in Connecticut were sufficient for us to go ahead. So there's no one magic number in terms of capacity that says go ahead and build. It's a combination of capacity and energy together over the long term that we look at."

Number two, in terms of renewables, we've been active on 2 fronts. On the unregulated side, we have about 300 megawatts that are in 12 or 14 states. I've lost track. And we specifically embarked on a crawl, walk, run strategy. Actually, right now, we're jogging. And those projects have done well. Every one of them has met their pro formas. In fact, most of them have slightly exceeded their pro formas. Most of our solar investment, however, has been concentrated in PSE&G, and that's been a blend of rooftop-funded solar where we don't own the assets but we have regulatory assets that support the rooftop, and then grid connected. As you know, in New Jersey, grid connected is measured in single-digit megawatts as opposed to a double or triple-digit megawatts. Notwithstanding the impressive price improvements on these installations, they still are substantially above conventional technology power prices. So our estimates right now are that in New Jersey, people pay anywhere from $4 to $6 a month for solar energy, and that's typical residential homeowner. Obviously, the average homeowner means that there's a bunch of people paying more and a bunch of people paying less. And all of our customer survey information suggests that, that is at or above the level that people are comfortable paying. So our pursuit of solar in PSE&G is really driven by the RPS and the desire to achieve those policy-mandated targets at as low a price as possible. And doing things 3 and 4 megawatts at a time on landfills is a lot less expensive than doing them 2 or 3 kilowatt-hours at a time on rooftops. But one has to be careful, even 3 and 5 megawatts at a time, as to what the bill impact is. So we're long-standing fans of solar. We're not apologists for it, but we do have to balance the bill impacts. And so we pursue those opportunities in state, in accordance with the RPS, and in other states, in accordance with those utilities' need to meet their RPS and secure those investments through power purchase agreements."

First of all, it's good to hear you. I was a little concerned when you disappeared on us before. We remain interested in retail for defensive purposes, managing basis risk, and not as a significant growth opportunity by any stretch of the imagination. We've looked at some boutique shops, including the transaction you just referenced right now. I suspect that we're going to run into the same issues in looking at those types of potential tuck-in acquisitions as we do with power plants. That our disciplined, some would say conservative, approach to pricing these things will result in us perhaps not being able to roll up what we need to roll up from an acquisitive point of view. So we're starting to turn our attention to just building some capability in-house. Because again, our ambitions here are modest, they're defensive and it's conceivable that an organic approach could be quite a bit more profitable from a point of view of return expectations. Sorry, Jonathan. I seem to have left a deafening silence."

So in keeping with prior practices, let me just summarize what I hope were the key takeaways for you. 
The utility growth, driven by customer needs and policymaker priorities, is really continuing unabated. Rather than showing up a year after each investor meeting and telling you about what we found, we're trying to do a better job of keeping you apprised of things as we locate them. So you heard about a little bit over $500 million of new stuff that we'll been doing, $300 million of which we're definitely going to do and a couple hundred million of which we're waiting for BPU feedback on. 
Power remains quite focused on markets, managing its cost, its performance and its investment decisions with a real disciplined adherence to what the market's telling us. So some challenging price environments, some great O&M control. And then third and final takeaway is that this balance sheet remains strong. There's no change in our dividend policy. We continue to have the belief for the opportunity for sustained growth in that dividend. That continues. And that these expanding investment needs at the utility and opportunities at the utility can be met without any new equity. So I think we're on a little hiatus for a couple of weeks, and we'll be back on the road in September and certainly see all of you early in November at EEI. So thanks very much for joining us. Have a great rest of summer, folks."

PSEG reported strong results for the third quarter. Earlier this morning, we reported net income for the quarter of $0.64 per share versus $0.87 per share last year. Non-GAAP operating earnings for the third quarter of 2016 were $0.88 per share compared with non-GAAP operating earnings for the third quarter of 2015 of $0.80 per share.
For the 9 months, we reported net income of $1.94 per share versus $2.70 per share, but non-GAAP operating earnings for the 9 months ended September 30, 2016, are $2.36 per share, which compares with non-GAAP operating earnings of $2.41 per share earned during the 9 months ended September 30, 2015.
Slides 4 and 5 contain the details on the results for the quarter and the 9 months. We remain committed to our core operating philosophy of operational excellence, investing in a disciplined manner and maintaining a strong financial position to support the growth expected by our shareholders. PSE&G continues to earn its return on an expanded capital investment program. PSEG Power continues to manage through very difficult energy markets, and we continue to take strong actions to optimize both businesses in this environment.
PSEG Power has decided to retire the Hudson and Mercer coal-fired generation stations in 2017. This is sooner than we would've forecasted just a few short years ago but became inevitable in the face of changes in the energy market, which were amply demonstrated this summer. While we experienced very warm weather conditions, the abundance of low-cost gas supply, which is a benefit for our customers, kept energy prices low and is expected to keep power prices lower for longer. Careful analysis indicate it would be uneconomic to invest the capital necessary to assure the units would comply with PJM's new capacity performance reliability standards. Although the units have been dispatched infrequently, we expect the retirement of Hudson and Mercer to result in a further reduction in the fleets' emissions profile. These retirements continue the evolution of PSEG Power's fleet into a portfolio of reliable, low-cost, flexible assets capable of competing in today's market. To be clear, retirement will also aid Power's future cash flow and return profile.
The addition of 1,800 megawatts of new gas-fired capacity at Keys, Sewaren and Bridgeport Harbor over 2018 through '19 will further the transformation of the fleet.
From a supply/demand standpoint, I want to remind you that the capacity at Sewaren and Bridgeport Harbor will replace older steam and coal-fired capacity that we will retire. The new capacity will improve the fleets' efficiency and lower its cost structure. The new units remain on-time and on budget. These new units remain profitable even with the recent declines in market pricing and continue to meet our hurdles for returns, which, of course, are in excess of our return expectations that we placed on new utility investments.
By the end of this decade, our nuclear and gas-fired generation facilities will provide more than 90% of our electric output. Our nuclear fleet represents our cleanest energy resource for the foreseeable future, and our gas-fired combined cycle fleet represents an efficient flexible resource. We remain committed to operating the fleet in a safe, reliable manner and assuring their availability over the long term.
Power continues to focus on running the business efficiently and has made target reductions in its workforce and continues to identify measures to improve availability and margins in today's market. New investment opportunities for Power do not involve the construction of additional new capacity, but we continue to look for opportunities to diversify the fleet.
PSE&G also continues to identify new opportunities for growth. PSE&G is on track to invest $3 billion in 2016 as part of its 5-year $12 billion capital program. In addition, PSE&G has recently reached a settlement with key parties that provides for an extension of its existing innovative landfill and brownfield solar programs subject to BPU preapproval. The settlement allows PSE&G to expand its investment in Solar by approximately $80 million to construct 33 megawatts of grid-connected solar facilities over 3 years. We believe PSE&G's involvement in grid-connected solar -- excuse me -- extends the benefit of Solar to all of its customers at a lower cost. We anticipate the decision from the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities by year-end.
PSE&G is also requesting approval from the BPU to partner with New Jersey Transit in the development of a new $270 million substation that both would utilize and would enhance the reliability and resilience of facilities damaged by Superstorm Sandy. The new substations would enter service by the end of 2020. For me, it's hard to believe, but it's been 4 years since Superstorm Sandy struck. It touched all of our customers, and today, we've invested more than $900 million under electric and gas programs approved by the BPU to improve our systems' resilience through raising substations, building redundancy, replacing gas pipe and even trimming trees. The collaboration with New Jersey Transit on construction of a new substation represents a continuation of this type of work.
The agreement to increase our investment in Solar, our announced $300 million increase in base capital spend and PSE&G's anticipated collaboration with New Jersey Transit represent a greater than $600 million increase in PSE&G's capital program.
PSE&G's ability to earn its authorized return on investment continues to drive our forecast for double-digit growth in PSE&G's 2016 earnings.
Based on our forecast for the year, PSE&G is expected to represent more than 60% of 2016's consolidated non-GAAP operating earnings. Its investment program continues to drive annual growth in rate base of 8% for the end of decade with the potential for up to 10% with additional programs that we have planned.
We have met significant challenges to our forecast presented by the lack of winter weather and low energy pricing. Even so, consistent with our comments on the second quarter earnings call this mid--- in mid-summer, we're making a slight adjustment to the upper end of our full year guidance. We are now guiding towards 2016 non-GAAP operating earnings of $2.80 to $2.95 per share, which represents a small reduction from our prior forecast of non-GAAP operating earnings of $2.80 to $3 per share. We are confident that the investments we're making along with a focus on operational excellence and a strong balance sheet will drive long term success.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Dan who will discuss our financials in greater detail."

Thank you, Ralph, and thank you, everybody, for joining us on the call this morning.As Ralph mentioned, PSEG reported net income for the third quarter of 2016 of $0.64 per share versus net income of $0.87 per share in last year's third quarter. N",1944,"Great. Thank you, Ralph, and thank you, everybody, for joining us on the call this morning.
As Ralph mentioned, PSEG reported net income for the third quarter of 2016 of $0.64 per share versus net income of $0.87 per share in last year's third quarter. Non-GAAP operating earnings for the third quarter of 2016 were $0.88 per share versus non-GAAP operating earnings of $0.80 per share in last year's third quarter, and a reconciliation of non-GAAP operating earnings to net income for the quarter and year-to-date can be found on Slides 4 and 5.
We've also provided you with a waterfall chart on Slide 9 that takes you through the net changes in quarter-over-quarter non-GAAP operating earnings by major business, and a similar chart on Slide 10 provides you with the changes to non-GAAP operating earnings by each business on a year-to-date basis. And I'll now review each company in more detail starting with PSE&G.
PSE&G reported net income of $0.50 per share for the third quarter of 2016 compared with $0.44 per share for the third quarter of 2015 for a 14% improvement. Results for the quarter are shown on Slide 12.
The improvement in PSE&G's net income for the third quarter reflects growth from its expanded investment in electric and gas transmission and distribution facilities. Returns on PSE&G's expanded investment in Transmission added $0.03 per share to net income in the quarter, and incremental revenue associated with PSE&G's Energy Strong infrastructure program added $0.02 per share to net income in the quarter.
Third quarter net income comparisons also benefited by an increase in electric demand associated with weather conditions, which were approximately 30% warmer-than-normal and 9% warmer than conditions experienced in the third quarter of 2015. The increase in demand associated with the warmer-than-normal weather added $0.01 per share to third quarter net income.
An increase in depreciation and O&M and other expense was offset by a decline in taxes and other items.
Retail electric sales increased 3.6% in the quarter, reflecting the much warmer summer weather that occurred in 2016. And on a weather-normalized basis, total sales were slightly positive versus the third quarter of 2015, with higher sales to residential and industrial customers offset by a decline in sales to commercial customers.
As Ralph mentioned, PSE&G's capital program, led by an investment and transmission, is on schedule. PSE&G is expected to invest $1.8 billion in transmission during 2016 as part of the 5-year $7.1 billion investment program to upgrade and expand the Transmission network. PSE&G's investment in transmission is expected to grow to represent approximately 45% of year-end 2016's rate base.
PSE&G recently filed an update of its formula rate for Transmission at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. And the update which reflects an increase on the level of PSE&G's investment in Transmission would provide for a $121 million increase in annual transmission revenues effective January 1, 2017, subject to FERC approval. We are maintaining our forecast for PSE&G's non-GAAP operating earnings for 2016 of $900 million to $935 million.
Now let's turn to Power. PSEG Power reported net income of $139 million or $0.27 per share for the third quarter of 2016 compared with net income of $206 million or $0.40 per share for the year ago quarter. Our non-GAAP operating earnings were $0.34 per share for the third quarter of 2016 compared to non-GAAP operating earnings for the third quarter of 2015 of $0.33 per share. And non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of 2016 was $397 million versus non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA for 2015 of $401 million.
Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA includes the same -- excludes the same items as our non-GAAP operating earnings measure as well as income tax expense, interest expense, depreciation and amortization and major maintenance at Power's Fossil Generating Facilities.
And the earnings release on Page 18 provides you with detailed analysis of the impact on Powers' non-GAAP operating earnings quarter-over-quarter. We've also provided you with more detail on generation for the quarter and for 9 months of the year on Slide 19 and Slide 20.
Power's net income in the third quarter includes one-time pretax charges amounting to $114 million pretax, $67 million after tax with $0.13 per share related to the early retirement of the Hudson and Mercer generating stations. These one-time charges, which are excluded from Power's non-GAAP operating earnings, mainly relate to the write-down of excess coal inventories and materials and supplies as well as some other smaller items.
Power's non-GAAP operating earnings for the third quarter reflect a decline in the average price on energy hedges, which is partially offset by lower cost to serve load which combined to reduce quarter-over-quarter operating earnings by $0.02 per share. A decline in output during the quarter reduced the operating earnings by $0.01 per share, and a reduction in O&M expense improved the results by $0.03 per share.
An increase in depreciation expense associated with Power's capital program was more than offset by a decline in interest expense and other items, which combined to improve quarter-over-quarter net income by $0.01 per share.
As I mentioned, Power's third quarter results benefited from a reduction in O&M expense, which added $0.03 per share to net income quarter-over-quarter. Year-to-date, a reduction in Power's O&M expense has improved net income comparisons by $0.15 per share.
Management's proactive response to low energy pricing has been a major contributor to the decline in O&M, and the timing of outages and major maintenance-related work has also influenced comparisons. 
For example, in 2016, for refueling outage at Hope occurred in the spring and this year, Hope Creek's refueling outage is currently underway in the fourth quarter. O&M expense in 2015 was also elevated due to major maintenance-related work at some of the fossil stations. Although we expect O&M expense in 2016 to decline year-over-year, you should anticipate an increase in O&M for the fourth quarter, given the cost associated with the refueling of our 100% owned Hope Creek nuclear station. 
Over the long term, you can expect constant diligence in controlling the growth of O&M. 
Now let's turn to Power's operations. Output at Power is generating facilities declined 4% in the quarter and the nuclear fleet operated at an average capacity factor of 80% in the third quarter versus an average capacity factor of 95% in the year-ago quarter as output declined 12% to 6.9 terawatt hours from 7.8 terawatt hours. The decline in output reflects the impact of extended outages at the few Salem units. And as we mentioned in our second quarter earnings call, output in the third quarter would be impacted by the expansion of the refueling outages at Salem 1 through July to complete repair work on the units baffle bolts and repair work at Salem 2 and 3 pair at electrical fall. Both units have since returned to service and are operating at full capacity. 
Output from Power's gas-fired combined cycle fleet declined slightly to 5.2 terawatt hours from 5.4 terawatt hours last year. The warmer-than-normal weather conditions further increased in demand for Power's coal-fired generating stations and peeking fleet, which, together, experienced an increase in output during the quarter to 2 terawatt hours from 1.6 terawatt hours. 
Power markets in the third quarter benefited from hotter-than-normal weather, which had a favorable influence on the market, and Power was less hedged going into the quarter than a year ago, allowing the fleet to capture some upside in pricing. That said, the decline in Power's gross margin in the quarter to $41.74 per megawatt hour from $42.07 per megawatts reflects the impact of lower average prices on energy hedges. 
As we've indicated, we continue to expect basis to be seasonal. That is positive in the winter, assuming normal weather, and neutral to negative at other times of the year until more gas pipeline takeaway capacity goes into operation. 
Our continues to forecast output for 2016 of 50 to 52 terawatt hours. The forecast takes into account the extended outage at Salem as well as refueling outage at Hope Creek, which is currently under way. 
Power has reduced its forecast of generation output for '17 and '18 by approximately 3% to 4%. The revised forecast recognizes the impact of low gas prices and the potential dispatch of the Keystone and coal-fired generating stations with also some impact coming from the retirement of Hudson in Mercer's coal-fired generating stations in mid-2017.
Approximately 75% to 80% of anticipated production in the fourth quarter of 2016 of and 11 to 12 terawatt hours is hedged at an average price of $48 per megawatt hour. The average price for energy hedges for the full year approximates $50 per megawatt hour. And for 2017, Power hedged at 65% to 70% of its revised forecast of 51 to 53 terawatts of output at an average price of $47 per megawatt hour. And for 2018, Power has hedged approximately 25% to 30% of its revised forecast of 56 to 58 terawatt hours of output at an average price of $45 per megawatt hour. The hedge then did continues to assume BGS hedges will cover 11 to 12 terawatt hours of output.
The forecast of Power's non-GAAP operating earnings for 2016 has been revised to $460 million to $500 million, and the forecast represents non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA for the full year of $1,270,000,000 to $1,335,000,000. 
I'd also like to point out that the retirement of Hudson and Mercer will continue to have an impact on Power's net income in the fourth quarter. In addition, the one-time charges recognized in the third quarter, Power expects to recognize incremental depreciation and amortization during the remainder of 2016 of $568 million pretax; and in 2017, Power expect to recognize incremental depreciation and amortization of $946 million pretax due to the shortening of the expected economic useful lives of Hudson and Mercer. Until the units are retired, we will continue to record normal O&M and depreciation in our non-GAAP operating earnings on an annual basis these expenses amount to an estimated $60 million and $50 million pretax, respectively. 
We should also see a reduction in Power's planned capital spending beyond 2017 of approximately $200 million to reflect the elimination of previously planned capital improvements at Hudson and Mercer. 
Now let's turn to PSEG Enterprise and other where we reported a net loss of $0.13 per share for the third quarter 2016 compared to net income of $0.03 per share for the third quarter of 2015.
Our non-GAAP operating earnings for the third quarter of 2016 were $0.04 per share compared to non-GAAP operating earnings of $0.03 per share for the third quarter of '15. During the third quarter of 2016, Energy Holdings completed its review of estimated residual values embedded in the energy arena leverage leases. As a result of current and expected future market conditions and impairment of $86 million after tax related to the residual value of these leases was recorded in net income. The increase in non-GAAP operating in earnings quarter-over-quarter results reflect certain tax items at PSE&G Energy Holdings and contractual payments associated with the operation of PSE&G island. The forecast of PSE&G Enterprise and other full year 2016 non-GAAP operating earnings remains $65 million. 
PSEG also closed the quarter ended September 30, 2016, with $450 million of cash on its balance sheet with debt at the end of the quarter representing approximately 45% of consolidated capital. PSEG Power had debt at the end of the quarter representing 28% of capital. 
As Ralph mentioned, we've adjusted our forecast for non-GAAP operating earnings for the full year to $2.80 to $2.95 per share from $2.80 to $3 per share. 
And with that, we're ready for questions."

It's [indiscernible], which, I believe according to PJM is scheduled for completion sometime next spring. That's where public information. You should check the PJM Oasis Board for confirmation that in case I have the date wrong. And, obviously, from a gas point of view, there's a much healthier degree of infrastructure that's bringing gas in the Marcellus to the New York/New Jersey region than there is going to the PJM West, which is a bit of a misnomer. It's actually south of here. And until the infrastructure corrects that arbitrage opportunity, you'll continue to see gas-based generation being less expensive to operate up here than it is down there. But we remain confident that over time, the market does correct any anomalies that exist and arbitrage opportunities that exist and there's no shortage of projects that are up either in permitting or in construction to move gas to the south.

PSEG reported strong results for the third quarter. Earlier this morning, we reported net income for the quarter of $0.64 per share versus $0.87 per share last year. Non-GAAP operating earnings for the third quarter of 2016 were $0.88 per share compared with non-GAAP operating earnings for the third quarter of 2015 of $0.80 per share.
For the 9 months, we reported net income of $1.94 per share versus $2.70 per share, but non-GAAP operating earnings for the 9 months ended September 30, 2016, are $2.36 per share, which compares with non-GAAP operating earnings of $2.41 per share earned during the 9 months ended September 30, 2015.
Slides 4 and 5 contain the details on the results for the quarter and the 9 months. We remain committed to our core operating philosophy of operational excellence, investing in a disciplined manner and maintaining a strong financial position to support the growth expected by our shareholders. PSE&G continues to earn its return on an expanded capital investment program. PSEG Power continues to manage through very difficult energy markets, and we continue to take strong actions to optimize both businesses in this environment.
PSEG Power has decided to retire the Hudson and Mercer coal-fired generation stations in 2017. This is sooner than we would've forecasted just a few short years ago but became inevitable in the face of changes in the energy market, which were amply demonstrated this summer. While we experienced very warm weather conditions, the abundance of low-cost gas supply, which is a benefit for our customers, kept energy prices low and is expected to keep power prices lower for longer. Careful analysis indicate it would be uneconomic to invest the capital necessary to assure the units would comply with PJM's new capacity performance reliability standards. Although the units have been dispatched infrequently, we expect the retirement of Hudson and Mercer to result in a further reduction in the fleets' emissions profile. These retirements continue the evolution of PSEG Power's fleet into a portfolio of reliable, low-cost, flexible assets capable of competing in today's market. To be clear, retirement will also aid Power's future cash flow and return profile.
The addition of 1,800 megawatts of new gas-fired capacity at Keys, Sewaren and Bridgeport Harbor over 2018 through '19 will further the transformation of the fleet.
From a supply/demand standpoint, I want to remind you that the capacity at Sewaren and Bridgeport Harbor will replace older steam and coal-fired capacity that we will retire. The new capacity will improve the fleets' efficiency and lower its cost structure. The new units remain on-time and on budget. These new units remain profitable even with the recent declines in market pricing and continue to meet our hurdles for returns, which, of course, are in excess of our return expectations that we placed on new utility investments.
By the end of this decade, our nuclear and gas-fired generation facilities will provide more than 90% of our electric output. Our nuclear fleet represents our cleanest energy resource for the foreseeable future, and our gas-fired combined cycle fleet represents an efficient flexible resource. We remain committed to operating the fleet in a safe, reliable manner and assuring their availability over the long term.
Power continues to focus on running the business efficiently and has made target reductions in its workforce and continues to identify measures to improve availability and margins in today's market. New investment opportunities for Power do not involve the construction of additional new capacity, but we continue to look for opportunities to diversify the fleet.
PSE&G also continues to identify new opportunities for growth. PSE&G is on track to invest $3 billion in 2016 as part of its 5-year $12 billion capital program. In addition, PSE&G has recently reached a settlement with key parties that provides for an extension of its existing innovative landfill and brownfield solar programs subject to BPU preapproval. The settlement allows PSE&G to expand its investment in Solar by approximately $80 million to construct 33 megawatts of grid-connected solar facilities over 3 years. We believe PSE&G's involvement in grid-connected solar -- excuse me -- extends the benefit of Solar to all of its customers at a lower cost. We anticipate the decision from the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities by year-end.
PSE&G is also requesting approval from the BPU to partner with New Jersey Transit in the development of a new $270 million substation that both would utilize and would enhance the reliability and resilience of facilities damaged by Superstorm Sandy. The new substations would enter service by the end of 2020. For me, it's hard to believe, but it's been 4 years since Superstorm Sandy struck. It touched all of our customers, and today, we've invested more than $900 million under electric and gas programs approved by the BPU to improve our systems' resilience through raising substations, building redundancy, replacing gas pipe and even trimming trees. The collaboration with New Jersey Transit on construction of a new substation represents a continuation of this type of work.
The agreement to increase our investment in Solar, our announced $300 million increase in base capital spend and PSE&G's anticipated collaboration with New Jersey Transit represent a greater than $600 million increase in PSE&G's capital program.
PSE&G's ability to earn its authorized return on investment continues to drive our forecast for double-digit growth in PSE&G's 2016 earnings.
Based on our forecast for the year, PSE&G is expected to represent more than 60% of 2016's consolidated non-GAAP operating earnings. Its investment program continues to drive annual growth in rate base of 8% for the end of decade with the potential for up to 10% with additional programs that we have planned.
We have met significant challenges to our forecast presented by the lack of winter weather and low energy pricing. Even so, consistent with our comments on the second quarter earnings call this mid--- in mid-summer, we're making a slight adjustment to the upper end of our full year guidance. We are now guiding towards 2016 non-GAAP operating earnings of $2.80 to $2.95 per share, which represents a small reduction from our prior forecast of non-GAAP operating earnings of $2.80 to $3 per share. We are confident that the investments we're making along with a focus on operational excellence and a strong balance sheet will drive long term success.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Dan who will discuss our financials in greater detail."
298482,402444484,1067464,"Public Service Enterprise Group Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 31, 2016",2016-10-31,"Earnings Calls","Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated","Executives","Great. Thank you, Ralph, and thank you, everybody, for joining us on the call this morning.As Ralph mentioned, PSEG reported net income for the third quarter of 2016 of $0.64 per share versus net income of $0.87 per share in last year's third quarter. N",1950,"Great. Thank you, Ralph, and thank you, everybody, for joining us on the call this morning.
As Ralph mentioned, PSEG reported net income for the third quarter of 2016 of $0.64 per share versus net income of $0.87 per share in last year's third quarter. Non-GAAP operating earnings for the third quarter of 2016 were $0.88 per share versus non-GAAP operating earnings of $0.80 per share in last year's third quarter, and a reconciliation of non-GAAP operating earnings to net income for the quarter and year-to-date can be found on Slides 4 and 5.
We've also provided you with a waterfall chart on Slide 9 that takes you through the net changes in quarter-over-quarter non-GAAP operating earnings by major business, and a similar chart on Slide 10 provides you with the changes to non-GAAP operating earnings by each business on a year-to-date basis. And I'll now review each company in more detail starting with PSE&G.
PSE&G reported net income of $0.50 per share for the third quarter of 2016 compared with $0.44 per share for the third quarter of 2015 for a 14% improvement. Results for the quarter are shown on Slide 12.
The improvement in PSE&G's net income for the third quarter reflects growth from its expanded investment in electric and gas transmission and distribution facilities. Returns on PSE&G's expanded investment in Transmission added $0.03 per share to net income in the quarter, and incremental revenue associated with PSE&G's Energy Strong infrastructure program added $0.02 per share to net income in the quarter.
Third quarter net income comparisons also benefited by an increase in electric demand associated with weather conditions, which were approximately 30% warmer-than-normal and 9% warmer than conditions experienced in the third quarter of 2015. The increase in demand associated with the warmer-than-normal weather added $0.01 per share to third quarter net income.
An increase in depreciation and O&M and other expense was offset by a decline in taxes and other items.
Retail electric sales increased 3.6% in the quarter, reflecting the much warmer summer weather that occurred in 2016. And on a weather-normalized basis, total sales were slightly positive versus the third quarter of 2015, with higher sales to residential and industrial customers offset by a decline in sales to commercial customers.
As Ralph mentioned, PSE&G's capital program, led by an investment and transmission, is on schedule. PSE&G is expected to invest $1.8 billion in transmission during 2016 as part of the 5-year $7.1 billion investment program to upgrade and expand the Transmission network. PSE&G's investment in transmission is expected to grow to represent approximately 45% of year-end 2016's rate base.
PSE&G recently filed an update of its formula rate for Transmission at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. And the update which reflects an increase on the level of PSE&G's investment in Transmission would provide for a $121 million increase in annual transmission revenues effective January 1, 2017, subject to FERC approval. We are maintaining our forecast for PSE&G's non-GAAP operating earnings for 2016 of $900 million to $935 million.
Now let's turn to Power. PSEG Power reported net income of $139 million or $0.27 per share for the third quarter of 2016 compared with net income of $206 million or $0.40 per share for the year ago quarter. Our non-GAAP operating earnings were $0.34 per share for the third quarter of 2016 compared to non-GAAP operating earnings for the third quarter of 2015 of $0.33 per share. And non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of 2016 was $397 million versus non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA for 2015 of $401 million.
Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA includes the same -- excludes the same items as our non-GAAP operating earnings measure as well as income tax expense, interest expense, depreciation and amortization and major maintenance at Power's Fossil Generating Facilities.
And the earnings release on Page 18 provides you with detailed analysis of the impact on Powers' non-GAAP operating earnings quarter-over-quarter. We've also provided you with more detail on generation for the quarter and for 9 months of the year on Slide 19 and Slide 20.
Power's net income in the third quarter includes one-time pretax charges amounting to $114 million pretax, $67 million after tax with $0.13 per share related to the early retirement of the Hudson and Mercer generating stations. These one-time charges, which are excluded from Power's non-GAAP operating earnings, mainly relate to the write-down of excess coal inventories and materials and supplies as well as some other smaller items.
Power's non-GAAP operating earnings for the third quarter reflect a decline in the average price on energy hedges, which is partially offset by lower cost to serve load which combined to reduce quarter-over-quarter operating earnings by $0.02 per share. A decline in output during the quarter reduced the operating earnings by $0.01 per share, and a reduction in O&M expense improved the results by $0.03 per share.
An increase in depreciation expense associated with Power's capital program was more than offset by a decline in interest expense and other items, which combined to improve quarter-over-quarter net income by $0.01 per share.
As I mentioned, Power's third quarter results benefited from a reduction in O&M expense, which added $0.03 per share to net income quarter-over-quarter. Year-to-date, a reduction in Power's O&M expense has improved net income comparisons by $0.15 per share.
Management's proactive response to low energy pricing has been a major contributor to the decline in O&M, and the timing of outages and major maintenance-related work has also influenced comparisons.
For example, in 2015, the refueling outage at Hope Creek occurred in the spring, and this year, Hope Creek's refueling outage is currently underway in the fourth quarter. O&M expense in 2015 was also elevated due to major maintenance-related work at some of the fossil stations. So although we expect O&M expense in 2016 to decline year-over-year, you should anticipate an increase in O&M for the fourth quarter, given the cost associated with the refueling of our 100%-owned Hope Creek Nuclear Station. Over the long term, you can expect constant diligence in controlling the growth of O&M.
Now let's turn to Power's operations. Output at Power's generating facilities declined 4% in the quarter, and the nuclear fleet operated at an average capacity factor of 80% in the third quarter versus an average capacity factor of 95% in the year-ago quarter as output declined 12% to 6.9 terawatt hours from 7.8 terawatt hours. The decline in output reflects the impact of extended outages at the few Salem units. And as we mentioned in our second quarter earnings call, output in the third quarter would be impacted by the extension of the refueling outage at Salem 1 through July to complete repair work on the unit's baffle bolts and repair work at Salem 2 to repair an electrical fault. Both units have since returned to service and are operating at full capacity.
Output from Power's gas-fired combined cycle fleet declined slightly to 5.2 terawatt hours from 5.4 terawatt hours last year. The warmer-than-normal weather conditions spurred an increase in demand for Power's coal-fired generating stations and peaking fleet, which together, experienced an increase in output during the quarter to 2 terawatt hours from 1.6 terawatt hours.
Power markets in the third quarter benefited from hotter-than-normal weather, which had a favorable influence on the market, and Power was less hedged going into the quarter than a year ago, allowing the fleet to capture some upside in pricing. That said, a decline in Power's gross margin into the quarter to $41.74 per megawatt hour from $42.07 per megawatts reflects the impact of lower average prices on energy hedges.
As we have indicated, we continue to expect bases to be seasonal that is positive in the winter, assuming normal weather, and neutral to negative at other times of the year until more gas pipeline takeaway capacity goes into operation.
Power continues to forecast the output for 2016 of 50 to 52 terawatt hours. The forecast takes into account the extended outage at Salem as well as refueling outage at Hope Creek, which is currently under way.
Power has reduced its forecast of generation output for '17 and '18 by approximately 3% to 4%. The revised forecast recognizes the impact of low gas prices on the potential dispatch of the Keystone and Conemaugh coal-fired generating stations with also some impact coming from the retirement of Hudson and Mercer's coal-fired generating stations in mid-2017.
Approximately 75% to 80% of anticipated production in the fourth quarter of 2016 of 11 to 12 terawatt hours is hedged at an average price of $48 per megawatt hour. The average price for energy hedges for the full year approximates $50 per megawatt hour. And for 2017, Power has hedged at 65% to 70% of its revised forecast of 51 to 53 terawatt hours of output at an average price of $47 per megawatt hour. And for 2018, Power has hedged approximately 25% to 30% of its revised forecast of 56 to 58 terawatt hours of output at an average price of $45 per megawatt hour. The hedge data continues to assume BGS hedges will cover 11 to 12 terawatt hours of output.
The forecast of Power's non-GAAP operating earnings for 2016 has been revised to $460 million to $500 million, and the forecast represents non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA for the full year of $1,270,000,000 to $1,335,000,000.
I'd also like to point out that the retirement of Hudson and Mercer will continue to have an impact on Power's net income in the fourth quarter. In addition to the one-time charges recognized in the third quarter, Power expects to recognize incremental depreciation and amortization during the remainder of 2016 of $568 million pretax. And in 2017, Power expects to recognize incremental depreciation and amortization of $946 million pretax due to the shortening of the expected economic useful lives of Hudson and Mercer. Until the units are retired, we will continue to record normal O&M and depreciation in our non-GAAP operating earnings on an annual basis. These expenses amount to an estimated $60 million and $50 million pretax, respectively.
We should also see a reduction in Power's planned capital spending beyond 2017 of approximately $200 million to reflect the elimination of previously planned capital improvements at Hudson and Mercer.
Now I'll turn to PSEG Enterprise and other where we reported a net loss of $0.13 per share for the third quarter 2016 compared to net income of $0.03 per share for the third quarter of 2015.
Our non-GAAP operating earnings for the third quarter of 2016 were $0.04 per share compared to non-GAAP operating earnings of $0.03 per share for the third quarter of '15. During the third quarter of 2016, Energy Holdings completed its review of estimated residual values embedded in the NRG REMA leveraged leases. And as a result of current and expected future market conditions, an impairment of $86 million after tax related to the residual value of these leases was recorded in net income. The increase in non-GAAP operating earnings quarter-over-quarter results reflect certain tax items at PSEG Energy Holdings and contractual payments associated with the operation of PSEG-Long Island. The forecast of PSEG Enterprise and other full year 2016 non-GAAP operating earnings remains $65 million.
PSEG also closed the quarter ended September 30, 2016, with $450 million of cash on its balance sheet, with debt at the end of the quarter representing approximately 45% of consolidated capital. PSEG Power had debt at the end of the quarter, representing 28% of capital.
As Ralph mentioned, we've adjusted our forecast for non-GAAP operating earnings for the full year to $2.80 to $2.95 per share from $2.80 to $3 per share.
And with that, we are ready for your questions."

Although we continue to look for opportunities to acquire assets in Power that fill out our portfolios in competitive markets that we're interested in, that being New York, New England and PJM. But number 1, use of the balance sheet is reinvesting in the business. Number two is given the cyclicality of the merchant-generation business to provide support for the dividend in some of those ups and downs, so that we can provide a consistent growth rate in that dividend. And the last would be to repurchase shares if we were not seeing those growth opportunities, primarily in the utility or had earnings that just dwarfed the growth in the dividend.

And then obviously, from a gas point of view, there's a much healthier degree of infrastructure that's bringing gas in the Marcellus to the New York/New Jersey region than there is going to the PJM west region, which is a bit of a misnomer. It's actually south of here. And until the infrastructure corrects that arbitrage opportunity, you'll continue to see gas-based generation being less expensive to operate up here than it is down there. But we remain confident that over time, the market does correct any anomalies that exist and arbitrage opportunities that exist, and there's no shortage of projects that are up either in permitting or in construction to move gas to the south.

PSEG reported strong results for the third quarter. Earlier this morning, we reported net income for the quarter of $0.64 per share versus $0.87 per share last year. Non-GAAP operating earnings for the third quarter of 2016 were $0.88 per share compared with non-GAAP operating earnings for the third quarter of 2015 of $0.80 per share.
For the 9 months, we reported net income of $1.94 per share versus $2.70 per share, but non-GAAP operating earnings for the 9 months ended September 30, 2016, are $2.36 per share, which compares with non-GAAP operating earnings of $2.41 per share earned during the 9 months ended September 30, 2015.
Slides 4 and 5 contain the details on the results for the quarter and the 9 months. We remain committed to our core operating philosophy of operational excellence, investing in a disciplined manner and maintaining a strong financial position to support the growth expected by our shareholders. PSE&G continues to earn its return on an expanded capital investment program. PSEG Power continues to manage through very difficult energy markets, and we continue to take strong actions to optimize both businesses in this environment.
PSEG Power has decided to retire the Hudson and Mercer coal-fired generation stations in 2017. This is sooner than we would've forecasted just a few short years ago but became inevitable in the face of changes in the energy market, which were amply demonstrated this summer. While we experienced very warm weather conditions, the abundance of low-cost gas supply, which is a benefit for our customers, kept energy prices low and is expected to keep power prices lower for longer. Careful analysis indicate it would be uneconomic to invest the capital necessary to assure the units would comply with PJM's new capacity performance reliability standards. Although the units have been dispatched infrequently, we expect the retirement of Hudson and Mercer to result in a further reduction in the fleets' emissions profile. These retirements continue the evolution of PSEG Power's fleets into a portfolio of reliable, low-cost, flexible assets capable of competing in today's market. To be clear, retirement will also aid Power's future cash flow and return profile.
The addition of 1,800 megawatts of new gas-fired capacity at Keys, Sewaren and Bridgeport Harbor over 2018 through '19 will further the transformation of the fleet.
From a supply/demand standpoint, I want to remind you that the capacity at Sewaren and Bridgeport Harbor will replace older steam and coal-fired capacity that we will retire. The new capacity will improve the fleets' efficiency and lower its cost structure. The new units remain on-time and on budget. These new units remain profitable even with the recent declines in market pricing and continue to meet our hurdles for returns, which, of course, are in excess of our return expectations that we place on new utility investments.
By the end of this decade, our nuclear and gas-fired generation facilities will provide more than 90% of our electric output. Our nuclear fleet represents our cleanest energy resource for the foreseeable future, and our gas-fired combined cycle fleet represents an efficient flexible resource. We remain committed to operating the fleet in a safe, reliable manner and assuring their availability over the long term.
Power continues to focus on running the business efficiently and has made targeted reductions in its workforce and continues to identify measures to improve availability and margins in today's market. New investment opportunities for Power do not involve the construction of additional new capacity, but we continue to look for opportunities to diversify the fleet.
PSE&G also continues to identify new opportunities for growth. PSE&G is on track to invest $3 billion in 2016 as part of its 5-year $12 billion capital program. In addition, PSE&G has recently reached a settlement with key parties that provides for an extension of its existing innovative landfill and brownfield solar programs subject to BPU approval. The settlement allows PSE&G to expand its investment in Solar by approximately $80 million to construct 33 megawatts of grid-connected solar facilities over 3 years. We believe PSE&G's involvement in grid-connected solar -- excuse me -- extends the benefit of Solar to all of its customers at a lower cost. We anticipate a decision from the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities by year-end.
PSE&G is also requesting approval from the BPU to partner with New Jersey Transit in the development of a new $270 million substation that both would utilize and would enhance the reliability and resilience of facilities damaged by Superstorm Sandy. The new substation would enter service by the end of 2020. For me, it's hard to believe, but it's been 4 years since Superstorm Sandy struck. It touched all of our customers, and to date, we've invested more than $900 million under electric and gas programs approved by the BPU to improve our systems' resilience through raising substations, building redundancy, replacing gas pipe and even trimming trees. The collaboration with New Jersey Transit on construction of a new substation represents a continuation of this type of work.
The agreement to increase our investment in Solar, our announced $300 million increase in base capital spend and PSE&G's anticipated collaboration with New Jersey Transit represent a greater than $600 million increase in PSE&G's capital program.
PSE&G's ability to earn its authorized return on investment continues to drive our forecast for double-digit growth in PSE&G's 2016 earnings.
Based on our forecast for the year, PSE&G is expected to represent more than 60% of 2016's consolidated non-GAAP operating earnings. Its investment program continues to drive annual growth in rate base of 8% for the end of decade with the potential for up to 10% with additional programs that we have planned.
We have met significant challenges to our forecast presented by the lack of winter weather and low energy pricing. Even so, consistent with our comments on the second quarter earnings call this mid--- in mid-summer, we're making a slight adjustment to the upper end of our full year guidance. We are now guiding towards 2016 non-GAAP operating earnings of $2.80 to $2.95 per share, which represents a small reduction from our prior forecast of non-GAAP operating earnings of $2.80 to $3 per share. We are confident that the investments we're making along with a focus on operational excellence and a strong balance sheet will drive long term success.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Dan who will discuss our financials in greater detail."
298482,402444484,1067542,"Public Service Enterprise Group Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 31, 2016",2016-10-31,"Earnings Calls","Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated","Executives","Great. Thank you, Ralph, and thank you, everybody, for joining us on the call this morning.As Ralph mentioned, PSEG reported net income for the third quarter of 2016 of $0.64 per share versus net income of $0.87 per share in last year's third quarter. N",1951,"Great. Thank you, Ralph, and thank you, everybody, for joining us on the call this morning.
As Ralph mentioned, PSEG reported net income for the third quarter of 2016 of $0.64 per share versus net income of $0.87 per share in last year's third quarter. Non-GAAP operating earnings for the third quarter of 2016 were $0.88 per share versus non-GAAP operating earnings of $0.80 per share in last year's third quarter, and a reconciliation of non-GAAP operating earnings to net income for the quarter and year-to-date can be found on Slides 4 and 5.
We've also provided you with a waterfall chart on Slide 9 that takes you through the net changes in quarter-over-quarter non-GAAP operating earnings by major business, and a similar chart on Slide 10 provides you with the changes to non-GAAP operating earnings by each business on a year-to-date basis. And I'll now review each company in more detail starting with PSE&G.
PSE&G reported net income of $0.50 per share for the third quarter of 2016 compared with $0.44 per share for the third quarter of 2015 for a 14% improvement. Results for the quarter are shown on Slide 12.
The improvement in PSE&G's net income for the third quarter reflects growth from its expanded investment in electric and gas transmission and distribution facilities. Returns on PSE&G's expanded investment in Transmission added $0.03 per share to net income in the quarter, and incremental revenue associated with PSE&G's Energy Strong infrastructure program added $0.02 per share to net income in the quarter.
Third quarter net income comparisons also benefited by an increase in electric demand associated with weather conditions, which were approximately 30% warmer than normal and 9% warmer than conditions experienced in the third quarter of 2015. The increase in demand associated with the warmer-than-normal weather added $0.01 per share to third quarter net income.
An increase in depreciation and O&M and other expense was offset by a decline in taxes and other items.
Retail electric sales increased 3.6% in the quarter, reflecting the much warmer summer weather that occurred in 2016. And on a weather-normalized basis, total sales were slightly positive versus the third quarter of 2015, with higher sales to residential and industrial customers offset by a decline in sales to commercial customers.
As Ralph mentioned, PSE&G's capital program, led by an investment in transmission, is on schedule. PSE&G is expected to invest $1.8 billion in transmission during 2016 as part of the 5-year $7.1 billion investment program to upgrade and expand the Transmission network. PSE&G's investment in transmission is expected to grow to represent approximately 45% of year-end 2016's rate base.
PSE&G recently filed an update of its formula rate for Transmission at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. And the update which reflects an increase in the level of PSE&G's investment in Transmission would provide for a $121 million increase in annual transmission revenues effective January 1, 2017, subject to FERC approval. We are maintaining our forecast for PSE&G's non-GAAP operating earnings for 2016 of $900 million to $935 million.
Now let's turn to Power. PSEG Power reported net income of $139 million or $0.27 per share for the third quarter of 2016 compared with net income of $206 million or $0.40 per share for the year ago quarter. Our non-GAAP operating earnings were $0.34 per share for the third quarter of 2016 compared to non-GAAP operating earnings for the third quarter of 2015 of $0.33 per share. And non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of 2016 was $397 million versus non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA for 2015 of $401 million.
Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA includes the same -- excludes the same items as our non-GAAP operating earnings measure as well as income tax expense, interest expense, depreciation and amortization and major maintenance at Power's Fossil Generating Facilities.
And the earnings release on Page 18 provides you with detailed analysis of the impact on Powers' non-GAAP operating earnings quarter-over-quarter. We've also provided you with more detail on generation for the quarter and for 9 months of the year on Slide 19 and Slide 20.
Power's net income in the third quarter includes one-time pretax charges amounting to $114 million pretax, $67 million after tax with $0.13 per share related to the early retirement of the Hudson and Mercer generating stations. These one-time charges, which are excluded from Power's non-GAAP operating earnings, mainly relate to the write-down of excess coal inventory and materials and supplies as well as some other smaller items.
Power's non-GAAP operating earnings for the third quarter reflect a decline in the average price on energy hedges, which is partially offset by lower cost to serve load which combined to reduce quarter-over-quarter operating earnings by $0.02 per share. A decline in output during the quarter reduced the operating earnings by $0.01 per share, and a reduction in O&M expense improved the results by $0.03 per share.
An increase in depreciation expense associated with Power's capital program was more than offset by a decline in interest expense and other items, which combined to improve quarter-over-quarter net income by $0.01 per share.
As I mentioned, Power's third quarter results benefited from a reduction in O&M expense, which added $0.03 per share to net income quarter-over-quarter. Year-to-date, a reduction in Power's O&M expense has improved net income comparisons by $0.15 per share.
Management's proactive response to low energy pricing has been a major contributor to the decline in O&M, and the timing of outages and major maintenance-related work has also influenced comparisons.
For example, in 2015, the refueling outage at Hope Creek occurred in the spring, and this year, Hope Creek's refueling outage is currently underway in the fourth quarter. O&M expense in 2015 was also elevated due to major maintenance-related work at some of the fossil stations. So although we expect O&M expense in 2016 to decline year-over-year, you should anticipate an increase in O&M for the fourth quarter, given the cost associated with the refueling of our 100%-owned Hope Creek Nuclear Station. Over the long term, you can expect constant diligence in controlling the growth of O&M.
Now let's turn to Power's operations. Output at Power's generating facilities declined 4% in the quarter, and the nuclear fleet operated at an average capacity factor of 80% in the third quarter versus an average capacity factor of 95% in the year-ago quarter as output declined 12% to 6.9 terawatt hours from 7.8 terawatt hours. The decline in output reflects the impact of extended outages at the 2 Salem units. And as we mentioned in our second quarter earnings call, output in the third quarter would be impacted by the extension of the refueling outage at Salem 1 through July to complete repair work on the unit's baffle bolts and repair work at Salem 2 to repair an electrical fault. Both units have since returned to service and are operating at full capacity.
Output from Power's gas-fired combined cycle fleet declined slightly to 5.2 terawatt hours from 5.4 terawatt hours last year. The warmer-than-normal weather conditions spurred an increase in demand for Power's coal-fired generating stations and peaking fleet, which together, experienced an increase in output during the quarter to 2 terawatt hours from 1.6 terawatt hours.
Power markets in the third quarter benefited from hotter-than-normal weather, which had a favorable influence on the market, and Power was less hedged going into the quarter than a year ago, allowing the fleet to capture some upside in pricing. That said, a decline in Power's gross margin in the quarter to $41.74 per megawatt hour from $42.07 per megawatt hour reflects the impact of lower average prices on energy hedges.
As we have indicated, we continue to expect basis to be seasonal, that is positive in the winter, assuming normal weather, and neutral to negative at other times of the year until more gas pipeline takeaway capacity goes into operation.
Power continues to forecast the output for 2016 of 50 to 52 terawatt hours. The forecast takes into account the extended outage at Salem as well as refueling outage at Hope Creek, which is currently underway.
Power has reduced its forecast of generation output for '17 and '18 by approximately 3% to 4%. The revised forecast recognizes the impact of low gas prices on the potential dispatch of the Keystone and Conemaugh coal-fired generating stations, with also some impact coming from the retirement of Hudson and Mercer's coal-fired generating stations in mid-2017.
Approximately 75% to 80% of anticipated production in the fourth quarter of 2016 of 11 to 12 terawatt hours is hedged at an average price of $48 per megawatt hour. The average price for energy hedges for the full year approximates $50 per megawatt hour. And for 2017, Power has hedged 65% to 70% of its revised forecast of 51 to 53 terawatt hours of output at an average price of $47 per megawatt hour. And for 2018, Power has hedged approximately 25% to 30% of its revised forecast of 56 to 58 terawatt hours of output at an average price of $45 per megawatt hour. The hedge data continues to assume BGS hedges will cover 11 to 12 terawatt hours of output.
The forecast of Power's non-GAAP operating earnings for 2016 has been revised to $460 million to $500 million, and the forecast represents non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA for the full year of $1,270,000,000 to $1,335,000,000.
I'd also like to point out that the retirement of Hudson and Mercer will continue to have an impact on Power's net income in the fourth quarter. In addition to the one-time charges recognized in the third quarter, Power expects to recognize incremental depreciation and amortization during the remainder of 2016 of $568 million pretax. And in 2017, Power expects to recognize incremental depreciation and amortization of $946 million pretax due to the shortening of the expected economic useful lives of Hudson and Mercer. Until the units are retired, we will continue to record normal O&M and depreciation in our non-GAAP operating earnings on an annual basis. These expenses amount to an estimated $60 million and $50 million pretax, respectively.
We should also see a reduction in Power's planned capital spending beyond 2017 of approximately $200 million to reflect the elimination of previously planned capital improvements at Hudson and Mercer.
Now I'll turn to PSEG Enterprise and other where we reported a net loss of $0.13 per share for the third quarter 2016 compared to net income of $0.03 per share for the third quarter of 2015.
Our non-GAAP operating earnings for the third quarter of 2016 were $0.04 per share compared to non-GAAP operating earnings of $0.03 per share for the third quarter of '15. During the third quarter of 2016, Energy Holdings completed its review of estimated residual values embedded in the NRG REMA leveraged leases. And as a result of current and expected future market conditions, an impairment of $86 million after tax related to the residual value of these leases was recorded in net income. The increase in non-GAAP operating earnings quarter-over-quarter results reflect certain tax items at PSEG Energy Holdings and contractual payments associated with the operation of PSEG-Long Island. The forecast of PSEG Enterprise and other full year 2016 non-GAAP operating earnings remains $65 million.
PSEG also closed the quarter ended September 30, 2016, with $450 million of cash on its balance sheet, with debt at the end of the quarter representing approximately 45% of consolidated capital. PSEG Power had debt at the end of the quarter, representing 28% of capital.
As Ralph mentioned, we've adjusted our forecast for non-GAAP operating earnings for the full year to $2.80 to $2.95 per share from $2.80 to $3 per share.
And with that, we are ready for your questions."

And we've been hearing from other power producers, gas-fired producers, in PJM that there's been some expansion in the negative Power bases due to some congestion on transmission lines as all of the gas plants are running now, often 24/7. Is this a phenomenon you are experiencing at your units?"

And then obviously, from a gas point of view, there's a much healthier degree of infrastructure that's bringing gas in the Marcellus to the New York/New Jersey region than there is going to the PJM west region, which is a bit of a misnomer. It's actually south of here. And until the infrastructure corrects that arbitrage opportunity, you'll continue to see gas-based generation being less expensive to operate up here than it is down there. But we remain confident that over time, the market does correct any anomalies that exist and arbitrage opportunities that exist, and there's no shortage of projects that are up either in permitting or in construction to move gas to the south.

PSEG reported strong results for the third quarter. Earlier this morning, we reported net income for the quarter of $0.64 per share versus $0.87 per share last year. Non-GAAP operating earnings for the third quarter of 2016 were $0.88 per share compared with non-GAAP operating earnings for the third quarter of 2015 of $0.80 per share.
For the 9 months, we reported net income of $1.94 per share versus $2.70 per share, but non-GAAP operating earnings for the 9 months ended September 30, 2016, are $2.36 per share, which compares with non-GAAP operating earnings of $2.41 per share earned during the 9 months ended September 30, 2015.
Slides 4 and 5 contain the details on the results for the quarter and the 9 months. We remain committed to our core operating philosophy of operational excellence, investing in a disciplined manner and maintaining a strong financial position to support the growth expected by our shareholders. PSE&G continues to earn its return on an expanded capital investment program. PSEG Power continues to manage through very difficult energy markets, and we continue to take strong actions to optimize both businesses in this environment.
PSEG Power has decided to retire the Hudson and Mercer coal-fired generation stations in 2017. This is sooner than we would've forecasted just a few short years ago but became inevitable in the face of changes in the energy market, which were amply demonstrated this summer. While we experienced very warm weather conditions, the abundance of low-cost gas supply, which is a benefit for our customers, kept energy prices low and is expected to keep power prices lower for longer. Careful analysis indicate it would be uneconomic to invest the capital necessary to assure the units would comply with PJM's new capacity performance reliability standards. Although the units have been dispatched infrequently, we expect the retirement of Hudson and Mercer to result in a further reduction in the fleets' emissions profile. These retirements continue the evolution of PSEG Power's fleets into a portfolio of reliable, low-cost, flexible assets capable of competing in today's market. To be clear, retirement will also aid Power's future cash flow and return profile.
The addition of 1,800 megawatts of new gas-fired capacity at Keys, Sewaren and Bridgeport Harbor over 2018 through '19 will further the transformation of the fleet.
From a supply/demand standpoint, I want to remind you that the capacity at Sewaren and Bridgeport Harbor will replace older steam and coal-fired capacity that we will retire. The new capacity will improve the fleets' efficiency and lower its cost structure. The new units remain on-time and on budget. These new units remain profitable even with the recent declines in market pricing and continue to meet our hurdles for returns, which, of course, are in excess of our return expectations that we place on new utility investments.
By the end of this decade, our nuclear and gas-fired generation facilities will provide more than 90% of our electric output. Our nuclear fleet represents our cleanest energy resource for the foreseeable future, and our gas-fired combined cycle fleet represents an efficient flexible resource. We remain committed to operating the fleet in a safe, reliable manner and assuring their availability over the long term.
Power continues to focus on running the business efficiently and has made targeted reductions in its workforce and continues to identify measures to improve availability and margins in today's market. New investment opportunities for Power do not involve the construction of additional new capacity, but we continue to look for opportunities to diversify the fleet.
PSE&G also continues to identify new opportunities for growth. PSE&G is on track to invest $3 billion in 2016 as part of its 5-year $12 billion capital program. In addition, PSE&G has recently reached a settlement with key parties that provides for an extension of its existing innovative landfill and brownfield solar programs subject to BPU approval. The settlement allows PSE&G to expand its investment in Solar by approximately $80 million to construct 33 megawatts of grid-connected solar facilities over 3 years. We believe PSE&G's involvement in grid-connected solar -- excuse me -- extends the benefit of Solar to all of its customers at a lower cost. We anticipate a decision from the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities by year-end.
PSE&G is also requesting approval from the BPU to partner with New Jersey Transit in the development of a new $270 million substation that both would utilize and would enhance the reliability and resilience of facilities damaged by Superstorm Sandy. The new substation would enter service by the end of 2020. For me, it's hard to believe, but it's been 4 years since Superstorm Sandy struck. It touched all of our customers, and to date, we've invested more than $900 million under electric and gas programs approved by the BPU to improve our systems' resilience through raising substations, building redundancy, replacing gas pipe and even trimming trees. The collaboration with New Jersey Transit on construction of a new substation represents a continuation of this type of work.
The agreement to increase our investment in Solar, our announced $300 million increase in base capital spend and PSE&G's anticipated collaboration with New Jersey Transit represent a greater than $600 million increase in PSE&G's capital program.
PSE&G's ability to earn its authorized return on investment continues to drive our forecast for double-digit growth in PSE&G's 2016 earnings.
Based on our forecast for the year, PSE&G is expected to represent more than 60% of 2016's consolidated non-GAAP operating earnings. Its investment program continues to drive annual growth in rate base of 8% for the end of decade with the potential for up to 10% with additional programs that we have planned.
We have met significant challenges to our forecast presented by the lack of winter weather and low energy pricing. Even so, consistent with our comments on the second quarter earnings call this mid--- in mid-summer, we're making a slight adjustment to the upper end of our full year guidance. We are now guiding towards 2016 non-GAAP operating earnings of $2.80 to $2.95 per share, which represents a small reduction from our prior forecast of non-GAAP operating earnings of $2.80 to $3 per share. We are confident that the investments we're making along with a focus on operational excellence and a strong balance sheet will drive long term success.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Dan who will discuss our financials in greater detail."
298482,402444484,1067790,"Public Service Enterprise Group Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 31, 2016",2016-10-31,"Earnings Calls","Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated","Executives","Great. Thank you, Ralph, and thank you, everybody, for joining us on the call this morning.As Ralph mentioned, PSEG reported net income for the third quarter of 2016 of $0.64 per share versus net income of $0.87 per share in last year's third quarter. N",1951,"Great. Thank you, Ralph, and thank you, everybody, for joining us on the call this morning.
As Ralph mentioned, PSEG reported net income for the third quarter of 2016 of $0.64 per share versus net income of $0.87 per share in last year's third quarter. Non-GAAP operating earnings for the third quarter of 2016 were $0.88 per share versus non-GAAP operating earnings of $0.80 per share in last year's third quarter, and a reconciliation of non-GAAP operating earnings to net income for the quarter and year-to-date can be found on Slides 4 and 5.
We've also provided you with a waterfall chart on Slide 9 that takes you through the net changes in quarter-over-quarter non-GAAP operating earnings by major business, and a similar chart on Slide 10 provides you with the changes to non-GAAP operating earnings by each business on a year-to-date basis. And I'll now review each company in more detail starting with PSE&G.
PSE&G reported net income of $0.50 per share for the third quarter of 2016 compared with $0.44 per share for the third quarter of 2015 for a 14% improvement. Results for the quarter are shown on Slide 12.
The improvement in PSE&G's net income for the third quarter reflects growth from its expanded investment in electric and gas transmission and distribution facilities. Returns on PSE&G's expanded investment in Transmission added $0.03 per share to net income in the quarter, and incremental revenue associated with PSE&G's Energy Strong infrastructure program added $0.02 per share to net income in the quarter.
Third quarter net income comparisons also benefited by an increase in electric demand associated with weather conditions, which were approximately 30% warmer than normal and 9% warmer than conditions experienced in the third quarter of 2015. The increase in demand associated with the warmer-than-normal weather added $0.01 per share to third quarter net income.
An increase in depreciation and O&M and other expense was offset by a decline in taxes and other items.
Retail electric sales increased 3.6% in the quarter, reflecting the much warmer summer weather that occurred in 2016. And on a weather-normalized basis, total sales were slightly positive versus the third quarter of 2015, with higher sales to residential and industrial customers offset by a decline in sales to commercial customers.
As Ralph mentioned, PSE&G's capital program, led by an investment in transmission, is on schedule. PSE&G is expected to invest $1.8 billion in transmission during 2016 as part of the 5-year $7.1 billion investment program to upgrade and expand the Transmission network. PSE&G's investment in transmission is expected to grow to represent approximately 45% of year-end 2016's rate base.
PSE&G recently filed an update of its formula rate for Transmission at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. And the update which reflects an increase in the level of PSE&G's investment in Transmission would provide for a $121 million increase in annual transmission revenues effective January 1, 2017, subject to FERC approval. We are maintaining our forecast for PSE&G's non-GAAP operating earnings for 2016 of $900 million to $935 million.
Now let's turn to Power. PSEG Power reported net income of $139 million or $0.27 per share for the third quarter of 2016 compared with net income of $206 million or $0.40 per share for the year ago quarter. Our non-GAAP operating earnings were $0.34 per share for the third quarter of 2016 compared to non-GAAP operating earnings for the third quarter of 2015 of $0.33 per share. And non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of 2016 was $397 million versus non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA for 2015 of $401 million.
Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA includes the same -- excludes the same items as our non-GAAP operating earnings measure as well as income tax expense, interest expense, depreciation and amortization and major maintenance at Power's Fossil Generating Facilities.
And the earnings release on Page 18 provides you with detailed analysis of the impact on Powers' non-GAAP operating earnings quarter-over-quarter. We've also provided you with more detail on generation for the quarter and for 9 months of the year on Slide 19 and Slide 20.
Power's net income in the third quarter includes one-time pretax charges amounting to $114 million pretax, $67 million after tax with $0.13 per share related to the early retirement of the Hudson and Mercer generating stations. These one-time charges, which are excluded from Power's non-GAAP operating earnings, mainly relate to the write-down of excess coal inventory and materials and supplies as well as some other smaller items.
Power's non-GAAP operating earnings for the third quarter reflect a decline in the average price on energy hedges, which is partially offset by lower cost to serve load which combined to reduce quarter-over-quarter operating earnings by $0.02 per share. A decline in output during the quarter reduced the operating earnings by $0.01 per share, and a reduction in O&M expense improved the results by $0.03 per share.
An increase in depreciation expense associated with Power's capital program was more than offset by a decline in interest expense and other items, which combined to improve quarter-over-quarter net income by $0.01 per share.
As I mentioned, Power's third quarter results benefited from a reduction in O&M expense, which added $0.03 per share to net income quarter-over-quarter. Year-to-date, a reduction in Power's O&M expense has improved net income comparisons by $0.15 per share.
Management's proactive response to low energy pricing has been a major contributor to the decline in O&M, and the timing of outages and major maintenance-related work has also influenced comparisons.
For example, in 2015, the refueling outage at Hope Creek occurred in the spring, and this year, Hope Creek's refueling outage is currently underway in the fourth quarter. O&M expense in 2015 was also elevated due to major maintenance-related work at some of the fossil stations. So although we expect O&M expense in 2016 to decline year-over-year, you should anticipate an increase in O&M for the fourth quarter, given the cost associated with the refueling of our 100%-owned Hope Creek Nuclear Station. Over the long term, you can expect constant diligence in controlling the growth of O&M.
Now let's turn to Power's operations. Output at Power's generating facilities declined 4% in the quarter, and the nuclear fleet operated at an average capacity factor of 80% in the third quarter versus an average capacity factor of 95% in the year-ago quarter as output declined 12% to 6.9 terawatt hours from 7.8 terawatt hours. The decline in output reflects the impact of extended outages at the 2 Salem units. And as we mentioned in our second quarter earnings call, output in the third quarter would be impacted by the extension of the refueling outage at Salem 1 through July to complete repair work on the unit's baffle bolts and repair work at Salem 2 to repair an electrical fault. Both units have since returned to service and are operating at full capacity.
Output from Power's gas-fired combined cycle fleet declined slightly to 5.2 terawatt hours from 5.4 terawatt hours last year. The warmer-than-normal weather conditions spurred an increase in demand for Power's coal-fired generating stations and peaking fleet, which together, experienced an increase in output during the quarter to 2 terawatt hours from 1.6 terawatt hours.
Power markets in the third quarter benefited from hotter-than-normal weather, which had a favorable influence on the market, and Power was less hedged going into the quarter than a year ago, allowing the fleet to capture some upside in pricing. That said, a decline in Power's gross margin in the quarter to $41.74 per megawatt hour from $42.07 per megawatt hour reflects the impact of lower average prices on energy hedges.
As we have indicated, we continue to expect basis to be seasonal, that is positive in the winter, assuming normal weather, and neutral to negative at other times of the year until more gas pipeline takeaway capacity goes into operation.
Power continues to forecast the output for 2016 of 50 to 52 terawatt hours. The forecast takes into account the extended outage at Salem as well as refueling outage at Hope Creek, which is currently underway.
Power has reduced its forecast of generation output for '17 and '18 by approximately 3% to 4%. The revised forecast recognizes the impact of low gas prices on the potential dispatch of the Keystone and Conemaugh coal-fired generating stations, with also some impact coming from the retirement of Hudson and Mercer's coal-fired generating stations in mid-2017.
Approximately 75% to 80% of anticipated production in the fourth quarter of 2016 of 11 to 12 terawatt hours is hedged at an average price of $48 per megawatt hour. The average price for energy hedges for the full year approximates $50 per megawatt hour. And for 2017, Power has hedged 65% to 70% of its revised forecast of 51 to 53 terawatt hours of output at an average price of $47 per megawatt hour. And for 2018, Power has hedged approximately 25% to 30% of its revised forecast of 56 to 58 terawatt hours of output at an average price of $45 per megawatt hour. The hedge data continues to assume BGS hedges will cover 11 to 12 terawatt hours of output.
The forecast of Power's non-GAAP operating earnings for 2016 has been revised to $460 million to $500 million, and the forecast represents non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA for the full year of $1,270,000,000 to $1,335,000,000.
I'd also like to point out that the retirement of Hudson and Mercer will continue to have an impact on Power's net income in the fourth quarter. In addition to the one-time charges recognized in the third quarter, Power expects to recognize incremental depreciation and amortization during the remainder of 2016 of $568 million pretax. And in 2017, Power expects to recognize incremental depreciation and amortization of $946 million pretax due to the shortening of the expected economic useful lives of Hudson and Mercer. Until the units are retired, we will continue to record normal O&M and depreciation in our non-GAAP operating earnings on an annual basis. These expenses amount to an estimated $60 million and $50 million pretax, respectively.
We should also see a reduction in Power's planned capital spending beyond 2017 of approximately $200 million to reflect the elimination of previously planned capital improvements at Hudson and Mercer.
Now I'll turn to PSEG Enterprise and other where we reported a net loss of $0.13 per share for the third quarter 2016 compared to net income of $0.03 per share for the third quarter of 2015.
Our non-GAAP operating earnings for the third quarter of 2016 were $0.04 per share compared to non-GAAP operating earnings of $0.03 per share for the third quarter of '15. During the third quarter of 2016, Energy Holdings completed its review of estimated residual values embedded in the NRG REMA leveraged leases. And as a result of current and expected future market conditions, an impairment of $86 million after tax related to the residual value of these leases was recorded in net income. The increase in non-GAAP operating earnings quarter-over-quarter results reflect certain tax items at PSEG Energy Holdings and contractual payments associated with the operation of PSEG-Long Island. The forecast of PSEG Enterprise and other full year 2016 non-GAAP operating earnings remains $65 million.
PSEG also closed the quarter ended September 30, 2016, with $450 million of cash on its balance sheet, with debt at the end of the quarter representing approximately 45% of consolidated capital. PSEG Power had debt at the end of the quarter, representing 28% of capital.
As Ralph mentioned, we've adjusted our forecast for non-GAAP operating earnings for the full year to $2.80 to $2.95 per share from $2.80 to $3 per share.
And with that, we are ready for your questions."

We've -- we do a good job of controlling O&M, but I would not want to promise that we will be able to control O&M at a level of 0, which is about where the load has been growing. It's like 0.1%, 0.2%. So it's -- suffice to say that the earnings growth will -- would probably be a net subtraction from that rate base growth, but we don't give an exact number of what that is."

Even 3-year capacity prices don't capture the full benefit of what I expect to be a fairly extensive debate on how carbon's to be priced in the future. So they may -- every state may not come up with its own remedy, and regrettably, the right remedy would be a national remedy, but we don't seem to have a lot of traction in that regard right now.
