Today, we are reporting strong results for another successful year of significant accomplishments for our core Utility, Parent & Other business, adjusted EPS were in line with our guidance and growth expectations and our consolidated operational earnings came in above our guidance range. A year ago, I told you that the foundation for our success in 2018 was largely in place, and we laid out what we needed to do to stay on track to achieve our outlooks and aspirations. We checked off every deliverable on that list as well as a few more, and our success keeps us firmly on track to achieve our strategic and financial objectives in 2019 and beyond.
As a result, we raised our dividend for the fourth consecutive year, at trend we expect to continue, subject as always to approval of our board. At EWC, we made important progress toward exiting that business. At start of the year, we had made shutdown decisions on all EWC nuclear plants, and we had a agreement in place to sell Vermont Yankee, a first of its kind transaction. Since then, we completed the sale of our Vermont Yankee and we announced agreements to sell Pilgrim and Palisades. The Vermont Yankee transaction is an important milestone, not only for our strategy to completely divest our nuclear assets, but also for the nuclear decommissioning industry. It establishes a model for the sale of nuclear plants post-shutdown, which benefits the industry and key stakeholders by accelerating the decommissioning time line, drawing on industry-leading decommissioning and site expertise and experience and laying the foundation for future business development opportunities in the regions.
We're also making progress on the sale of Pilgrimâ€™s to Holtec. Holtec submitted its post-shutdown decommissioning activity report to the NRC, and we submitted the license transfer application. We will shut down Pilgrim no later than May 31, and we expect to close on the sale of that plant by the end of the year.
Since announcing our intent to exit the merchant business, our progress has been deliberate and on the mark. We sold 5 facilities to Ventures, the Rhode Island State Energy Center and 2 nuclear plants, leaving EWC with 3 nuclear plants. We have agreements in place to sell 2 of those, and we are now actively working toward a post-shutdown sale of the third Indian Point. All of this work and success significantly advances our clear strategy to transition to a pure-play utility.
This past year, we also saw solid achievements at our core utility business. At the Analyst Day, we demonstrated our ability to successfully execute our plan to improve technology across our business. Our disciplined capital projects management organization and rigorous processes give us confidence that we can grow the business through investment that benefit not only our customers, but all our stakeholders.
These investments are important because they help sustain and modernize our system, provide lower production cost and lower carbon emission rates, enhance reliability, support customer growth, bring jobs and economic development of our communities and provide opportunities for our employees.
Our newbuild CCGT projects remain on budget and on schedule with the St. Charles power stations related to be in service in mid-2019. We also received regulatory approval from Louisiana Public Service Commission for the acquisition of Washington Parish Energy Center, and we expect to close on that plant in 2021. More recently, we entered into an agreement to acquire the Choctaw Generating Station in Mississippi. We've clear review on Scott Levine and have requested approval from the Mississippi Public Service Commission.
We will also be requesting approval from the FERC in near future, and we expect to complete the transaction by the end of 2019. We continue to make progress on adding the new build generation to our portfolio. We are committed to providing our customers with renewable power options, which are playing an increasingly important role in our resource planning.
We have approximately 1,000 megawatts of renewables in various stages of development, and specific projects, include 2 solar PPAs in Arkansas totaling 100 and 80 megawatts, one of which is operational; and 100-megawatt utilities to gain solar project at Entergy Mississippi; 3 utility scale solar projects for Entergy New Orleans totaling 90 megawatts; multiple rooftop solar projects in New Orleans totaling 5 megawatts; and a 15 megawatts solar project selected in Entergy Louisiana as a renewable Each of these projects is in process, and we're in-service range from 2019 to 2022. Entergy Arkansas recently announced its intent to issue a solar RMP. The company is interested in procuring up to 200 megawatts of solar PV resources through an asset acquisition.
Renewables are an important resource beyond their obvious environmental They can provide cost-effective energy supply, fuel diversity and advance the adoption of distributed energy solutions for our customers. As the economics, performance and reliability of these resources improve, we will continue to engage with the regulators and stakeholders to solve technical challenges associated with the expanding the use of renewable energy across our service area.
Last month, we hit an important and very exciting milestone in our AMI deployment plan with the installation of the first meters. We will install approximately 3 million automated meters across our jurisdictions, with plan to activate 1 million new meters in 2019. We are pleased with this progress, especially in light of the benefits this technology will provide our customers from faster outage restoration to enhance customer service and cost-savings. Additionally, with these meeters, we'll have more tools to help our customers manage their energy usage and lower their bills.
AMI will also serve as a foundation for future customer solutions as we evolve from being a supplier to a partner with our customers. We are excited about this next chapter, and our actively studying other opportunities to prepare our distribution system for the future. We will provide an updates on our progress when appropriate.
Successful execution also includes our nuclear operations. In 2016, we rolled out our 5-year road map to invest in our people, our clients and our processes to achieve operational excellence. Today, we have about halfway through that journey and our performance to date is in line with our expectations. In 2018, we realized an important milestone when AMI returns to Column 1 of the reactor oversight process metrics. As planned, we expect Pilgrim to also return to Column 1 this quarter.
These adjusted fuel stations of the many investments that we're making to develop an efficient, sustainable, electric-generating and delivery system for our customers. We also had an active regulatory calendar last year with proceedings in each of our jurisdictions. It started with tax reform. And customers are now seeing benefits in their bills. We work with our retail regulators and result return of more than $1 billion of benefits to customers. And we were able to return the benefits on an expedited basis.
This not only helped our customers, but also provided financial clarity, which was important to solidify our credit as illustrated by Moody's moving our outlook to stable in November. Entergy Louisiana extended and modified its formula rate plan to include a new mechanism to recover incremental transmission investments 8 months beyond any historic test year. In the fourth quarter, we resolved 2 base rate proceedings. The Public Utility Commission of Texas the rate case, which was a good step toward improving earnings and returns in the jurisdiction in the near term. The Arkansas Public Service Commission approved our partial settlement in the annual forward test year FRP and the new rates are now effective. And Entergy New Orleans rate case is still ongoing and is expected to be completed by August of this year.
In addition, we recently filed legislation in Texas could help reduce regulatory lag on generational investment in that jurisdiction. If passed, it would allow the commission to approve the to recover reasonable and necessary generational investment, which would be more timely and less burdensome on a base rate case filing. This legislation is consistent with our desire to align regulatory structures with customer benefits.
Overall, the resolution will be achieved on all of the regulatory matters we undertook last year provides clarity to our plans and solidifies the financial commitments we've made.
At Entergy, we are dedicated to sustainability efforts. Once again, we're named to the Dow Jones Sustainability North America index, which measures performance in economic, environmental and social dimensions against industry peers around the globe.
We are on top scores in areas of policy employed climate strategy, water-related risks and corporate citizenship and philanthropy. This is the 17th consecutive year Entergy has been included on either the world or North American index or both.
We were recognized by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation who named Entergy in it's 2018 Corporate Citizenship Awards in the Best Economic Empowerment Program category. The world recognized Entergy's 5-year, $5 million workforce ready initiative aimed at promoting economic development for communities throughout our service region.
And Entergy creating a diverse and increasing workplace is one of our shared values, we are committed to leveraging the richness of a diverse workforce. In recognition of our efforts, Black Enterprise magazine has recognized Entergy as one of its 2018 50 Best Companies for Diversity. The list highlights companies that champion professional inclusion of people from all races and demographic groups. This is the fifth consecutive year that we've been included on that list.
2018 has been another successful year for us. We executed on our strategy, and we expect 2019 will be no different. Our operating and financial positions are solid, and our strategic direction is clear. Today, we are very different company than we were just a few years ago. We are a simpler company and a stronger company for the benefit of all our stakeholders. We have an industry that -- we are industry leader in critical measures of sustainability.
We have among the lowest rates in the United States. We had operate one of the cleanest large-scale fleets in the country. We operate in the region that benefits from strong industrial growth. We invest in our employees to create a workforce for the future. We have recognized as a socially responsible growth engine for our communities. And our aspirations for customers are aligned with the goals of regulators. These attributes alone make Entergy a compelling long-term investment today. But this is also the foundation on which we will grow, innovate and expand our investment profile for tomorrow.
We will invest in new technologies and new revenue streams that offer promising returns for our owners. We will embrace innovations and will transition as from energy provider to delivering new outcomes in solutions that our customers want.
We will continue to promote the well-being of our communities by partnering to improve education, eradicate poverty and protect the environment. And we will remain at the forefront of our industry's efforts to address climate issues, while also maintaining reliable and economic service for our customers.
We are in the early days of our industry's transformation. Innovation is changing how we see the future of our industry, a future that offers a significant opportunity for continued long-term growth, and we are well positioned to lead the way. I'll now turn the call over to Drew, will provide more detail on our 2018 financial results, 2019 guidance under our new single measure and our 3-year outlook."

And as Leo stated, we are reporting strong results for another successful year.

And as Leo stated, we are reporting strong results for another successful year. We executed on all our planned deliverables and this progress is reflected in our financial performance. the Utility on an adjusted view, we ended the year in line with our expectations. And for Entergy consolidated, we exceeded our expectations for the year.
We are pleased with these results and we look forward to continuing this momentum into 2019. For the next few minutes, I'll review the results of fourth quarter and then the full year we're also rushing 2019 guidance and 3-year outlook under our new Entergy adjusted measure.
Starting with the quarter, on Slide 6. Our adjusted Utility, Parent & Other earnings were $0.04 higher than fourth quarter 2017. The key driver was lower O&M, driven by lower nuclear cost this quarter. Also contributing to the increase were favorable base rate action. Partially offsetting these drivers, were regulatory provisions were 2 items, I highlighted a few on the last earnings call.
First, the $25 million refund Entergy Texas customers from the lower tax rate, retroactive to January 2018. And second, because Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Mississippi performed above expectations, thus the future true ups results amount due back to customers. We've accrued those in 2019.
We also have lower income tax expense and higher depreciation expense. Before we move on, I'd like to point out that starting next quarter, we will revert back to our variances on an EPS basis only since the statutory tax rate period-over-period will be the same again. This will simplify our variance going forward.
Moving to EWC on Slide 7. Operational earnings decreased to $1.22 from the year-ago. This was largely the result of lower returns on decommissioning trust investments during the quarter, and to a lesser extent, lower net revenue from lower nuclear volume. Lower O&M and lower income taxes help partially offset the decrease.
On Slide 8, operating cash flow in the quarter was $526 million, $385 million lower than a year ago. The decrease is primarily due to the return of the unprotected excess ADIT to customers of Utility as well as net revenue and higher severance retention cost to EWC.
Now turning to full year, on Slide 9. Consolidated operational earnings for 2018 were $7.21 per share, higher than the $7.20 per share in 2017. These results exceeded our guidance range, primarily due to favorable weather and favorable O&M and EWC. We also had tax items and losses on EWC decommissioning trusts that mostly offset each other. Excluding these items, results would have been firmly within our guidance range.
UP&O adjusted EPS on Slide 10 was $4.71 in 2010, $0.14 higher than 2017. The increase in 2018 was due largely to base rate actions. This increase is partly offset by higher O&M other operating expenses as well as higher interest expense at Pam. We also have lower income tax expenses as a result of lower federal income tax rate, which is offsetting net revenue. Size 7 summarizes EWC operational earnings, which decreased $2.22 year-over-year. Losses on the decommissioning trust on investments are less favorable income tax items in 2018 as compared to a year ago were key drivers.
Lower net revenue from lower prices and lower volume also contributed. Partially offsetting these decreases were favorable depreciation decommissioning expenses. year 2018, operating cash flow shown on Slide 12, was approximately $2.4 billion in 2018, $239 million lower than last year. Our main driver was a return of unprotected excess ADIT to customers, which reduced cash flow approximately $600 million.
Lower net revenue at EWC was also a driver. Favorable weather at Utility and lower severance and retention payment at EWC, partially offset the decrease. Moving to Slide 13, as I mentioned last quarter, with the progress we made on our strategy to exit our EWC business and transition to a pure play utility, we are moving to a single, simpler measure that better results -- better reflects the nature of our business going forward.
Today, we are initiating our new Entergy adjusted EPS guidance at 3-year outlook. The new measure excludes all of our EWC earnings and a similar to our previous UP&O adjusted measures with the following instructions. We now exclude large tax items as opposed to normalizing statutory tax rate. And we no longer normalize effective weather.
While we have not changed our views on the underlying business, our Entergy adjusted guidance is higher than our previous adjusted disclosure. The change is only attributable to our expectations for lower than statutory tax rates in those years. The lower tax rates are created by the return of protected, excess ADIT and EWC from significant capital investments we're making at our core business to benefit our customers.
The effective tax rate is lower in 2019 versus '20 and '21, primarily due to higher AFUDC in 2019. A reconciliation of the UP&O adjusted measure to the new Entergy adjusted measure can be found in our appendix. Starting next quarter, we will report actual results under this Entergy adjusted measure only under disclosures will be revised accordingly.
The Entergy adjusted guidance range is $5.10 to $5.50, the midpoint of $5.30. I would note that this is the same midpoint we showed insured at our Analyst Day in 2016, except for the 27 improvement related to the lower effective tax rate.
On Slide 13, you will also see a few of the key drivers for 2019 guidance. Starting on the top line, our projected sales volume in 2019 is expected to increase about 1% year-over-year, driven by strong industrial sales of approximately 2.5% to 3%. We continue to expect volatility from quarter-to-quarter, but slightly positive residential sales in the first half the year turning slightly relative to the second half of the year as advanced meters go in service.
Additionally, a full year of 2018 rate activity at Arkansas, Louisiana and Texas contribute to 2019 results, along with the 2019 FRP filings in Mississippi and Louisiana. Recovery of the power stations is expected to begin Madeira when the plan goes in-service. The project on few O&M to be approximately $2.7 billion, which represents a 3% increase -- about the 3% increase compared to 2018. This reflects our ongoing capital intensive construction plan, which create higher spending on fossil and transmission operations. We expect 2019 to be the last year for incremental nuclear hiring under our nuclear strategic plan, and there are a few costs anticipated for cyber security, grid modernization and customer initiatives makes for a new technologies and services building off of our platform.
We expect other expenses, such as the depreciation, interest and property taxes to increase as we continue to make productive investments to benefit our customers and our communities. And 2019, also assumes normal weather and no income tax planning items at the Utility. Finally, the result of settling a portion of our equity in late 2018 and the remainder planned for second quarter 2019, we expect dilution of approximately $0.35.
Even though EWC's results are excluded from the Entergy adjusted EPS guidance, we will continue to provide our expectations for EWC's financial performance through 2022. This information can be found in the appendix of our webcast presentation.
I also like to give us an update on our cash position at EWC. While the weak market performance led to lower returns on our nuclear decommissioning trust funds investment in fourth quarter 2018, we still expect EWC to revise positive net cash to parent from 2019 through 2022. And this includes our current view of potential decommissioning trust contributions. Additionally, we continue our efforts to reduce risk at EWC. We have rebalanced EWC's decommissioning product trust portfolio that we eliminated we expect equity market exposure. Programs along with the close of the VY sale earlier this year are notable steps in our transition to a pure play utility.
Moving to a longer-term view on Slide 14, you will see our 2020 and 2021 outlooks have been updated to reflect the new measure. And as I previously mentioned, our longer-term view of our business is not changed. We continue to target a 5% to 7% growth rate for adjusted earnings. Finally, our cash and credit metrics as of the end of the year are shown on Slide 15. Our parent debt to total debt ratio has improved to 22.6%. This is largely due to the settlement of a portion of our equity in December. Our operational effort is 12%, but this includes the effect of returning $600 million of unprotected excess ADIT to customers. Excluding this giveback, operational FFO to debt would be 15.3%.
As I noted in previous calls, we remain committed to our target ranges at or above 15% FFO to debt and below 25% for parent debt-to-total debt as well as maintaining our investment-grade profile. Additionally, we continue to derisk strong balance sheet by managing our pension liability. 2018 pension obligation is lower by almost $600 million from last year, and we've lowered our return asset expectation by 25 basis points for 2019.
As a reflection of these collective efforts, Moody's upgraded our outlook to stable in November. 2018 is another year of strong results, and we are proud what we accomplished. We made significant progress in our exit of the EWC business and we continue to execute on our customer-centric investment plan at Utility. As we've stated, we are committed to creating sustainable value for our customers, employees, communities and owners. I look forward to another successful year in 2019.
And now, the Entergy team is available to answer questions."

In fact, that's one of the things they decided to run positive is that we're getting that behind us, so that you can't see our FFO to debt measure move higher, more quickly instead of out. When we discussed it with them the expectation was that if even have to deal with this on an ongoing basis, how we're recalculating it to show you the effect of it back to 15% in the material today. And we had to do that an ongoing basis. It will be much harder for them to get comfortable with our outlook. So they are very comfortable with it.

And that was very helpful in terms of giving this more comforts towards our expectation of keeping that cash outlook. We've also continue to find ways to manage our O&M and capital costs.

So that's going to be kind of dribbling out over time. That's really the source of one of the 2 sources of the effective -- the lower effective tax rate, and that is going directly back to customers over time. And then in the that is AFUDC is recognized by books, is not recognized by tax, so that's just a structural element that's in there associated with that. That will get reflected in rate base ultimately. But those are the 2 main drivers of the positive change in the effective tax rate. And of course, when we are defining tax items, we are not including those in our numbers going forward, but often we are working with the retail regulators to share those benefits with customers.

Today, we are reporting strong results for another successful year of significant accomplishments. For our core Utility, Parent & Other business, adjusted EPS were in line with our guidance and growth expectations and our consolidated operational earnings came in above our guidance range. A year ago, I told you that the foundation for our success in 2018 was largely in place, and we laid out what we needed to do to stay on track to achieve our outlooks and aspirations. We've checked off every deliverable on that list as well as a few more and our success keeps us firmly on track to achieve our strategic and financial objectives in 2019 and beyond.
As a result, we raised our dividend for a fourth consecutive year, a trend we expect to continue, subject as always to approval of our board. At EWC, we made important progress toward exiting that business. At the start of the year, we had made shutdown decisions on all EWC nuclear plants, and we had an agreement in place to sell Vermont Yankee, a first of its kind transaction. Since then, we completed the sale of Vermont Yankee and we announced agreements to sell Pilgrim and Palisades. 
The Vermont Yankee transaction is an important milestone, not only for our strategy to completely divest our merchant nuclear assets, but also for the nuclear decommissioning industry. It establishes a model for the sale of nuclear plants post-shutdown, which benefits the industry and key stakeholders by accelerating the decommissioning time line, drawing on industry-leading decommissioning and site remediation expertise and experience and laying the foundation for future business development opportunities in the region.  
We're also making progress on the sale of Pilgrim to Holtec. Holtec submitted its post-shutdown decommissioning activity report to the NRC and we submitted the license transfer application. We will shut down Pilgrim no later than May 31, and we expect to close on the sale of that plant by the end of the year.
Since announcing our intent to exit the merchant business, our progress has been deliberate and on the mark. We've sold 5 facilities to Wind Ventures, the Rhode Island State Energy Center and 2 nuclear plants, leaving EWC with 3 nuclear plants. We have agreements in place to sell 2 of those, and we are now actively working toward a post-shutdown sale of the third, Indian Point. All of this work and success significantly advances our clear strategy to transition to a pure-play utility. 
This past year, we also saw solid achievements at our core Utility business. At the Analyst Day, we demonstrated our ability to successfully execute our plan to improve technology across our business. Our disciplined capital projects management organization and rigorous processes give us confidence that we can grow the business through investments that benefit not only our customers, but all our stakeholders.  These investments are important because they help sustain and modernize our system, provide lower production cost and lower carbon emission rates, enhance reliability, support customer growth, bring jobs and economic development of our communities and provide opportunities for our employees.
Our new build CCGT projects remain on budget and on schedule with the St. Charles Power Station slated to be in service in mid-2019. We also received regulatory approval from Louisiana Public Service Commission for the acquisition of Washington Parish Energy Center, and we expect to close on that plant in 2021. More recently, we entered into an agreement to acquire the Choctaw Generating Station in Mississippi. We have cleared review under Hart-Scott-Rodino and have requested approval from the Mississippi Public Service Commission.  We will also be requesting approval from the FERC in the near future, and we expect to complete the transaction by the end of 2019. 
We continue to make progress on adding renewable generation to our portfolio. We are committed to providing our customers with renewable power options, which are playing an increasingly important role in our resource planning.  We have approximately 1,000 megawatts of renewables in various stages of development, and specific projects, include 2 solar PPAs in Arkansas totaling 180 megawatts, one of which is operational; a 100-megawatt utility scale to gain solar project at Entergy Mississippi; 3 utility scale solar projects for Entergy New Orleans totaling 90 megawatts; multiple rooftop solar projects in New Orleans totaling 5 megawatts; and a 15-megawatt solar project selected in Entergy Louisiana as renewable RFP.  Each of these projects is in process, and are in-service stage range from 2019 to 2022.  Entergy Arkansas recently announced its intent to issue a solar RFP. The company is interested in procuring up to 200 megawatts of solar PV resources through an asset acquisition.
Renewables are an important resource beyond their obvious environmental attributes. They can provide cost-effective energy supply, fuel diversity and advance the adoption of distributed energy solutions for our customers. As the economics, performance and reliability of these resources improve, we will continue to engage with our regulators and stakeholders to solve technical challenges associated with expanding the use of renewable energy across our service area.
Last month, we hit an important and very exciting milestone in our AMI deployment plan with the installation of the first meters. We will install approximately 3 million automated meters across our jurisdictions, with plans to activate 1 million new meters in 2019. We are pleased with this progress, especially in light of the benefits this technology will provide our customers from faster outage restoration to enhanced customer service and cost-savings. Additionally, with these meters, we'll have more tools to help our customers manage their energy usage and lower their bills.  
AMI will also serve as a foundation for future customer solutions as we evolve from being a supplier to a partner with our customers. We are excited about this next chapter, and are actively studying other opportunities to prepare our distribution system for the future. We will provide updates on our progress when appropriate.
Successful execution also includes our nuclear operations. In 2016, we rolled out our 5-year road map to invest in our people, our plants and our processes to achieve operational excellence. Today, we are about halfway through that journey and our performance to-date is in line with our expectations. In 2018, we realized an important milestone when ANO returned to Column 1 of the Reactor Oversight Process Matrix. As planned, we expect Pilgrim to also return to Column 1 this quarter.  These are just a few illustrations of the many investments that we're making to develop an efficient, sustainable, electric-generating and delivery system for our customers. 
We also had an active regulatory calendar last year with proceedings in each of our jurisdictions. It started with tax reform. And customers are now seeing benefits in their bills. We worked with our retail regulators and resolved the return of more than $1 billion of benefits to customers. And we were able to return the benefits on an expedited basis.  This not only helped our customers, but also provided financial clarity, which was important to solidify our credit as illustrated by Moody's moving our outlook to stable in November. 
Entergy Louisiana extended and modified its formula rate plan to include a new mechanism to recover incremental transmission investments 8 months beyond any historic test year. In the fourth quarter, we resolved 2 base rate proceedings. The Public Utility Commission of Texas approved the rate case, which was a good step toward improving earnings and returns in that jurisdiction in the near term. The Arkansas Public Service Commission approved our partial settlement in the annual forward test year FRP and new rates are now effective. And Entergy New Orleans rate case is still ongoing and is expected to be completed by August of this year.
In addition, recently filed legislation in Texas could help reduce regulatory lag on generation investment in that jurisdiction. If passed, it would allow the Commission to approve a rider to recover reasonable and necessary generation investment, which would be more timely and less burdensome on a base rate case filing. This legislation is consistent with our desire to align regulatory structures with customer benefits.  Overall, the resolution we achieved on all of the regulatory matters we undertook last year provides clarity to our plans and solidifies the financial commitments we've made.
At Entergy, we are dedicated to sustainability efforts. Once again, we were named to the Dow Jones Sustainability North American Index, which measures performance in economic, environmental and social dimensions against industry peers around the globe.  We earned top scores in areas of policy employed, climate strategy, water-related risks and corporate citizenship and philanthropy. This is the 17th consecutive year Entergy has been included on either the world or North American index or both.
We are recognized by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation who named Entergy a finalist in its 2018 Corporate Citizenship Awards in the Best Economic Empowerment Program category. The award recognized Entergy's 5-year, $5 million workforce-ready initiative aimed at promoting economic development for communities throughout our service region.  And Entergy creating a diverse and inclusive increasing workplace is one of our shared values, we are committed to leveraging the richness of a diverse workforce. In recognition of our efforts, Black Enterprise Magazine has recognized Entergy as one of its 2018 50 Best Companies for Diversity. The list highlights companies that champion professional inclusion of people from all races and demographic groups. This is the fifth consecutive year that we've been included on that list.  
2018 has been another successful year for us. We executed on our strategy, and we expect 2019 will be no different. Our operating and financial positions are solid, and our strategic direction is clear. Today, we are a very different company than we were just a few years ago. We're a simpler company and a stronger company for the benefit of all our stakeholders. 
We are an industry leader in critical measures of sustainability.  We have among the lowest rates in the United States. We operate one of the cleanest large-scale fleets in the country. We operate in a region that benefits from strong industrial growth. We invest in our employees to create a workforce for the future. We are recognized as a socially responsible growth engine for our communities. And our aspirations for our customers are aligned with the goals of regulators. These attributes alone make Entergy a compelling long-term investment today. 
But this is also the foundation on which we will grow, innovate and expand our investment profile for tomorrow.  We will invest in new technologies and new revenue streams that offer promising returns for our owners. We will embrace innovations that will transition us from energy provider to delivering new outcomes and solutions that our customers want.
We will continue to promote the well-being of our communities by partnering to improve education, eradicate poverty and protect the environment. And we will remain at the forefront of our industry's efforts to address climate issues, while also maintaining reliable and economic service for our customers.
We are in the early days of our industry's transformation. Innovation is changing how we see the future of our industry, a future that offers a significant opportunity for continued long-term growth, and we are well positioned to lead the way. 
I will now turn the call over to Drew, who will provide more detail on our 2018 financial results, 2019 guidance under our new single measure and our 3-year outlook."

We executed on all our planned deliverables and this progress is reflected in our financial performance. The Utility, Parent & Other, on an adjusted view, we ended the year in line with our expectations, and for Entergy consolidated, we exceeded our expectations for the year.  We are pleased with these results and we look forward to continuing this momentum into 2019.  For the next few minutes, I'll review the results of the fourth quarter and then the full year, while also issuing 2019 guidance and a 3-year outlook under our new Entergy adjusted measure.
Starting with the quarter. On Slide 6, our adjusted Utility, Parent & Other earnings were $0.04 higher than fourth quarter 2017. The key driver was lower non-fuel O&M, driven by lower nuclear cost this quarter. Also contributing to the increase were favorable base rate actions. Partially offsetting these drivers, were regulatory provisions were 2 items, I highlighted a few on the last earnings call.
First, the $25 million refund to Entergy Texas customers from the lower tax rate, retroactive till January 2018. And second, because Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Mississippi performed above expectations such that future true ups resulting amounts due back to customers. We have accrued those in 2019.  We also had lower income tax expense and higher depreciation expense. Before we move on, I'd like to point out that starting next quarter, we will revert back to showing our variances on an EPS basis only since the statutory tax rate period-over-period will be the same again. This will simplify our variance thesis going forward.
Moving to EWC on Slide 7. Operational earnings decreased $1.22 from year ago. This was largely result of lower returns on decommissioning trust investments during the quarter, and to a lesser extent, lower net revenue from lower nuclear volume. Lower non-fuel O&M and lower income taxes helped partially offset the decrease.
On Slide 8, operating cash flow in the quarter was $526 million, $385 million lower than a year ago. The decrease is primarily due to the return of the unprotected excess ADIT to customers at Utility as well as net revenue and higher severance retention cost at EWC.
Now turning to full year, on Slide 9. Consolidated operational earnings for 2018 were $7.21 per share, higher than the $7.20 per share in 2017. These results exceeded our guidance range, primarily due to favorable weather and favorable non-fuel O&M at EWC. We also had tax items and losses on EWC decommissioning trust that mostly offset each other. Excluding these items, results would have been firmly within our guidance range.
UP&O adjusted EPS on Slide 10 was $4.71 in 2010, $0.14 higher than 2017. The increase in 2018 was due largely to base rate actions. This increase is partly offset by higher non-fuel O&M and other operating expenses as well as higher interest expense at Parent. We also have lower income tax expenses as a result of lower federal income tax rate, which is offsetting net revenue. 
Slide 7 (sic)[ Slide 11 ] summarizes EWC operational earnings, which decreased $2.22 year-over-year. Losses on the decommissioning trust on investments and less favorable income tax items in 2018 as compared to a year ago were key drivers.  Lower net revenue from lower prices and lower volume also contributed. Partially offsetting these decreases were favorable depreciation and decommissioning expenses. 
Full year 2018 operating cash flow shown on Slide 12, was approximately $2.4 billion in 2018, $239 million lower than last year. Our main driver was a return of the unprotected excess ADIT to customers, which reduced cash flow approximately $600 million.  Lower net revenue at EWC was also a driver. Favorable weather at Utility and lower severance and retention payments at EWC partially offset the decrease. 
Moving to Slide 13. As I mentioned last quarter, with the progress we've made on our strategy to exit our EWC business and transition to a pure-play utility, we are moving to a single, simpler measure that better reflects the nature of our business going forward.  Today, we are initiating our new Entergy adjusted EPS guidance and 3-year outlook. The new measure excludes all of our EWC earnings and similar to our previous UP&O adjusted measures with the following exceptions. We now exclude large tax items as opposed to normalizing to a statutory tax rate. And we no longer normalize the effective weather.  While we have not changed our views on the underlying business, our Entergy adjusted guidance is higher than our previous UP&O adjusted disclosure. The change is only attributable to our expectation for lower than statutory tax rates in those years. The lower tax rates are created by the return of protected excess ADIT and AFUDC from the significant capital investments we're making at our core business to benefit our customers.  The effective tax rate is lower in 2019 versus '20 and '21, primarily due to higher AFUDC in 2019. 
A reconciliation of the UP&O adjusted measure to the new Entergy adjusted measure can be found in our appendix. Starting next quarter, we will report actual results under this Entergy adjusted measure only and our disclosures will be revised accordingly.  The Entergy adjusted guidance range is $5.10 to $5.50 with a midpoint of $5.30. I will note that this is the same midpoint we showed at our Analyst Day in 2016, except for the $0.20 improvement related to the lower effective tax rate.
On Slide 13, you will also see a few of the key drivers for 2019 guidance. Starting on the top line, our projected sales volume in 2019 is expected to increase about 1% year-over-year, driven by strong industrial sales of approximately 2.5% to 3%. We continue to expect volatility from quarter-to-quarter, with slightly positive residential sales in the first half of the year turning slightly relative from the second half of the year as advanced meters go in service.
Additionally, a full year of 2018 rate activity at Arkansas, Louisiana and Texas contribute to 2019's results along with the 2019 FRP filings in Mississippi and Louisiana. Recovery of the St. Charles Power Station is expected to begin mid-year when the plant goes in-service. We project non-fuel O&M to be approximately $2.7 billion, which represents a 3% increase -- about the 3% increase compared to 2018. This reflects our ongoing capital intensive construction plan, which creates higher spending on fossil and transmission operations. 
We expect 2019 to be the last year for incremental nuclear hiring under our nuclear strategic plan, and there are a few costs anticipated for cybersecurity, grid modernization and customer initiatives and then explore new technologies and services building off of our AMI platform.  We expect other expenses, such as the depreciation, interest and property taxes to increase as we continue to make productive investments to benefit our customers and our communities. And 2019, also assumes normal weather and no income tax planning items at the Utility. 
Finally, the result of settling a portion of our equity forward into late 2018 and remainder planned for second quarter 2019, we expect dilution of approximately $0.35.  Even though EWC's results are excluded from the Entergy adjusted EPS guidance, we will continue to provide our expectations for EWC's financial performance through 2022. This information can be found in the appendix of our webcast presentation.
I'd also like to give us an update on our cash position at EWC. While weak market performance led to low returns on our nuclear decommissioning trust investments in fourth quarter 2018, we still expect EWC to revise positive net cash to parent from 2019 through 2022. And this includes our current view of potential decommissioning trust contributions. Additionally, we continue our efforts to reduce risk at EWC. We have rebalanced EWC decommissioning product trust portfolio such that we eliminated it's equity market exposure. Programs derisk NDT along with the close of the VY sale earlier this year are notable steps in our transition to a pure-play utility.
Moving to the longer-term view on Slide 14, you will see our 2020 and 2021 outlooks have been updated to reflect the new measure. And as I previously mentioned, our longer-term view of our business is not changed. We continue to target a 5% to 7% growth rate for adjusted earnings. 
Finally, our cash and credit metrics as of the end of the year are shown on Slide 15. Our parent debt to total debt ratio has improved to 22.6%. This was largely due to the settlement of a portion of our equity forward in December. Our operational FFO to debt is 12%, but this includes the effects of returning $600 million of unprotected excess ADIT to customers. Excluding this giveback, operational FFO to debt would be 15.3%.  As I've noted on previous calls, we remain committed to our target ranges at or above 15% for FFO to debt and below 25% for parent debt-to-total debt as well as maintaining our investment-grade profile. 
Additionally, we continue to derisk our balance sheet by managing our pension liability. 2018 pension obligation is lower by almost $600 million from last year and we've lowered our return on assets expectation by 25 basis points for 2019.  As a reflection of these collective efforts, Moody's upgraded our outlook to stable in November. 
2018 was another year of strong results, and we are proud of what we accomplished. We made significant progress in our exit of the EWC business and we continue to execute on our customer-centric investment plan at Utility. As we have stated, we are committed to creating sustainable value for our customers, employees, communities and owners, and look forward to another successful year in 2019.

That's one of the strategies that we employed to help keep our customer rate flow. And one of the drivers, of course, is the protected excess ADIT, which is basically money that's going back to customers we collected over time for the higher tax rate in previous years. So that's going to be kind of dribbling out over time. That's really the source of -- or 1 of the 2 sources of the effective -- the low effective tax rate, and that is going directly back to customers over time. And then the AFUDC piece, that is -- AFUDC is recognized by books, is not recognized by tax, so that's just a structural element that's in there associated with that. That will get reflected in rate base ultimately. But those are the 2 main drivers of the positive change in the effective tax rate. And of course, when we are defining tax items, we are not including those in our numbers going forward, but often we are working with retail regulators to share those benefits with customers. And as we do that, those money we follow back to customers as well."

Today, we are reporting strong results for another successful year of significant accomplishments.

Today, we are reporting strong results for another successful year of significant accomplishments. For our core Utility, Parent & Other business, adjusted EPS were in line with our guidance and growth expectations and our consolidated operational earnings came in above our guidance range. A year ago, I told you that the foundation for our success in 2018 was largely in place, and we laid out what we needed to do to stay on track to achieve our outlooks and aspirations. We've checked off every deliverable on that list as well as a few more and our success keeps us firmly on track to achieve our strategic and financial objectives in 2019 and beyond.
As a result, we raised our dividend for a fourth consecutive year, a trend we expect to continue, subject as always to approval of our board. At EWC, we made important progress toward exiting that business. At the start of the year, we had made shutdown decisions on all EWC nuclear plants, and we had an agreement in place to sell Vermont Yankee, a first-of-its-kind transaction. Since then, we completed the sale of Vermont Yankee and we announced agreements to sell Pilgrim and Palisades. 
The Vermont Yankee transaction is an important milestone, not only for our strategy to completely divest our merchant nuclear assets, but also for the nuclear decommissioning industry. It establishes a model for the sale of nuclear plants post-shutdown, which benefits the industry and key stakeholders by accelerating the decommissioning time line, drawing on industry-leading decommissioning and site remediation expertise and experience and laying the foundation for future business development opportunities in the regions.
We're also making progress on the sale of Pilgrim to Holtec. Holtec submitted its post-shutdown decommissioning activity report to the NRC and we submitted the license transfer application. We will shut down Pilgrim no later than May 31, and we expect to close on the sale of that plant by the end of the year.
Since announcing our intent to exit the merchant business, our progress has been deliberate and on the mark. We've sold 5 facilities to Wind Ventures, the Rhode Island State Energy Center and 2 nuclear plants, leaving EWC with 3 nuclear plants. We have agreements in place to sell 2 of those, and we are now actively working toward a post-shutdown sale of the third, Indian Point. All of this work and success significantly advances our clear strategy to transition to a pure-play utility. 
This past year, we also saw solid achievements at our core Utility business. At Analyst Day, we demonstrated our ability to successfully execute our plan to improve technology across our business. Our disciplined capital projects management organization and rigorous processes give us confidence that we can grow the business through investments that benefit not only our customers, but all our stakeholders. These investments are important because they help sustain and modernize our system, provide lower production cost and lower carbon emission rates, enhance reliability, support customer growth, bring jobs and economic development to our communities and provide opportunities for our employees.
Our new build CCGT projects remain on budget and on schedule with the St. Charles Power Station slated to be in service in mid-2019. We also received regulatory approval from Louisiana Public Service Commission for the acquisition of Washington Parish Energy Center, and we expect to close on that plant in 2021. More recently, we entered into an agreement to acquire the Choctaw Generating Station in Mississippi. We have cleared review under Hart-Scott-Rodino and have requested approval from the Mississippi Public Service Commission. We will also be requesting approval from the FERC in the near future, and we expect to complete the transaction by the end of 2019. 
We continue to make progress on adding renewable generation to our portfolio. We are committed to providing our customers with renewable power options, which are playing an increasingly important role in our resource planning. We have approximately 1,000 megawatts of renewables in various stages of development, and specific projects include 2 solar PPAs in Arkansas, totaling 180 megawatts, one of which is operational; a 100-megawatt utility scale to gain solar project at Entergy Mississippi; 3 utility scale solar projects for Entergy New Orleans totaling 90 megawatts; multiple rooftop solar projects in New Orleans totaling 5 megawatts; and a 15-megawatt solar project selected in Entergy Louisiana's renewable RFP. Each of these projects is in process, and their in-service dates range from 2019 to 2022.  Entergy Arkansas recently announced its intent to issue a solar RFP. The company is interested in procuring up to 200 megawatts of solar PV resources through an asset acquisition.
Renewables are an important resource beyond their obvious environmental attributes. They can provide cost-effective energy supply, fuel diversity and advance the adoption of distributed energy solutions for our customers. As the economics, performance and reliability of these resources improve, we will continue to engage with our regulators and stakeholders to solve technical challenges associated with expanding the use of renewable energy across our service area.
Last month, we hit an important and very exciting milestone in our AMI deployment plan with the installation of the first meters. We will install approximately 3 million automated meters across our jurisdictions, with plans to activate 1 million new meters in 2019. We are pleased with this progress, especially in light of the benefits this technology will provide our customers from faster outage restoration to enhanced customer service and cost-savings. Additionally, with these meters, we'll have more tools to help our customers manage their energy usage and lower their bills.  
AMI will also serve as a foundation for future customer solutions as we evolve from being a supplier to a partner with our customers. We are excited about this next chapter and are actively studying other opportunities to prepare our distribution system for the future. We will provide updates on our progress when appropriate.
Successful execution also includes our nuclear operations. In 2016, we rolled out our 5-year road map to invest in our people, our plants and our processes to achieve operational excellence. Today, we are about halfway through that journey and our performance to-date is in line with our expectations. In 2018, we realized an important milestone when ANO returned to Column 1 of the Reactor Oversight Process Matrix. As planned, we expect Pilgrim to also return to Column 1 this quarter. These are just a few illustrations of the many investments that we're making to develop an efficient, sustainable, electric-generating and delivery system for our customers. 
We also had an active regulatory calendar last year with proceedings in each of our jurisdictions. It started with tax reform, and customers are now seeing benefits in their bills. We worked with our retail regulators and resolved the return of more than $1 billion of benefits to customers. And we were able to return the benefits on an expedited basis. This not only helped our customers, but also provided financial clarity, which was important to solidify our credit as illustrated by Moody's moving our outlook to stable in November. 
Entergy Louisiana extended and modified its formula rate plan to include a new mechanism to recover incremental transmission investments 8 months beyond any historic test year. In the fourth quarter, we resolved 2 base rate proceedings. The Public Utility Commission of Texas approved the rate case, which was a good step toward improving earnings and returns in that jurisdiction in the near term. The Arkansas Public Service Commission approved our partial settlement in the annual forward test year FRP and new rates are now effective. And Entergy New Orleans rate case is still ongoing and is expected to be completed by August of this year.
In addition, recently filed legislation in Texas could help reduce regulatory lag on generation investment in that jurisdiction. If passed, it would allow the Commission to approve a rider to recover reasonable and necessary generation investment, which would be more timely and less burdensome than a base rate case filing. This legislation is consistent with our desire to align regulatory structures with customer benefits.  Overall, the resolution we achieved on all of the regulatory matters we undertook last year provides clarity to our plans and solidifies the financial commitments we've made.
At Entergy, we are dedicated to sustainability efforts. Once again, we were named to the Dow Jones Sustainability North American Index, which measures performance in economic, environmental and social dimensions against industry peers around the globe. We earned top scores in areas of policy influence, climate strategy, water-related risks and corporate citizenship and philanthropy. This is the 17th consecutive year Entergy has been included on either the world or North American index or both.
We are recognized by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation who named Entergy a finalist in its 2018 Corporate Citizenship Awards in the Best Economic Empowerment Program category. The award recognized Entergy's 5-year, $5 million workforce-ready initiative aimed at promoting economic development for communities throughout our service region. And Entergy creating a diverse and inclusive workplace is one of our shared values, and we are committed to leveraging the richness of a diverse workforce. In recognition of our efforts, Black Enterprise Magazine has recognized Entergy as one of its 2018 50 Best Companies for Diversity. The list highlights companies that champion professional inclusion of people from all races and demographic groups. This is the fifth consecutive year that we've been included on that list.  
2018 has been another successful year for us. We executed on our strategy, and we expect 2019 will be no different. Our operating and financial positions are solid, and our strategic direction is clear. Today, we are a very different company than we were just a few years ago. We're a simpler company and a stronger company for the benefit of all our stakeholders. 
We are an industry leader in critical measures of sustainability.  We have among the lowest rates in the United States. We operate one of the cleanest large-scale fleets in the country. We operate in a region that benefits from strong industrial growth. We invest in our employees to create a workforce for the future. We are recognized as a socially responsible growth engine for our communities. And our aspirations for our customers are aligned with the goals of our regulators. These attributes alone make Entergy a compelling long-term investment today. 
But this is also the foundation on which we will grow, innovate and expand our investment profile for tomorrow.  We will invest in new technologies and new revenue streams that offer promising returns for our owners. We will embrace innovations that will transition us from an energy provider to delivering new outcomes and solutions that our customers want.
We will continue to promote the well-being of our communities by partnering to improve education, eradicate poverty and protect the environment. And we will remain at the forefront of our industry's efforts to address climate issues, while also maintaining reliable and economic service for our customers.
We are in the early days of our industry's transformation. Innovation is changing how we see the future of our industry, a future that offers a significant opportunity for continued long-term growth, and we are well positioned to lead the way. 
I will now turn the call over to Drew, who will provide more detail on our 2018 financial results, 2019 guidance under our new single measure and our 3-year outlooks."

As Leo stated, we are reporting strong results for another successful year. We executed on all our planned deliverables and this progress is reflected in our financial performance.

We executed on all our planned deliverables and this progress is reflected in our financial performance. The Utility, Parent & Other, on an adjusted view, we ended the year in line with our expectations, and for Entergy consolidated, we exceeded our expectations for the year. We are pleased with these results and we look forward to continuing this momentum into 2019. For the next few minutes, I'll review the results of the fourth quarter and then the full year, while also issuing 2019 guidance and a 3-year outlook under our new Entergy adjusted measure.
Starting with the quarter. On Slide 6, our adjusted Utility, Parent & Other earnings were $0.04 higher than fourth quarter 2017. The key driver was lower non-fuel O&M, driven by lower nuclear cost this quarter. Also contributing to the increase were favorable base rate actions. Partially offsetting these drivers, were regulatory provisions for 2 items I highlighted for you on the last earnings call.
First, the $25 million refund to Entergy Texas customers from the lower tax rate, retroactive till January 2018. And second, because Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Mississippi performed above expectations, such that future true-ups resulted in amounts due back to customers. We have accrued those in 2018. We also had lower income tax expense and higher depreciation expense. Before we move on, I'd like to point out that starting next quarter, we will revert back to showing our variances on an EPS basis only since the statutory tax rate period-over-period will be the same again. This will simplify our variance views going forward.
Moving to EWC on Slide 7. Operational earnings decreased $1.22 from a year ago. This was largely the result of lower returns on decommissioning trust investments during the quarter, and to a lesser extent, lower net revenue from lower nuclear volume. Lower non-fuel O&M and lower income taxes helped partially offset the decrease.
On Slide 8, operating cash flow in the quarter was $526 million, $385 million lower than a year ago. The decrease is primarily due to the return of the unprotected excess ADIT to customers at Utility as well as lower net revenue and higher severance and retention costs at EWC.
Now turning to full year, on Slide 9. Consolidated operational earnings for 2018 were $7.31 per share, higher than the $7.20 per share in 2017. These results exceeded our guidance range, primarily due to favorable weather and favorable non-fuel O&M at EWC. We also had tax items and losses on EWC decommissioning trust that mostly offset each other. Excluding these items, results would have been firmly within our guidance range.
UP&O adjusted EPS on Slide 10 was $4.71 in 2018, $0.14 higher than 2017. The increase in 2018 was due largely to base rate actions. This increase is partly offset by higher non-fuel O&M and other operating expenses as well as higher interest expense at Parent. We also had lower income tax expenses as a result of the lower federal income tax rate, which has offset net revenue. 
Slide 7 (sic)[ Slide 11 ] summarizes EWC operational earnings, which decreased $2.22 year-over-year. Losses on the decommissioning trust fund investments and less favorable income tax items in 2018 as compared to a year ago were key drivers.  Lower net revenue from lower prices and lower volume also contributed. Partially offsetting these decreases were favorable depreciation and decommissioning expenses. 
Full year 2018 operating cash flow shown on Slide 12, was approximately $2.4 billion in 2018, $239 million lower than last year. Our main driver was a return of the unprotected excess ADIT to customers, which reduced cash flow approximately $600 million. Lower net revenue in EWC was also a driver. Favorable weather at Utility and lower severance and retention payments at EWC partially offset the decrease. 
Moving to Slide 13. As we mentioned last quarter, with the progress we've made on our strategy to exit our EWC business and transition to a pure-play utility, we are moving to a single, simpler measure that better reflects the nature of our business going forward. Today, we are initiating our new Entergy adjusted EPS guidance and 3-year outlook. The new measure excludes all of our EWC earnings and is similar to our previous UP&O adjusted measure with the following exceptions. We now exclude large tax items as opposed to normalizing to a statutory tax rate. And we no longer normalize the effective weather. While we have not changed our views of the underlying business, our Entergy adjusted guidance is higher than our previous UP&O adjusted disclosure. The change is only attributable to our expectation for lower-than-statutory tax rates in those years. The lower tax rates are created by the return of protected excess ADIT and AFUDC from the significant capital investment we're making at our core business to benefit our customers. The effective tax rate is lower in 2019 versus '20 and '21, primarily due to higher AFUDC in 2019. 
A reconciliation of the UP&O adjusted measure to the new Entergy adjusted measure can be found in our appendix. Starting next quarter, we will report actual results under this Entergy adjusted measure only and our disclosures will be revised accordingly. The Entergy adjusted guidance range is $5.10 to $5.50 with a midpoint of $5.30. I will note that this is the same midpoint we showed at our Analyst Day in 2016, except for the $0.20 improvement related to the lower effective tax rate.
On Slide 13, you will also see a few of the key drivers for 2019 guidance. Starting on the top line, our projected sales volume in 2019 is expected to increase about 1% year-over-year, driven by strong industrial sales of approximately 2.5% to 3%. We continue to expect volatility from quarter-to-quarter, with slightly positive residential sales in the first half of the year turning slightly negative from the second half of the year as advanced meters go in service.
Additionally, a full year of 2018 rate activity at Arkansas, Louisiana and Texas contribute to 2019's results along with the 2019 FRP filings in Mississippi and Louisiana. Recovery of the St. Charles Power Station is expected to begin mid-year when the plant goes in service. We project non-fuel O&M to be approximately $2.7 billion, which represents a 3% increase -- about a 3% increase compared to 2018. This reflects our ongoing capital-intensive construction plan, which creates higher spending on fossil and transmission operations. 
We expect 2019 to be the last year for incremental nuclear hiring under our nuclear strategic plan, and there are a few costs anticipated for cybersecurity, grid modernization and customer initiatives to then explore new technologies and services building off of our AMI platform. We expect other expenses, such as the depreciation, interest and property taxes to increase as we continue to make productive investments to benefit our customers and our communities. And 2019 also assumes normal weather and no income tax planning items at the Utility. 
Finally, the result of settling a portion of our equity forward into late 2018 and remainder planned for second quarter 2019, we expect dilution of approximately $0.35. Even though EWC's results are excluded from the Entergy adjusted EPS guidance, we will continue to provide our expectations for EWC's financial performance through 2022. This information can be found in the appendix of our webcast presentation.
I'd also like to give an update on our cash position at EWC. While weak market performance led to low returns on our nuclear decommissioning trust investments in fourth quarter 2018, we still expect EWC to revise positive net cash to parent from 2019 through 2022, and this includes our current view of potential decommissioning trust contributions. Additionally, we continue our efforts to reduce risk at EWC. We have rebalanced EWC decommissioning trust portfolio such that we eliminated its equity market exposure. Programs derisk NDT along with the close of the VY sale earlier this year are notable steps in our transition to a pure-play utility.
Moving to the longer-term view on Slide 14, you will see our 2020 and 2021 outlooks have been updated to reflect the new measure. And as I previously mentioned, our longer-term view of our business is not changed. We continue to target a 5% to 7% growth rate for adjusted earnings. 
Finally, our cash and credit metrics as of the end of the year are shown on Slide 15. Our parent debt to total debt ratio has improved to 22.6%. This was largely due to the settlement of a portion of our equity forward in December. Our operational FFO to debt is 12%, but this includes the effects of returning $600 million of unprotected excess ADIT to customers. Excluding this giveback, operational FFO to debt would be 15.3%. As I've noted on previous calls, we remain committed to our targeted ranges at, or above, 15% for FFO to debt and below 25% for parent debt-to-total-debt as well as maintaining our investment-grade profile. 
Additionally, we continue to derisk our balance sheet by managing our pension liability. 2018 pension obligation is lower by almost $600 million from last year and we've lowered our return on assets expectation by 25 basis points for 2019. As a reflection of these collective efforts, Moody's upgraded our outlook to stable in November. 
2018 was another year of strong results, and we are proud of what we accomplished. We made significant progress in our exit of the EWC business and we continue to execute on our customer-centric investment plan at the Utility. As Leo stated, we are committed to creating sustainable value for our customers, employees, communities and owners, and look forward to another successful year in 2019.
And now, the Entergy team is available to answer questions."

It's just a little bit more this first year as we have 3 large combined cycle gas turbines under construction that are long-dated construction assets.

The decommissioning activities are strictly matched up against the decommissioning trust. And so that we do anticipate economies of scale. We think that would be helpful.

That's really the source of -- or 1 of the 2 sources of the effective -- the lower effective tax rate, and that is going directly back to customers over time. And then the AFUDC piece, that is -- AFUDC is recognized by books, it's not recognized by tax, so that's just a structural element that's in there associated with that. That will get reflected in rate base ultimately. But those are the 2 main drivers of the positive change in the effective tax rate.

Today, we are reporting strong results for another successful year of significant accomplishments.

Today, we are reporting strong results for another successful year of significant accomplishments. For our core Utility, Parent & Other business, adjusted EPS were in line with our guidance and growth expectations and our consolidated operational earnings came in above our guidance range. A year ago, I told you that the foundation for our success in 2018 was largely in place, and we laid out what we needed to do to stay on track to achieve our outlooks and aspirations. We've checked off every deliverable on that list as well as a few more and our success keeps us firmly on track to achieve our strategic and financial objectives in 2019 and beyond.
As a result, we raised our dividend for a fourth consecutive year, a trend we expect to continue, subject as always to approval of our board. At EWC, we made important progress toward exiting that business. At the start of the year, we had made shutdown decisions on all EWC nuclear plants, and we had an agreement in place to sell Vermont Yankee, a first-of-its-kind transaction. Since then, we completed the sale of Vermont Yankee and we announced agreements to sell Pilgrim and Palisades. 
The Vermont Yankee transaction is an important milestone, not only for our strategy to completely divest our merchant nuclear assets, but also for the nuclear decommissioning industry. It establishes a model for the sale of nuclear plants post-shutdown, which benefits the industry and key stakeholders by accelerating the decommissioning time line, drawing on industry-leading decommissioning and site remediation expertise and experience and laying the foundation for future business development opportunities in the regions.
We're also making progress on the sale of Pilgrim to Holtec. Holtec submitted its post-shutdown decommissioning activity report to the NRC and we submitted the license transfer application. We will shut down Pilgrim no later than May 31, and we expect to close on the sale of that plant by the end of the year.
Since announcing our intent to exit the merchant business, our progress has been deliberate and on the mark. We've sold 5 facilities to Wind Ventures, the Rhode Island State Energy Center and 2 nuclear plants, leaving EWC with 3 nuclear plants. We have agreements in place to sell 2 of those, and we are now actively working toward a post-shutdown sale of the third, Indian Point. All of this work and success significantly advances our clear strategy to transition to a pure-play utility. 
This past year, we also saw solid achievements at our core Utility business. At Analyst Day, we demonstrated our ability to successfully execute our plan to improve technology across our business. Our disciplined capital projects management organization and rigorous processes give us confidence that we can grow the business through investments that benefit not only our customers, but all our stakeholders. These investments are important because they help sustain and modernize our system, provide lower production cost and lower carbon emission rates, enhance reliability, support customer growth, bring jobs and economic development to our communities and provide opportunities for our employees.
Our new build CCGT projects remain on budget and on schedule with the St. Charles Power Station slated to be in service in mid-2019. We also received regulatory approval from Louisiana Public Service Commission for the acquisition of Washington Parish Energy Center, and we expect to close on that plant in 2021. More recently, we entered into an agreement to acquire the Choctaw Generating Station in Mississippi. We have cleared review under Hart-Scott-Rodino and have requested approval from the Mississippi Public Service Commission. We will also be requesting approval from the FERC in the near future, and we expect to complete the transaction by the end of 2019. 
We continue to make progress on adding renewable generation to our portfolio. We are committed to providing our customers with renewable power options, which are playing an increasingly important role in our resource planning. We have approximately 1,000 megawatts of renewables in various stages of development, and specific projects include 2 solar PPAs in Arkansas, totaling 180 megawatts, one of which is operational; a 100-megawatt utility scale to gain solar project at Entergy Mississippi; 3 utility scale solar projects for Entergy New Orleans totaling 90 megawatts; multiple rooftop solar projects in New Orleans totaling 5 megawatts; and a 15-megawatt solar project selected in Entergy Louisiana's renewable RFP. Each of these projects is in process, and their in-service dates range from 2019 to 2022.  Entergy Arkansas recently announced its intent to issue a solar RFP. The company is interested in procuring up to 200 megawatts of solar PV resources through an asset acquisition.
Renewables are an important resource beyond their obvious environmental attributes. They can provide cost-effective energy supply, fuel diversity and advance the adoption of distributed energy solutions for our customers. As the economics, performance and reliability of these resources improve, we will continue to engage with our regulators and stakeholders to solve technical challenges associated with expanding the use of renewable energy across our service area.
Last month, we hit an important and very exciting milestone in our AMI deployment plan with the installation of the first meters. We will install approximately 3 million automated meters across our jurisdictions, with plans to activate 1 million new meters in 2019. We are pleased with this progress, especially in light of the benefits this technology will provide our customers from faster outage restoration to enhanced customer service and cost-savings. Additionally, with these meters, we'll have more tools to help our customers manage their energy usage and lower their bills.  
AMI will also serve as a foundation for future customer solutions as we evolve from being a supplier to a partner with our customers. We are excited about this next chapter and are actively studying other opportunities to prepare our distribution system for the future. We will provide updates on our progress when appropriate.
Successful execution also includes our nuclear operations. In 2016, we rolled out our 5-year road map to invest in our people, our plants and our processes to achieve operational excellence. Today, we are about halfway through that journey and our performance to-date is in line with our expectations. In 2018, we realized an important milestone when ANO returned to Column 1 of the Reactor Oversight Process Matrix. As planned, we expect Pilgrim to also return to Column 1 this quarter. These are just a few illustrations of the many investments that we're making to develop an efficient, sustainable, electric-generating and delivery system for our customers. 
We also had an active regulatory calendar last year with proceedings in each of our jurisdictions. It started with tax reform, and customers are now seeing benefits in their bills. We worked with our retail regulators and resolved the return of more than $1 billion of benefits to customers. And we were able to return the benefits on an expedited basis. This not only helped our customers, but also provided financial clarity, which was important to solidify our credit as illustrated by Moody's moving our outlook to stable in November. 
Entergy Louisiana extended and modified its formula rate plan to include a new mechanism to recover incremental transmission investments 8 months beyond any historic test year. In the fourth quarter, we resolved 2 base rate proceedings. The Public Utility Commission of Texas approved the rate case, which was a good step toward improving earnings and returns in that jurisdiction in the near term. The Arkansas Public Service Commission approved our partial settlement in the annual forward test year FRP and new rates are now effective. And Entergy New Orleans rate case is still ongoing and is expected to be completed by August of this year.
In addition, recently filed legislation in Texas could help reduce regulatory lag on generation investment in that jurisdiction. If passed, it would allow the Commission to approve a rider to recover reasonable and necessary generation investment, which would be more timely and less burdensome than a base rate case filing. This legislation is consistent with our desire to align regulatory structures with customer benefits.  Overall, the resolution we achieved on all of the regulatory matters we undertook last year provides clarity to our plans and solidifies the financial commitments we've made.
At Entergy, we are dedicated to sustainability efforts. Once again, we were named to the Dow Jones Sustainability North American Index, which measures performance in economic, environmental and social dimensions against industry peers around the globe. We earned top scores in areas of policy influence, climate strategy, water-related risks and corporate citizenship and philanthropy. This is the 17th consecutive year Entergy has been included on either the world or North American index or both.
We are recognized by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation who named Entergy a finalist in its 2018 Corporate Citizenship Awards in the Best Economic Empowerment Program category. The award recognized Entergy's 5-year, $5 million workforce-ready initiative aimed at promoting economic development for communities throughout our service region. And Entergy creating a diverse and inclusive workplace is one of our shared values, and we are committed to leveraging the richness of a diverse workforce. In recognition of our efforts, Black Enterprise Magazine has recognized Entergy as one of its 2018 50 Best Companies for Diversity. The list highlights companies that champion professional inclusion of people from all races and demographic groups. This is the fifth consecutive year that we've been included on that list.  
2018 has been another successful year for us. We executed on our strategy, and we expect 2019 will be no different. Our operating and financial positions are solid, and our strategic direction is clear. Today, we are a very different company than we were just a few years ago. We're a simpler company and a stronger company for the benefit of all our stakeholders. 
We are an industry leader in critical measures of sustainability.  We have among the lowest rates in the United States. We operate one of the cleanest large-scale fleets in the country. We operate in a region that benefits from strong industrial growth. We invest in our employees to create a workforce for the future. We are recognized as a socially responsible growth engine for our communities. And our aspirations for our customers are aligned with the goals of our regulators. These attributes alone make Entergy a compelling long-term investment today. 
But this is also the foundation on which we will grow, innovate and expand our investment profile for tomorrow.  We will invest in new technologies and new revenue streams that offer promising returns for our owners. We will embrace innovations that will transition us from an energy provider to delivering new outcomes and solutions that our customers want.
We will continue to promote the well-being of our communities by partnering to improve education, eradicate poverty and protect the environment. And we will remain at the forefront of our industry's efforts to address climate issues, while also maintaining reliable and economic service for our customers.
We are in the early days of our industry's transformation. Innovation is changing how we see the future of our industry, a future that offers a significant opportunity for continued long-term growth, and we are well positioned to lead the way. 
I will now turn the call over to Drew, who will provide more detail on our 2018 financial results, 2019 guidance under our new single measure and our 3-year outlooks."
269764,599962365,1664426,"Entergy Corporation, Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Feb 20, 2019",2019-02-20,"Earnings Calls","Entergy Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Leo. Good morning, everyone. As Leo stated, we are reporting strong results for another successful year. We executed on all our planned deliverables and this progress is reflected in our financial performance. The Utility, Parent & Other, on an",1629,"Thank you, Leo. Good morning, everyone. As Leo stated, we are reporting strong results for another successful year. We executed on all our planned deliverables and this progress is reflected in our financial performance. The Utility, Parent & Other, on an adjusted view, we ended the year in line with our expectations, and for Entergy consolidated, we exceeded our expectations for the year. We are pleased with these results and we look forward to continuing this momentum into 2019. For the next few minutes, I'll review the results of the fourth quarter and then the full year, while also issuing 2019 guidance and a 3-year outlook under our new Entergy adjusted measure.
Starting with the quarter. On Slide 6, our adjusted Utility, Parent & Other earnings were $0.04 higher than fourth quarter 2017. The key driver was lower non-fuel O&M, driven by lower nuclear cost this quarter. Also contributing to the increase were favorable base rate actions. Partially offsetting these drivers, were regulatory provisions for 2 items I highlighted for you on the last earnings call.
First, the $25 million refund to Entergy Texas customers from the lower tax rate, retroactive till January 2018. And second, because Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Mississippi performed above expectations, such that future true-ups resulted in amounts due back to customers. We have accrued those in 2018. We also had lower income tax expense and higher depreciation expense. Before we move on, I'd like to point out that starting next quarter, we will revert back to showing our variances on an EPS basis only since the statutory tax rate period-over-period will be the same again. This will simplify our variance views going forward.
Moving to EWC on Slide 7. Operational earnings decreased $1.22 from a year ago. This was largely the result of lower returns on decommissioning trust investments during the quarter, and to a lesser extent, lower net revenue from lower nuclear volume. Lower non-fuel O&M and lower income taxes helped partially offset the decrease.
On Slide 8, operating cash flow in the quarter was $526 million, $385 million lower than a year ago. The decrease is primarily due to the return of the unprotected excess ADIT to customers at Utility as well as lower net revenue and higher severance and retention costs at EWC.
Now turning to full year, on Slide 9. Consolidated operational earnings for 2018 were $7.31 per share, higher than the $7.20 per share in 2017. These results exceeded our guidance range, primarily due to favorable weather and favorable non-fuel O&M at EWC. We also had tax items and losses on EWC decommissioning trust that mostly offset each other. Excluding these items, results would have been firmly within our guidance range.
UP&O adjusted EPS on Slide 10 was $4.71 in 2018, $0.14 higher than 2017. The increase in 2018 was due largely to base rate actions. This increase is partly offset by higher non-fuel O&M and other operating expenses as well as higher interest expense at Parent. We also had lower income tax expenses as a result of the lower federal income tax rate, which has offset net revenue. 
Slide 7 (sic)[ Slide 11 ] summarizes EWC operational earnings, which decreased $2.22 year-over-year. Losses on the decommissioning trust fund investments and less favorable income tax items in 2018 as compared to a year ago were key drivers.  Lower net revenue from lower prices and lower volume also contributed. Partially offsetting these decreases were favorable depreciation and decommissioning expenses. 
Full year 2018 operating cash flow shown on Slide 12, was approximately $2.4 billion in 2018, $239 million lower than last year. Our main driver was a return of the unprotected excess ADIT to customers, which reduced cash flow approximately $600 million. Lower net revenue in EWC was also a driver. Favorable weather at Utility and lower severance and retention payments at EWC partially offset the decrease. 
Moving to Slide 13. As we mentioned last quarter, with the progress we've made on our strategy to exit our EWC business and transition to a pure-play utility, we are moving to a single, simpler measure that better reflects the nature of our business going forward. Today, we are initiating our new Entergy adjusted EPS guidance and 3-year outlook. The new measure excludes all of our EWC earnings and is similar to our previous UP&O adjusted measure with the following exceptions. We now exclude large tax items as opposed to normalizing to a statutory tax rate. And we no longer normalize the effective weather. While we have not changed our views of the underlying business, our Entergy adjusted guidance is higher than our previous UP&O adjusted disclosure. The change is only attributable to our expectation for lower-than-statutory tax rates in those years. The lower tax rates are created by the return of protected excess ADIT and AFUDC from the significant capital investment we're making at our core business to benefit our customers. The effective tax rate is lower in 2019 versus '20 and '21, primarily due to higher AFUDC in 2019. 
A reconciliation of the UP&O adjusted measure to the new Entergy adjusted measure can be found in our appendix. Starting next quarter, we will report actual results under this Entergy adjusted measure only and our disclosures will be revised accordingly. The Entergy adjusted guidance range is $5.10 to $5.50 with a midpoint of $5.30. I will note that this is the same midpoint we showed at our Analyst Day in 2016, except for the $0.20 improvement related to the lower effective tax rate.
On Slide 13, you will also see a few of the key drivers for 2019 guidance. Starting on the top line, our projected sales volume in 2019 is expected to increase about 1% year-over-year, driven by strong industrial sales of approximately 2.5% to 3%. We continue to expect volatility from quarter-to-quarter, with slightly positive residential sales in the first half of the year turning slightly negative from the second half of the year as advanced meters go in service.
Additionally, a full year of 2018 rate activity at Arkansas, Louisiana and Texas contribute to 2019's results along with the 2019 FRP filings in Mississippi and Louisiana. Recovery of the St. Charles Power Station is expected to begin mid-year when the plant goes in service. We project non-fuel O&M to be approximately $2.7 billion, which represents a 3% increase -- about a 3% increase compared to 2018. This reflects our ongoing capital-intensive construction plan, which creates higher spending on fossil and transmission operations. 
We expect 2019 to be the last year for incremental nuclear hiring under our nuclear strategic plan, and there are a few costs anticipated for cybersecurity, grid modernization and customer initiatives to then explore new technologies and services building off of our AMI platform. We expect other expenses, such as the depreciation, interest and property taxes to increase as we continue to make productive investments to benefit our customers and our communities. And 2019 also assumes normal weather and no income tax planning items at the Utility. 
Finally, the result of settling a portion of our equity forward into late 2018 and remainder planned for second quarter 2019, we expect dilution of approximately $0.35. Even though EWC's results are excluded from the Entergy adjusted EPS guidance, we will continue to provide our expectations for EWC's financial performance through 2022. This information can be found in the appendix of our webcast presentation.
I'd also like to give an update on our cash position at EWC. While weak market performance led to low returns on our nuclear decommissioning trust investments in fourth quarter 2018, we still expect EWC to revise positive net cash to parent from 2019 through 2022, and this includes our current view of potential decommissioning trust contributions. Additionally, we continue our efforts to reduce risk at EWC. We have rebalanced EWC decommissioning trust portfolio such that we eliminated its equity market exposure. Programs derisk NDT along with the close of the VY sale earlier this year are notable steps in our transition to a pure-play utility.
Moving to the longer-term view on Slide 14, you will see our 2020 and 2021 outlooks have been updated to reflect the new measure. And as I previously mentioned, our longer-term view of our business is not changed. We continue to target a 5% to 7% growth rate for adjusted earnings. 
Finally, our cash and credit metrics as of the end of the year are shown on Slide 15. Our parent debt to total debt ratio has improved to 22.6%. This was largely due to the settlement of a portion of our equity forward in December. Our operational FFO to debt is 12%, but this includes the effects of returning $600 million of unprotected excess ADIT to customers. Excluding this giveback, operational FFO to debt would be 15.3%. As I've noted on previous calls, we remain committed to our targeted ranges at, or above, 15% for FFO to debt and below 25% for parent debt-to-total-debt as well as maintaining our investment-grade profile. 
Additionally, we continue to derisk our balance sheet by managing our pension liability. 2018 pension obligation is lower by almost $600 million from last year and we've lowered our return on assets expectation by 25 basis points for 2019. As a reflection of these collective efforts, Moody's upgraded our outlook to stable in November. 
2018 was another year of strong results, and we are proud of what we accomplished. We made significant progress in our exit of the EWC business and we continue to execute on our customer-centric investment plan at the Utility. As Leo stated, we are committed to creating sustainable value for our customers, employees, communities and owners, and look forward to another successful year in 2019.
And now, the Entergy team is available to answer questions."

There isn't really much change in the AFUDC expectation, not in our guidance outlook. But as the AFUDC comes down from '19 to '20, the effect that, that has on the effective tax rate is going to diminish. And so it actually pops back up afterwards, but the protected excess ADIT piece starts to come off. So it's going to level out at around the $0.10 effect. It's just a little bit more this first year as we have 3 large combined cycle gas turbines under construction that are long-dated construction assets. There's just going to be more AFUDC on the books this year."

Today, we are reporting strong results for another successful year of significant accomplishments.

Today, we are reporting strong results for another successful year of significant accomplishments. For our core Utility, Parent & Other business, adjusted EPS were in line with our guidance and growth expectations and our consolidated operational earnings came in above our guidance range. A year ago, I told you that the foundation for our success in 2018 was largely in place, and we laid out what we needed to do to stay on track to achieve our outlooks and aspirations. We've checked off every deliverable on that list as well as a few more and our success keeps us firmly on track to achieve our strategic and financial objectives in 2019 and beyond.
As a result, we raised our dividend for a fourth consecutive year, a trend we expect to continue, subject as always to approval of our board. At EWC, we made important progress toward exiting that business. At the start of the year, we had made shutdown decisions on all EWC nuclear plants, and we had an agreement in place to sell Vermont Yankee, a first-of-its-kind transaction. Since then, we completed the sale of Vermont Yankee and we announced agreements to sell Pilgrim and Palisades. 
The Vermont Yankee transaction is an important milestone, not only for our strategy to completely divest our merchant nuclear assets, but also for the nuclear decommissioning industry. It establishes a model for the sale of nuclear plants post-shutdown, which benefits the industry and key stakeholders by accelerating the decommissioning time line, drawing on industry-leading decommissioning and site remediation expertise and experience and laying the foundation for future business development opportunities in the regions.
We're also making progress on the sale of Pilgrim to Holtec. Holtec submitted its post-shutdown decommissioning activity report to the NRC and we submitted the license transfer application. We will shut down Pilgrim no later than May 31, and we expect to close on the sale of that plant by the end of the year.
Since announcing our intent to exit the merchant business, our progress has been deliberate and on the mark. We've sold 5 facilities to Wind Ventures, the Rhode Island State Energy Center and 2 nuclear plants, leaving EWC with 3 nuclear plants. We have agreements in place to sell 2 of those, and we are now actively working toward a post-shutdown sale of the third, Indian Point. All of this work and success significantly advances our clear strategy to transition to a pure-play utility. 
This past year, we also saw solid achievements at our core Utility business. At Analyst Day, we demonstrated our ability to successfully execute our plan to improve technology across our business. Our disciplined capital projects management organization and rigorous processes give us confidence that we can grow the business through investments that benefit not only our customers, but all our stakeholders. These investments are important because they help sustain and modernize our system, provide lower production cost and lower carbon emission rates, enhance reliability, support customer growth, bring jobs and economic development to our communities and provide opportunities for our employees.
Our new build CCGT projects remain on budget and on schedule with the St. Charles Power Station slated to be in service in mid-2019. We also received regulatory approval from Louisiana Public Service Commission for the acquisition of Washington Parish Energy Center, and we expect to close on that plant in 2021. More recently, we entered into an agreement to acquire the Choctaw Generating Station in Mississippi. We have cleared review under Hart-Scott-Rodino and have requested approval from the Mississippi Public Service Commission. We will also be requesting approval from the FERC in the near future, and we expect to complete the transaction by the end of 2019. 
We continue to make progress on adding renewable generation to our portfolio. We are committed to providing our customers with renewable power options, which are playing an increasingly important role in our resource planning. We have approximately 1,000 megawatts of renewables in various stages of development, and specific projects include 2 solar PPAs in Arkansas, totaling 180 megawatts, one of which is operational; a 100-megawatt utility scale to gain solar project at Entergy Mississippi; 3 utility scale solar projects for Entergy New Orleans totaling 90 megawatts; multiple rooftop solar projects in New Orleans totaling 5 megawatts; and a 15-megawatt solar project selected in Entergy Louisiana's renewable RFP. Each of these projects is in process, and their in-service dates range from 2019 to 2022.  Entergy Arkansas recently announced its intent to issue a solar RFP. The company is interested in procuring up to 200 megawatts of solar PV resources through an asset acquisition.
Renewables are an important resource beyond their obvious environmental attributes. They can provide cost-effective energy supply, fuel diversity and advance the adoption of distributed energy solutions for our customers. As the economics, performance and reliability of these resources improve, we will continue to engage with our regulators and stakeholders to solve technical challenges associated with expanding the use of renewable energy across our service area.
Last month, we hit an important and very exciting milestone in our AMI deployment plan with the installation of the first meters. We will install approximately 3 million automated meters across our jurisdictions, with plans to activate 1 million new meters in 2019. We are pleased with this progress, especially in light of the benefits this technology will provide our customers from faster outage restoration to enhanced customer service and cost-savings. Additionally, with these meters, we'll have more tools to help our customers manage their energy usage and lower their bills.  
AMI will also serve as a foundation for future customer solutions as we evolve from being a supplier to a partner with our customers. We are excited about this next chapter and are actively studying other opportunities to prepare our distribution system for the future. We will provide updates on our progress when appropriate.
Successful execution also includes our nuclear operations. In 2016, we rolled out our 5-year road map to invest in our people, our plants and our processes to achieve operational excellence. Today, we are about halfway through that journey and our performance to-date is in line with our expectations. In 2018, we realized an important milestone when ANO returned to Column 1 of the Reactor Oversight Process Matrix. As planned, we expect Pilgrim to also return to Column 1 this quarter. These are just a few illustrations of the many investments that we're making to develop an efficient, sustainable, electric-generating and delivery system for our customers. 
We also had an active regulatory calendar last year with proceedings in each of our jurisdictions. It started with tax reform, and customers are now seeing benefits in their bills. We worked with our retail regulators and resolved the return of more than $1 billion of benefits to customers. And we were able to return the benefits on an expedited basis. This not only helped our customers, but also provided financial clarity, which was important to solidify our credit as illustrated by Moody's moving our outlook to stable in November. 
Entergy Louisiana extended and modified its formula rate plan to include a new mechanism to recover incremental transmission investments 8 months beyond any historic test year. In the fourth quarter, we resolved 2 base rate proceedings. The Public Utility Commission of Texas approved the rate case, which was a good step toward improving earnings and returns in that jurisdiction in the near term. The Arkansas Public Service Commission approved our partial settlement in the annual forward test year FRP and new rates are now effective. And Entergy New Orleans rate case is still ongoing and is expected to be completed by August of this year.
In addition, recently filed legislation in Texas could help reduce regulatory lag on generation investment in that jurisdiction. If passed, it would allow the Commission to approve a rider to recover reasonable and necessary generation investment, which would be more timely and less burdensome than a base rate case filing. This legislation is consistent with our desire to align regulatory structures with customer benefits.  Overall, the resolution we achieved on all of the regulatory matters we undertook last year provides clarity to our plans and solidifies the financial commitments we've made.
At Entergy, we are dedicated to sustainability efforts. Once again, we were named to the Dow Jones Sustainability North American Index, which measures performance in economic, environmental and social dimensions against industry peers around the globe. We earned top scores in areas of policy influence, climate strategy, water-related risks and corporate citizenship and philanthropy. This is the 17th consecutive year Entergy has been included on either the world or North American index or both.
We are recognized by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation who named Entergy a finalist in its 2018 Corporate Citizenship Awards in the Best Economic Empowerment Program category. The award recognized Entergy's 5-year, $5 million workforce-ready initiative aimed at promoting economic development for communities throughout our service region. And Entergy creating a diverse and inclusive workplace is one of our shared values, and we are committed to leveraging the richness of a diverse workforce. In recognition of our efforts, Black Enterprise Magazine has recognized Entergy as one of its 2018 50 Best Companies for Diversity. The list highlights companies that champion professional inclusion of people from all races and demographic groups. This is the fifth consecutive year that we've been included on that list.  
2018 has been another successful year for us. We executed on our strategy, and we expect 2019 will be no different. Our operating and financial positions are solid, and our strategic direction is clear. Today, we are a very different company than we were just a few years ago. We're a simpler company and a stronger company for the benefit of all our stakeholders. 
We are an industry leader in critical measures of sustainability.  We have among the lowest rates in the United States. We operate one of the cleanest large-scale fleets in the country. We operate in a region that benefits from strong industrial growth. We invest in our employees to create a workforce for the future. We are recognized as a socially responsible growth engine for our communities. And our aspirations for our customers are aligned with the goals of our regulators. These attributes alone make Entergy a compelling long-term investment today. 
But this is also the foundation on which we will grow, innovate and expand our investment profile for tomorrow.  We will invest in new technologies and new revenue streams that offer promising returns for our owners. We will embrace innovations that will transition us from an energy provider to delivering new outcomes and solutions that our customers want.
We will continue to promote the well-being of our communities by partnering to improve education, eradicate poverty and protect the environment. And we will remain at the forefront of our industry's efforts to address climate issues, while also maintaining reliable and economic service for our customers.
We are in the early days of our industry's transformation. Innovation is changing how we see the future of our industry, a future that offers a significant opportunity for continued long-term growth, and we are well positioned to lead the way. 
I will now turn the call over to Drew, who will provide more detail on our 2018 financial results, 2019 guidance under our new single measure and our 3-year outlooks."

As Leo stated, we are reporting strong results for another successful year. We executed on all our planned deliverables and this progress is reflected in our financial performance. The Utility, Parent & Other, on an",1629,"Thank you, Leo. Good morning, everyone. As Leo stated, we are reporting strong results for another successful year. We executed on all our planned deliverables and this progress is reflected in our financial performance. The Utility, Parent & Other, on an adjusted view, we ended the year in line with our expectations, and for Entergy consolidated, we exceeded our expectations for the year. We are pleased with these results and we look forward to continuing this momentum into 2019. For the next few minutes, I'll review the results of the fourth quarter and then the full year, while also issuing 2019 guidance and a 3-year outlook under our new Entergy adjusted measure.
Starting with the quarter. On Slide 6, our adjusted Utility, Parent & Other earnings were $0.04 higher than fourth quarter 2017. The key driver was lower non-fuel O&M, driven by lower nuclear cost this quarter. Also contributing to the increase were favorable base rate actions. Partially offsetting these drivers, were regulatory provisions for 2 items I highlighted for you on the last earnings call.
First, the $25 million refund to Entergy Texas customers from the lower tax rate, retroactive till January 2018. And second, because Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Mississippi performed above expectations, such that future true-ups resulted in amounts due back to customers. We have accrued those in 2018. We also had lower income tax expense and higher depreciation expense. Before we move on, I'd like to point out that starting next quarter, we will revert back to showing our variances on an EPS basis only since the statutory tax rate period-over-period will be the same again. This will simplify our variance views going forward.
Moving to EWC on Slide 7. Operational earnings decreased $1.22 from a year ago. This was largely the result of lower returns on decommissioning trust investments during the quarter, and to a lesser extent, lower net revenue from lower nuclear volume. Lower non-fuel O&M and lower income taxes helped partially offset the decrease.
On Slide 8, operating cash flow in the quarter was $526 million, $385 million lower than a year ago. The decrease is primarily due to the return of the unprotected excess ADIT to customers at Utility as well as lower net revenue and higher severance and retention costs at EWC.
Now turning to full year, on Slide 9. Consolidated operational earnings for 2018 were $7.31 per share, higher than the $7.20 per share in 2017. These results exceeded our guidance range, primarily due to favorable weather and favorable non-fuel O&M at EWC. We also had tax items and losses on EWC decommissioning trust that mostly offset each other. Excluding these items, results would have been firmly within our guidance range.
UP&O adjusted EPS on Slide 10 was $4.71 in 2018, $0.14 higher than 2017. The increase in 2018 was due largely to base rate actions. This increase is partly offset by higher non-fuel O&M and other operating expenses as well as higher interest expense at Parent. We also had lower income tax expenses as a result of the lower federal income tax rate, which has offset net revenue. 
Slide 7 (sic)[ Slide 11 ] summarizes EWC operational earnings, which decreased $2.22 year-over-year. Losses on the decommissioning trust fund investments and less favorable income tax items in 2018 as compared to a year ago were key drivers.  Lower net revenue from lower prices and lower volume also contributed. Partially offsetting these decreases were favorable depreciation and decommissioning expenses. 
Full year 2018 operating cash flow shown on Slide 12, was approximately $2.4 billion in 2018, $239 million lower than last year. Our main driver was a return of the unprotected excess ADIT to customers, which reduced cash flow approximately $600 million. Lower net revenue in EWC was also a driver. Favorable weather at Utility and lower severance and retention payments at EWC partially offset the decrease. 
Moving to Slide 13. As we mentioned last quarter, with the progress we've made on our strategy to exit our EWC business and transition to a pure-play utility, we are moving to a single, simpler measure that better reflects the nature of our business going forward. Today, we are initiating our new Entergy adjusted EPS guidance and 3-year outlook. The new measure excludes all of our EWC earnings and is similar to our previous UP&O adjusted measure with the following exceptions. We now exclude large tax items as opposed to normalizing to a statutory tax rate. And we no longer normalize the effective weather. While we have not changed our views of the underlying business, our Entergy adjusted guidance is higher than our previous UP&O adjusted disclosure. The change is only attributable to our expectation for lower-than-statutory tax rates in those years. The lower tax rates are created by the return of protected excess ADIT and AFUDC from the significant capital investment we're making at our core business to benefit our customers. The effective tax rate is lower in 2019 versus '20 and '21, primarily due to higher AFUDC in 2019. 
A reconciliation of the UP&O adjusted measure to the new Entergy adjusted measure can be found in our appendix. Starting next quarter, we will report actual results under this Entergy adjusted measure only and our disclosures will be revised accordingly. The Entergy adjusted guidance range is $5.10 to $5.50 with a midpoint of $5.30. I will note that this is the same midpoint we showed at our Analyst Day in 2016, except for the $0.20 improvement related to the lower effective tax rate.
On Slide 13, you will also see a few of the key drivers for 2019 guidance. Starting on the top line, our projected sales volume in 2019 is expected to increase about 1% year-over-year, driven by strong industrial sales of approximately 2.5% to 3%. We continue to expect volatility from quarter-to-quarter, with slightly positive residential sales in the first half of the year turning slightly negative from the second half of the year as advanced meters go in service.
Additionally, a full year of 2018 rate activity at Arkansas, Louisiana and Texas contribute to 2019's results along with the 2019 FRP filings in Mississippi and Louisiana. Recovery of the St. Charles Power Station is expected to begin mid-year when the plant goes in service. We project non-fuel O&M to be approximately $2.7 billion, which represents a 3% increase -- about a 3% increase compared to 2018. This reflects our ongoing capital-intensive construction plan, which creates higher spending on fossil and transmission operations. 
We expect 2019 to be the last year for incremental nuclear hiring under our nuclear strategic plan, and there are a few costs anticipated for cybersecurity, grid modernization and customer initiatives to then explore new technologies and services building off of our AMI platform. We expect other expenses, such as the depreciation, interest and property taxes to increase as we continue to make productive investments to benefit our customers and our communities. And 2019 also assumes normal weather and no income tax planning items at the Utility. 
Finally, the result of settling a portion of our equity forward into late 2018 and remainder planned for second quarter 2019, we expect dilution of approximately $0.35. Even though EWC's results are excluded from the Entergy adjusted EPS guidance, we will continue to provide our expectations for EWC's financial performance through 2022. This information can be found in the appendix of our webcast presentation.
I'd also like to give an update on our cash position at EWC. While weak market performance led to low returns on our nuclear decommissioning trust investments in fourth quarter 2018, we still expect EWC to revise positive net cash to parent from 2019 through 2022, and this includes our current view of potential decommissioning trust contributions. Additionally, we continue our efforts to reduce risk at EWC. We have rebalanced EWC decommissioning trust portfolio such that we eliminated its equity market exposure. Programs derisk NDT along with the close of the VY sale earlier this year are notable steps in our transition to a pure-play utility.
Moving to the longer-term view on Slide 14, you will see our 2020 and 2021 outlooks have been updated to reflect the new measure. And as I previously mentioned, our longer-term view of our business is not changed. We continue to target a 5% to 7% growth rate for adjusted earnings. 
Finally, our cash and credit metrics as of the end of the year are shown on Slide 15. Our parent debt to total debt ratio has improved to 22.6%. This was largely due to the settlement of a portion of our equity forward in December. Our operational FFO to debt is 12%, but this includes the effects of returning $600 million of unprotected excess ADIT to customers. Excluding this giveback, operational FFO to debt would be 15.3%. As I've noted on previous calls, we remain committed to our targeted ranges at, or above, 15% for FFO to debt and below 25% for parent debt-to-total-debt as well as maintaining our investment-grade profile. 
Additionally, we continue to derisk our balance sheet by managing our pension liability. 2018 pension obligation is lower by almost $600 million from last year and we've lowered our return on assets expectation by 25 basis points for 2019. As a reflection of these collective efforts, Moody's upgraded our outlook to stable in November. 
2018 was another year of strong results, and we are proud of what we accomplished. We made significant progress in our exit of the EWC business and we continue to execute on our customer-centric investment plan at the Utility. As Leo stated, we are committed to creating sustainable value for our customers, employees, communities and owners, and look forward to another successful year in 2019.

And so it actually pops back up afterwards, but the protected excess ADIT piece starts to come off. So it's going to level out at around the $0.10 effect. It's just a little bit more this first year as we have 3 large combined cycle gas turbines under construction that are long-dated construction assets. There's just going to be more AFUDC on the books this year."

And we are still on track for that. We've had ongoing conversations with the rating agencies. They are fully aware of the plan, and they can see the expectation for the excess -- the unprotected excess ADIT going back to customers quite rapidly. In fact, that's one of the things that they cited as positive is that we're getting that behind us, so that you can see our FFO-to-debt measure move higher, more quickly instead of drawn out. When we discussed it with them, the expectation was that if we even have to deal with it on an ongoing basis, how we're recalculating it to show you the effect of it back to 15% in the materials today. If we had to do that on an ongoing basis, it would be much harder for them to get comfortable with our outlook. So they are very comfortable with it, and it exceeds the full depth of it, and we all expect to get back by 2020."

As you know, it dipped down in the fourth quarter, it's rallied in January. The rally in January, of course, was helpful for us and also allowed us to finish the derisking of Pilgrim. And that was very helpful in terms of giving us more comfort towards our expectation of keeping that cash outlook. We've also continued to find ways to manage our O&M and capital costs. And those efforts are ongoing within EWC. And some of those were realized in the fourth quarter of '18 in the form of some significantly lower O&M.

The decommissioning activities are strictly matched up against the decommissioning trust. And so that we do anticipate economies of scale. We think that would be helpful.

That's really the source of -- or 1 of the 2 sources of the effective -- the lower effective tax rate, and that is going directly back to customers over time. And then the AFUDC piece, that is -- AFUDC is recognized by books, it's not recognized by tax, so that's just a structural element that's in there associated with that. That will get reflected in rate base ultimately. But those are the 2 main drivers of the positive change in the effective tax rate. And of course, when we are defining tax items, we are not including those in our numbers going forward, but often we are working with retail regulators to share those benefits with customers. And as we do that, those monies would flow back to customers as well."

We had a productive start to the year, and today we are reporting first quarter adjusted earnings of $0.82 per share. While weather was a headwind, we remain firmly on track to achieve our full year guidance and our longer-term outlooks. We checked out every first quarter key deliverable and we added an important new milestone. We have agreement for post-shutdown sale of Indian Point to International. With this announcement, we now have definitive agreements to sell all of EWC's remaining nuclear assets. We will shut down Pilgrim this month, and we plan to close on the sale of that plant by the end of the year.
We will then shut down Indian Point unit 2 next year and unit 3 in 2021. The sale of all Indian Point units is expected to close in the third quarter 2021, and we expect to complete the Palisades transaction after its shut down in 2022. The sales of these plants are important. Not only do they secure our orderly of business, but they do in a way that benefits stakeholders by accelerating decommissioning time line, drawing on industry-leading decommissioning and site expertise and experience and laying the foundation for future business development opportunities in the regions. We are grateful to our nuclear teams to remain focused on finishing strong with safe and secure operations. Our Pilgrim employees a shining example of this hard work, commitment and dedication. In March, Pilgrim returned to normal baseline oversight by the NRC, moving to in the reactor oversight program. Over the last 2 years, Pilgrim's 600 employees exhibited professionalism and pride, resulting in this important milestone for our organization.
At the Utility business, we also executing on key deliverables in the quarter. We continue to pursue our commitment to renewable resources and 2 of our operating companies, Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Texas have each issued a request for proposals for 200 megawatts of solar resources. Entergy Arkansas also announced plan for 100-megawatt solar facility. This project, pending approval by Arkansas Public Service Commission, will be the largest utility-owned solar facility in the state in the first to feature battery storage.
The facility is expected to be in service by 2021.
We are pleased with the progress we continue to make on developing renewable projects as they are an important resource beyond their obvious environmental attributes. They can provide cost-effective energy supply, fuel diversity and advance the adoption of distributed energy solutions for our customers. We currently have just over 230 megawatts of renewable resources in service, including hydro, solar and biomass technologies. We also have 185 megawatts of new solar projects that have been approved and are moving forward. Just under 300 megawatts that are pending regulatory approval and the 400 megawatts that I mentioned from Arkansas in Texas RFPs.
And as the economics and performance of renewable resources continue to improve, we will engage with our regulators and stakeholders to expand their use across our service area.
In January, we began installement of the first automated meters. Over the next 3 years, we will install approximately 3 million automated meters across our jurisdictions, with plans to activate 1 million new meters in 2019. The new meters will benefit our customers with faster outage identification, enhanced customer service and cost savings. Additionally, these meters will provide us with the tools to help our customers manage their energy usage and lower their bills.
And we will recycle the lower meters after removal. They will be yielding copper and scrap that can be recycled.
Our new build projects remain on budget and on schedule. After a little over 2-year of construction, St. Charles Power Station is in its file commissioning phase, and that plant is expected to be placed in service this quarter. Construction activity at the New Orleans power station kicked into high gear after the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality issued its clean air permit.
The plant will be a much needed local resource of modern natural gas generated power for residents and businesses. In Mississippi, we continue to work through the Choctaw Generating Station acquisition to ensure that the plant is a good value for our customers. Our due diligence has identified a potential mechanical issue that may need to be addressed prior to closing. There is a possibility that closing maybe delayed to allow time to resolve the issue. You will know more in the coming weeks and we'll provide an update on our next earnings call.
At this point, we do not foresee a delay that will have a material financial impact. These are just a few examples of the investments we are making in our efficient and sustainable power system for the benefit of our customers.
We kicked off 2019 base rate filings with the Entergy Mississippi's annual FRP, which was submitted on March 15. We are working through that process and expect new rates to be effective in June. We're also preparing to file our annual FRPs in Louisiana and Arkansas later this year. Our New Orleans rate case is ongoing and we remain on track to have new rates this summer and we requested a rate plan to take effect next year.
In addition, proposed legislation in Texas could help reduce regulatory lag on generation investment in that jurisdictions. The legislation passed the house, it was also passed by the Senate Business and Commerce Committee, and it will now be considered by the full senate.
If signed into a law, the legislation would allow the commission to approve to to recover reasonable and necessary generation investment, which would be more timely and less burdensome than a base rate case filing.
This legislation is consistent with our desire to align regulatory structures with customer benefits. 3 out of our 5 jurisdictions, which generate approximately 80% of the utility's revenue have annual formula rate plan mechanisms. These, combined with other constructs that allow for timely recovery of investments, which benefit customers, provide clarity to our plans and solidify the financial commitments we've made to provide steady, predictable growth in earnings and dividends.
At Entergy, our people are critical to our success. Our employees make it possible to implement our strategy and achieve our objectives. Acquiring, retaining and developing the talent we need to meet today's business needs to and to prepare for the workplace of tomorrow are important. As part of our employee focus, we are proud to promote supportive work environments for members of the National Guard and Reserve. In recognition of this, we won the 2019 Award from the Department of Defense, and we were a semifinalist for the 2019 Freedom Award.
Entergy is also committed to supporting businesses in the communities we serve. The Women's Business Enterprise National Council recognized our efforts, and once again, presented the prestigious America's Top Corporations for Women's Business Enterprises award to Entergy. The national work recognizes companies with world-class diversity in programs than enable growth and innovation, while breaking down barriers for women-owned businesses.
These awards are a good validation of our mission to create value for all of our stakeholders, customers, employees, communities and owners. We recently released our annual integrated report titled, when this one equal more. It illustrates how our efforts to serve the needs of each stakeholder creates value for all.
Our reported outlines how the of new technologies enables us to build a more individualized relationships with our customers and partner with them on solutions that make their lives better. And how providing opportunities for our employees to adapt new skill sets to effectively implement and manage new technologies will drive transformative change.
Entergy is also recognized as an industry leader for taking actions to address climate issues. In 2001, we were the first U.S. electric utility to commit voluntarily the stabilizing greenhouse gas initiatives. In 2005, we upped that commitment to capping our carbon dioxide emissions at 20% below year 2000 levels through the year 2010. Then in 2011, we extended that through 2020. Even though Entergy's carbon dioxide emission rates continues to one of the lowest among our peers, the broad consensus of current scientific data on climate change indicates that, as an industry, we must do work to reduce our footprint and that of our customers and communities.
Entergy sees this not as a choice, but as a responsibility and an opportunity. That is why, in addition to our integrated report, we also released our climate scenario analysis and evaluation of risks and opportunities. This report outlines our role in meeting the to reduce risk that is posed by climate change and analyses a new greenhouse gas emissions goal. To reduce our CO2 emissions rate to 50% below year 2000 levels by 2030.
That means that for every unit of electricity we generate in 2030, we will emit half the carbon dioxide we did in 2000.
Entergy's leadership in sustainability and social responsibility makes us a successful Fortune 500 company with a Our actions and commitments to sustainability position us to effectively benefit our stakeholders today, while securing a bright tomorrow.
For the first quarter of 2019, we continue on track of steady successful execution of our strategy. In 2019, will be another successful year for us. Of our operating and financial positions are solid and our strategic direction is clear. We are an industry leader in critical measures of sustainability. We have among the lowest retail rates in the country, and we operate one of the cleanest large-scale fleets in The United States. We also benefit from strong industrial growth within our service territory, we invest in our employees and our communities, and our strategy is aligned with the goals of our regulators. This is what makes Entergy a compelling long-term investment. And this is the foundation we will continue to grow and innovate for the benefit of all of our stakeholders. I'll now turn the call over to Drew who will provide more detail on our first quarter financial results."

As Leo said, the first quarter was a productive start to the year, and we are firmly on track to meet our full year guidance and longer-term outlooks. Today, we are officially starting to report earnings using our simpler Entergy adjusted earnings measures, to better reflect the nature of our business going forward. And our materials and disclosures are more streamlined as a result.
I'll now turn to the numbers. As you can see on Slide 4, on a per share basis, Entergy adjusted earnings were largely flat quarter-over-quarter. Turning to Slide 5, results of Utility are straightforward. Net revenue increased primarily from the effect of rate activity in Arkansas, Louisiana and Texas. Also with of tax reform last year's results included regulatory charges to return the benefits of lower federal tax rates to customers, and that lower tax rate is now reflected in customer bills.
Partially offsetting was lower volume due to the effect whether, which was unfavorable this quarter compared to 1 year ago. Finally, a higher share count affected this quarter's results on a per share basis. EWC's first quarter results are summarized on the Slide 6. And as a reminder, EWC is now concluded from our Entergy adjusted measure. As reported, earnings were $0.60 higher than the prior year. The key driver was strong market performance on the quarter for EWC's nuclear decommissioning A tax item, which resulted from the sale of Vermont Yankee partly offset the increase.
Before leaving EWC, I would like to affirm that after accounting for the transaction cost for a new client, we still expect EWC to provide slightly positive net cash to parent from '19 through '22.
Slide 7 shows operating cash flow for the quarter of $501 million, a $56 million decrease from year ago. The change was driven by the return of approximately $100 million of unprotected excess ADIT to customers as well as the effects of unfavorable weather.
Lower pension contributions partially offset the decrease.
We are affirming our 2019 earnings guidance and financial outlooks, which are summarized on Slide 8. As I mentioned, we experienced unfavorable weather in the quarter. Nevertheless, we remain on track to coming around the midpoint of our 2019 guidance. Our credit metrics are shown on Slide 10. Our parent debt to total debt has improved to 21.7%. This was largely due to the settlement of a portion of the equity in December. Our FFO to debt is 11.1%, but this includes the effects of returning $692 million of unprotected excess ADIT to customers. Excluding this giveback and certain items related to our exit of EWC, debt would be 15%. We expect cash flows to improve as soon as next quarter and throughout the remainder of the year assuming a normal weather.
We remain committed to our targeted ranges of at or above 15% for FFO to debt by 2020 and below 25% for parent debt to total debt as well as maintaining our investment grade profile.
We have productive first quarter and we see 2019 as another successful year. The foundations in place for us to meet our financial commitments to deliver steady, predictable growth and earnings and dividends through customer-centric investment. As Leo mentioned, our operating and financial positions are solid and our strategic direction is clear. We are continuing our mission to create sustainable value for all of our stakeholders, and we look forward to the opportunities ahead.

The low nature of just energy prices here on the Gulf Coast is extremely competitive worldwide. And so we are very confident in what we can see. Our current forecast is based on what we can see from an industrial perspective, and that includes petrochemical, LNG, some metals and not much at new at this point, but has been very strong performer for us in that market continues to get tighter. And as we look forward, we do see new opportunities in the quarter alkaline petrochemical space there is potential for new LNG and other things.
So all of that goes well for our industrial sales expectations., and while that's good for us, the really important thing for us is it gives us incremental headroom to create investment and whether industrial customers are distribution operations in new ways.

I think it's important to note that the reason why we're suggesting that the proposed legislation, keep in mind, it's still in the midst of negotiations at the legislature does changed our outlook in terms of Texa's performance in large part because of the timing of the existing rate case process or rate case filing in Texas. So we made some headway over the last several years in Texas to reduce risk to improve the likelihood of us earnings our allowed ROE through mechanisms such as the transmission, cost recovery rider, the distribution cost recovery rider, with the objection -- objective rather of moving Texas closer to, as a Leo mentioned, the other jurisdictions that have more formulaic rate mechanism. So we view the proposed rider step in the right direction of reducing the risk in Texas and improving our ability to our and sustain our allowed ROE. So while it's accretive structurally, it's not material enough for us to change our outlook.
So putting that rider in some context, I think is appropriate."

But I can just tell you kind of the process that we go forward through. Obviously, our objective is to get to the point where your earnings and dividend growth more closely match than they have over the last few years, that's why we started dividend increases long before we got into that payout ratio target.
Certainly, tax reforms had an impact on that. One thing that I would say in your discussion that is not necessarily true is that the capital plan reduction. If you go back to the 2013 to 2015 timeframe, that 3-year plan, our capital plan was about $6 million over the 3 years. I think the one in the presentation today is $11.7 billion, so it's a doubling of CapEx in that time frame. While we've been able to maintain some of the lowest rates in the United States. So we would anticipate if we can continue to manage the business with rate levels as attractive as they are, keep customers bills low, that gives us the opportunity to continue to invest more on behalf of our customers to improve technology, to higher level of service at a little price. That's our objective. So that piece of your discussion where CapEx should be trending down or just not necessarily correct. I don't think going we will going the other direction. So all of those things will come into consideration. You are right on our objective is to get to the point where our earnings growth and dividend growth were closely match. It is something that will come out within the year normally with the board point of view on that and then we will take it them. But On tax reform, the growing capital budget, where we are in the range, what do we see earnings going and opportunities associated with that, will all be factors that play into it."

We had a productive start to the year, and today, we are reporting first quarter adjusted earnings of $0.82 per share. While weather was a headwind, we remain firmly on track to achieve our full year guidance",1689,"Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. We had a productive start to the year, and today, we are reporting first quarter adjusted earnings of $0.82 per share. While weather was a headwind, we remain firmly on track to achieve our full year guidance and our longer-term outlooks. We checked off every first quarter key deliverable and we added an important new milestone. We announced our agreement for a postshutdown sale of Indian Point to Holtec International. With this announcement, we now have definitive agreements to sell all of EWC's remaining nuclear assets. We will shut down Pilgrim this month and we plan to close on the sale of that plant by the end of the year.
We will then shut down Indian Point Unit 2 next year and Unit 3 in 2021. The sale of all Indian Point units is expected to close in the third quarter 2021, and we expect to complete the Palisades transaction after its shut down in 2022. The sales of these plants are important. Not only do they secure our orderly exit from the merchant business, but they do so in a way that benefits stakeholders by accelerating the decommissioning time line, drawing on industry-leading decommissioning and site remediation expertise and experience and laying the foundation for future business development opportunities in the regions. We are grateful to our nuclear teams who remained focused on finishing strong with safe and secure operations. Our Pilgrim employees are a shining example of this hard work, commitment and dedication. In March, Pilgrim returned to normal baseline oversight by the NRC, moving to Column 1 in the agency's reactor oversight program. Over the last 2 years, Pilgrim's 600 employees exhibited professionalism and pride resulting in this important milestone for our organization.
At the Utility business, we also executed on key deliverables in the quarter. We continued to pursue our commitment to renewable resources and 2 of our operating companies, Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Texas have each issued requests for proposals for 200 megawatts of solar resources. Entergy Arkansas also announced plans for a 100-megawatt solar facility. This project, pending approval by Arkansas Public Service Commission, will be the largest utility-owned solar facility in the state and the first to feature battery storage. The facility is expected to be in service by 2021.
We are pleased with the progress we continue to make on developing renewable projects as they are an important resource beyond their obvious environmental attributes. They can provide cost-effective energy supply, fuel diversity and advance the adoption of distributed energy solutions for our customers. We currently have just over 230 megawatts of renewable resources in service, including hydro, solar and biomass technologies. We also have 185 megawatts of new solar projects that have been approved and are moving forward, just under 300 megawatts that are pending regulatory approval and the 400 megawatts that I mentioned from Arkansas in Texas RFPs. And as the economics and performance of renewable resources continue to improve, we will engage with our regulators and stakeholders to expand their use across our service area.
In January, we began installment of the first automated meters. Over the next 3 years, we will install approximately 3 million automated meters across our jurisdictions, with plans to activate 1 million new meters in 2019. The new meters will benefit our customers with faster outage identification, enhanced customer service and cost savings. Additionally, these meters will provide us with the tools to help our customers manage their energy usage and lower their bills. And we will recycle the lower meters after removal. They will be sustainably dismantled yielding copper and aluminum scrap that can be recycled.
Our new build CCGT projects remain on budget and on schedule. After a little over 2 years of construction, St. Charles Power Station is in its file commissioning phase, and that plant is expected to be placed in service this quarter. Construction activity at the New Orleans Power Station kicked into high gear after the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality issued its Clean Air permit. The plant will be a much needed local resource of modern natural gas generated power for residents and businesses. In Mississippi, we continue to work through the Choctaw Generating Station acquisition to ensure that the plant is a good value for our customers. Our due diligence has identified a potential mechanical issue that may need to be addressed prior to closing. There is a possibility that closing may be delayed to allow time to resolve the issue. We will know more in the coming weeks and we'll provide an update on our next earnings call. At this point, we do not foresee a delay that would have a material financial impact. These are just a few examples of the investments we are making in our efficient and sustainable power system for the benefit of our customers.
We kicked off 2019's base rate filings with Entergy Mississippi's annual FRP, which was submitted on March 15. We are working through that process and expect new rates to be effective in June. We're also preparing to file our annual FRPs in Louisiana and Arkansas later this year. Our New Orleans rate case is ongoing and we remain on track to have new rates effective this summer and we've requested a formula rate plan to take effect next year.
In addition, proposed legislation in Texas could help reduce regulatory lag on generation investment in that jurisdiction. The legislation passed the House. It was also passed by the Senate Business & Commerce Committee, and it will now be considered by the full Senate. If signed into law, the legislation would allow the commission to approve a rider to recover reasonable and necessary generation investment, which would be more timely and less burdensome than the base rate case filing. This legislation is consistent with our desire to align regulatory structures with customer benefits. 3 of our 5 jurisdictions, which generate approximately 80% of the utility's revenue have annual formula rate plan mechanisms. These, combined with other constructs that allow for timely recovery of investments which benefit customers, provide clarity to our plans and solidify the financial commitments we've made to provide steady, predictable growth in earnings and dividends.
At Entergy, our people are critical to our success. Our employees make it possible to implement our strategy and achieve our objectives. Acquiring, retaining and developing the talent we need to meet today's business needs to and to prepare for the workplace of tomorrow are important. As part of our employee focus, we are proud to promote supportive work environments for members of the National Guard and Reserve. In recognition of this, we won the 2019 Pro Patria Award from the Department of Defense, and we were a semifinalist for the 2019 Freedom Award.
Entergy is also committed to supporting businesses in the communities we serve. The Women's Business Enterprise National Council recognized our efforts, and once again presented the prestigious America's Top Corporations for Women's Business Enterprises award to Entergy. The national award recognizes companies with world-class diversity and inclusion programs that enable growth and innovation while breaking down barriers for women-owned businesses. These awards are a good validation of our mission to create value for all of our stakeholders, customers, employees, communities and owners. We recently released our annual integrated report entitled, When does 1 = more? It illustrates how our efforts to serve the needs of each stakeholder creates value for all. Our report outlines how the emergence of new technologies enables us to build more individualized relationships with our customers and partner with them on solutions that make their lives better, and how providing opportunities for our employees to adopt new skill sets to effectively implement and manage new technologies will drive transformative change.
Entergy is also recognized as an industry leader for taking action to address climate issues. In 2001, we were the first U.S. electric utility to commit voluntarily to stabilizing greenhouse gas emissions. In 2005, we upped that commitment to capping our carbon dioxide emissions at 20% below year 2000 levels through the year 2010. Then in 2011, we extended that commitment through 2020. Even though Entergy's carbon dioxide emissions rate continues to one of the lowest among our peers, the broad consensus of current scientific data on climate change indicates that, as an industry, we must do more to reduce our footprint and that of our customers and communities. Entergy sees this not as a choice, but as a responsibility and an opportunity. That is why, in addition to our integrated report, we also released our climate scenario analysis and evaluation of risks and opportunities. This report outlines our role in meeting the worldwide imperative to reduce risk that's posed by climate change and announces a new greenhouse gas emissions goal, to reduce our CO2 emissions rate to 50% below year 2000 levels by 2030. That means that for every unit of electricity we generate in 2030, we will emit half the carbon dioxide we did in 2000.
Entergy's leadership in sustainability and social responsibility makes us a successful Fortune 500 company with a conscience. Our actions and commitments to sustainability position us to effectively benefit our stakeholders today, while securing a bright tomorrow.
For the first quarter of 2019, we continue on track of steady, successful execution of our strategy, and 2019 will be another successful year for us. Our operating and financial positions are solid and our strategic direction is clear. We are an industry leader in critical measures of sustainability. We have among the lowest retail rates in the country, and we operate one of the cleanest large-scale fleets in United States. We also benefit from strong industrial growth within our service territory, we invest in our employees and our communities, and our strategy is aligned with the goals of our regulators. This is what makes Entergy a compelling long-term investment. And this is the foundation from which we will continue to grow and innovate for the benefit of all of our stakeholders. I'll now turn the call over to Drew who will provide more detail on our first quarter financial results."
269764,608499939,1715659,"Entergy Corporation, Q1 2019 Earnings Call, May 01, 2019",2019-05-01,"Earnings Calls","Entergy Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Leo. Good morning, everyone. As Leo said, the first quarter was a productive start to the year, and we are firmly on track to meet our full year guidance and longer-term outlooks. Today, we are officially starting to report earnings using our s",594,"Thank you, Leo. Good morning, everyone. As Leo said, the first quarter was a productive start to the year, and we are firmly on track to meet our full year guidance and longer-term outlooks. Today, we are officially starting to report earnings using our simpler Entergy adjusted earnings measures, to better reflect the nature of our business going forward. And our materials and disclosures are more streamlined as a result.
Let's now turn to the numbers. As you can see on Slide 4, on a per share basis, Entergy adjusted earnings were largely flat quarter-over-quarter. Turning to Slide 5. Results of Utility are straightforward. Net revenue increased primarily from the effect of rate activity in Arkansas, Louisiana and Texas. Also with the enactment of tax reform, last year's results included regulatory charges to return the benefits of the lower federal tax rates to customers, and that lower tax rate is now reflected in customer bills.
Partially offsetting was lower volume due to the effect of weather, which was unfavorable this quarter compared to 1 year ago. Finally, a higher share count affected this quarter's results on a per share basis.
EWC's first quarter results are summarized on Slide 6. And as a reminder, EWC is now excluded from our Entergy adjusted measure. As reported, earnings were $0.60 higher than the prior year. The key driver was strong market performance on the quarter for EWC's nuclear decommissioning trust funds. A tax item, which resulted from the sale of Vermont Yankee partly offset the increase. Before leaving EWC, I would like to affirm that after accounting for the transaction cost for Indian Point, we still expect EWC to provide slightly positive net cash to parent from '19 through '22.
Slide 7 shows operating cash flow for the quarter of $501 million, a $56 million decrease from a year ago. The change was driven by the return of approximately $100 million of unprotected excess ADIT to customers as well as the effects of unfavorable weather. Lower pension contributions partially offset the decrease.
We are affirming our 2019 earnings guidance and financial outlooks, which are summarized on Slide 8. As I mentioned, we experienced unfavorable weather in the quarter. Nevertheless, we remain on track to coming around the midpoint of our 2019 guidance.
Our credit metrics are shown on Slide 10. Our parent debt to total debt has improved to 21.7%. This was largely due to the settlement of a portion of the equity forward in December. Our FFO to debt is 11.1%, but this includes the effects of returning $692 million of unprotected excess ADIT to customers. Excluding this giveback and certain items related to our exit of EWC, FFO to debt would be 15%. We expect cash flows to improve as soon as next quarter and throughout the remainder of the year assuming normal weather. We remain committed to our targeted ranges of at or above 15% for FFO to debt by 2020 and below 25% for parent debt to total debt as well as maintaining our investment grade profile.
We had a productive first quarter and we see 2019 as another successful year. The foundation is in place for us to meet our financial commitments to deliver steady, predictable growth and earnings and dividends through customer-centric investment. As Leo mentioned, our operating and financial positions are solid and our strategic direction is clear. We are continuing our mission to create sustainable value for all of our stakeholders, and we look forward to the opportunities ahead.
And now, the Entergy team is available to answer questions."

That includes some efficiencies we found early in the year, our good operations have led to some rebates for insurance premiums, a little bit of a timing into the periods like 2020, but it's not enough to change any expectations out there. And we've also seen some offsets in other areas like interest expense. We had a very active quarter, in $1.5 billion of refinancings and new money issuances. And since interest rates were lower, we were able to capture some of that versus our previous expectation. So the combination of all those things are what's helping us maintain our expectations for the year."

As we look at our industry load, we continue to see positive signs, frankly. So our industrial customers are looking at a number of spreads, commodity spreads, crack spreads, gas versus oil, geographic spreads between Henry Hub and yes, MVP for example or Brent. And so all of those -- all of the indicators continue to be green for us. Inventories are reasonable and exports are picking up. The low nature of just energy prices here on the Gulf Coast is extremely competitive worldwide. And so we are very confident in what we can see. Our current forecast is based on what we can see from an industrial perspective, and that includes petrochem, LNG, some metals and not much core alkali. It's new at this point, but core alkali has been a very strong performer for us and that market continues to get tighter. And as we look forward, we do see new opportunities in the core alkali space, in the petrochem space, there is potential for new LNG and other things. So all of that bodes well for our industrial sales expectations, and while that's good for us, the really important thing for us is it gives us incremental headroom to create investment and whether it's for those industrial customers or supported distribution operations in new ways. There is significant investment opportunity within our business as we highlighted last July. And so all of that industrial opportunity may create additional headroom for us to make those investments."

I think it's important to note that the reason why we're suggesting that the proposed legislation, keeping in mind we're -- it's still in the midst of negotiations at the legislature does not change our outlooks in terms of Texas' performance in large part because of the timing of the existing rate case process or rate case filing in Texas. So we made some headway over the last several years in Texas to reduce risk to improve the likelihood of us earning our allowed ROE through mechanisms such as the transmission, cost recovery rider, the distribution cost recovery rider, with the objection -- objective rather of moving Texas closer to, as a Leo mentioned, the other jurisdictions that have more formulaic rate mechanism. So we view the proposed rider as a step in the right direction of reducing the risk in Texas and improving our ability to earn and sustain our allowed ROE. So while it's accretive structurally, it's not material enough for us to change our outlook. So putting that rider in some context, I think is appropriate."

But I'll -- so I'll just tell you kind of a process that we go forward through. Obviously, our objective is to get to the point where your earnings and dividend growth more closely match than they have over the last few years. That's why we started the dividend increases long before we got into that payout ratio target. Certainly, tax reforms had an impact on that. One thing that I would say in your discussion that is not necessarily true is the capital plan reduction. If you go back to the 2013 to 2015 time frame, that 3-year period, our capital plan was about $6 billion over the 3 years. I think the one in the presentation today is $11.7 billion, so it's a doubling of CapEx in that time frame, while we've been able to maintain some of the lowest rates in the United States. So we would anticipate if we can continue to manage the business with rate levels as attractive as they are, keep customers' bills low, then that gives us the opportunity to continue to invest more on behalf of our customers to improve technology to higher level of service at a lower price. That's our objective. So that piece of your discussion where CapEx should be trending downward is not necessarily correct. In fact, I would think it would be going the other direction. So all of those things will come into consideration. You are right on our objective is to get to the point where our earnings growth and dividend growth more closely match. It is something that we'll come up toward the end of the year normally where the Board refreshes its point of view on that and then we will take it up with them. But on tax reform, the growing capital budget, where we are in a range what we see earnings going and the opportunities associated with that, will all be factors that play into it."

We had a productive start to the year, and today, we are reporting first quarter adjusted earnings of $0.82 per share. While weather was a headwind, we remain firmly on track to achieve our full year guidance",1689,"Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. We had a productive start to the year, and today, we are reporting first quarter adjusted earnings of $0.82 per share. While weather was a headwind, we remain firmly on track to achieve our full year guidance and our longer-term outlooks. We checked off every first quarter key deliverable and we added an important new milestone. We announced our agreement for a postshutdown sale of Indian Point to Holtec International. With this announcement, we now have definitive agreements to sell all of EWC's remaining nuclear assets. We will shut down Pilgrim this month and we plan to close on the sale of that plant by the end of the year.
We will then shut down Indian Point Unit 2 next year and Unit 3 in 2021. The sale of all Indian Point units is expected to close in the third quarter 2021, and we expect to complete the Palisades transaction after its shut down in 2022. The sales of these plants are important. Not only do they secure our orderly exit from the merchant business, but they do so in a way that benefits stakeholders by accelerating the decommissioning time line, drawing on industry-leading decommissioning and site remediation expertise and experience and laying the foundation for future business development opportunities in the regions. We are grateful to our nuclear teams who remained focused on finishing strong with safe and secure operations. Our Pilgrim employees are a shining example of this hard work, commitment and dedication. In March, Pilgrim returned to normal baseline oversight by the NRC, moving to Column 1 in the agency's reactor oversight program. Over the last 2 years, Pilgrim's 600 employees exhibited professionalism and pride resulting in this important milestone for our organization.
At the Utility business, we also executed on key deliverables in the quarter. We continued to pursue our commitment to renewable resources and 2 of our operating companies, Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Texas have each issued requests for proposals for 200 megawatts of solar resources. Entergy Arkansas also announced plans for a 100-megawatt solar facility. This project, pending approval by Arkansas Public Service Commission, will be the largest utility-owned solar facility in the state and the first to feature battery storage. The facility is expected to be in service by 2021.
We are pleased with the progress we continue to make on developing renewable projects as they are an important resource beyond their obvious environmental attributes. They can provide cost-effective energy supply, fuel diversity and advance the adoption of distributed energy solutions for our customers. We currently have just over 230 megawatts of renewable resources in service, including hydro, solar and biomass technologies. We also have 185 megawatts of new solar projects that have been approved and are moving forward, just under 300 megawatts that are pending regulatory approval and the 400 megawatts that I mentioned from Arkansas in Texas RFPs. And as the economics and performance of renewable resources continue to improve, we will engage with our regulators and stakeholders to expand their use across our service area.
In January, we began installment of the first automated meters. Over the next 3 years, we will install approximately 3 million automated meters across our jurisdictions, with plans to activate 1 million new meters in 2019. The new meters will benefit our customers with faster outage identification, enhanced customer service and cost savings. Additionally, these meters will provide us with the tools to help our customers manage their energy usage and lower their bills. And we will recycle the lower meters after removal. They will be sustainably dismantled yielding copper and aluminum scrap that can be recycled.
Our new build CCGT projects remain on budget and on schedule. After a little over 2 years of construction, St. Charles Power Station is in its file commissioning phase, and that plant is expected to be placed in service this quarter. Construction activity at the New Orleans Power Station kicked into high gear after the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality issued its Clean Air permit. The plant will be a much needed local resource of modern natural gas generated power for residents and businesses. In Mississippi, we continue to work through the Choctaw Generating Station acquisition to ensure that the plant is a good value for our customers. Our due diligence has identified a potential mechanical issue that may need to be addressed prior to closing. There is a possibility that closing may be delayed to allow time to resolve the issue. We will know more in the coming weeks and we'll provide an update on our next earnings call. At this point, we do not foresee a delay that would have a material financial impact. These are just a few examples of the investments we are making in our efficient and sustainable power system for the benefit of our customers.
We kicked off 2019's base rate filings with Entergy Mississippi's annual FRP, which was submitted on March 15. We are working through that process and expect new rates to be effective in June. We're also preparing to file our annual FRPs in Louisiana and Arkansas later this year. Our New Orleans rate case is ongoing and we remain on track to have new rates effective this summer and we've requested a formula rate plan to take effect next year.
In addition, proposed legislation in Texas could help reduce regulatory lag on generation investment in that jurisdiction. The legislation passed the House. It was also passed by the Senate Business & Commerce Committee, and it will now be considered by the full Senate. If signed into law, the legislation would allow the commission to approve a rider to recover reasonable and necessary generation investment, which would be more timely and less burdensome than the base rate case filing. This legislation is consistent with our desire to align regulatory structures with customer benefits. 3 of our 5 jurisdictions, which generate approximately 80% of the utility's revenue have annual formula rate plan mechanisms. These, combined with other constructs that allow for timely recovery of investments which benefit customers, provide clarity to our plans and solidify the financial commitments we've made to provide steady, predictable growth in earnings and dividends.
At Entergy, our people are critical to our success. Our employees make it possible to implement our strategy and achieve our objectives. Acquiring, retaining and developing the talent we need to meet today's business needs to and to prepare for the workplace of tomorrow are important. As part of our employee focus, we are proud to promote supportive work environments for members of the National Guard and Reserve. In recognition of this, we won the 2019 Pro Patria Award from the Department of Defense, and we were a semifinalist for the 2019 Freedom Award.
Entergy is also committed to supporting businesses in the communities we serve. The Women's Business Enterprise National Council recognized our efforts, and once again presented the prestigious America's Top Corporations for Women's Business Enterprises award to Entergy. The national award recognizes companies with world-class diversity and inclusion programs that enable growth and innovation while breaking down barriers for women-owned businesses. These awards are a good validation of our mission to create value for all of our stakeholders, customers, employees, communities and owners. We recently released our annual integrated report entitled, When does 1 = more? It illustrates how our efforts to serve the needs of each stakeholder creates value for all. Our report outlines how the emergence of new technologies enables us to build more individualized relationships with our customers and partner with them on solutions that make their lives better, and how providing opportunities for our employees to adopt new skill sets to effectively implement and manage new technologies will drive transformative change.
Entergy is also recognized as an industry leader for taking action to address climate issues. In 2001, we were the first U.S. electric utility to commit voluntarily to stabilizing greenhouse gas emissions. In 2005, we upped that commitment to capping our carbon dioxide emissions at 20% below year 2000 levels through the year 2010. Then in 2011, we extended that commitment through 2020. Even though Entergy's carbon dioxide emissions rate continues to one of the lowest among our peers, the broad consensus of current scientific data on climate change indicates that, as an industry, we must do more to reduce our footprint and that of our customers and communities. Entergy sees this not as a choice, but as a responsibility and an opportunity. That is why, in addition to our integrated report, we also released our climate scenario analysis and evaluation of risks and opportunities. This report outlines our role in meeting the worldwide imperative to reduce risk that's posed by climate change and announces a new greenhouse gas emissions goal, to reduce our CO2 emissions rate to 50% below year 2000 levels by 2030. That means that for every unit of electricity we generate in 2030, we will emit half the carbon dioxide we did in 2000.
Entergy's leadership in sustainability and social responsibility makes us a successful Fortune 500 company with a conscience. Our actions and commitments to sustainability position us to effectively benefit our stakeholders today, while securing a bright tomorrow.
For the first quarter of 2019, we continue on track of steady, successful execution of our strategy, and 2019 will be another successful year for us. Our operating and financial positions are solid and our strategic direction is clear. We are an industry leader in critical measures of sustainability. We have among the lowest retail rates in the country, and we operate one of the cleanest large-scale fleets in United States. We also benefit from strong industrial growth within our service territory, we invest in our employees and our communities, and our strategy is aligned with the goals of our regulators. This is what makes Entergy a compelling long-term investment. And this is the foundation from which we will continue to grow and innovate for the benefit of all of our stakeholders. I'll now turn the call over to Drew who will provide more detail on our first quarter financial results."

And our materials and disclosures are more streamlined as a result.
Let's now turn to the numbers. As you can see on Slide 4, on a per share basis, Entergy adjusted earnings were largely flat quarter-over-quarter. Turning to Slide 5. Results of Utility are straightforward. Net revenue increased primarily from the effect of rate activity in Arkansas, Louisiana and Texas. Also with the enactment of tax reform, last year's results included regulatory charges to return the benefits of the lower federal tax rates to customers, and that lower tax rate is now reflected in customer bills.
Partially offsetting was lower volume due to the effect of weather, which was unfavorable this quarter compared to 1 year ago. Finally, a higher share count affected this quarter's results on a per share basis.
EWC's first quarter results are summarized on Slide 6. And as a reminder, EWC is now excluded from our Entergy adjusted measure. As reported, earnings were $0.60 higher than the prior year. The key driver was strong market performance on the quarter for EWC's nuclear decommissioning trust funds. A tax item, which resulted from the sale of Vermont Yankee partly offset the increase. Before leaving EWC, I would like to affirm that after accounting for the transaction cost for Indian Point, we still expect EWC to provide slightly positive net cash to parent from '19 through '22.
Slide 7 shows operating cash flow for the quarter of $501 million, a $56 million decrease from a year ago. The change was driven by the return of approximately $100 million of unprotected excess ADIT to customers as well as the effects of unfavorable weather. Lower pension contributions partially offset the decrease.
We are affirming our 2019 earnings guidance and financial outlooks, which are summarized on Slide 8. As I mentioned, we experienced unfavorable weather in the quarter. Nevertheless, we remain on track to coming around the midpoint of our 2019 guidance.
Our credit metrics are shown on Slide 10. Our parent debt to total debt has improved to 21.7%. This was largely due to the settlement of a portion of the equity forward in December. Our FFO to debt is 11.1%, but this includes the effects of returning $692 million of unprotected excess ADIT to customers. Excluding this giveback and certain items related to our exit of EWC, FFO to debt would be 15%. We expect cash flows to improve as soon as next quarter and throughout the remainder of the year assuming normal weather. We remain committed to our targeted ranges of at or above 15% for FFO to debt by 2020 and below 25% for parent debt to total debt as well as maintaining our investment grade profile.
We had a productive first quarter and we see 2019 as another successful year. The foundation is in place for us to meet our financial commitments to deliver steady, predictable growth and earnings and dividends through customer-centric investment. As Leo mentioned, our operating and financial positions are solid and our strategic direction is clear. We are continuing our mission to create sustainable value for all of our stakeholders, and we look forward to the opportunities ahead.
And now, the Entergy team is available to answer questions."

And we've also seen some offsets in other areas like interest expense. We had a very active quarter, in $1.5 billion of refinancings and new money issuances. And since interest rates were lower, we were able to capture some of that versus our previous expectation. So the combination of all those things are what's helping us maintain our expectations for the year."

So our industrial customers are looking at a number of spreads, commodity spreads, crack spreads, gas versus oil, geographic spreads between Henry Hub and yes, MVP for example or Brent. And so all of those -- all of the indicators continue to be green for us. Inventories are reasonable and exports are picking up. The low nature of just energy prices here on the Gulf Coast is extremely competitive worldwide. And so we are very confident in what we can see. Our current forecast is based on what we can see from an industrial perspective, and that includes petrochem, LNG, some metals and not much core alkali. It's new at this point, but core alkali has been a very strong performer for us and that market continues to get tighter. And as we look forward, we do see new opportunities in the core alkali space, in the petrochem space, there is potential for new LNG and other things. So all of that bodes well for our industrial sales expectations, and while that's good for us, the really important thing for us is it gives us incremental headroom to create investment and whether it's for those industrial customers or supported distribution operations in new ways. There is significant investment opportunity within our business as we highlighted last July.

I think it's important to note that the reason why we're suggesting that the proposed legislation, keeping in mind we're -- it's still in the midst of negotiations at the legislature does not change our outlooks in terms of Texas' performance in large part because of the timing of the existing rate case process or rate case filing in Texas. So we made some headway over the last several years in Texas to reduce risk to improve the likelihood of us earning our allowed ROE through mechanisms such as the transmission, cost recovery rider, the distribution cost recovery rider, with the objection -- objective rather of moving Texas closer to, as a Leo mentioned, the other jurisdictions that have more formulaic rate mechanism. So we view the proposed rider as a step in the right direction of reducing the risk in Texas and improving our ability to earn and sustain our allowed ROE. So while it's accretive structurally, it's not material enough for us to change our outlook. So putting that rider in some context, I think is appropriate."

Like I said earlier, we will continue to keep an eye on things. If renewables started to become much more economic and the window was still open on the production or the investment tax credits, certainly, we would look to accelerate if we thought that was the right thing."

Your payout ratio, based on your guidance, should be in the bottom half of your range. You have the bulk of the risk with respect to Indian Point now behind now, and then finally, your CapEx has got a little bit of a downward trajectory with some of the generation being completed. Does this put the Board in a better position to increase the dividend closer to the EPS growth rate? And I realize you can't speak for the Board, but do I at least have the right factors or is there something else I'm forgetting?"

But I'll -- so I'll just tell you kind of a process that we go forward through. Obviously, our objective is to get to the point where your earnings and dividend growth more closely match than they have over the last few years. That's why we started the dividend increases long before we got into that payout ratio target. Certainly, tax reforms had an impact on that. One thing that I would say in your discussion that is not necessarily true is the capital plan reduction. If you go back to the 2013 to 2015 time frame, that 3-year period, our capital plan was about $6 billion over the 3 years. I think the one in the presentation today is $11.7 billion, so it's a doubling of CapEx in that time frame, while we've been able to maintain some of the lowest rates in the United States. So we would anticipate if we can continue to manage the business with rate levels as attractive as they are, keep customers' bills low, then that gives us the opportunity to continue to invest more on behalf of our customers to improve technology to higher level of service at a lower price. That's our objective. So that piece of your discussion where CapEx should be trending downward is not necessarily correct. In fact, I would think it would be going the other direction. So all of those things will come into consideration. You are right on our objective is to get to the point where our earnings growth and dividend growth more closely match. It is something that we'll come up toward the end of the year normally where the Board refreshes its point of view on that and then we will take it up with them. But on tax reform, the growing capital budget, where we are in a range what we see earnings going and the opportunities associated with that, will all be factors that play into it."

We had a productive start to the year, and today, we are reporting first quarter adjusted earnings of $0.82 per share. While weather was a headwind, we remain firmly on track to achieve our full year guidance",1688,"Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. We had a productive start to the year, and today, we are reporting first quarter adjusted earnings of $0.82 per share. While weather was a headwind, we remain firmly on track to achieve our full year guidance and our longer-term outlooks. We checked off every first quarter key deliverable and we added an important new milestone. We announced our agreement for a postshutdown sale of Indian Point to Holtec International. With this announcement, we now have definitive agreements to sell all of EWC's remaining nuclear assets. We will shut down Pilgrim this month and we plan to close on the sale of that plant by the end of the year.
We will then shut down Indian Point Unit 2 next year and Unit 3 in 2021. The sale of all Indian Point units is expected to close in the third quarter 2021, and we expect to complete the Palisades transaction after its shut down in 2022. The sales of these plants are important. Not only do they secure our orderly exit from the merchant business, but they do so in a way that benefits stakeholders by accelerating the decommissioning time line, drawing on industry-leading decommissioning and site remediation expertise and experience and laying the foundation for future business development opportunities in the regions. We are grateful to our nuclear teams who remained focused on finishing strong with safe and secure operations. Our Pilgrim employees are a shining example of this hard work, commitment and dedication. In March, Pilgrim returned to normal baseline oversight by the NRC, moving to Column 1 in the agency's reactor oversight program. Over the last two years, Pilgrim's 600 employees exhibited professionalism and pride resulting in this important milestone for our organization.
At the Utility business, we also executed on key deliverables in the quarter. We continued to pursue our commitment to renewable resources and two of our operating companies, Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Texas have each issued requests for proposals for 200 megawatts of solar resources. Entergy Arkansas also announced plans for a 100-megawatt solar facility. This project, pending approval by Arkansas Public Service Commission, will be the largest utility-owned solar facility in the state and the first to feature battery storage. The facility is expected to be in service by 2021.
We are pleased with the progress we continue to make on developing renewable projects as they are an important resource beyond their obvious environmental attributes. They can provide cost-effective energy supply, fuel diversity and advance the adoption of distributed energy solutions for our customers. We currently have just over 230 megawatts of renewable resources in service, including hydro, solar and biomass technologies. We also have 185 megawatts of new solar projects that have been approved and are moving forward, just under 300 megawatts that are pending regulatory approval and the 400 megawatts that I mentioned from Arkansas in Texas RFPs. And as the economics and performance of renewable resources continue to improve, we will engage with our regulators and stakeholders to expand their use across our service area.
In January, we began installment of the first automated meters. Over the next three years, we will install approximately 3 million automated meters across our jurisdictions, with plans to activate 1 million new meters in 2019. The new meters will benefit our customers with faster outage identification, enhanced customer service and cost savings. Additionally, these meters will provide us with the tools to help our customers manage their energy usage and lower their bills. And we will recycle the lower meters after removal. They will be sustainably dismantled yielding copper and aluminum scrap that can be recycled.
Our new build CCGT projects remain on budget and on schedule. After a little over two years of construction, St. Charles Power Station is in its final commissioning phase, and that plant is expected to be placed in service this quarter. Construction activity at the New Orleans Power Station kicked into high gear after the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality issued its Clean Air permit. The plant will be a much needed local resource of modern natural gas generated power for residents and businesses. In Mississippi, we continue to work through the Choctaw Generating Station acquisition to ensure that the plant is a good value for our customers. Our due diligence has identified a potential mechanical issue that may need to be addressed prior to closing. There is a possibility that closing may be delayed to allow time to resolve the issue. We will know more in the coming weeks and we'll provide an update on our next earnings call. At this point, we do not foresee a delay that would have a material financial impact. These are just a few examples of the investments we are making in our efficient and sustainable power system for the benefit of our customers.
We kicked off 2019's base rate filings with Entergy Mississippi's annual FRP, which was submitted on March 15. We are working through that process and expect new rates to be effective in June. We're also preparing to file our annual FRPs in Louisiana and Arkansas later this year. Our New Orleans rate case is ongoing and we remain on track to have new rates effective this summer and we've requested a formula rate plan to take effect next year.
In addition, proposed legislation in Texas could help reduce regulatory lag on generation investment in that jurisdiction. The legislation passed the House. It was also passed by the Senate Business & Commerce Committee, and it will now be considered by the full Senate. If signed into law, the legislation would allow the commission to approve a rider to recover reasonable and necessary generation investment, which would be more timely and less burdensome than the base rate case filing. This legislation is consistent with our desire to align regulatory structures with customer benefits. Three of our five jurisdictions, which generate approximately 80% of the utility's revenue have annual formula rate plan mechanisms. These, combined with other constructs that allow for timely recovery of investments which benefit customers, provide clarity to our plans and solidify the financial commitments we've made to provide steady, predictable growth in earnings and dividends.
At Entergy, our people are critical to our success. Our employees make it possible to implement our strategy and achieve our objectives. Acquiring, retaining and developing the talent we need to meet today's business needs and to prepare for the workplace of tomorrow are important. As part of our employee focus, we are proud to promote supportive work environments for members of the National Guard and Reserve. In recognition of this, we won the 2019 Pro Patria Award from the Department of Defense, and we were a semifinalist for the 2019 Freedom Award.
Entergy is also committed to supporting businesses in the communities we serve. The Women's Business Enterprise National Council recognized our efforts, and once again presented the prestigious America's Top Corporations for Women's Business Enterprises award to Entergy. The national award recognizes companies with world-class diversity and inclusion programs that enable growth and innovation while breaking down barriers for women-owned businesses. These awards are a good validation of our mission to create value for all of our stakeholders, customers, employees, communities and owners. We recently released our annual integrated report entitled, When does 1 = more? It illustrates how our efforts to serve the needs of each stakeholder creates value for all. Our report outlines how the emergence of new technologies enables us to build more individualized relationships with our customers and partner with them on solutions that make their lives better, and how providing opportunities for our employees to adopt new skill sets to effectively implement and manage new technologies will drive transformative change.
Entergy is also recognized as an industry leader for taking action to address climate issues. In 2001, we were the first U.S. electric utility to commit voluntarily to stabilizing greenhouse gas emissions. In 2005, we upped that commitment to capping our carbon dioxide emissions at 20% below year 2000 levels through the year 2010. Then in 2011, we extended that commitment through 2020. Even though Entergy's carbon dioxide emissions rate continues to one of the lowest among our peers, the broad consensus of current scientific data on climate change indicates that, as an industry, we must do more to reduce our footprint and that of our customers and communities. Entergy sees this not as a choice, but as a responsibility and an opportunity. That is why, in addition to our integrated report, we also released our climate scenario analysis and evaluation of risks and opportunities. This report outlines our role in meeting the worldwide imperative to reduce risk that's posed by climate change and announces a new greenhouse gas emissions goal, to reduce our CO2 emissions rate to 50% below year 2000 levels by 2030. That means that for every unit of electricity we generate in 2030, we will emit half the carbon dioxide we did in 2000.
Entergy's leadership in sustainability and social responsibility makes us a successful Fortune 500 company with a conscience. Our actions and commitments to sustainability position us to effectively benefit our stakeholders today, while securing a bright tomorrow.
For the first quarter of 2019, we continue on track of steady, successful execution of our strategy, and 2019 will be another successful year for us. Our operating and financial positions are solid and our strategic direction is clear. We are an industry leader in critical measures of sustainability. We have among the lowest retail rates in the country, and we operate one of the cleanest large-scale fleets in United States. We also benefit from strong industrial growth within our service territory, we invest in our employees and our communities, and our strategy is aligned with the goals of our regulators. This is what makes Entergy a compelling long-term investment. And this is the foundation from which we will continue to grow and innovate for the benefit of all of our stakeholders. I'll now turn the call over to Drew who will provide more detail on our first quarter financial results."

As Leo said, the first quarter was a productive start to the year, and we are firmly on track to meet our full year guidance and longer-term outlooks. Today, we are officially starting to report earnings using our s",594,"Thank you, Leo. Good morning, everyone. As Leo said, the first quarter was a productive start to the year, and we are firmly on track to meet our full year guidance and longer-term outlooks. Today, we are officially starting to report earnings using our simpler Entergy adjusted earnings measures, to better reflect the nature of our business going forward. And our materials and disclosures are more streamlined as a result.
Let's now turn to the numbers. As you can see on Slide 4, on a per share basis, Entergy adjusted earnings were largely flat quarter-over-quarter. Turning to Slide 5. Results of Utility are straightforward. Net revenue increased primarily from the effect of rate activity in Arkansas, Louisiana and Texas. Also with the enactment of tax reform, last year's results included regulatory charges to return the benefits of the lower federal tax rates to customers, and that lower tax rate is now reflected in customer bills.
Partially offsetting was lower volume due to the effect of weather, which was unfavorable this quarter compared to one year ago. Finally, a higher share count affected this quarter's results on a per share basis.
EWC's first quarter results are summarized on Slide 6. And as a reminder, EWC is now excluded from our Entergy adjusted measure. As reported, earnings were $0.60 higher than the prior year. The key driver was strong market performance on the quarter for EWC's nuclear decommissioning trust funds. A tax item, which resulted from the sale of Vermont Yankee partly offset the increase. Before leaving EWC, I would like to affirm that after accounting for the transaction cost for Indian Point, we still expect EWC to provide slightly positive net cash to parent from '19 through '22.
Slide 7 shows operating cash flow for the quarter of $501 million, a $56 million decrease from a year ago. The change was driven by the return of approximately $100 million of unprotected excess ADIT to customers as well as the effects of unfavorable weather. Lower pension contributions partially offset the decrease.
We are affirming our 2019 earnings guidance and financial outlooks, which are summarized on Slide 8. As I mentioned, we experienced unfavorable weather in the quarter. Nevertheless, we remain on track to coming around the midpoint of our 2019 guidance.
Our credit metrics are shown on Slide 10. Our apparent debt to total debt has improved to 21.7%. This was largely due to the settlement of a portion of the equity forward in December. Our FFO to debt is 11.1%, but this includes the effects of returning $692 million of unprotected excess ADIT to customers. Excluding this giveback and certain items related to our exit of EWC, FFO to debt would be 15%. We expect cash flows to improve as soon as next quarter and throughout the remainder of the year assuming normal weather. We remain committed to our targeted ranges of at or above 15% for FFO to debt by 2020 and below 25% for parent debt to total debt as well as maintaining our investment grade profile.
We had a productive first quarter and we see 2019 as another successful year. The foundation is in place for us to meet our financial commitments to deliver steady, predictable growth and earnings and dividends through customer-centric investment. As Leo mentioned, our operating and financial positions are solid and our strategic direction is clear. We are continuing our mission to create sustainable value for all of our stakeholders, and we look forward to the opportunities ahead.

And so all of those -- all of the indicators continue to be green for us. Inventories are reasonable and exports are picking up. The low nature of just energy prices here on the Gulf Coast is extremely competitive worldwide. And so we are very confident in what we can see. Our current forecast is based on what we can see from an industrial perspective, and that includes petrochem, LNG, sub metals and not much core alkali. It's new at this point, but core alkali has been a very strong performer for us and that market continues to get tighter. And as we look forward, we do see new opportunities in the core alkali space, in the petrochem space, there is potential for new LNG and other things. So all of that bodes well for our industrial sales expectations, and while that's good for us, the really important thing for us is it gives us incremental headroom to create investment and whether it's for those industrial customers or supported distribution operations in new ways. There is significant investment opportunity within our business as we highlighted last July.

I think it's important to note that the reason why we're suggesting that the proposed legislation, keeping in mind we're -- it's still in the midst of negotiations at the legislature does not change our outlooks in terms of Texas' performance in large part because of the timing of the existing rate case process or rate case filing in Texas. So we made some headway over the last several years in Texas to reduce risk to improve the likelihood of us earning our allowed ROE through mechanisms such as the transmission, cost recovery rider, the distribution cost recovery rider, with the objection -- objective rather of moving Texas closer to, as a Leo mentioned, the other jurisdictions that have more formulaic rate mechanism. So we view the proposed rider as a step in the right direction of reducing the risk in Texas and improving our ability to earn and sustain our allowed ROE. So while it's accretive structurally, it's not material enough for us to change our outlook. So putting that rider in some context, I think is appropriate."

But I'll -- so I'll just tell you kind of a process that we go forward through. Obviously, our objective is to get to the point where your earnings and dividend growth more closely match than they have over the last few years. That's why we started the dividend increases long before we got into that payout ratio target. Certainly, tax reforms had an impact on that. One thing that I would say in your discussion that is not necessarily true is the capital plan reduction. If you go back to the 2013 to 2015 time frame, that 3-year period, our capital plan was about $6 billion over the 3 years. I think the one in the presentation today is $11.7 billion, so it's a doubling of CapEx in that time frame, while we've been able to maintain some of the lowest rates in the United States. So we would anticipate if we can continue to manage the business with rate levels as attractive as they are, keep customers' bills low, then that gives us the opportunity to continue to invest more on behalf of our customers to improve technology to higher level of service at a lower price. That's our objective. So that piece of your discussion where CapEx should be trending downward is not necessarily correct. In fact, I would think it would be going the other direction. So all of those things will come into consideration. You are right on our objective is to get to the point where our earnings growth and dividend growth more closely match. It is something that we'll come up toward the end of the year normally where the Board refreshes its point of view on that and then we will take it up with them. But on tax reform, the growing capital budget, where we are in a range what we see earnings going and the opportunities associated with that, will all be factors that play into it."

We had a productive start to the year, and today, we are reporting first quarter adjusted earnings of $0.82 per share. While weather was a headwind, we remain firmly on track to achieve our full year guidance",1688,"Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. We had a productive start to the year, and today, we are reporting first quarter adjusted earnings of $0.82 per share. While weather was a headwind, we remain firmly on track to achieve our full year guidance and our longer-term outlooks. We checked off every first quarter key deliverable and we added an important new milestone. We announced our agreement for a post shutdown sale of Indian Point to Holtec International. With this announcement, we now have definitive agreements to sell all of EWC's remaining nuclear assets. We will shut down Pilgrim this month and we plan to close on the sale of that plant by the end of the year.
We will then shut down Indian Point Unit 2 next year and Unit 3 in 2021. The sale of all Indian Point units is expected to close in the third quarter 2021, and we expect to complete the Palisades transaction after its shutdown in 2022. The sales of these plants are important. Not only do they secure our orderly exit from the merchant business, but they do so in a way that benefits stakeholders by accelerating the decommissioning time line, drawing on industry-leading decommissioning and site remediation expertise and experience and laying the foundation for future business development opportunities in the regions. We are grateful to our nuclear teams who remained focused on finishing strong with safe and secure operations. Our Pilgrim employees are a shining example of this hard work, commitment and dedication. In March, Pilgrim returned to normal baseline oversight by the NRC, moving to Column 1 in the agency's reactor oversight program. Over the last 2 years, Pilgrim's 600 employees exhibited professionalism and pride resulting in this important milestone for our organization.
At the Utility business, we also executed on key deliverables in the quarter. We continued to pursue our commitment to renewable resources and 2 of our operating companies, Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Texas have each issued requests for proposals for 200 megawatts of solar resources. Entergy Arkansas also announced plans for a 100-megawatt solar facility. This project, pending approval by Arkansas Public Service Commission, will be the largest utility-owned solar facility in the state and the first to feature battery storage. The facility is expected to be in service by 2021.
We are pleased with the progress we continue to make on developing renewable projects as they are an important resource beyond their obvious environmental attributes. They can provide cost-effective energy supply, fuel diversity and advance the adoption of distributed energy solutions for our customers. We currently have just over 230 megawatts of renewable resources in service, including hydro, solar and biomass technologies. We also have 185 megawatts of new solar projects that have been approved and are moving forward, just under 300 megawatts that are pending regulatory approval and the 400 megawatts that I mentioned from Arkansas in Texas RFPs. And as the economics and performance of renewable resources continue to improve, we will engage with our regulators and stakeholders to expand their use across our service area.
In January, we began installment of the first automated meters. Over the next 3 years, we will install approximately 3 million automated meters across our jurisdictions, with plans to activate 1 million new meters in 2019. The new meters will benefit our customers with faster outage identification, enhanced customer service and cost savings. Additionally, these meters will provide us with the tools to help our customers manage their energy usage and lower their bills. And we will recycle the lower meters after removal. They will be sustainably dismantled yielding copper and aluminum scrap that can be recycled.
Our new build CCGT projects remain on budget and on schedule. After a little over 2 years of construction, St. Charles Power Station is in its final commissioning phase, and that plant is expected to be placed in service this quarter. Construction activity at the New Orleans Power Station kicked into high gear after the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality issued its Clean Air permit. The plant will be a much needed local resource of modern natural gas generated power for residents and businesses. In Mississippi, we continue to work through the Choctaw Generating Station acquisition to ensure that the plant is a good value for our customers. Our due diligence has identified a potential mechanical issue that may need to be addressed prior to closing. There is a possibility that closing may be delayed to allow time to resolve the issue. We will know more in the coming weeks and we'll provide an update on our next earnings call. At this point, we do not foresee a delay that would have a material financial impact. These are just a few examples of the investments we are making in our efficient and sustainable power system for the benefit of our customers.
We kicked off 2019's base rate filings with Entergy Mississippi's annual FRP, which was submitted on March 15. We are working through that process and expect new rates to be effective in June. We're also preparing to file our annual FRPs in Louisiana and Arkansas later this year. Our New Orleans rate case is ongoing and we remain on track to have new rates effective this summer and we've requested a formula rate plan to take effect next year.
In addition, proposed legislation in Texas could help reduce regulatory lag on generation investment in that jurisdiction. The legislation passed the House. It was also passed by the Senate Business & Commerce Committee, and it will now be considered by the full Senate. If signed into law, the legislation would allow the commission to approve a rider to recover reasonable and necessary generation investment, which would be more timely and less burdensome than the base rate case filing. This legislation is consistent with our desire to align regulatory structures with customer benefits. 3 of our 5 jurisdictions, which generate approximately 80% of the utility's revenue have annual formula rate plan mechanisms. These, combined with other constructs that allow for timely recovery of investments which benefit customers, provide clarity to our plans and solidify the financial commitments we've made to provide steady, predictable growth in earnings and dividends.
At Entergy, our people are critical to our success. Our employees make it possible to implement our strategy and achieve our objectives. Acquiring, retaining and developing the talent we need to meet today's business needs and to prepare for the workplace of tomorrow are important. As part of our employee focus, we are proud to promote supportive work environments for members of the National Guard and Reserve. In recognition of this, we won the 2019 Pro Patria Award from the Department of Defense, and we were a semifinalist for the 2019 Freedom Award.
Entergy is also committed to supporting businesses in the communities we serve. The Women's Business Enterprise National Council recognized our efforts, and once again presented the prestigious America's Top Corporations for Women's Business Enterprises award to Entergy. The national award recognizes companies with world-class diversity and inclusion programs that enable growth and innovation while breaking down barriers for women-owned businesses. These awards are a good validation of our mission to create value for all of our stakeholders, customers, employees, communities and owners. We recently released our annual integrated report entitled, When does 1 = more? It illustrates how our efforts to serve the needs of each stakeholder creates value for all. Our report outlines how the emergence of new technologies enables us to build more individualized relationships with our customers and partner with them on solutions that make their lives better, and how providing opportunities for our employees to adopt new skill sets to effectively implement and manage new technologies will drive transformative change.
Entergy is also recognized as an industry leader for taking action to address climate issues. In 2001, we were the first U.S. electric utility to commit voluntarily to stabilizing greenhouse gas emissions. In 2005, we upped that commitment to capping our carbon dioxide emissions at 20% below year 2000 levels through the year 2010. Then in 2011, we extended that commitment through 2020. Even though Entergy's carbon dioxide emissions rate continues to one of the lowest among our peers, the broad consensus of current scientific data on climate change indicates that, as an industry, we must do more to reduce our footprint and that of our customers and communities. Entergy sees this not as a choice, but as a responsibility and an opportunity. That is why, in addition to our integrated report, we also released our climate scenario analysis and evaluation of risks and opportunities. This report outlines our role in meeting the worldwide imperative to reduce risk that's posed by climate change and announces a new greenhouse gas emissions goal, to reduce our CO2 emissions rate to 50% below year 2000 levels by 2030. That means that for every unit of electricity we generate in 2030, we will emit half the carbon dioxide we did in 2000.
Entergy's leadership in sustainability and social responsibility makes us a successful Fortune 500 company with a conscience. Our actions and commitments to sustainability position us to effectively benefit our stakeholders today, while securing a bright tomorrow.
For the first quarter of 2019, we continue on track of steady, successful execution of our strategy, and 2019 will be another successful year for us. Our operating and financial positions are solid and our strategic direction is clear. We are an industry leader in critical measures of sustainability. We have among the lowest retail rates in the country, and we operate one of the cleanest large-scale fleets in United States. We also benefit from strong industrial growth within our service territory, we invest in our employees and our communities, and our strategy is aligned with the goals of our regulators. This is what makes Entergy a compelling long-term investment. And this is the foundation from which we will continue to grow and innovate for the benefit of all of our stakeholders. 
I'll now turn the call over to Drew who will provide more detail on our first quarter financial results."

As Leo said, the first quarter was a productive start to the year, and we are firmly on track to meet our full year guidance and longer-term outlooks. Today, we are officially starting to report earnings using our s",594,"Thank you, Leo. Good morning, everyone. As Leo said, the first quarter was a productive start to the year, and we are firmly on track to meet our full year guidance and longer-term outlooks. Today, we are officially starting to report earnings using our simpler Entergy adjusted earnings measures, to better reflect the nature of our business going forward. And our materials and disclosures are more streamlined as a result.
Let's now turn to the numbers. As you can see on Slide 4, on a per share basis, Entergy adjusted earnings were largely flat quarter-over-quarter. Turning to Slide 5. Results of Utility are straightforward. Net revenue increased primarily from the effect of rate activity in Arkansas, Louisiana and Texas. Also with the enactment of tax reform, last year's results included regulatory charges to return the benefits of the lower federal tax rates to customers, and that lower tax rate is now reflected in customer bills.
Partially offsetting was lower volume due to the effect of weather, which was unfavorable this quarter compared to 1 year ago. Finally, a higher share count affected this quarter's results on a per share basis.
EWC's first quarter results are summarized on Slide 6. And as a reminder, EWC is now excluded from our Entergy adjusted measure. As reported, earnings were $0.60 higher than the prior year. The key driver was strong market performance on the quarter for EWC's nuclear decommissioning trust funds. A tax item, which resulted from the sale of Vermont Yankee partly offset the increase. Before leaving EWC, I would like to affirm that after accounting for the transaction cost for Indian Point, we still expect EWC to provide slightly positive net cash to parent from '19 through '22.
Slide 7 shows operating cash flow for the quarter of $501 million, a $56 million decrease from a year ago. The change was driven by the return of approximately $100 million of unprotected excess ADIT to customers as well as the effects of unfavorable weather. Lower pension contributions partially offset the decrease.
We are affirming our 2019 earnings guidance and financial outlooks, which are summarized on Slide 8. As I mentioned, we experienced unfavorable weather in the quarter. Nevertheless, we remain on track to coming around the midpoint of our 2019 guidance.
Our credit metrics are shown on Slide 10. Our apparent debt to total debt has improved to 21.7%. This was largely due to the settlement of a portion of the equity forward in December. Our FFO to debt is 11.1%, but this includes the effects of returning $692 million of unprotected excess ADIT to customers. Excluding this giveback and certain items related to our exit of EWC, FFO to debt would be 15%. We expect cash flows to improve as soon as next quarter and throughout the remainder of the year assuming normal weather. We remain committed to our targeted ranges of at or above 15% for FFO to debt by 2020 and below 25% for parent debt to total debt as well as maintaining our investment grade profile.
We had a productive first quarter and we see 2019 as another successful year. The foundation is in place for us to meet our financial commitments to deliver steady, predictable growth and earnings and dividends through customer-centric investment. As Leo mentioned, our operating and financial positions are solid and our strategic direction is clear. We are continuing our mission to create sustainable value for all of our stakeholders, and we look forward to the opportunities ahead.

That includes some efficiencies we found early in the year, our good operations have led to some rebates for insurance premiums, a little bit of a timing into the periods like 2020, but it's not enough to change any expectations out there. And we've also seen some offsets in other areas like interest expense. We had a very active quarter, in $1.5 billion of refinancings and new money issuances. And since interest rates were lower, we were able to capture some of that versus our previous expectation.

Like what does the current economic climate look like in terms of the risk of being sort of either over or under you base case demand growth expectations?"

As we look at our industry load, we continue to see positive signs, frankly. So our industrial customers are looking at a number of spreads, commodity spreads, crack spreads, gas versus oil, geographic spreads between Henry Hub and yes, MVP for example or Brent. And so all of those -- all of the indicators continue to be green for us. Inventories are reasonable and exports are picking up. The low nature of just energy prices here on the Gulf Coast is extremely competitive worldwide. And so we are very confident in what we can see. Our current forecast is based on what we can see from an industrial perspective, and that includes petrochem, LNG, sub metals and not much core alkali. 
It's new at this point, but core alkali has been a very strong performer for us and that market continues to get tighter. And as we look forward, we do see new opportunities in the core alkali space, in the petrochem space, there is potential for new LNG and other things. So all of that bodes well for our industrial sales expectations, and while that's good for us, the really important thing for us is it gives us incremental headroom to create investment and whether it's for those industrial customers or supported distribution operations in new ways. There is significant investment opportunity within our business as we highlighted last July. And so all of that industrial opportunity may create additional headroom for us to make those investments."

I think it's important to note that the reason why we're suggesting that the proposed legislation, keeping in mind we're -- it's still in the midst of negotiations at the legislature does not change our outlooks in terms of Texas' performance in large part because of the timing of the existing rate case process or rate case filing in Texas. So we made some headway over the last several years in Texas to reduce risk to improve the likelihood of us earning our allowed ROE through mechanisms such as the transmission, cost recovery rider, the distribution cost recovery rider, with the objection -- objective rather of moving Texas closer to, as a Leo mentioned, the other jurisdictions that have more formulaic rate mechanism. So we view the proposed rider as a step in the right direction of reducing the risk in Texas and improving our ability to earn and sustain our allowed ROE. So while it's accretive structurally, it's not material enough for us to change our outlook. So putting that rider in some context, I think is appropriate."

But I'll -- so I'll just tell you kind of a process that we go forward through. Obviously, our objective is to get to the point where your earnings and dividend growth more closely match than they have over the last few years. That's why we started the dividend increases long before we got into that payout ratio target. Certainly, tax reforms had an impact on that. One thing that I would say in your discussion that is not necessarily true is the capital plan reduction. If you go back to the 2013 to 2015 time frame, that 3-year period, our capital plan was about $6 billion over the 3 years. I think the one in the presentation today is $11.7 billion, so it's a doubling of CapEx in that time frame, while we've been able to maintain some of the lowest rates in the United States. So we would anticipate if we can continue to manage the business with rate levels as attractive as they are, keep customers' bills low, then that gives us the opportunity to continue to invest more on behalf of our customers to improve technology to higher level of service at a lower price. That's our objective. 
So that piece of your discussion where CapEx should be trending downward is not necessarily correct. In fact, I would think it would be going the other direction. So all of those things will come into consideration. You are right on our objective is to get to the point where our earnings growth and dividend growth more closely match. It is something that we'll come up toward the end of the year normally where the Board refreshes its point of view on that and then we will take it up with them. But on tax reform, the growing capital budget, where we are in a range what we see earnings going and the opportunities associated with that, will all be factors that play into it."

We had a productive quarter and today, we're reporting adjusted earnings of $1.35 per share.

We had a productive quarter and today, we're reporting adjusted earnings of $1.35 per share. Drew will go over the details, but the bottom line is that these are strong results that keep us firmly on track to achieve our 2019 guidance. With our success over the past 3 years and our confidence in our strategy going forward, I'm pleased to announce that we're increasing our 3-year investment plan for the benefit of our customers.
As a result, we are also raising our earnings outlook midpoint in 2020 and 2021, narrowing our guidance and outlook ranges and providing clarity on our dividend with an expectation to align the dividend growth rate with our earnings growth rate by the end of 2021. This is possible because we are finding ways to optimize our operating costs through automation and other continuous improvement efforts. With this new plan, we are investing to enhance our level of service and the lower O&M creates headroom to help us manage the effects on our customers bills.
Today,, we're world-class utility with a proven track record of successful execution, a solid investment plan and an outlook that will deliver their earnings and dividend growth that investors expect of a premier utility. Beyond our 3-year horizon, we see no shortage of investment opportunities to benefit our customers and maintain our growth aspirations well into the future.
For example, we currently plan to add 7,000 to 8,000 megawatts of new generation from 2022 through 2030. This is necessary to continue to modernize our infrastructure, serve load growth and achieve our environmental commitments. We anticipate that half of this new generation would be renewables, primarily solar, with the balance being highly officiant gas generation.
While the specifics could change as technology and economics evolve, of course, we'll work with our regulators and other stakeholders to determine the best strategy to meet customer needs for reliability and affordable bills while achieving our sustainability goals. We'll also continue to invest in transmission infrastructure, to integrate new generation technology, connect new customers, enable future economic development and enhance system reliability, efficiency and resiliency.
We believe that our largest opportunity for long-term growth is in distribution. We are already making major investments in AMI, enterprise asset management systems, workforce management systems, customer relationship management systems, and new and improved customer engagement portal, distribution automation, distribution and outage management systems and geospace information systems.
Beyond these initiatives, we expect to invest in technologies to harden our grid and enable the optimization of distributed resources, like residential and utility scale solar, battery storage, backup generators, microgrids and electric vehicle infrastructure. This is our expectation today, but ultimately our final resource decisions will be informed by many factors, including our customers evolving preferences and expectations. As a vertically-integrated utility, we're agnostic to the specific solution, whether generation transmission or distribution as long as it's the best solution.
As a result, we see sufficient customer-centric investment opportunities to enable us to continue to achieve our current rate base growth beyond 2021. Physical assets are the only things that matter. We're also investing in our employees. We've created an innovation hub to help us lead in rapidly evolving industry and to help us develop solutions to address customer needs. We're also enhancing our leadership training to give our employees the tools to lead their organizations through the changes ahead.
Organizational health and diversity and belonging efforts are also integral to our success. These programs will ensure that our employees will grow as the company grows. With our increased earnings outlooks, clarity on our dividend growth and excellent prospects for continued growth, we're as excited about our future as we have ever been.
We achieve our success one step at a time. And this quarter is a continuation of our journey. In May, we completed the St. Charles Power Station. This modern CCGT went into service ahead of schedule and on budget. It will supply reliable clean energy to Louisiana's customers to help support the growth that state is experiencing. In Mississippi, we're wrapping up due diligence for the acquisition. We're on a path to resolve the mechanical issue identified earlier this year, and we plan to close the transaction by year end or early next year. On the renewables front, we've had several developments. In Orleans, we received approval from the City Council to proceed with the 90-megawatt solar portfolio previously proposed. Entergy New Orleans is also piloting a new program that puts solar panels on low income customers homes. Through partnerships with local vendors, we'll install a rooftop solar system at no cost to the customers and give them a credit on monthly bills. 
In Arkansas, we're partnering with commercial and industrial customers to meet their energy and sustainability goals. We're offering a community solar tariff to allow them to subscribe -- to solar resources for our customers. This is a cost-effective way to meet their renewable energy goals without them having to make an upfront capital investment.
These are just some of the innovative programs we are implementing to deliver renewable energy solutions. We will continue to engage with our regulators and stakeholders to expand these renewables under our framework, which ensures that we build the most economic system, balancing reliability, price and sustainability. 
In Texas, 2 large transmission projects, including Phase I of the Western Region economic transmission line was placed into service. These assets will help Entergy Texas to support growth in that area. We're also making significant distribution investments over the next 3 years with the emergence of new technologies.
We continue to install advanced meters with plans for 1 million new meters in 2019. We also deployed the first release of sales force capabilities to our call centers. This is part of a larger effort to build a new website with mobile functionality, a customer relationship management system and interactive voice response to transform our customer experience. We benefit from constructive, collaborative relationships with our regulators and progressive regulatory constructs that give us the opportunity to align cost recovery when our customers receive the benefits. Our regulatory frameworks provide clarity to our plan and give us confidence in our financial commitments.
We continue to make strides in this area. In May, Texas enacted legislation empowering the Public Utility Commission to allow for faster recovery of generation investments. This legislation is a step in the right direction and will help us earn closer to our allowed return. More tightly recovery will help us create value for our stakeholders in Texas and ensure that the communities we serve remain economically competitive.
Also in the quarter, Entergy Mississippi received approval of its annual formula rig plan filing, and we submitted annual FRP filings in the Louisiana and Arkansas. A request in Arkansas was for a rate change of $15 million, less than 1% of total revenue, well below the 4% cap. This includes placing approximately $700 million of new assets into service in 2020 for the benefit of our customers. 
As many of you know, Hurricane made landfall in our service area earlier this month. The storm created significant flooding and accessibility issues, but thankfully we did not see extensive and widespread damage to our system. We activated our emergency response plans, and we were fully prepared for the event. And as always, our employees stepped up. We'd also like to thank our neighboring utilities that provided mutual assistance to help us get our customers back online as quickly and safely as possible. Mutual assistance is a hallmark of our industry. We're proud that once again the Edison Electric Institute has awarded Entergy with its Emergency Assistance award for the company's outstanding power restoration efforts. 
At EWC, all of the pieces are now in place to fully exit the merchant business and we continue to systematically reduce risks. We have commercial agreements to sell the last 3 nuclear assets to our counterparty that NRC has already approved in a similar transaction.
We are proud to lead the industry in the unprecedented strategy to sell nonoperating nuclear assets, the strategy that fully transfers the plants decommissioning liability to the new owners while accelerating the decommissioning time line. As we predicted, this market has grown in a short period of time as 3 operators have announced plans with 3 different buyers.
We're becoming a better, stronger company in a premier regulated utility creating sustainable value for all of our stakeholders. The fundamentals of our business are strong as reflected by the increase in our earnings outlooks, supported by our robust capital plan. We're expecting 5% to 7% adjusted EPS growth off of our 2019 guidance. And the by the end of 2021, we expect to increase our dividend growth rate to align with our earnings growth. We have among the lowest retail rates in the country. We operate in a region that benefits from strong industrial growth. We are an industry leader in critical measures of sustainability. We're making significant investments in our system and our culture to benefit customers. And our aspirations for our customers are aligned with their evolving expectations as well as the goals of our regulators.
These are just some of the reasons why Entergy is a compelling long-term investment today. This is the foundation on which we'll grow, innovate and expand our investment profile to continue to deliver on our commitments tomorrow.
We're excited about our future. I'll now turn the call over to Drew to provide more detail on our results, our expectations for 2019 and our updated outlooks."
269764,629570494,1785213,"Entergy Corporation, Q2 2019 Earnings Call, Jul 31, 2019",2019-07-31,"Earnings Calls","Entergy Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Leo. Good morning, everyone. As you heard from Leo, we had another productive quarter with good results, and we're firmly on track to meet our full year guidance. With our updated capital investment profile and cost expectations, we're raising",1277,"Thank you, Leo. Good morning, everyone. As you heard from Leo, we had another productive quarter with good results, and we're firmly on track to meet our full year guidance. With our updated capital investment profile and cost expectations, we're raising our earnings outlook midpoints in 2020 and 2021. In addition, we're narrowing our guidance and outlook range. I'll provide details on these changes a more, but first let's turn to the quarter.
You can see on Slide 4, on a per share basis, Entergy adjusted earnings were $1.35, $0.07 lower than second quarter of 2018, including the effects of dilution. 
Turning to the Utility on Slide 5. Rate actions in Arkansas, Louisiana and Texas contributed positively to the quarter's results. Also, last year's results included regulatory changes to return the benefits of lower federal tax rate to customers. Partially offsetting these increases were lower sales volume in the unbilled period and the effects of weather, which was less favorable this quarter compared to 1 year ago.
Regarding industrial sales. We experienced higher customer unplanned outages, fewer customer outages an unusually wet weather in Arkansas leading to lower sales to agriculture customers. The fundamentals to support industrial customers in our region remains strong, and our long-term industrial sales outlook remains intact.
Other drivers for the quarter's results included higher nonfuel O&M, due largely to higher planned spending on nuclear operations, information technology and initiative to explore new customer products and services. Drivers related to our growth such as higher depreciation expense, including the St. Charles Power Station, which came online at the end of May; and lastly, the higher share count affected this quarter's results on a per share basis. 
Looking at EWC's second quarter results on Slide 6. As reported, earnings were $0.18 higher than the prior year. The key drivers were lower impairment charges at the merchant nuclear plants and strong market performance in the quarter for EWC's nuclear decommissioning trust funds. Partially offsetting the increase was lower revenue due to the shutdown of Pilgrim as well as the tax benefit in second quarter of 2018.
Looking forward, we still expect EWC to provide slightly positive net cash to parent from 2019 through 2022. Leo mentioned that we continue to systematically reduce risk as we complete our exit from EWC. Entergy sales are 94% hedged. At any endpoint, our sale agreement does not require a minimum level of funding in the nuclear decommissioning trust as a condition to close. Trust now only has 25% equity investments. And at a 5% return, we should not expect to have to make any contributions and close the transaction.
Pilgrim shuts down at the end of May and it's trust essentially cash. And finally, as a reminder, our strategy to sell nonoperating nuclear assets fully transfers the plans decommissioning liability to the new owners. As a result, we significantly reduced our risk associated with revenue, operating, capital market and decommissioning activities for EWC as we finalize our exit from that business.
Moving to operating cash flow on Slide 7. For the quarter was $552 million, a $29 million increase from a year-ago. The change was driven by a lower amount of unprotected excess ADIT return to customers. overfueling outage cost and lower ARO spending at EWC. Partially offsetting were higher severance and retention payments at EWC.
Turning to our guidance and outlooks on Slide 8. Today, we continue to see results coming in around the midpoint for 2019. In addition, we're raising the financial outlook midpoints for 2020 and 2021. The updated outlook was driven by $750 million of incremental investments through 2021 through reliability and customer engagements.
These investments are centered on themes that we have discussed, namely updating distribution transmission and generation infrastructure to drive improved reliability as well as new products and services for our customers. However, important goal is for our rate to remain among the lowest in the nation for investor-owned utilities. To that end, we're working to optimize our operating costs and part by leveraging innovation, automation, grid monetization and other new technologies to drive efficiency and productivity in our business processes.
We expect O&M to be about $2.65 billion in 2020, 2021, the goal to offset inflation in our business on an ongoing basis. The combination of the incremental investments and cost discipline will improve our level of service to our customers while continuing to manage bill growth at or below inflation. The benefits of these efforts are not just limited to our customers. Our employees will have the opportunity to develop new skills, broaden their professional expertise and leverage technology to work more productively. Our communities will see economic development and will benefit from better service and improved reliability. And our investors will see improved earnings per share growth and improved confidence in our expectations. We previously communicated our targeted adjusted EPS growth of 5% to 7% and that remains our expectation. The new midpoints reflect a 6% growth rate off of 2019's midpoint. Additionally, we have narrowed our guidance and outlook ranges by $0.10, and we could narrow them further in future years as we continue to execute on our strategy and deliver on our commitments. Providing steady, predictable growth is fundamental to our strategy and this includes our dividend. Our goal is to align our dividend growth rate with our EPS growth rate of 5% to 7%. And the key variable to determine that is our capital plan. Given our updated capital plan, we expect to achieve our of objective in the fourth quarter of 2021. We discussed this dividend plan with our Board, and they support our goal and timing. 
As you know, dividends are quarterly decisions made by the Board and this one will be made at that time. These collective updates reflect the evolution of our business to our premier regulated utility. With the success we've had in executing our strategy over the past 3 years, gives us confidence in our ability to deliver on our ongoing plans. 
Turning to credit on Slide 9. Our parent debt-to-total debt has further improved to 19.4%, largely due to the settlement of the in May. Our FFO to debt is 11.8%. This includes the effects of returning approximately $650 million of unprotected excess ADIT to customers. Excluding this giveback and certain items related to our exit of EWC, FFO to debt would be 15.8%. While some things in our plan have changed, several critical credit elements have not. We expect cash flow to continue to improve beginning next quarter and throughout the remainder of the year. And the amount of unprotected excess ADIT returns to customers as the amount of unprotected excess ADIT return to customers decline. Our equity financing framework remains the same as it was at our Analyst Day last year, and we remain committed to our targets of at or above 15% of FFO to debt by 2020 and below 25% for parent debt-to-total debt, as well as maintaining our investment-grade profile. We had another productive quarter with good results. We continue to execute on our plan to deliver steady predictable growth in earnings and dividends through customer-centric investments. The improvements we're making today are natural continuation of the evolution underway for some time. They're reflected in the alignment our customer outcomes, our focus on customer bills, development of new investment opportunities and updated earnings outlook, tighter outlook ranges and dividend path clarity.
As Leo mentioned, the fundamentals of our business are strong and we're well positioned for continued value creation. We are world-class utility, working for the benefit of all 4 of our key stakeholders. And now, the Entergy team is available to answer questions."

Those are the types of things that we're still looking at. Nothing that we're talking about today. Nothing that enters the plan or outside of the balance of things that we've been talking about for some time with all of you and certainly working on for even longer internally to the company. As we look at it, as we've always said, what we're -- what we're always balancing, every day, every decision we make, is that three-pronged outcomes that we need for our customers. One, it has to improve the level of service that we provide. And two, we have to do it to manage their bills. Managing the bills is the governor in terms of how much we can spend on operating reliability of the system. We've had to balance of that. And obviously, the sustainability objectives that we end our customers and all of you as investors have. So it is more of the same in terms of what we have to do to be looking at upgrade that system. The 7,000 to 8,000 megawatts generation, that's a continuation of what we've been doing and that is modernizing the fleet lower O&M, lower fuel cost, improve emissions across the board. As we look to deactivate 40 and 50-year-old unis and replace them with new capacity. So if you look at our system, we used to put out that histogram of age of our fleet. We still have some older units. Some of what we'll are spending the money on right now, the new -- some of those new dollars are actually to go into some of those legacy gas units to make sure they continue to operate reliably while be replaced by the newer stuff.
So it's nothing new. It's nothing new that we haven't been talking about before. It's really just focus on making sure that we balance those 3 objectives. We want to make sure that we improve the level of service, maintain some of the lowest rates in the country, work on the customers bills, keep them below the level of inflation while we continue to improve our sustainability footprint, but importantly, as I mentioned, the sustainability of our customers. That's very important to them as well."

So in terms of the flowback to customers, we expect it's pretty much all of it flow back to customers in the course of time, as you're noting depending on the jurisdictions back to customers faster than others. And I think that's actually a critical piece of the overall strategy here because we are aiming to manage our customers bills. And by doing that, we are creating space in the bill for incremental capital investments to improve the reliability. And we don't have in the main slide, but there's an appendix slide, I think Slide 38 or so that talks about how our earnings are expected to change while you notice that the net revenue line doesn't really move all that much. And the O&M line is, that's creating that space for us. So we would expect if that would flowback to customers because we are not anticipating the bills really moving at all as a result of this incremental capital.
In terms of some of the O&M and the progress to be made, and I think the answer is yes. We have made some progress this year, that's part of what gives us confidence that we can execute on these going forward. And I don't know if all of today is in today, but it will get into rates very quickly this year. As you know, we're using it to offset some of the negative weather that we had in the first quarter plus industrial sales growth is a little below our expectations year-to-date. But it will be fine long-term. But in the meantime, we can make sure that we're managing to get our expectations for this year.
So some of that is happening now, part of what gives us confidence going forward and it should all flowback into rates."

We had a productive quarter and today, we're reporting adjusted earnings of $1.35 per share. Drew will go over the details, but the bottom line is that these are strong results that keep us firmly on track to achieve our 2019 guidance. With our success over the past 3 years and our confidence in our strategy going forward, I'm pleased to announce that we're increasing our 3-year investment plan for the benefit of our customers.
As a result, we are also raising our earnings outlook midpoint in 2020 and 2021, narrowing our guidance and outlook ranges and providing clarity on our dividend with an expectation to align the dividend growth rate with our earnings growth rate by the end of 2021. This is possible because we are finding ways to optimize our operating costs through automation and other continuous improvement efforts. With this new plan, we are investing to enhance our level of service and the lower O&M creates headroom to help us manage the effects on our customers' bills.
Today, we're a world-class utility with a proven track record of successful execution, a solid investment plan and an outlook that will deliver the earnings and dividend growth that investors expect of a premier utility. Beyond our 3-year horizon, we see no shortage of investment opportunities to benefit our customers and maintain our growth aspirations well into the future.
For example, we currently plan to add 7,000 to 8,000 megawatts of new generation from 2022 through 2030. This is necessary to continue to modernize our infrastructure, serve load growth and achieve our environmental commitments. We anticipate that up to half of this new generation would be renewables, primarily solar, with the balance being highly efficient gas generation.
While the specifics could change as technology and economics evolve, of course we'll work with our regulators and other stakeholders to determine the best strategy to meet customer needs for reliability and affordable bills while achieving our sustainability goals. We'll also continue to invest in transmission infrastructure, to integrate new generation technology, connect new customers, enable future economic development and enhance system reliability, efficiency and resiliency.
We believe that our largest opportunity for long-term growth is in distribution. We are already making major investments in AMI, enterprise asset management systems, workforce management systems, customer relationship management systems, a new and improved customer engagement portal, distribution automation, distribution and outage management systems and geospace information systems.
Beyond these initiatives, we expect to invest in technologies to harden our grid and enable the optimization of distributed resources, like residential and utility scale solar, battery storage, backup generators, microgrids and electric vehicle infrastructure. This is our expectation today, but ultimately our final resource decisions will be informed by many factors, including our customers' evolving preferences and expectations. As a vertically-integrated utility, we're agnostic to the specific solution, whether generation, transmission or distribution as long as it's the best solution.
As a result, we see sufficient customer-centric investment opportunities to enable us to continue to achieve our current rate base growth beyond 2021. Physical assets are the only things that matter. We're also investing in our employees. We've created an innovation hub to help us lead in a rapidly evolving industry and to help us develop solutions to address customer needs. We're also enhancing our leadership training to give our employees the tools to lead their organizations through the changes ahead.
Organizational health and diversity and belonging efforts are also integral to our success. These programs will ensure that our employees will grow as the company grows. With our increased earnings outlooks, clarity on our dividend growth and excellent prospects for continued growth, we're as excited about our future as we have ever been.
We achieve our success one step at a time. And this quarter is a continuation of our journey. In May, we completed the St. Charles Power Station. This modern CCGT went into service ahead of schedule and on budget. It will supply reliable clean energy to Louisiana's customers to help support the growth that state is experiencing. In Mississippi, we're wrapping up due diligence for the Choctaw acquisition. We're on a path to resolve the mechanical issue identified earlier this year and we plan to close the transaction by year end or early next year.
On the renewables front, we've had several developments. In New Orleans, we received approval from the City Council to proceed with the 90-megawatt solar portfolio previously proposed. Entergy New Orleans is also piloting a new program that puts solar panels on low-income customers' homes. Through partnerships with local vendors, we'll install a rooftop solar system at no cost to the customers and give them a credit on monthly bills. 
In Arkansas, we're partnering with commercial and industrial customers to meet their energy and sustainability goals. We're offering a community solar tariff to allow them to subscribe to blocks of solar resources. For our customers, this is a cost-effective way to meet their renewable energy goals without them having to make an upfront capital investment.
These are just some of the innovative programs we are implementing to deliver renewable energy solutions. We will continue to engage with our regulators and stakeholders to expand the use of renewables under a framework which ensures that we build the most economic system, balancing reliability, price and sustainability. 
In Texas, 2 large transmission projects, including Phase I of the Western Region economic transmission line, were placed into service. These assets will help Entergy Texas support growth in that area. We're also making significant distribution investments over the next 3 years with the emergence of new technologies.
We continue to install advanced meters with plans for 1 million new meters in 2019. We also deployed the first release of Salesforce capabilities to our call centers. This is part of a larger effort to build a new website with mobile functionality, a customer relationship management system and interactive voice response to transform our customer experience. We benefit from constructive, collaborative relationships with our regulators and progressive regulatory constructs that give us the opportunity to align cost recovery with when our customers receive the benefits. Our regulatory frameworks provide clarity to our plan and give us confidence in our financial commitments.
We continue to make strides in this area. In May, Texas enacted legislation empowering the Public Utility Commission to allow for faster recovery of generation investments. This legislation is a step in the right direction and will help us earn closer to our allowed return. More timely recovery will help us create value for our stakeholders in Texas and ensure that the communities we serve remain economically competitive.
Also in the quarter, Entergy Mississippi received approval of its annual formula rate plan filing, and we submitted annual FRP filings in Louisiana and Arkansas. Our request in Arkansas was for a rate change of $15 million, less than 1% of total revenue, well below the 4% cap. This includes placing approximately $700 million of new assets into service in 2020 for the benefit of our customers. 
As many of you know, Hurricane Barry made landfall in our service area earlier this month. The storm created significant flooding and accessibility issues, but thankfully we did not see extensive and widespread damage to our system. We activated our emergency response plans, and we were fully prepared for the event. And as always, our employees stepped up. We'd also like to thank our neighboring utilities that provided mutual assistance to help us get our customers back online as quickly and safely as possible. Mutual assistance is a hallmark of our industry. We're proud that once again the Edison Electric Institute has awarded Entergy with its Emergency Assistance award for the company's outstanding power restoration efforts. 
At EWC, all of the pieces are now in place to fully exit the merchant business and we continue to systematically reduce risks. We have commercial agreements to sell the last 3 nuclear assets to a counterparty that the NRC has already approved in a similar transaction.  We are proud to have led the industry in the unprecedented strategy to sell nonoperating nuclear assets, the strategy that fully transfers the plant's decommissioning liability to the new owners while accelerating the decommissioning time line. As we predicted, this market has grown in a short period of time as 3 operators have announced plans with 3 different buyers.
We're becoming a better, stronger company and a premier regulated utility creating sustainable value for all of our stakeholders. The fundamentals of our business are strong as reflected by the increase in our earnings outlooks, supported by our robust capital plan. We're expecting 5% to 7% adjusted EPS growth off of our 2019 guidance. And  by the end of 2021, we expect to increase our dividend growth rate to align with our earnings growth. We have among the lowest retail rates in the country. We operate in a region that benefits from strong industrial growth. We are an industry leader in critical measures of sustainability. We're making significant investments on our system and our culture to benefit customers. And our aspirations for our customers are aligned with their evolving expectations as well as the goals of our regulators.
These are just some of the reasons why Entergy is a compelling long-term investment today. This is the foundation on which we will grow, innovate and expand our investment profile to continue to deliver on our commitments tomorrow.
We are excited about our future. I will now turn the call over to Drew to provide more detail on our results, our expectations for 2019 and our updated outlooks."

As you heard from Leo, we had another productive quarter with good results, and we're firmly on track to meet our full year guidance. With our updated capital investment profile and cost expectations, we're raising",1295,"Thank you, Leo. Good morning, everyone. As you heard from Leo, we had another productive quarter with good results, and we're firmly on track to meet our full year guidance. With our updated capital investment profile and cost expectations, we're raising our earnings outlook midpoints in 2020 and 2021. In addition, we're narrowing our guidance and outlook ranges. I'll provide details on these changes and more, but first let's turn to the quarter.
You can see on Slide 4, on a per share basis, Entergy adjusted earnings were $1.35, $0.07 lower than second quarter of 2018, including the effects of dilution. 
Turning to the Utility on Slide 5. Rate actions in Arkansas, Louisiana and Texas contributed positively to the quarter's results. Also, last year's results included regulatory charges to return the benefits of a lower federal tax rate to customers. Partially offsetting these increases were lower sales volume in the unbilled period and the effects of weather, which was less favorable this quarter compared to 1 year ago.
Regarding industrial sales. We experienced higher customer unplanned outages; fewer cogen customer outages; and unusually wet weather in Arkansas, leading to low sales to agriculture customers. The fundamentals that support the industrial customers in our region remain strong, and our long-term industrial sales outlook remains intact.
Other drivers for the quarter's results included higher nonfuel O&M, due largely to higher planned spending on nuclear operations, information technology and initiative to explore new customer products and services; drivers related to our growth, such as higher depreciation expense, including the St. Charles Power Station, which came online at the end of May; and lastly, the higher share count affected this quarter's results on a per share basis. 
Looking at EWC's second quarter results on Slide 6. As reported, earnings were $0.18 higher than the prior year. The key drivers were lower impairment charges at the merchant nuclear plants and strong market performance in the quarter for EWC's nuclear decommissioning trust funds. Partially offsetting the increase was lower revenue due to the shutdown of Pilgrim as well as a tax benefit in second quarter of 2018.
Looking forward, we still expect EWC to provide slightly positive net cash to parent from 2019 through 2022. Leo mentioned that we continue to systematically reduce risk as we complete our exit from EWC. Energy sales are 94% hedged. At Indian Point, our sale agreement does not require a minimum level of funding in the nuclear decommissioning trust as a condition to close. Palisades' trust now only has 25% equity investments. And at a 5% return, we should not expect to have to make any contributions to close the transaction.
Pilgrim shuts down at the end of May and its trust is essentially in cash. And finally, as a reminder, our strategy to sell nonoperating nuclear assets fully transfers the plant's decommissioning liability to the new owners. As a result, we have significantly reduced our risk associated with revenue, operating, capital market and decommissioning activities for EWC as we finalize our exit from that business.
Moving to operating cash flow on Slide 7, for the quarter, was $552 million -- a $29 million increase from a year-ago. The change was driven by a lower amount of unprotected excess ADIT returned to customers, lower fueling outage cost and lower ARO spending at EWC. Partially offsetting were higher severance and retention payments at EWC.
Turning to our guidance and outlook on Slide 8. Today, we continue to see results coming in around the midpoint for 2019. In addition, we're raising the financial outlook midpoints for 2020 and 2021. The updated outlook is driven by $750 million of incremental investments through 2021 that improve reliability and customer engagement.  These investments are centered on themes that we have discussed, namely updating distribution, transmission and generation infrastructure to drive improved reliability as well as new products and services for our customers. However, an important goal is for our rates to remain among the lowest in the nation for investor-owned utilities. To that end, we're working to optimize our operating costs, in part by leveraging innovation, automation, grid modernization and other new technologies to drive efficiency and productivity in our business processes.
We expect O&M to be about $2.65 billion in 2020, 2021, the goal to offset inflation in our business on an ongoing basis. The combination of the incremental investments and cost discipline will improve our level of service to our customers while continuing to manage bill growth at or below inflation. The benefits of these efforts are not just limited to our customers. Our employees will have the opportunity to develop new skills, broaden their professional expertise and leverage technology to work more productively. Our communities will see economic development and will benefit from better service and improved reliability. And our investors will see improved earnings per share growth and improved confidence in our expectations. We previously communicated our targeted adjusted EPS growth of 5% to 7% and that remains our expectation. The new midpoints reflect a 6% growth rate off of 2019's midpoint. Additionally, we have narrowed our guidance and outlook ranges by $0.10, and we could narrow them further in future years as we continue to execute on our strategy and deliver on our commitments. Providing steady, predictable growth is fundamental to our strategy and this includes our dividend. Our goal is to align our dividend growth rate with our EPS growth rate of 5% to 7%. And the key variable to determine that is our capital plan. Given our updated capital plan, we expect to achieve our alignment objective in the fourth quarter of 2021. We discussed this dividend plan with our Board, and they support our goal and timing. 
As you know, dividends are quarterly decisions made by the Board and this one will be made at that time. These collective updates reflect the evolution of our business to a premier regulated utility. The success we've had in executing our strategy over the past 3 years gives us confidence in our ability to deliver on our ongoing plans. 
Turning to credit on Slide 9. Our parent debt-to-total debt has further improved to 19.4%, largely due to the settlement of the remainder of the equity forward in May. Our FFO to debt is 11.8%. This includes the effects of returning approximately $650 million of unprotected excess ADIT to customers. Excluding this giveback and certain items related to our exit of EWC, FFO to debt would be 15.8%. While some things in our plan have changed, several critical credit elements have not. We expect cash flow to continue to improve beginning next quarter and throughout the remainder of the year and the amount of unprotected excess ADIT returns to customers -- as the amount of unprotected excess ADIT returned to customers decline. Our equity financing framework remains the same as it was at our Analyst Day last year, and we remain committed to our targets of at or above 15% of FFO to debt by 2020 and below 25% for parent debt-to-total debt, as well as maintaining our investment-grade profile. 
We had another productive quarter with good results. We continue to execute on our plan to deliver steady, predictable growth in earnings and dividends through customer-centric investments. The improvements we're making today are a natural continuation of the evolution underway for some time. They're reflected in the alignment toward customer outcomes, our focus on customer bills, development of new investment opportunities and updated earnings outlook, tighter outlook ranges and dividend path clarity.
As Leo mentioned, the fundamentals of our business are strong and we're well positioned for continued value creation. We are a world-class utility working for the benefit of all 4 of our key stakeholders. And now, the Entergy team is available to answer questions."

Those are the types of things that we're still looking at. Nothing that we're talking about today -- nothing that enters the plan are outside of the bounds of the sorts of things that we've been talking about for some time with all of you and certainly working on for even longer internally to the company.
 As we look at it, as we've always said, what we're -- what we're always balancing, every day, every decision we make, is that 3-pronged outcomes that we need for our customers. One, it has to improve the level of service that we provide. And two, we have to do it to manage their bills. Managing the bills is the governor in terms of how much we can spend on upgrading the reliability of the system. We've got to balance that. And then obviously, the sustainability objectives that we and our customers and all of you as investors have. So it is more of the same in terms of what we have to do to be looking at to upgrade that system.
The 7,000 megawatts to 8,000 megawatts of generation, that's a continuation of what we've been doing and that is modernizing the fleet to lower O&M, lower fuel cost, improve emissions across the board as we look to deactivate 40 and 50-year-old units and replace them with new capacity. So if you look at our system, we used to put out that histogram of the age of our fleet. We still have some older units. Some of what we are spending the money on right now, the new -- some of those new dollars are actually to go into some of those legacy gas units to make sure they continue to operate reliably while they get into queue to be replaced by the newer stuff.
So it's nothing new. It's nothing that we haven't been talking about before. It's really just a focus on making sure that we balance those 3 objectives. We want to make sure that we improve the level of service; maintain some of the lowest rates in the country; work on the customers' bills, keep them below the level of inflation while we continue to improve our sustainability footprint; but importantly, as I mentioned, the sustainability of our customers. That's very important to them as well. So."

So in terms of the flowback to customers, we would expect that pretty much all of it would flow back to customers in the course of time. As you're noting, depending on the jurisdiction, some would flow back to customers faster than others. And I think that's actually a critical piece of the overall strategy here because we are aiming to manage our customers' bills. And by doing that, we are creating space in the bill for incremental capital investments to improve reliability. And I think there's -- we don't have it in the main slide, but there's an appendix slide, I think it's like Slide 38 or so that talks about how our earnings are expected to change. While it happens, you will notice that the net revenue line doesn't really move all that much. And the O&M line is, that's creating that space for us. So we would expect that, that would flow back to customers because we are not anticipating their bills really moving at all as a result of this incremental capital.
In terms of some of the O&M and the progress that we've made, I think the answer is yes. We have made some progress this year, that's part of what gives us confidence that we can execute on this going forward. And I don't know if all of it is in rates today, but it will get into rates very quickly -- this year, as you know, we're using it to offset some of the negative weather that we had in the first quarter. Plus, I mentioned in my remarks, the industrial sales growth was a little bit below our expectations year-to-date. But it will be fine long-term. But in the meantime, we need to make sure that we're managing to hit our expectations for this year.
So some of that is happening now, it's part of what gives us confidence going forward and it should all flow back into rates."

We had a productive quarter and today, we're reporting adjusted earnings of $1.35 per share. Drew will go over the details, but the bottom line is that these are strong results that keep us firmly on track to",1606,"Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. We had a productive quarter and today, we're reporting adjusted earnings of $1.35 per share. Drew will go over the details, but the bottom line is that these are strong results that keep us firmly on track to achieve our 2019 guidance. With our success over the past 3 years and our confidence in our strategy going forward, I'm pleased to announce that we're increasing our 3-year investment plan for the benefit of our customers. As a result, we are also raising our earnings outlook midpoint in 2020 and 2021, narrowing our guidance and outlook ranges and providing clarity on our dividend with an expectation to align the dividend growth rate with our earnings growth rate by the end of 2021. This is possible because we are finding ways to optimize our operating costs through automation and other continuous improvement efforts. With this new plan, we are investing to enhance our level of service, and the lower O&M creates headroom to help us manage the effects on our customers' bills.
Today, we're a world-class utility with a proven track record of successful execution, a solid investment plan and an outlook that will deliver the earnings and dividend growth that investors expect of a premier utility. Beyond our 3-year horizon, we see no shortage of investment opportunities to benefit our customers and maintain our growth aspirations well into the future.
For example, we currently plan to add 7,000 to 8,000 megawatts of new generation from 2022 through 2030. This is necessary to continue to modernize our infrastructure, serve load growth and achieve our environmental commitments. We anticipate that up to half of this new generation would be renewables, primarily solar, with the balance being highly efficient gas generation.
While the specifics could change as technology and economics evolve, of course we'll work with our regulators and other stakeholders to determine the best strategy to meet customer needs for reliability and affordable bills while achieving our sustainability goals. We'll also continue to invest in transmission infrastructure, to integrate new generation technology, connect new customers, enable future economic development and enhance system reliability, efficiency and resiliency.
We believe that our largest opportunity for long-term growth is in distribution. We are already making major investments in AMI, enterprise asset management systems, workforce management systems, customer relationship management systems, a new and improved customer engagement portal, distribution automation, distribution and outage management systems and geospatial information systems.
Beyond these initiatives, we expect to invest in technologies to harden our grid and enable the optimization of distributed resources, like residential and utility scale solar, battery storage, backup generators, microgrids and electric vehicle infrastructure. This is our expectation today, but ultimately our final resource decisions will be informed by many factors, including our customers' evolving preferences and expectations. As a vertically-integrated utility, we're agnostic to the specific solution, whether generation, transmission or distribution as long as it's the best solution.
As a result, we see sufficient customer-centric investment opportunities to enable us to continue to achieve our current rate base growth beyond 2021. Physical assets aren't the only things that matter. We're also investing in our employees. We've created an innovation hub to help us lead in a rapidly evolving industry and to help us develop solutions to address customer needs. We're also enhancing our leadership training to give our employees the tools to lead their organizations through the changes ahead.
Organizational health and diversity and belonging efforts are also integral to our success. These programs will ensure that our employees will grow as the company grows. With our increased earnings outlooks, clarity on our dividend growth and excellent prospects for continued growth, we're as excited about our future as we have ever been.
We achieve our success one step at a time. And this quarter is a continuation of our journey. In May, we completed the St. Charles Power Station. This modern CCGT went into service ahead of schedule and on budget. It will supply reliable clean energy to Louisiana's customers to help support the growth the state is experiencing. In Mississippi, we're wrapping up due diligence for the Choctaw acquisition. We're on a path to resolve the mechanical issue identified earlier this year and we plan to close the transaction by year end or early next year.
On the renewables front, we've had several developments. In New Orleans, we received approval from the City Council to proceed with the 90-megawatt solar portfolio previously proposed. Entergy New Orleans is also piloting a new program that puts solar panels on low-income customers' homes. Through partnerships with local vendors, we'll install a rooftop solar system at no cost to the customers and give them a credit on monthly bills. 
In Arkansas, we're partnering with commercial and industrial customers to meet their energy and sustainability goals. We're offering a community solar tariff to allow them to subscribe to blocks of solar resources. For our customers, this is a cost-effective way to meet their renewable energy goals without them having to make an upfront capital investment.
These are just some of the innovative programs we are implementing to deliver renewable energy solutions. We will continue to engage with our regulators and stakeholders to expand the use of renewables under a framework which ensures that we build the most economic system, balancing reliability, price and sustainability. 
In Texas, 2 large transmission projects, including Phase I of the Western Region economic transmission line, were placed into service. These assets will help Entergy Texas and support growth in that area. We're also making significant distribution investments over the next 3 years with the emergence of new technologies.
We continue to install advanced meters with plans for 1 million new meters in 2019. We also deployed the first release of Salesforce capabilities to our call centers. This is part of a larger effort to build a new website with mobile functionality, a customer relationship management system and interactive voice response to transform our customer experience. We benefit from constructive, collaborative relationships with our regulators and progressive regulatory constructs that give us the opportunity to align cost recovery with when our customers receive the benefits. Our regulatory frameworks provide clarity to our plan and give us confidence in our financial commitments.
We continue to make strides in this area. In May, Texas enacted legislation empowering the Public Utility Commission to allow for faster recovery of generation investments. This legislation is a step in the right direction and will help us earn closer to our allowed return. More timely recovery will help us create value for our stakeholders in Texas and ensure that the communities we serve remain economically competitive.
Also in the quarter, Entergy Mississippi received approval of its annual formula rate plan filing, and we submitted annual FRP filings in Louisiana and Arkansas. Our request in Arkansas was for a rate change of $15 million, less than 1% of total revenue, well below the 4% cap. This includes placing approximately $700 million of new assets into service in 2020 for the benefit of our customers. 
As many of you know, Hurricane Barry made landfall in our service area earlier this month. The storm created significant flooding and accessibility issues, but thankfully we did not see extensive and widespread damage to our system. We activated our emergency response plans, and we were fully prepared for the event. And as always, our employees stepped up. We'd also like to thank our neighboring utilities that provided mutual assistance to help us get our customers back online as quickly and safely as possible. Mutual assistance is a hallmark of our industry. We're proud that once again the Edison Electric Institute has awarded Entergy with its Emergency Assistance award for the company's outstanding power restoration efforts. 
At EWC, all of the pieces are now in place to fully exit the merchant business, and we continue to systematically reduce risks. We have commercial agreements to sell the last 3 nuclear assets to a counterparty that the NRC has already approved in a similar transaction. We are proud to have led the industry in the unprecedented strategy to sell nonoperating nuclear assets, the strategy that fully transfers the plant's decommissioning liability to the new owners while accelerating the decommissioning time line. As we predicted, this market has grown in a short period of time as 3 operators have announced plans with 3 different buyers.
We're becoming a better, stronger company and a premier regulated utility creating sustainable value for all of our stakeholders. The fundamentals of our business are strong as reflected by the increase in our earnings outlooks, supported by our robust capital plan. We're expecting 5% to 7% adjusted EPS growth off of our 2019 guidance. And by the end of 2021, we expect to increase our dividend growth rate to align with our earnings growth. We have among the lowest retail rates in the country. We operate in a region that benefits from strong industrial growth. We are an industry leader in critical measures of sustainability. We're making significant investments on our system and our culture to benefit customers. And our aspirations for our customers are aligned with their evolving expectations as well as the goals of our regulators.
These are just some of the reasons why Entergy is a compelling long-term investment today. This is the foundation on which we will grow, innovate and expand our investment profile to continue to deliver on our commitments tomorrow.
We are excited about our future. I will now turn the call over to Drew to provide more detail on our results, our expectations for 2019 and our updated outlooks."

As you heard from Leo, we had another productive quarter with good results, and we're firmly on track to meet our full year guidance. With our updated capital investment profile and cost expectations, we're raising our earnings outlook midpoints in 2020 and 2021. In addition, we're narrowing our guidance and outlook ranges. I'll provide details on these changes and more, but first let's turn to the quarter.
You can see on Slide 4, on a per share basis, Entergy adjusted earnings were $1.35, $0.07 lower than second quarter of 2018, including the effect of dilution. 
Turning to the Utility on Slide 5. Rate actions in Arkansas, Louisiana and Texas contributed positively to the quarter's results. Also, last year's results included regulatory charges to return the benefits of a lower federal tax rate to customers. Partially offsetting these increases were lower sales volume in the unbilled period and the effects of weather, which was less favorable this quarter compared to 1 year ago.
Regarding industrial sales. We experienced higher customer unplanned outages; fewer cogen customer outages; and unusually wet weather in Arkansas, leading to low sales to agriculture customers. The fundamentals that support the industrial customers in our region remain strong, and our long-term industrial sales outlook remains intact.
Other drivers for the quarter's results included higher nonfuel O&M, due largely to higher planned spending on nuclear operations, information technology and initiative to explore new customer products and services; drivers related to our growth, such as higher depreciation expense, including the St. Charles Power Station, which came online at the end of May; and lastly, the higher share count affected this quarter's results on a per share basis. 
Looking at EWC's second quarter results on Slide 6. As reported, earnings were $0.18 higher than the prior year. The key drivers were lower impairment charges at the merchant nuclear plants and strong market performance in the quarter for EWC's nuclear decommissioning trust funds. Partially offsetting the increase was lower revenue due to the shutdown of Pilgrim as well as a tax benefit in second quarter of 2018.
Looking forward, we still expect EWC to provide slightly positive net cash to parent from 2019 through 2022. Leo mentioned that we continue to systematically reduce risk as we complete our exit from EWC. Energy sales are 94% hedged. At Indian Point, our sale agreement does not require a minimum level of funding in the nuclear decommissioning trust as a condition to close. Palisades' trust now only has 25% equity investments. And at a 5% return, we should not expect to have to make any contributions to close the transaction.
Pilgrim shuts down at the end of May and its trust is essentially in cash. And finally, as a reminder, our strategy to sell nonoperating nuclear assets fully transfers the plant's decommissioning liability to the new owners. As a result, we have significantly reduced our risk associated with revenue, operating, capital market and decommissioning activities for EWC as we finalize our exit from that business.
Moving to operating cash flow on Slide 7, for the quarter, was $552 million -- a $29 million increase from a year-ago. The change was driven by a lower amount of unprotected excess ADIT returned to customers, lower fueling outage cost and lower ARO spending at EWC. Partially offsetting were higher severance and retention payments at EWC.
Turning to our guidance and outlook on Slide 8. Today, we continue to see results coming in around the midpoint for 2019. In addition, we're raising the financial outlook midpoints for 2020 and 2021. The updated outlook is driven by $750 million of incremental investments through 2021 that improve reliability and customer engagement. These investments are centered on themes that we have discussed, namely updating distribution, transmission and generation infrastructure to drive improved reliability as well as new products and services for our customers. However, an important goal is for our rates to remain among the lowest in the nation for investor-owned utilities. To that end, we're working to optimize our operating costs, in part by leveraging innovation, automation, grid modernization and other new technologies to drive efficiency and productivity in our business processes.
We expect O&M to be about $2.65 billion in 2020, 2021, the goal to offset inflation in our business on an ongoing basis. The combination of the incremental investments and cost discipline will improve our level of service to our customers while continuing to manage bill growth at or below inflation. The benefits of these efforts are not just limited to our customers. Our employees will have the opportunity to develop new skills, broaden their professional expertise and leverage technology to work more productively. Our communities will see economic development and will benefit from better service and improved reliability. And our investors will see improved earnings per share growth and improved confidence in our expectations. We previously communicated our targeted adjusted EPS growth of 5% to 7% and that remains our expectation. The new midpoints reflect a 6% growth rate off of 2019's midpoint. Additionally, we have narrowed our guidance and outlook ranges by $0.10, and we could narrow them further in future years as we continue to execute on our strategy and deliver on our commitments. Providing steady, predictable growth is fundamental to our strategy and this includes our dividend. Our goal is to align our dividend growth rate with our EPS growth rate of 5% to 7%. And the key variable to determine that is our capital plan. Given our updated capital plan, we expect to achieve our alignment objective in the fourth quarter of 2021. We discussed this dividend plan with our Board, and they support our goal and timing. 
As you know, dividends are quarterly decisions made by the Board and this one will be made at that time. These collective updates reflect the evolution of our business to a premier regulated utility. The success we've had in executing our strategy over the past 3 years gives us confidence in our ability to deliver on our ongoing plans. 
Turning to credit on Slide 9. Our parent debt-to-total debt has further improved to 19.4%, largely due to the settlement of the remainder of the equity forward in May. Our FFO to debt is 11.8%. This includes the effects of returning approximately $650 million of unprotected excess ADIT to customers. Excluding this giveback and certain items related to our exit of EWC, FFO to debt would be 15.8%. While some things in our plan have changed, several critical credit elements have not. We expect cash flow to continue to improve beginning next quarter and throughout the remainder of the year and the amount of unprotected excess ADIT returns to customers -- as the amount of unprotected excess ADIT returned to customers decline. Our equity financing framework remains the same as it was at our Analyst Day last year, and we remain committed to our targets of at or above 15% of FFO to debt by 2020 and below 25% for parent debt-to-total debt, as well as maintaining our investment-grade profile. 
We had another productive quarter with good results. We continue to execute on our plan to deliver steady, predictable growth in earnings and dividends through customer-centric investments. The improvements we're making today are a natural continuation of the evolution underway for some time. They're reflected in the alignment toward customer outcomes, our focus on customer bills, development of new investment opportunities and updated earnings outlook, tighter outlook ranges and dividend path clarity.
As Leo mentioned, the fundamentals of our business are strong and we're well positioned for continued value creation. We are a world-class utility working for the benefit of all 4 of our key stakeholders. And now, the Entergy team is available to answer questions."

Those are the types of things that we're still looking at. Nothing that we're talking about today -- nothing that enters the plan are outside of the bounds of the sorts of things that we've been talking about for some time with all of you and certainly working on for even longer internally to the company.
As we look at it, as we've always said, what we're -- what we're always balancing, every day, every decision we make, is that 3-pronged outcomes that we need for our customers. One, it has to improve the level of service that we provide. And two, we have to do it to manage their bills. Managing the bills is the governor in terms of how much we can spend on upgrading the reliability of the system. We've got to balance that. And then obviously, the sustainability objectives that we and our customers and all of you as investors have. So it is more of the same in terms of what we have to do to be looking at to upgrade that system.
The 7,000 megawatts to 8,000 megawatts of generation, that's a continuation of what we've been doing and that is modernizing the fleet to lower O&M, lower fuel cost, improve emissions across the board as we look to deactivate 40 and 50-year-old units and replace them with new capacity. So if you look at our system, we used to put out that histogram of the age of our fleet. We still have some older units. Some of what we are spending the money on right now, the new -- some of those new dollars are actually to go into some of those legacy gas units to make sure they continue to operate reliably while they get into queue to be replaced by the newer stuff.
So it's nothing new. It's nothing that we haven't been talking about before. It's really just a focus on making sure that we balance those 3 objectives. We want to make sure that we improve the level of service; maintain some of the lowest rates in the country; work on the customers' bills, keep them below the level of inflation while we continue to improve our sustainability footprint; but importantly, as I mentioned, the sustainability of our customers. That's very important to them as well, so."

So in terms of the flowback to customers, we would expect that pretty much all of it would flow back to customers in the course of time. As you're noting, depending on the jurisdiction, some would flow back to customers faster than others. And I think that's actually a critical piece of the overall strategy here because we are aiming to manage our customers' bills. And by doing that, we are creating space in the bill for incremental capital investments to improve reliability. And I think there's -- we don't have it in the main slide, but there's an appendix slide, I think it's like Slide 38 or so that talks about how our earnings are expected to change. While it happens, you will notice that the net revenue line doesn't really move all that much. And the O&M line is, that's creating that space for us. So we would expect that, that would flow back to customers because we are not anticipating their bills really moving at all as a result of this incremental capital.
In terms of some of the O&M and the progress that we've made, I think the answer is yes. We have made some progress this year, that's part of what gives us confidence that we can execute on this going forward. And I don't know if all of it is in rates today, but it will get into rates very quickly -- this year, as you know, we're using it to offset some of the negative weather that we had in the first quarter. Plus, I mentioned in my remarks, the industrial sales growth was a little bit below our expectations year-to-date. But it will be fine long-term. But in the meantime, we need to make sure that we're managing to hit our expectations for this year.
So some of that is happening now, it's part of what gives us confidence going forward and it should all flow back into rates."

We had a productive quarter and today, we're reporting adjusted earnings of $1.35 per share.

We had a productive quarter and today, we're reporting adjusted earnings of $1.35 per share. Drew will go over the details, but the bottom line is that these are strong results that keep us firmly on track to achieve our 2019 guidance. With our success over the past 3 years and our confidence in our strategy going forward, I'm pleased to announce that we're increasing our 3-year investment plan for the benefit of our customers. As a result, we are also raising our earnings outlook midpoint in 2020 and 2021, narrowing our guidance and outlook ranges and providing clarity on our dividend with an expectation to align the dividend growth rate with our earnings growth rate by the end of 2021. This is possible because we are finding ways to optimize our operating costs through automation and other continuous improvement efforts. With this new plan, we are investing to enhance our level of service, and the lower O&M creates headroom to help us manage the effects on our customers' bills.
Today, we're a world-class utility with a proven track record of successful execution, a solid investment plan and an outlook that will deliver the earnings and dividend growth that investors expect of a premier utility. Beyond our 3-year horizon, we see no shortage of investment opportunities to benefit our customers and maintain our growth aspirations well into the future.
For example, we currently plan to add 7,000 to 8,000 megawatts of new generation from 2022 through 2030. This is necessary to continue to modernize our infrastructure, serve load growth and achieve our environmental commitments. We anticipate that up to half of this new generation would be renewables, primarily solar, with the balance being highly efficient gas generation.
While the specifics could change as technology and economics evolve, of course we'll work with our regulators and other stakeholders to determine the best strategy to meet customer needs for reliability and affordable bills while achieving our sustainability goals. We'll also continue to invest in transmission infrastructure, to integrate new generation technology, connect new customers, enable future economic development and enhance system reliability, efficiency and resiliency.
We believe that our largest opportunity for long-term growth is in distribution. We are already making major investments in AMI, enterprise asset management systems, workforce management systems, customer relationship management systems, a new and improved customer engagement portal, distribution automation, distribution and outage management systems and geospatial information systems.
Beyond these initiatives, we expect to invest in technologies to harden our grid and enable the optimization of distributed resources, like residential and utility scale solar, battery storage, backup generators, microgrids and electric vehicle infrastructure. This is our expectation today, but ultimately our final resource decisions will be informed by many factors, including our customers' evolving preferences and expectations. As a vertically-integrated utility, we're agnostic to the specific solution, whether generation, transmission or distribution as long as it's the best solution.
As a result, we see sufficient customer-centric investment opportunities to enable us to continue to achieve our current rate base growth beyond 2021. Physical assets aren't the only things that matter. We're also investing in our employees. We've created an innovation hub to help us lead in a rapidly evolving industry and to help us develop solutions to address customer needs. We're also enhancing our leadership training to give our employees the tools to lead their organizations through the changes ahead.
Organizational health and diversity and belonging efforts are also integral to our success. These programs will ensure that our employees will grow as the company grows. With our increased earnings outlooks, clarity on our dividend growth and excellent prospects for continued growth, we're as excited about our future as we have ever been.
We achieve our success one step at a time. And this quarter is a continuation of our journey. In May, we completed the St. Charles Power Station. This modern CCGT went into service ahead of schedule and on budget. It will supply reliable clean energy to Louisiana's customers to help support the growth the state is experiencing. In Mississippi, we're wrapping up due diligence for the Choctaw acquisition. We're on a path to resolve the mechanical issue identified earlier this year and we plan to close the transaction by year-end or early next year.
On the renewables front, we've had several developments. In New Orleans, we received approval from the City Council to proceed with the 90-megawatt solar portfolio previously proposed. Entergy New Orleans is also piloting a new program that puts solar panels on low-income customers' homes. Through partnerships with local vendors, we'll install a rooftop solar system at no cost to the customers and give them a credit on monthly bills. 
In Arkansas, we're partnering with commercial and industrial customers to meet their energy and sustainability goals. We're offering a community solar tariff to allow them to subscribe to blocks of solar resources. For our customers, this is a cost-effective way to meet their renewable energy goals without them having to make an upfront capital investment.
These are just some of the innovative programs we are implementing to deliver renewable energy solutions. We will continue to engage with our regulators and stakeholders to expand the use of renewables under a framework which ensures that we build the most economic system, balancing reliability, price and sustainability. 
In Texas, 2 large transmission projects, including Phase I of the Western Region economic transmission line, were placed into service. These assets will help Entergy Texas and support growth in that area. We're also making significant distribution investments over the next 3 years with the emergence of new technologies.
We continue to install advanced meters with plans for 1 million new meters in 2019. We also deployed the first release of Salesforce capabilities to our call centers. This is part of a larger effort to build a new website with mobile functionality, a customer relationship management system and interactive voice response to transform our customer experience. We benefit from constructive, collaborative relationships with our regulators and progressive regulatory constructs that give us the opportunity to align cost recovery with when our customers receive the benefits. Our regulatory frameworks provide clarity to our plan and give us confidence in our financial commitments.
We continue to make strides in this area. In May, Texas enacted legislation empowering the Public Utility Commission to allow for faster recovery of generation investments. This legislation is a step in the right direction and will help us earn closer to our allowed return. More timely recovery will help us create value for our stakeholders in Texas and ensure that the communities we serve remain economically competitive.
Also in the quarter, Entergy Mississippi received approval of its annual formula rate plan filing, and we submitted annual FRP filings in Louisiana and Arkansas. Our request in Arkansas was for a rate change of $15 million, less than 1% of total revenue, well below the 4% cap. This includes placing approximately $700 million of new assets into service in 2020 for the benefit of our customers. 
As many of you know, Hurricane Barry made landfall in our service area earlier this month. The storm created significant flooding and accessibility issues, but thankfully we did not see extensive and widespread damage to our system. We activated our emergency response plans, and we were fully prepared for the event. And as always, our employees stepped up. We'd also like to thank our neighboring utilities that provided mutual assistance to help us get our customers back online as quickly and safely as possible. Mutual assistance is a hallmark of our industry. We're proud that once again the Edison Electric Institute has awarded Entergy with its Emergency Assistance award for the company's outstanding power restoration efforts. 
At EWC, all of the pieces are now in place to fully exit the merchant business, and we continue to systematically reduce risks. We have commercial agreements to sell the last 3 nuclear assets to a counterparty that the NRC has already approved in a similar transaction. We are proud to have led the industry in the unprecedented strategy to sell nonoperating nuclear assets, the strategy that fully transfers the plant's decommissioning liability to the new owners while accelerating the decommissioning time line. As we predicted, this market has grown in a short period of time as 3 operators have announced plans with 3 different buyers.
We're becoming a better, stronger company and a premier regulated utility creating sustainable value for all of our stakeholders. The fundamentals of our business are strong as reflected by the increase in our earnings outlooks, supported by our robust capital plan. We're expecting 5% to 7% adjusted EPS growth off of our 2019 guidance. And by the end of 2021, we expect to increase our dividend growth rate to align with our earnings growth. We have among the lowest retail rates in the country. We operate in a region that benefits from strong industrial growth. We are an industry leader in critical measures of sustainability. We're making significant investments on our system and our culture to benefit customers. And our aspirations for our customers are aligned with their evolving expectations as well as the goals of our regulators.
These are just some of the reasons why Entergy is a compelling long-term investment today. This is the foundation on which we will grow, innovate and expand our investment profile to continue to deliver on our commitments tomorrow.
We are excited about our future. I will now turn the call over to Drew to provide more detail on our results, our expectations for 2019 and our updated outlooks."

As you heard from Leo, we had another productive quarter with good results, and we're firmly on track to meet our full year guidance. With our updated capital investment profile and cost expectations, we're raising",1295,"Thank you, Leo. Good morning, everyone. As you heard from Leo, we had another productive quarter with good results, and we're firmly on track to meet our full year guidance. With our updated capital investment profile and cost expectations, we're raising our earnings outlook midpoints in 2020 and 2021. In addition, we're narrowing our guidance and outlook ranges. I'll provide details on these changes and more, but first let's turn to the quarter.
You can see on Slide 4, on a per share basis, Entergy adjusted earnings were $1.35, $0.07 lower than second quarter of 2018, including the effect of dilution. 
Turning to the Utility on Slide 5. Rate actions in Arkansas, Louisiana and Texas contributed positively to the quarter's results. Also last year's results included regulatory charges to return the benefits of a lower federal tax rate to customers. Partially offsetting these increases were lower sales volume in the unbilled period and the effects of weather, which was less favorable this quarter compared to 1 year ago.
Regarding industrial sales. We experienced higher customer unplanned outages; fewer cogen customer outages; and unusually wet weather in Arkansas, leading to low sales to agriculture customers. The fundamentals that support the industrial customers in our region remain strong, and our long-term industrial sales outlook remains intact.
Other drivers for the quarter's results included higher nonfuel O&M, due largely to higher planned spending on nuclear operations, information technology and initiative to explore new customer products and services; drivers related to our growth, such as higher depreciation expense, including the St. Charles Power Station, which came online at the end of May; and lastly, the higher share count affected this quarter's results on a per share basis. 
Looking at EWC's second quarter results on Slide 6. As reported, earnings were $0.18 higher than the prior year. The key drivers were lower impairment charges at the merchant nuclear plants and strong market performance in the quarter for EWC's nuclear decommissioning trust funds. Partially offsetting the increase was lower revenue due to the shutdown of Pilgrim as well as a tax benefit in second quarter of 2018.
Looking forward, we still expect EWC to provide slightly positive net cash to parent from 2019 through 2022. Leo mentioned that we continue to systematically reduce risk as we complete our exit from EWC. Energy sales are 94% hedged. At Indian Point, our sale agreement does not require a minimum level of funding in the nuclear decommissioning trust as a condition to close. Palisades' trust now only has 25% equity investments. And at a 5% return, we should not expect to have to make any contributions to close the transaction.
Pilgrim shuts down at the end of May and its trust is essentially in cash. And finally, as a reminder, our strategy to sell nonoperating nuclear assets fully transfers the plant's decommissioning liability to the new owners. As a result, we have significantly reduced our risk associated with revenue, operating, capital market and decommissioning activities for EWC as we finalize our exit from that business.
Moving to operating cash flow on Slide 7, for the quarter, was $552 million -- a $29 million increase from a year-ago. The change was driven by a lower amount of unprotected excess ADIT returned to customers, lower fueling outage cost and lower ARO spending at EWC. Partially offsetting were higher severance and retention payments at EWC.
Turning to our guidance and outlook on Slide 8. Today, we continue to see results coming in around the midpoint for 2019. In addition, we're raising the financial outlook midpoints for 2020 and 2021. The updated outlook is driven by $750 million of incremental investments through 2021 that improve reliability and customer engagement. These investments are centered on themes that we have discussed, namely updating distribution, transmission and generation infrastructure to drive improved reliability as well as new products and services for our customers. However, an important goal is for our rates to remain among the lowest in the nation for investor-owned utilities. To that end, we're working to optimize our operating costs, in part by leveraging innovation, automation, grid modernization and other new technologies to drive efficiency and productivity in our business processes.
We expect O&M to be about $2.65 billion in 2020, 2021, the goal to offset inflation in our business on an ongoing basis. The combination of the incremental investments and cost discipline will improve our level of service to our customers while continuing to manage bill growth at or below inflation. The benefits of these efforts are not just limited to our customers. Our employees will have the opportunity to develop new skills, broaden their professional expertise and leverage technology to work more productively. Our communities will see economic development and will benefit from better service and improved reliability. And our investors will see improved earnings per share growth and improved confidence in our expectations. We previously communicated our targeted adjusted EPS growth of 5% to 7% and that remains our expectation. The new midpoints reflect a 6% growth rate off of 2019's midpoint. Additionally, we have narrowed our guidance and outlook ranges by $0.10, and we could narrow them further in future years as we continue to execute on our strategy and deliver on our commitments. Providing steady, predictable growth is fundamental to our strategy and this includes our dividend. Our goal is to align our dividend growth rate with our EPS growth rate of 5% to 7%. And the key variable to determine that is our capital plan. Given our updated capital plan, we expect to achieve our alignment objective in the fourth quarter of 2021. We discussed this dividend plan with our Board, and they support our goal and timing. 
As you know, dividends are quarterly decisions made by the Board and this one will be made at that time. These collective updates reflect the evolution of our business to a premier regulated utility. The success we've had in executing our strategy over the past 3 years gives us confidence in our ability to deliver on our ongoing plans. 
Turning to credit on Slide 9. Our parent debt-to-total debt has further improved to 19.4%, largely due to the settlement of the remainder of the equity forward in May. Our FFO to debt is 11.8%. This includes the effects of returning approximately $650 million of unprotected excess ADIT to customers. Excluding this giveback and certain items related to our exit of EWC, FFO to debt would be 15.8%. While some things in our plan have changed, several critical credit elements have not. We expect cash flow to continue to improve beginning next quarter and throughout the remainder of the year and the amount of unprotected excess ADIT returns to customers -- as the amount of unprotected excess ADIT returned to customers decline. Our equity financing framework remains the same as it was at our Analyst Day last year, and we remain committed to our targets of at or above 15% of FFO to debt by 2020 and below 25% for parent debt-to-total debt, as well as maintaining our investment-grade profile. 
We had another productive quarter with good results. We continue to execute on our plan to deliver steady, predictable growth in earnings and dividends through customer-centric investments. The improvements we're making today are a natural continuation of the evolution underway for some time. They're reflected in the alignment toward customer outcomes, our focus on customer bills, development of new investment opportunities and updated earnings outlook, tighter outlook ranges and dividend path clarity.
As Leo mentioned, the fundamentals of our business are strong and we're well positioned for continued value creation. We are a world-class utility working for the benefit of all 4 of our key stakeholders. And now, the Entergy team is available to answer questions."

Those are the types of things that we're still looking at. Nothing that we're talking about today -- nothing that enters the plan are outside of the bounds of the sorts of things that we've been talking about for some time with all of you and certainly working on for even longer internally to the company.
As we look at it, as we've always said, what we're -- what we're always balancing, every day, every decision we make, is that 3-pronged outcomes that we need for our customers. One, it has to improve the level of service that we provide. And two, we have to do it to manage their bills. Managing the bills is the governor in terms of how much we can spend on upgrading the reliability of the system. We've got to balance that. And then obviously, the sustainability objectives that we and our customers and all of you as investors have. So it is more of the same in terms of what we have to do to be looking at to upgrade that system.
The 7,000 megawatts to 8,000 megawatts of generation, that's a continuation of what we've been doing and that is modernizing the fleet to lower O&M, lower fuel cost, improve emissions across the board as we look to deactivate 40 and 50-year-old units and replace them with new capacity. So if you look at our system, we used to put out that histogram of the age of our fleet. We still have some older units. Some of what we are spending the money on right now, the new -- some of those new dollars are actually to go into some of those legacy gas units to make sure they continue to operate reliably while they get into queue to be replaced by the newer stuff.
So it's nothing new. It's nothing that we haven't been talking about before. It's really just a focus on making sure that we balance those 3 objectives. We want to make sure that we improve the level of service; maintain some of the lowest rates in the country; work on the customers' bills, keep them below the level of inflation while we continue to improve our sustainability footprint; but importantly, as I mentioned, the sustainability of our customers. That's very important to them as well, so."

So in terms of the flowback to customers, we would expect that pretty much all of it would flow back to customers in the course of time. As you're noting, depending on the jurisdiction, some would flow back to customers faster than others. And I think that's actually a critical piece of the overall strategy here because we are aiming to manage our customers' bills. And by doing that, we are creating space in the bill for incremental capital investments to improve reliability. And I think there's -- we don't have it in the main slide, but there's an appendix slide, I think it's like Slide 38 or so that talks about how our earnings are expected to change. While it happens, you will notice that the net revenue line doesn't really move all that much. And the O&M line is, that's creating that space for us. So we would expect that, that would flow back to customers because we are not anticipating their bills really moving at all as a result of this incremental capital.
In terms of some of the O&M and the progress that we've made, I think the answer is yes. We have made some progress this year, that's part of what gives us confidence that we can execute on this going forward. And I don't know if all of it is in rates today, but it will get into rates very quickly -- this year, as you know, we're using it to offset some of the negative weather that we had in the first quarter. Plus, I mentioned in my remarks, the industrial sales growth was a little bit below our expectations year-to-date. But it will be fine long-term. But in the meantime, we need to make sure that we're managing to hit our expectations for this year.
So some of that is happening now, it's part of what gives us confidence going forward and it should all flow back into rates."

On the transmission side, there is quite a bit of economic development along the corridor between New Orleans and Baton Rouge that's prompting new reliability, investment opportunities for us from a transmission perspective that, frankly, we weren't planning at the beginning of the year mainly along the west side of the Mississippi River.

We are pleased to report third quarter adjusted earnings per share of $2.52. Drew, will go over the details, but the bottom line is that these are strong results and will allow us to raise our 2019 guidance midpoint by $0.05 and narrow the range. We also remain firmly on track to achieve our long-term outlooks. With 3 quarters behind us, we completed many of our key deliverables for the year, to keep us on track to achieve our goal to be the premier utility, including a few important milestones this quarter. 
Furthering our orderly exit from EWC, in late August the NRC approved our license transfer application for Pilgrim Nuclear Power Station. And shortly after that, we completed the sale to a subsidiary Holtec International. This is the second sale that we have successfully completed of a nonoperating nuclear plant and the third in the industry. This is also the second time the NRC has determine the Holtec has the financial and technical capabilities to decommission nuclear plants. As a reminder, we have agreements to sell our last 2 remaining nuclear planths to Holtec. 
We've also had significant accomplishments at the utility. Providing added clarity to our investment plan, the Mississippi Public Service Commission approved our proposal to purchase the generation station. We expect to close the transaction soon. The commission's order also included a stipulation supporting timely and full cost recovery of the asset. We expect the plan to be included in the rates with minimal lag, similar to how we have recovered cost of past acquisitions in Mississippi. Purchasing this clean and modern 810-megawatt combined cycle natural gas turbine is a good outcome for our stakeholders and is expected to result in approximately $100 million in net benefits for Entergy Mississippi's customers. 
We also have a solid track record of completing major generation projects on time and on budget or better. Supported by a solid capital projects management team. We are on track with the Lake Charles Power Station and New Orleans Power Station, which are expected to come online next year.  Montgomery County Power Station in Texas is also on schedule and expected to come online in mid-2021. 
On the renewables front, construction has begun on one of the largest solar facilities currently claimed for Louisiana. Capital Region Solar is a 50-megawatt solar project being built in West Baton Rouge, Parish. Once completed, the facility will offset the equivalent of nearly 19,000 passenger vehicle admissions each year. We will purchase the offer under a 20-year agreement. We are working with our regulators to expand and customize our portfolio for renewable energy solutions, to meet our customers' expectations and to achieve our sustainability goals. 
Turning to regulatory proceedings. Entergy Louisiana's new rates become effective in September. The company's annual FRP evaluation provides a simpler process that aligns rates and costs better than traditional rate cases. In Arkansas, we've reached an unopposed settlement on the company's annual FRP, which we are filing today. The settlement is in line with our initial expectation. We anticipate a final decision from the Arkansas Commission by the end of the year. 
In New Orleans, the city -- the Council Utility Committee issued a resolution that if adopted, wet set a revenue requirement that is below what we believe to be just reasonable for Entergy New Orleans and our customers. We continue to work with council members to reach a fair outcome when the council takes up the matter in early November.  This continued progress on regulatory proceedings is an important component of our success as it improves clarity on recoverability of our investments and solidifies our financial commitments.
Another growing part of our company that we are excited about is our innovation Center. This group is developing product and service concepts to meet the evolving expectations of our utility customers and the communities we serve. The team employs a rigorous work process, focused on exploring customer frictions and feedback, product design, market opportunities and more. For example, last quarter, I highlighted Entergy New Orleans', new program that puts solar panels on low-income customers' homes. Under this program, Entergy will install the rooftop solar system at no cost from the customers and give them a credit on monthly bills. That idea came out of our innovation team. 
Another concept developed that is now being implemented is a customer-sided backup generation solution for commercial and small industrial customers. The generators will be owned by Entergy and will of those businesses to operate as usual during widespread outages. For example, retail businesses would be able to provide services to the general public during significant weather events. In other times, when needed, the resource can be deployed by the utility, which benefits all the customers. 
Entergy owned customer-sided generation is an innovative win-win solution. It provides an economical alternative to businesses to remain open when our communities need them most and it provides us the utility and added resource when the system needs it. Entergy Texas recently announced a pilot of this concept in its service area and Entergy Mississippi has a filing pending before the Public Service Commission.  Our plan is to eventually implement this idea at all operating companies. 
Innovation and new technologies will be an important part of our business as we continue to explore solutions to improve our customers' everyday lives. 
As many of you know, there have been 3 significant storms in the last few months. Hurricane Dorian made landfall on the East Coast in early September, Entergy sent nearly 500 workers to the Carolina coast to help with the restoration efforts. Then a few weeks later, tropical storm made landform in Texas bringing 20 to 40 inches of rain over the impacted service area. We deployed more than 1,000 workers both from Entergy and from other utilities. At the peak, we had approximately 38,000 customers without power. Service was restored in 95% of our customers within 4 days. Just this past weekend, tropical storm Olga moved through Louisiana. Storm brought heavy rain and winds in excess of 50 miles per hour. At its peak, Olga disrupted electric service to more than 92,000 customers. The storm team of more than 1,000 workers restored the vast majority of outages within 2 days. Entergy employees have a long history of working together after natural disasters. They work to restore power for our customers and to assist our communities after an event. They also help coworkers who are impacted. In addition to volunteer support, the company has established employee assistance funds to provide financial assistance for affected employees. 
Providing support in times of need whether man power of financial contribution is important, ongoing. Efforts that support our communities are also vital to our success. In September, for the 12th consecutive year, Site Selection magazine named Entergy as one of the nation's top utilities in economic development. Entergy plays a vital role in economic development efforts across our service area, which brings business, jobs, and community support to our states. Sustainability is a key focus here at Entergy. Once again, we were named the Dow Jones sustainability North America index. We are very proud of this achievement. DJSI is one of the most respected independent sustainability measures in the world. We are the only electric utility to receive this honor, 18 years in a row, and for the past 5 years, we have made a perfect score in the climate strategy category.  To be named to this respect at least year-after-year is a clear acknowledgment of Entergy's commitment to implementing sustainability practices that serve our customers, employees, communities and our owners.
Last Friday, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.93 per share. This is the fifth straight year of steady predictable growth in our dividend and with this declaration will pay a total of $3.66 per share in common dividends this year, just under 70% payout at our guidance midpoint. As we mentioned, last quarter, we expect to grow our dividend each year and plan to increase the growth to be more in line with our earnings, starting in 2021.
This has been another successful quarter for our company and our stakeholders, as we continue to execute on our path to be the premier utility in every aspect of our business. We have among the lowest retail rates in the country. The states we serve benefit from strong industrial growth. We are an industry leader in sustainability. We invest in our communities, we invest in our employees and our culture. The fundamentals that underlie our steady predictable growth are strong. First, we have a robust capital plan which benefits our customers and supports the growth of the business and economic development in our communities. We have no shortage of investment opportunities beyond our current forecast period. As the utility with some of the lowest rates in the country, we always remain diligent in managing the cost impact to our customers and will continue to do so. Second, we have constructed regulatory mechanism, which give us the opportunity for fair and timely recovery of our capital plan. As we've noted in the past, we have a unique line of sight with approximately 90% of our capital plan ready for execution from a regulatory perspective and approximately 90% expected to be recovered through annual FRP's and writers. And third, we have a proven track record and ability to execute on major capital projects with cost and schedule certainty. This clear line of sight and our ability to execute our capital plan on time and on budget combined with the progressive regulatory mechanism ensures timely recovery of our investment supports our outlooks today.
And as we continue to identify sources of customer savings, including O&M and production cost efficiency, energy efficiency and industrial growth, we aspire to do even better.

As Leo mentioned, we had another successful quarter and with our strong results we are raising the midpoint of our 2019 guidance by $0.05 and narrowing the range. Also we remain firmly on track to meet our longer-ter",682,"Thank you Leo. Good morning, everyone. As Leo mentioned, we had another successful quarter and with our strong results we are raising the midpoint of our 2019 guidance by $0.05 and narrowing the range. Also we remain firmly on track to meet our longer-term outlooks. 
As you can see on Slide 4, on a per share basis, Entergy adjusted earnings were $2.52, $0.17 higher than the third quarter 2018, including the effect of dilution. Turning to Slide 5, rate actions in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas contributed positively to the quarter's results as did higher sales volume in the unbilled period. 
Overall, revenue was a little higher than we anticipated due to weather. Bill sales volume decline versus last year, which was in part due to fewer days billed. Volume in the unbilled period was positive as they capture offset to fewer days built as well as warmer weather at the end of September. Other drivers for the quarter's results included regulatory charges last year -- included regulatory charges last year to return the benefits of the lower federal tax rates to customers, higher rather O&M due largely to higher spending on information technology and customer initiatives, including distribution operations, partially offset by lower nuclear cost. Drivers related to our growth such as higher depreciation expense, including the St. Charles Power Station, which came online at the end of May, lower decommissioning trust fund returns and lastly, a higher share count affected this quarter's results on a per share basis.
Looking at EWC on Slide 6. As reported earnings were $1.27 per share lower than the prior year. Drivers for the quarter included the absence of tax items recorded in the third quarter 2018, lower revenue due to shutdown of as well as lower capacity pricing, lower decommissioned truck fund returns and higher asset writeoffs and impairment charges related to the sale of Pilgrim. Partially offsetting the decrease was lower rather O&M due to lower spending on nuclear operations and looking ahead, we still expect EWC to provide slightly positive net cash to parent from 2019 through 2022.
Turning to Slide 7. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $1.065 billion, $286 million increase from year ago. The change was driven by lower amount of unprotected FSA ADIT return to customers, lower pension contributions and lower ARO spending at EWC. Partially offsetting higher severances and retention payments at EWC. 
Turning to our guidance and outlook on Slide 8. For 2019, we have raised midpoint to $5.35 as a result of weather returning back to normal for the year. And mitigating strategies we put in place earlier in the year. We expect our results to come in around the midpoint of our updated range. Our targeted adjusted EPS growth remained at 5% to 7% off of our original 2019 guidance midpoint. Our outlooks include a new year, 2022, which in line with this growth rate. More information will be available in our EEI materials.
Moving to our credit metrics on Slide 9, our parent debt-to-total debt is 20.5% and our FFO to debt is 14.2%. This includes the effects of returning $469 million of unprotected excess ADIT to customers over last 12 months. Excluding this giveback and certain items relating to exit of EWC, FFO to debt would be 17.6%. We still have to return some unprotected excess ADIT to customers go up to report to bulk of the credit impact is now behind us. We remain committed to our target of at or above 15% for FFO or FFO to debt by 2020 and below 25% for parent debt-to-total debt. As well as maintaining our investment-grade profile.
This is another successful quarter with strong results. We were able to raise our 2019 guidance midpoint and we're firmly on track to achieve longer-term outlooks. We continue to execute on our plans and delivers steady, predictable growth in earnings and dividend through customer-centric investment. And as Leo mentioned, we inspire to do even better to continue to develop our culture and continuous improvement. 
And now, the Entergy team is available to answer your questions."

As we mentioned before, given the fact that we've done that ramp-up in the staffing and put the processes and procedures in place we need to keep things on track. So that's kind of it.

Our objectives will be -- we believe we'll continue to meet it, has been to keep our build inflation level consistent with inflation. As you recall, even in last quarter, when we were able to come up with some continuous improvement ideas and change our capital plan, the bill pass actually went down from where it was otherwise been. So we think we're going to continue to be able to manage that with the current capital plan that we have going forward. On the -- I'm not sure, I'm going to remember all of these, but I think the renewables from a CapEx standpoint, we mentioned on the last call that we still see the need to replace significant amount of our aging generation than a portion that will be gas, portion of that will be renewables. We outlined 7 to 8000 megawatts need and a roughly 50-50 gas to renewables standpoint there. We're not really doing anything outside of meeting our own customers needs with the generation that we got. So that's 22 to 30 time frame. So that's still obviously, we're adding some scale in the renewable front, but the scale economies obviously must. So we continue to see that as a part of our resource plan but it's really part of our resource plan like everything else, given the fully integrated nature that we have. As far as transmission expenditure, nothing has really changed from the last quarter. I'll open it up to my team to correct me or, and I think I answered all of your questions."

The first thing I think from our perspective is that macro fundamentals that we see that have been driving our industrial growth are still very much in place. The low inputs from energy perspective, gas prices for example, our low-power prices. The spreads of natural gas to oil or the spread geographically to Europe or Asia, those still remain very fundamentally sound, along with the of course, some of our natural advantages of here on the Gulf Coast taxes, deliver that threat if they will post strong and supportive communities all those things continue to be very supportive. And so you take our industrial base, it is some of the most modern and competitive in the world. So we expected to continue to run that's what we have seen for our large industrials this year. We've seen our refiners, our chlor-alkali facilities, our petrochem facilities continue to perform very well. Where we've had challenges are people that are coming up online. So we have new construction that is in place or taking place and it's just not ramping up as fast as we anticipated. We've been talking about that for a couple of quarters. And the small industrial space, our small industrial space has been surprisingly strong, despite all the economic headline, except for one area in Arkansas, we've had some agricultural customers, which are seasonally oriented and typically are pumping a lot of water and we only a lot of floods in the spring and that carried over into the summer into our fleet until this quarter. So our small industrial sales were down, but that was 2/3 of the driver, right there. And so we continue to see opportunities in the industrial space with all the fundamentals still in place.

What we talked about was particularly, given the schedule with Montgomery County that we would shape the rate case to the extent that we needed to ensure that recovery of Montgomery County that's reflected in our existing plan, it will shape with the timing of that rate case. That said, the rider that was passed gave us an opportunity as we look beyond Montgomery County to have more contemporary rates recovery from a regulatory process perspective. We still have to have the legislation only in enable the commission to provide that relief. We still have to go through the process of rule making through the PUCT to put that rider in effect. And from our advantage point, as we think about capital plan in Texas, we have not yet determined how we wish to time the availability of the rate cases and mechanism and contemporaneous rule making around that rider. We still have to go to the PUCT and candidly, that conversation is ongoing because when they are the parties would be part of that regulatory process. But think about it this way, we'll go to the commission to ask for rulemaking that would take advantage of the legislation to put the actual rider in effect for ongoing recovery. So from a timing standpoint, we don't want to set an expectation that there is immediate upside.

We are pleased to report third quarter adjusted earnings per share of $2.52. Drew will go over the details, but the bottom line is that these are strong results that allow us to raise our 2019 guidance midpoint by $0.05 and narrow the range. We also remain firmly on track to achieve our longer-term outlooks. With 3 quarters behind us, we've completed many of our key deliverables for the year to keep us on track to achieve our goal to be the premier utility, including a few important milestones this quarter.
Furthering our orderly exit from EWC, in late August the NRC approved our license transfer application for Pilgrim Nuclear Power Station. And shortly after that, we completed the sale to a subsidiary of Holtec International. This is the second sale that we have successfully completed of a nonoperating nuclear plant and the third in the industry. This is also the second time the NRC has determined that Holtec has the financial and technical capabilities to decommission nuclear plants. As a reminder, we have agreements to sell our last 2 remaining merchant nuclear plants to Holtec.
We've also had significant accomplishments at the utility. Providing added clarity to our investment plan, the Mississippi Public Service Commission approved our proposal to purchase the Choctaw generation station. We expect to close the transaction soon. The commission's order also included a stipulation supporting timely and full cost recovery of the asset. We expect the plan to be included in rates with minimal lag, similar to how we have recovered cost of past acquisitions in Mississippi. Purchasing this clean and modern 810-megawatt combined cycle natural gas turbine is a good outcome for our stakeholders and is expected to result in approximately $100 million in net benefits for Entergy Mississippi's customers.
We also have a solid track record of completing major generation projects on time and on budget or better, supported by a solid capital projects management team. We are on track with Lake Charles Power Station and New Orleans Power Station, which are expected to come online next year. Montgomery County Power Station in Texas is also on schedule and expected to come online in mid-2021.
On the renewables front, construction has begun on one of the largest solar facilities currently planned for Louisiana. Capital Region Solar is a 50-megawatt solar project being built in West Baton Rouge Parish. Once completed, the facility will offset the equivalent of nearly 19,000 passenger vehicles' emissions each year. We will purchase the output under a 20-year agreement. We are working with our regulators to expand and customize our portfolio for renewable energy solutions to meet our customers' expectations and to achieve our sustainability goals.
Turning to regulatory proceedings. Entergy Louisiana's new rates became effective in September. The company's annual FRP evaluation provides a simpler process that aligns rates and costs better than traditional rate cases. In Arkansas, we've reached an unopposed settlement on the company's annual FRP, which we are filing today. The settlement is in line with our initial expectations. We anticipate a final decision from the Arkansas Commission by the end of the year.
In New Orleans, the city -- the Council Utility Committee issued a resolution that if adopted would set a revenue requirement that is below what we believe to be just and reasonable for Entergy New Orleans and our customers. We continue to work with council members to reach a fair outcome when the council takes up the matter in early November.  This continued progress on regulatory proceedings is an important component of our success as it improves clarity on the recoverability of our investments and solidifies our financial commitments.
Another growing part of our company that we are excited about is our innovation center. This group is developing product and service concepts to meet the evolving expectations of our utility customers and the communities we serve. The team employs a rigorous work process, focused on exploring customer frictions and feedback, product design, market opportunities and more. For example, last quarter, I highlighted Entergy New Orleans' new program that puts solar panels on low-income customers' homes. Under this program, Entergy will install the rooftop solar system at no cost from the customers and give them a credit on their monthly bills. That idea came out of our innovation team.
Another concept developed that is now being implemented is a customer-sided backup generation solution for commercial and small industrial customers. The generators will be owned by Entergy and would allow those businesses to operate as usual during widespread outages. For example, retail businesses would be able to provide services to the general public during significant weather events. In other times, when needed, the resource can be deployed by the utility, which benefits all customers.
Entergy-owned, customer-sided generation is an innovative win-win solution. It provides an economical alternative to businesses to remain open when our communities need them most and it provides us the utility and added resource when the system needs it. Entergy Texas recently announced a pilot of this concept in its service area and Entergy Mississippi has a filing pending before the Public Service Commission. Our plan is to eventually implement this idea at all operating companies.
Innovation and new technologies will be an important part of our business as we continue to explore solutions to improve our customers' everyday lives.
As many of you know, there have been 3 significant storms in the last few months. Hurricane Dorian made landfall on the East Coast in early September. Entergy sent nearly 500 workers to the Carolina coast to help with the restoration efforts. Then a few weeks later Tropical Storm Imelda made landfall in Texas bringing 20 to 40 inches of rain over the impacted service area. We deployed more than 1,000 workers both from Entergy and from other utilities. At the peak, we had approximately 38,000 customers without power. Service was restored in 95% of our customers within 4 days. Just this past weekend, Tropical Storm Olga moved through Louisiana. The storm brought heavy rain and winds in excess of 50 miles per hour. At its peak, Olga disrupted electric service to more than 92,000 customers. The storm team of more than 1,000 workers restored the vast majority of outages within 2 days. Entergy employees have a long history of working together after natural disasters. They work to restore power for our customers and to assist our communities after an event. They also help coworkers who are impacted. In addition to volunteer support, the company has established employee assistance funds to provide financial assistance for affected employees.
Providing support in times of need, whether man power or financial contributions, is important. Ongoing efforts that support our communities are also vital to our success. In September, for the 12th consecutive year, Site Selection magazine named Entergy as one of the nation's top utilities in economic development. Entergy plays a vital role in economic development efforts across our service area, which brings business, jobs, and community support to our states. Sustainability is a key focus here at Entergy. Once again, we were named to the Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index. We are very proud of this achievement. DJSI is one of the most respected independent sustainability measures in the world. We are the only electric utility to receive this honor 18 years in a row. And for the past 5 years, we have made a perfect score in the climate strategy category. To be named to this respected list year-after-year is a clear acknowledgment of Entergy's commitment to implementing sustainability practices that serve our customers, employees, communities and our owners.
Last Friday, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.93 per share. This is the fifth straight year of steady predictable growth in our dividend and with this declaration, we'll pay a total of $3.66 per share in common dividends this year, just under 70% payout at our guidance midpoint. As we mentioned last quarter, we expect to grow our dividend each year and plan to increase the growth to be more in line with our earnings, starting in 2021.
This has been another successful quarter for our company and our stakeholders, as we continue to execute on our path to be the premier utility in every aspect of our business. We have among the lowest retail rates in the country. The states we serve benefit from strong industrial growth. We are an industry leader in sustainability. We invest in our communities and we invest in our employees and our culture. The fundamentals that underlie our steady predictable growth are strong. First, we have a robust capital plan which benefits our customers and supports the growth of the business and economic development in our communities. We have no shortage of investment opportunities beyond our current forecast period. As a utility with some of the lowest rates in the country, we always remain diligent in managing the cost impact to our customers and will continue to do so. Second, we have constructed regulatory mechanisms, which give us the opportunity for fair and timely recovery of our capital plan. As we've noted in the past, we have a unique line of sight with approximately 90% of our capital plan ready for execution from a regulatory perspective and approximately 90% expected to be recovered through annual FRPs and riders. And third, we have a proven track record and ability to execute on major capital projects with cost and schedule certainty. This clear line of sight and our ability to execute our capital plan on time and on budget combined with the progressive regulatory mechanisms that ensure timely recovery of our investments supports our outlooks today.
And as we continue to identify sources of customer savings, including O&M and production cost efficiency, energy efficiency and industrial growth, we aspire to do even better.
I will now turn the call over to Drew."

As Leo mentioned, we had another successful quarter and with our strong results, we are raising the midpoint of our 2019 guidance by $0.05 and narrowing the range. Also we remain firmly on track to meet our longer-term outlooks.
As you can see on Slide 4, on a per share basis, Entergy adjusted earnings were $2.52, $0.17 higher than the third quarter of 2018, including the effect of dilution. Turning to Slide 5, rate actions in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas contributed positively to the quarter's results as did higher sales volume in the unbilled period.
Overall, revenue was a little higher than we anticipated due to weather. Bill sales volume declined versus last year, which was in part due to fewer days billed. Volume in the unbilled period was positive as they capture the offset, the fewer days billed as well as warmer weather at the end of September. Other drivers for the quarter's results included regulatory charges last year -- included regulatory charges last year to return the benefits in the lower federal tax rate to customers, higher other O&M due largely to higher spending on information technology and customer initiatives, including distribution operations, partially offset by lower nuclear cost. Drivers related to our growth such as higher depreciation expense, including the St. Charles Power Station, which came online at the end of May, lower decommissioning trust fund returns and lastly, a higher share count affected this quarter's results on a per share basis.
Looking at EWC on Slide 6. As reported earnings were $1.27 per share lower than the prior year. Drivers for the quarter included the absence of tax items recorded in the third quarter 2018, lower revenue due to the shutdown of Pilgrim as well as lower capacity pricing, lower decommissioning trust fund returns and higher asset write-offs and impairment charges related to the sale of Pilgrim. Partially offsetting the decrease was lower other O&M due to lower spending on nuclear operations and looking ahead, we still expect EWC to provide slightly positive net cash to parent from 2019 through 2022.
Turning to Slide 7. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $1.065 billion, a $286 million increase from a year ago. The change was driven by lower amount of unprotected excess ADIT returned to customers, lower pension contributions and lower ARO spending at EWC. Partially offsetting were higher severances and retention payments at EWC.
Turning to our guidance and outlook on Slide 8. For 2019, we have raised the midpoint to $5.35 as a result of weather returning back to normal for the year and mitigating strategies we put in place earlier in the year. We expect our results to come in around the midpoint of our updated range. Our targeted adjusted EPS growth remains at 5% to 7% off of our original 2019 guidance midpoint. Our outlooks include a new year, 2022, which is in line with this growth rate. More information will be available in our EEI materials.
Moving to our credit metrics on Slide 9, our parent debt-to-total debt is 20.5% and our FFO to debt is 14.2%. This includes the effects of returning $469 million of unprotected excess ADIT to customers over the last 12 months. Excluding this giveback and certain items related to our exit of EWC, FFO to debt would be 17.6%. But we still have to return some unprotected excess ADIT to customers. I'm happy to report that the bulk of the credit impact is now behind us. We remain committed to our targets of at or above 15% for FFO -- for FFO to debt by 2020 and below 25% for parent debt-to-total debt as well as maintaining our investment-grade profile.
This is another successful quarter with strong results. We were able to raise our 2019 guidance midpoint and we're firmly on track to achieve longer-term outlooks. We continue to execute on our plans to deliver steady, predictable growth in earnings and dividends through customer-centric investment. And as Leo mentioned, we aspire to do even better as we continue to develop our culture of continuous improvement.
And now, the Entergy team is available to answer questions."

Other than that, it's just a continuation of the plan. We should start to see a leveling off of the cost of construction there. As we mentioned before, given the fact that we've done the ramp out into staffing and put the processes and procedures in place that we need to keep things on track. So that's kind of it, that will be the next thing that you'll see publicly. As I mentioned before, I think, in the last call, we have one more outage at Grand Gulf that would be considered part of the catch-up in terms of investment profile. So it will be a long outage.

So we think we're going to continue to be able to manage that with the current capital plan that we have going forward. On the -- I'm not sure, I'm going to remember all of these, but I think, on the renewables from a CapEx standpoint, we mentioned on the last call that we still see the need to replace the significant amount of our aging generation and that a portion of that will be gas, a portion of that could be renewables. We outlined a 7,000 to 8,000-megawatt need and a roughly 50-50 gas to renewables standpoint there. We're not really doing anything outside of meeting our own customers' needs with the generation that we've got, so that's -- that '22 to '30 time frame. So that's still, obviously, we're adding some scale on the renewable front, but -- and there are scale economies obviously if us doing it. So we continue to see that as a part of our resource plan, but it's really just part of the resource plan like everything else given the fully integrated nature that we have. As far as transmission expenditures, nothing has really changed in that from the last quarter. And I'll open it up to my team to correct me or -- and I think I answered all of the questions."

The call earlier today, I know it's not your region, but -- and you have different industrial drivers than they do, but Southern Company was talking about how they too are seeing a little bit of slowdown in demand expectations versus their initial forecast. Can you sort of point to anything in particular that you are seeing as it relates to perhaps the global economic conditions, trade war or other things that might be driving things on power demand to the -- below your prior guidance range. You give pretty good sensitivities in your -- in the appendix of how we should think about those impacts should they deviate from the forecast. But then, again, we also see that you're underearning in Arkansas and there could be improvements there. So as we think about how you sort of stay inside the [ skid ] sort of of the high end and the low end of your guidance range through time? How are you adjusting to those conditions?"

The first thing I think from our perspective is that the macro fundamentals that we see that have been driving our industrial growth are still very much in place. The low inputs from energy perspective, low gas prices, for example, or low power prices, the spreads of natural gas to oil or the spread geographically to Europe or Asia, those still remain very fundamentally sound along with, of course, some of our natural advantages here on the Gulf Coast, access to the Gulf Coast; access to the river; the ready, willing and able workforce; the strong and supportive communities, all those things continue to be very supportive. And so -- and then you take our industrial base, it is some of the most modern and competitive in the world and so we expect it to continue to run. In fact, that's what we have seen for our large industrials this year. We've seen our refiners, our chlor-alkali facilities, our petrochem facilities continue to perform very well. Where we've had challenges are people that are coming up online. So we have new construction that is in place or taking place and it's just not ramping up as fast as we anticipated. We've been talking about that for a couple of quarters. And the small industrial space, our small industrial space has been surprisingly strong despite all the economic headline, except for one area in Arkansas, we've had some agricultural customers, which are seasonally oriented and typically are pumping a lot of water. We had a lot of floods in the spring and that carried over into the summer into our 3 -- into this quarter. So our small industrial sales were down, but that was 2/3 of the driver right there. And so we continue to see opportunities in the industrial space with all the fundamentals still in place. And I'll turn it over to Rod to talk about what we have been seeing."

As we stated in prior conversations, that rider was not going to create an immediate material difference in our outlook. What we talked about was, particularly, given the schedule with Montgomery County that we would shape the rate case to the extent that we needed to ensure that the recovery of Montgomery County that's reflected in our existing plan, it was shaped with the timing of that rate case. That said, the rider that was passed gave us an opportunity as we look beyond Montgomery County to have more contemporaneous rate recovery. From a regulatory process perspective, we still have to have the -- remember the legislation only enabled the commission to provide that relief, we still have to go through the process of rulemaking through the PUCT to put that rider in effect. And from our vantage point, as we think about the capital plan in Texas, we have not yet determined how we wish to time the availability of the rate cases and mechanism and the contemporaneous rulemaking around that rider. We still have to go to the PUCT and candidly, that conversation is ongoing because they are the parties who would be part of that regulatory process. But think about it this way. We'll go to the commission to ask for rulemaking that would take advantage of the legislation to put the actual rider in effect for ongoing recovery. So from a timing standpoint, we don't want to set an expectation that there is immediate upside. So we'll be shaping the rate case and the regulatory process around that rider as we make the capital plan for Texas in the generation space a little more clear. There will be more on that, but it is not something immediate. I don't want to set that expectation."

Same goes with -- on renewable front. They will be part of the resource plan to meet the needs our customers have. We're not doing them outside of that customer base to meet any other needs.

We are pleased to report third quarter adjusted earnings per share of $2.52. Drew will go over the details, but the bottom line is that these are strong results that allow us to raise our 2019 guidance midpoint by $0.05 and narrow the range. We also remain firmly on track to achieve our longer-term outlooks. With 3 quarters behind us, we have completed many of our key deliverables for the year to keep us on track to achieve our goal to be the premier utility, including a few important milestones this quarter.
Furthering our orderly exit from EWC, in late August the NRC approved our license transfer application for Pilgrim Nuclear Power Station. And shortly after that, we completed the sale to a subsidiary of Holtec International. This is the second sale that we have successfully completed of a nonoperating nuclear plant and the third in the industry. This is also the second time the NRC has determined that Holtec has the financial and technical capabilities to decommission nuclear plants. As a reminder, we have agreements to sell our last 2 remaining merchant nuclear plants to Holtec.
We've also had significant accomplishments at the utility. Providing added clarity to our investment plan, the Mississippi Public Service Commission approved our proposal to purchase the Choctaw generation station. We expect to close the transaction soon. The commission's order also included a stipulation supporting timely and full cost recovery of the asset. We expect the plan to be included in rates with minimal lag, similar to how we have recovered cost of past acquisitions in Mississippi. Purchasing this clean and modern 810-megawatt combined cycle natural gas turbine is a good outcome for our stakeholders and is expected to result in approximately $100 million in net benefits for Entergy Mississippi's customers.
We also have a solid track record of completing major generation projects on time and on budget or better, supported by a solid capital projects management team. We are on track with Lake Charles Power Station and New Orleans Power Station, which are expected to come online next year. Montgomery County Power Station in Texas is also on schedule and expected to come online in mid-2021.
On the renewables front, construction has begun on one of the largest solar facilities currently planned for Louisiana. Capital Region Solar is a 50-megawatt solar project being built in West Baton Rouge Parish. Once completed, the facility will offset the equivalent of nearly 19,000 passenger vehicles' emissions each year. We will purchase the output under a 20-year agreement. We are working with our regulators to expand and customize our portfolio for renewable energy solutions to meet our customers' expectations and to achieve our sustainability goals.
Turning to regulatory proceedings. Entergy Louisiana's new rates became effective in September. The company's annual FRP evaluation provides a simpler process that aligns rates and costs better than traditional rate cases. In Arkansas, we've reached an unopposed settlement on the company's annual FRP, which we are filing today. The settlement is in line with our initial expectations. We anticipate a final decision from the Arkansas Commission by the end of the year.
In New Orleans, the city -- the Council Utility Committee issued a resolution that if adopted would set a revenue requirement that is below what we believe to be just and reasonable for Entergy New Orleans and our customers. We continue to work with council members to reach a fair outcome when the council takes up the matter in early November.  This continued progress on regulatory proceedings is an important component of our success as it improves clarity on the recoverability of our investments and solidifies our financial commitments.
Another growing part of our company that we are excited about is our innovation center. This group is developing product and service concepts to meet the evolving expectations of our utility customers and the communities we serve. The team employs a rigorous work process, focused on exploring customer frictions and feedback, product design, market opportunities and more. For example, last quarter, I highlighted Entergy New Orleans' new program that puts solar panels on low-income customers' homes. Under this program, Entergy will install the rooftop solar system at no cost from the customers and give them a credit on their monthly bills. That idea came out of our innovation team.
Another concept developed that is now being implemented is a customer-sided backup generation solution for commercial and small industrial customers. The generators will be owned by Entergy and would allow those businesses to operate as usual during widespread outages. For example, retail businesses would be able to provide services to the general public during significant weather events. In other times, when needed, the resource can be deployed by the utility, which benefits all customers.
Entergy-owned, customer-sided generation is an innovative win-win solution. It provides an economical alternative to businesses to remain open when our communities need them most and it provides us the utility and added resource when the system needs it. Entergy Texas recently announced a pilot of this concept in its service area and Entergy Mississippi has a filing pending before the Public Service Commission. Our plan is to eventually implement this idea at all operating companies.
Innovation and new technologies will be an important part of our business as we continue to explore solutions to improve our customers' everyday lives.
As many of you know, there have been 3 significant storms in the last few months. Hurricane Dorian made landfall on the East Coast in early September. Entergy sent nearly 500 workers to the Carolina coast to help with the restoration efforts. Then a few weeks later Tropical Storm Imelda made landfall in Texas bringing 20 to 40 inches of rain over the impacted service area. We deployed more than 1,000 workers both from Entergy and from other utilities. At the peak, we had approximately 38,000 customers without power. Service was restored in 95% of our customers within 4 days. Just this past weekend, Tropical Storm Olga moved through Louisiana. The storm brought heavy rain and winds in excess of 50 miles per hour. At its peak, Olga disrupted electric service to more than 92,000 customers. The storm team of more than 1,000 workers restored the vast majority of outages within 2 days. Entergy employees have a long history of working together after natural disasters. They work to restore power for our customers and to assist our communities after an event. They also help coworkers who are impacted. In addition to volunteer support, the company has established employee assistance funds to provide financial assistance for affected employees.
Providing support in times of need, whether man power or financial contributions, is important. Ongoing efforts that support our communities are also vital to our success. In September, for the 12th consecutive year, Site Selection magazine named Entergy as one of the nation's top utilities in economic development. Entergy plays a vital role in economic development efforts across our service area, which brings business, jobs, and community support to our states. Sustainability is a key focus here at Entergy. Once again, we were named to the Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index. We are very proud of this achievement. DJSI is one of the most respected independent sustainability measures in the world. We are the only electric utility to receive this honor 18 years in a row. And for the past 5 years, we have made a perfect score in the climate strategy category. To be named to this respected list year-after-year is a clear acknowledgment of Entergy's commitment to implementing sustainability practices that serve our customers, employees, communities and our owners.
Last Friday, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.93 per share. This is the fifth straight year of steady predictable growth in our dividend and with this declaration, we'll pay a total of $3.66 per share in common dividends this year, just under 70% payout at our guidance midpoint. As we mentioned last quarter, we expect to grow our dividend each year and plan to increase the growth to be more in line with our earnings, starting in 2021.
This has been another successful quarter for our company and our stakeholders, as we continue to execute on our path to be the premier utility in every aspect of our business. We have among the lowest retail rates in the country. The states we serve benefit from strong industrial growth. We are an industry leader in sustainability. We invest in our communities and we invest in our employees and our culture. The fundamentals that underlie our steady predictable growth are strong. First, we have a robust capital plan which benefits our customers and supports the growth of the business and economic development in our communities. We have no shortage of investment opportunities beyond our current forecast period. As a utility with some of the lowest rates in the country, we always remain diligent in managing the cost impact to our customers and will continue to do so. Second, we have constructed regulatory mechanisms, which give us the opportunity for fair and timely recovery of our capital plan. As we've noted in the past, we have a unique line of sight with approximately 90% of our capital plan ready for execution from a regulatory perspective and approximately 90% expected to be recovered through annual FRPs and riders. And third, we have a proven track record and ability to execute on major capital projects with cost and schedule certainty. This clear line of sight and our ability to execute our capital plan on time and on budget combined with the progressive regulatory mechanisms that ensure timely recovery of our investments supports our outlooks today.
And as we continue to identify sources of customer savings, including O&M and production cost efficiency, energy efficiency and industrial growth, we aspire to do even better.
I will now turn the call over to Drew."

As Leo mentioned, we had another successful quarter and with our strong results, we are raising the midpoint of our 2019 guidance by $0.05 and narrowing the range. Also we remain firmly on track to meet our longer-term outlooks.
As you can see on Slide 4, on a per share basis, Entergy adjusted earnings were $2.52, $0.17 higher than the third quarter of 2018, including the effect of dilution. Turning to Slide 5, rate actions in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas contributed positively to the quarter's results as did higher sales volume in the unbilled period.
Overall, revenue was a little higher than we anticipated due to weather. Bill sales volume declined versus last year, which was in part due to fewer days billed. Volume in the unbilled period was positive as they capture the offset, the fewer days billed as well as warmer weather at the end of September. Other drivers for the quarter's results included regulatory charges last year -- included regulatory charges last year to return the benefits in the lower federal tax rate to customers, higher other O&M due largely to higher spending on information technology and customer initiatives, including distribution operations, partially offset by lower nuclear cost. Drivers related to our growth such as higher depreciation expense, including the St. Charles Power Station, which came online at the end of May, lower decommissioning trust fund returns and lastly, a higher share count affected this quarter's results on a per share basis.
Looking at EWC on Slide 6. As reported earnings were $1.27 per share lower than the prior year. Drivers for the quarter included the absence of tax items recorded in the third quarter 2018, lower revenue due to the shutdown of Pilgrim as well as lower capacity pricing, lower decommissioning trust fund returns and higher asset write-offs and impairment charges related to the sale of Pilgrim. Partially offsetting the decrease was lower other O&M due to lower spending on nuclear operations and looking ahead, we still expect EWC to provide slightly positive net cash to parent from 2019 through 2022.
Turning to Slide 7. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $1.065 billion, a $286 million increase from a year ago. The change was driven by lower amount of unprotected excess ADIT returned to customers, lower pension contributions and lower ARO spending at EWC. Partially offsetting were higher severances and retention payments at EWC.
Turning to our guidance and outlook on Slide 8. For 2019, we have raised the midpoint to $5.35 as a result of weather returning back to normal for the year and mitigating strategies we put in place earlier in the year. We expect our results to come in around the midpoint of our updated range. Our targeted adjusted EPS growth remains at 5% to 7% off of our original 2019 guidance midpoint. Our outlooks include a new year, 2022, which is in line with this growth rate. More information will be available in our EEI materials.
Moving to our credit metrics on Slide 9, our parent debt-to-total debt is 20.5% and our FFO to debt is 14.2%. This includes the effects of returning $469 million of unprotected excess ADIT to customers over the last 12 months. Excluding this giveback and certain items related to our exit of EWC, FFO to debt would be 17.6%. But we still have to return some unprotected excess ADIT to customers. I'm happy to report that the bulk of the credit impact is now behind us. We remain committed to our targets of at or above 15% for FFO -- for FFO to debt by 2020 and below 25% for parent debt-to-total debt as well as maintaining our investment-grade profile.
This is another successful quarter with strong results. We were able to raise our 2019 guidance midpoint and we're firmly on track to achieve longer-term outlooks. We continue to execute on our plans to deliver steady, predictable growth in earnings and dividends through customer-centric investment.

I think the last remaining thing you will see from a NRC standpoint is the return of Grand Gulf to column 1, it's in column 2 at the moment, but we would anticipate that, that would happen this year. Other than that, it's just a continuation of the plan. We should start to see a leveling off of the cost of construction there. As we mentioned before, given the fact that we've done the ramp out into staffing and put the processes and procedures in place that we need to keep things on track. So that's kind of it, that will be the next thing that you'll see publicly. As I mentioned before, I think, in the last call, we have one more outage at Grand Gulf that would be considered part of the catch-up in terms of investment profile. So it will be a long outage. Our next outage in 2020 at Grand Gulf will be the final one in terms of getting things back to where they need to be, then it's just a continued climb to excellence."

Can you talk a bit more about CapEx reflected in your outlook around both renewables in light of what AEP in Wind Catcher is doing in Arkansas and prospects to mirror that to any extent?

Our objective, and we believe we'll continue to meet it, has been to keep our bill inflation level consistent with inflation. And as you recall, even in last quarter, when we were able to come up with some continuous improvement ideas and change our capital plan, the bill pass actually went down from where it would have otherwise been. So we think we're going to continue to be able to manage that with the current capital plan that we have going forward. On the -- I'm not sure, I'm going to remember all of these, but I think, on the renewables from a CapEx standpoint, we mentioned on the last call that we still see the need to replace the significant amount of our aging generation and that a portion of that will be gas, a portion of that could be renewables. We outlined a 7,000 to 8,000-megawatt need and a roughly 50-50 gas to renewables standpoint there. We're not really doing anything outside of meeting our own customers' needs with the generation that we've got, so that's -- that '22 to '30 time frame. So that's still, obviously, we're adding some scale on the renewable front, but -- and there are scale economies obviously if us doing it. So we continue to see that as a part of our resource plan, but it's really just part of the resource plan like everything else given the fully integrated nature that we have. As far as transmission expenditures, nothing has really changed in that from the last quarter. And I'll open it up to my team to correct me or -- and I think I answered all of the questions."

The first thing I think from our perspective is that the macro fundamentals that we see that have been driving our industrial growth are still very much in place. The low inputs from energy perspective, low gas prices, for example, or low power prices, the spreads of natural gas to oil or the spread geographically to Europe or Asia, those still remain very fundamentally sound along with, of course, some of our natural advantages here on the Gulf Coast, access to the Gulf Coast; access to the river; the ready, willing and able workforce; the strong and supportive communities, all those things continue to be very supportive. And so -- and then you take our industrial base, it is some of the most modern and competitive in the world and so we expect it to continue to run. In fact, that's what we have seen for our large industrials this year. We've seen our refiners, our chlor-alkali facilities, our petrochem facilities continue to perform very well. Where we've had challenges are people that are coming up online. So we have new construction that is in place or taking place and it's just not ramping up as fast as we anticipated. We've been talking about that for a couple of quarters. And the small industrial space, our small industrial space has been surprisingly strong despite all the economic headline, except for one area in Arkansas, we've had some agricultural customers, which are seasonally oriented and typically are pumping a lot of water. We had a lot of floods in the spring and that carried over into the summer into our 3 -- into this quarter. So our small industrial sales were down, but that was 2/3 of the driver right there. And so we continue to see opportunities in the industrial space with all the fundamentals still in place. And I'll turn it over to Rod to talk about what we have been seeing."

As we stated in prior conversations, that rider was not going to create an immediate material difference in our outlook. What we talked about was, particularly, given the schedule with Montgomery County that we would shape the rate case to the extent that we needed to ensure that the recovery of Montgomery County that's reflected in our existing plan, it was shaped with the timing of that rate case. That said, the rider that was passed gave us an opportunity as we look beyond Montgomery County to have more contemporaneous rate recovery. From a regulatory process perspective, we still have to have the -- remember the legislation only enabled the commission to provide that relief, we still have to go through the process of rulemaking through the PUCT to put that rider in effect. And from our vantage point, as we think about the capital plan in Texas, we have not yet determined how we wish to time the availability of the rate cases and mechanism and the contemporaneous rulemaking around that rider. We still have to go to the PUCT and candidly, that conversation is ongoing because they are the parties who would be part of that regulatory process. But think about it this way. We'll go to the commission to ask for rulemaking that would take advantage of the legislation to put the actual rider in effect for ongoing recovery. So from a timing standpoint, we don't want to set an expectation that there is immediate upside. So we'll be shaping the rate case and the regulatory process around that rider as we make the capital plan for Texas in the generation space a little more clear. There will be more on that, but it is not something immediate. I don't want to set that expectation."

Same goes with -- on renewable front. They will be part of the resource plan to meet the needs our customers have. We're not doing them outside of that customer base to meet any other needs.

We are pleased to report third quarter adjusted earnings per share of $2.52. Drew will go over the details, but the bottom line is that these are strong results that allow us to raise our 2019 guidance midpoint by $0.05 and narrow the range. We also remain firmly on track to achieve our longer-term outlooks. With 3 quarters behind us, we've completed many of our key deliverables for the year to keep us on track to achieve our goal to be the premier utility, including a few important milestones this quarter.
Furthering our orderly exit from EWC, in late August the NRC approved our license transfer application for Pilgrim Nuclear Power Station. And shortly after that, we completed the sale to a subsidiary of Holtec International. This is the second sale that we have successfully completed of a nonoperating nuclear plant and the third in the industry. This is also the second time the NRC has determined that Holtec has the financial and technical capabilities to decommission nuclear plants. As a reminder, we have agreements to sell our last 2 remaining merchant nuclear plants to Holtec.
We've also had significant accomplishments at the utility. Providing added clarity to our investment plan, the Mississippi Public Service Commission approved our proposal to purchase the Choctaw generation station. We expect to close the transaction soon. The commission's order also included a stipulation supporting timely and full cost recovery of the asset. We expect the plan to be included in rates with minimal lag, similar to how we have recovered cost of past acquisitions in Mississippi. Purchasing this clean and modern 810-megawatt combined cycle natural gas turbine is a good outcome for our stakeholders and is expected to result in approximately $100 million in net benefits for Entergy Mississippi's customers.
We also have a solid track record of completing major generation projects on time and on budget or better, supported by a solid capital projects management team. We are on track with Lake Charles Power Station and New Orleans Power Station, which are expected to come online next year. Montgomery County Power Station in Texas is also on schedule and expected to come online in mid-2021.
On the renewables front, construction has begun on one of the largest solar facilities currently planned for Louisiana. Capital Region Solar is a 50-megawatt solar project being built in West Baton Rouge Parish. Once completed, the facility will offset the equivalent of nearly 19,000 passenger vehicles' emissions each year. We will purchase the output under a 20-year agreement. We are working with our regulators to expand and customize our portfolio for renewable energy solutions to meet our customers' expectations and to achieve our sustainability goals.
Turning to regulatory proceedings. Entergy Louisiana's new rates became effective in September. The company's annual FRP evaluation provides a simpler process that aligns rates and costs better than traditional rate cases. In Arkansas, we've reached an unopposed settlement on the company's annual FRP, which we are filing today. The settlement is in line with our initial expectations. We anticipate a final decision from the Arkansas Commission by the end of the year.
In New Orleans, the city -- the Council Utility Committee issued a resolution that if adopted would set a revenue requirement that is below what we believe to be just and reasonable for Entergy New Orleans and our customers. We continue to work with council members to reach a fair outcome when the council takes up the matter in early November.  This continued progress on regulatory proceedings is an important component of our success as it improves clarity on the recoverability of our investments and solidifies our financial commitments.
Another growing part of our company that we are excited about is our innovation center. This group is developing product and service concepts to meet the evolving expectations of our utility customers and the communities we serve. The team employs a rigorous work process, focused on exploring customer frictions and feedback, product design, market opportunities and more. For example, last quarter, I highlighted Entergy New Orleans' new program that puts solar panels on low-income customers' homes. Under this program, Entergy will install the rooftop solar system at no cost from the customers and give them a credit on their monthly bills. That idea came out of our innovation team.
Another concept developed that is now being implemented is a customer-sided backup generation solution for commercial and small industrial customers. The generators will be owned by Entergy and would allow those businesses to operate as usual during widespread outages. For example, retail businesses would be able to provide services to the general public during significant weather events. In other times, when needed, the resource can be deployed by the utility, which benefits all customers.
Entergy-owned, customer-sided generation is an innovative win-win solution. It provides an economical alternative to businesses to remain open when our communities need them most and it provides us the utility and added resource when the system needs it. Entergy Texas recently announced a pilot of this concept in its service area and Entergy Mississippi has a filing pending before the Public Service Commission. Our plan is to eventually implement this idea at all operating companies.
Innovation and new technologies will be an important part of our business as we continue to explore solutions to improve our customers' everyday lives.
As many of you know, there have been 3 significant storms in the last few months. Hurricane Dorian made landfall on the East Coast in early September. Entergy sent nearly 500 workers to the Carolina coast to help with the restoration efforts. Then a few weeks later Tropical Storm Imelda made landfall in Texas bringing 20 to 40 inches of rain over the impacted service area. We deployed more than 1,000 workers both from Entergy and from other utilities. At the peak, we had approximately 38,000 customers without power. Service was restored in 95% of our customers within 4 days. Just this past weekend, Tropical Storm Olga moved through Louisiana. The storm brought heavy rain and winds in excess of 50 miles per hour. At its peak, Olga disrupted electric service to more than 92,000 customers. The storm team of more than 1,000 workers restored the vast majority of outages within 2 days. Entergy employees have a long history of working together after natural disasters. They work to restore power for our customers and to assist our communities after an event. They also help coworkers who are impacted. In addition to volunteer support, the company has established employee assistance funds to provide financial assistance for affected employees.
Providing support in times of need, whether man power or financial contributions, is important. Ongoing efforts that support our communities are also vital to our success. In September, for the 12th consecutive year, Site Selection magazine named Entergy as one of the nation's top utilities in economic development. Entergy plays a vital role in economic development efforts across our service area, which brings business, jobs, and community support to our states. Sustainability is a key focus here at Entergy. Once again, we were named to the Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index. We are very proud of this achievement. DJSI is one of the most respected independent sustainability measures in the world. We are the only electric utility to receive this honor 18 years in a row. And for the past 5 years, we have made a perfect score in the climate strategy category. To be named to this respected list year-after-year is a clear acknowledgment of Entergy's commitment to implementing sustainability practices that serve our customers, employees, communities and our owners.
Last Friday, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.93 per share. This is the fifth straight year of steady predictable growth in our dividend and with this declaration, we'll pay a total of $3.66 per share in common dividends this year, just under 70% payout at our guidance midpoint. As we mentioned last quarter, we expect to grow our dividend each year and plan to increase the growth to be more in line with our earnings, starting in 2021.
This has been another successful quarter for our company and our stakeholders, as we continue to execute on our path to be the premier utility in every aspect of our business. We have among the lowest retail rates in the country. The states we serve benefit from strong industrial growth. We are an industry leader in sustainability. We invest in our communities and we invest in our employees and our culture. The fundamentals that underlie our steady predictable growth are strong. First, we have a robust capital plan which benefits our customers and supports the growth of the business and economic development in our communities. We have no shortage of investment opportunities beyond our current forecast period. As a utility with some of the lowest rates in the country, we always remain diligent in managing the cost impact to our customers and will continue to do so. Second, we have constructed regulatory mechanisms, which give us the opportunity for fair and timely recovery of our capital plan. As we've noted in the past, we have a unique line of sight with approximately 90% of our capital plan ready for execution from a regulatory perspective and approximately 90% expected to be recovered through annual FRPs and riders. And third, we have a proven track record and ability to execute on major capital projects with cost and schedule certainty. This clear line of sight [ and ] our ability to execute our capital plan on time and on budget combined with the progressive regulatory mechanisms that ensure timely recovery of our investments supports our outlooks today.
And as we continue to identify sources of customer savings, including O&M and production cost efficiency, energy efficiency and industrial growth, we aspire to do even better.
I will now turn the call over to Drew."

As Leo mentioned, we had another successful quarter and with our strong results, we are raising the midpoint of our 2019 guidance by $0.05 and narrowing the range. Also we remain firmly on track to meet our longer-term outlooks.
As you can see on Slide 4, on a per share basis, Entergy adjusted earnings were $2.52, $0.17 higher than the third quarter of 2018, including the effect of dilution. Turning to Slide 5, rate actions in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas contributed positively to the quarter's results as did higher sales volume in the unbilled period.
Overall, revenue was a little higher than we anticipated due to weather. Bill sales volume declined versus last year, which was in part due to fewer days billed. Volume in the unbilled period was positive as they capture the offset, the fewer days billed, as well as warmer weather at the end of September. Other drivers for the quarter's results included regulatory charges last year -- included regulatory charges last year to return the benefits [ in ] the lower federal tax rate to customers, higher other O&M due largely to higher spending on information technology and customer initiatives, including distribution operations, partially offset by lower nuclear cost. Drivers related to our growth such as higher depreciation expense, including the St. Charles Power Station, which came online at the end of May, lower decommissioning trust fund returns and lastly, a higher share count affected this quarter's results on a per share basis.
Looking at EWC on Slide 6. [ As ] reported earnings were $1.27 per share lower than the prior year. Drivers for the quarter included the absence of tax items recorded in the third quarter 2018, lower revenue due to the shutdown of Pilgrim as well as lower capacity pricing, lower decommissioning trust fund returns and higher asset write-offs and impairment charges related to the sale of Pilgrim. Partially offsetting the decrease was lower other O&M due to lower spending on nuclear operations and looking ahead, we still expect EWC to provide slightly positive net cash [ to parent ] from 2019 through 2022.
Turning to Slide 7. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $1.065 billion, a $286 million increase from a year ago. The change was driven by lower amount of unprotected [ excess ] ADIT returned to customers, lower pension contributions and lower ARO spending at EWC. Partially offsetting were higher severances and retention payments at EWC.
Turning to our guidance and outlook on Slide 8. For 2019, we have raised the midpoint to $5.35 as a result of weather returning back to normal for the year and mitigating strategies we put in place earlier in the year. We expect our results to come in around the midpoint of our updated range. Our targeted adjusted EPS growth remains at 5% to 7% off of our original 2019 guidance midpoint. Our outlooks include a new year, 2022, which is in line with this growth rate. More information will be available in our EEI materials.
Moving to our credit metrics on Slide 9, our parent debt-to-total debt is 20.5% and our FFO to debt is 14.2%. This includes the effects of returning $469 million of unprotected excess ADIT to customers over the last 12 months. Excluding this giveback and certain items related to our exit of EWC, FFO to debt would be 17.6%. But we still have to return some unprotected excess ADIT to customers. I'm happy to report that the bulk of the credit impact is now behind us. We remain committed to our targets of at or above 15% for FFO -- for FFO to debt by 2020 and below 25% for parent debt-to-total debt as well as maintaining our investment-grade profile.
This is another successful quarter with strong results. We were able to raise our 2019 guidance midpoint and we're firmly on track to achieve longer-term outlooks. We continue to execute on our plans to deliver steady, predictable growth in earnings and dividends through customer-centric investments. And as Leo mentioned, we aspire to do even better as we continue to develop our culture of continuous improvement.
And now, the Entergy team is available to answer questions."

Other than that, it's just a continuation of the plan. We should start to see a leveling off of the cost of construction there. As we mentioned before, given the fact that we've done the ramp out into staffing and put the processes and procedures in place that we need to keep things on track. So that's kind of it, that will be the next thing that you'll see publicly.

So we think we're going to continue to be able to manage that with the current capital plan that we have going forward. On the -- I'm not sure, I'm going to remember all of these, but I think, on the renewables from a CapEx standpoint, we mentioned on the last call that we still see the need to replace the significant amount of our aging generation and that a portion of that will be gas, a portion of that could be renewables. We outlined a 7,000 to 8,000-megawatt need and a roughly 50-50 gas to renewables standpoint there. We're not really doing anything outside of meeting our own customers' needs with the generation that we've got, so that's -- that '22 to '30 time frame. So that's still, obviously, we're adding some scale on the renewable front, but -- and [ there are ] scale economies obviously of us doing it.

The first thing I think from our perspective is that the macro fundamentals that we see that have been driving our industrial growth are still very much in place. The low inputs from energy perspective, low gas prices, for example, or low power prices, the spreads of natural gas to oil or the spread geographically to Europe or Asia, those still remain very fundamentally sound along with, of course, some of our natural advantages here on the Gulf Coast, access to the Gulf Coast; access to the river; the ready, willing and able workforce; the strong and supportive communities, all those things continue to be very supportive. And so -- and then you take our industrial base, it is some of the most modern and competitive in the world and so we expect it to continue to run. In fact, that's what we have seen for our large industrials this year. We've seen our refiners, our chlor-alkali facilities, our petrochem facilities continue to perform very well. Where we've had challenges are people that are coming up online. So we have new construction that is in place or taking place and it's just not ramping up as fast as we anticipated. We've been talking about that for a couple of quarters. And the small industrial space, our small industrial space has been surprisingly strong despite all the economic headline, except for one area in Arkansas, we've had some agricultural customers, which are seasonally oriented and typically are pumping a lot of water. We had a lot of floods in the spring and that carried over into the summer into our 3 -- into this quarter. So our small industrial sales were down, but that was 2/3 of the driver right there. And so we continue to see opportunities in the industrial space with all the fundamentals still in place. And I'll turn it over to Rod to talk about what we have been seeing."

So today, we have approximately 1,000 megawatts of project that we probability weighted such that we're comfortable putting those in the plan. What we don't and we have not yet disclosed because of where those potential pipeline projects are in their industrial development cycle. We have about 4x that 1,000 megawatts that's in the potential pipeline. But we're tracking that in real time with those prospective companies, who have expressed an interest in locating our service territory. The significant ones being Louisiana and Texas taking advantage of those macroeconomic advantages that Drew just made reference to.

What we talked about was, particularly, given the schedule with Montgomery County that we would shape the rate case to the extent that we needed to ensure that the recovery of Montgomery County that's reflected in our existing plan, it was shaped with the timing of that rate case. That said, the rider that was passed gave us an opportunity as we look beyond Montgomery County to have more contemporaneous rate recovery. From a regulatory process perspective, we still have to have the -- remember the legislation only enabled the commission to [ provide  ] that relief, we still have to go through the process of rulemaking through the PUCT to put that rider in effect. And from our vantage point, as we think about the capital plan in Texas, we have not yet determined how we wish to time the availability of the rate cases and mechanism and the contemporaneous rulemaking around that rider. We still have to [ through ] the PUCT and candidly, that conversation is ongoing because they are the parties who would be part of that regulatory process. But think about it this way. We'll go to the commission to ask for rulemaking that would take advantage of the legislation to put the actual rider in effect for ongoing recovery. So from a timing standpoint, we don't want to set an expectation that there is this immediate upside. So we'll be shaping the rate case and the regulatory process around that rider as we make the capital plan for Texas in the generation space a little more clear. There will be more on that, but it is not something immediate. I don't want to set that expectation."

Obviously, what the regulatory mechanisms do is provide an opportunity for there being more certainty for our customers and for our investors in terms of us having the financial flexibility to make sure we continue to make those investments. Same goes with -- on renewable front. They will be part of the resource plan to meet the needs our customers have. We're not doing them outside of that customer base to meet any other needs.

We are pleased to report third quarter adjusted earnings per share of $2.52. Drew will go over the details, but the bottom line is that these are strong results that allow us to raise our 2019 guidance midpoint by $0.05 and narrow the range. We also remain firmly on track to achieve our longer-term outlooks. With 3 quarters behind us, we have completed many of our key deliverables for the year to keep us on track to achieve our goal to be the premier utility, including a few important milestones this quarter.
Furthering our orderly exit from EWC, in late August the NRC approved our license transfer application for Pilgrim Nuclear Power Station. And shortly after that, we completed the sale to a subsidiary of Holtec International. This is the second sale that we have successfully completed of a nonoperating nuclear plant and the third in the industry. This is also the second time the NRC has determined that Holtec has the financial and technical capabilities to decommission nuclear plants. As a reminder, we have agreements to sell our last 2 remaining merchant nuclear plants to Holtec.
We've also had significant accomplishments at the utility. Providing added clarity to our investment plan, the Mississippi Public Service Commission approved our proposal to purchase the Choctaw generation station. We expect to close the transaction soon. The commission's order also included a stipulation supporting timely and full cost recovery of the asset. We expect the plan to be included in rates with minimal lag, similar to how we have recovered cost of past acquisitions in Mississippi. Purchasing this clean and modern 810-megawatt combined-cycle natural gas turbine is a good outcome for our stakeholders and is expected to result in approximately $100 million in net benefits for Entergy Mississippi's customers.
We also have a solid track record of completing major generation projects on time and on budget or better, supported by a solid capital projects management team. We are on track with Lake Charles Power Station and New Orleans Power Station, which are expected to come online next year. Montgomery County Power Station in Texas is also on schedule and expected to come online in mid-2021.
On the renewables front, construction has begun on one of the largest solar facilities currently planned for Louisiana. Capital Region Solar is a 50-megawatt solar project being built in West Baton Rouge Parish. Once completed, the facility will offset the equivalent of nearly 19,000 passenger vehicles' emissions each year. We will purchase the output under a 20-year agreement. We are working with our regulators to expand and customize our portfolio for renewable energy solutions to meet our customers' expectations and to achieve our sustainability goals.
Turning to regulatory proceedings. Entergy Louisiana's new rates became effective in September. The company's annual FRP evaluation provides a simpler process that aligns rates and costs better than traditional rate cases. In Arkansas, we've reached an unopposed settlement on the company's annual FRP, which we are filing today. The settlement is in line with our initial expectations. We anticipate a final decision from the Arkansas Commission by the end of the year.
In New Orleans, the city -- the Council Utility Committee issued a resolution that if adopted would set a revenue requirement that is below what we believe to be just and reasonable for Entergy New Orleans and our customers. We continue to work with council members to reach a fair outcome when the council takes up the matter in early November.  This continued progress on regulatory proceedings is an important component of our success as it improves clarity on the recoverability of our investments and solidifies our financial commitments.
Another growing part of our company that we are excited about is our innovation center. This group is developing product and service concepts to meet the evolving expectations of our utility customers and the communities we serve. The team employs a rigorous work process, focused on exploring customer frictions and feedback, product design, market opportunities and more. For example, last quarter, I highlighted Entergy New Orleans' new program that puts solar panels on low-income customers' homes. Under this program, Entergy will install the rooftop solar system at no cost from the customers and give them a credit on their monthly bills. That idea came out of our innovation team.
Another concept developed that is now being implemented is a customer-sided backup generation solution for commercial and small industrial customers. The generators will be owned by Entergy and would allow those businesses to operate as usual during widespread outages. For example, retail businesses would be able to provide services to the general public during significant weather events. In other times, when needed, the resource can be deployed by the utility, which benefits all customers.
Entergy-owned, customer-sided generation is an innovative win-win solution. It provides an economical alternative to businesses to remain open when our communities need them most and it provides us the utility and added resource when the system needs it. Entergy Texas recently announced a pilot of this concept in its service area and Entergy Mississippi has a filing pending before the Public Service Commission. Our plan is to eventually implement this idea at all operating companies.
Innovation and new technologies will be an important part of our business as we continue to explore solutions to improve our customers' everyday lives.
As many of you know, there have been 3 significant storms in the last few months. Hurricane Dorian made landfall on the East Coast in early September. Entergy sent nearly 500 workers to the Carolina coast to help with the restoration efforts. Then a few weeks later Tropical Storm Imelda made landfall in Texas bringing 20 to 40 inches of rain over the impacted service area. We deployed more than 1,000 workers both from Entergy and from other utilities. At the peak, we had approximately 38,000 customers without power. Service was restored in 95% of our customers within 4 days. Just this past weekend, Tropical Storm Olga moved through Louisiana. The storm brought heavy rain and winds in excess of 50 miles per hour. At its peak, Olga disrupted electric service to more than 92,000 customers. The storm team of more than 1,000 workers restored the vast majority of outages within 2 days. Entergy employees have a long history of working together after natural disasters. They work to restore power for our customers and to assist our communities after an event. They also help coworkers who are impacted. In addition to volunteer support, the company has established employee assistance funds to provide financial assistance for affected employees.
Providing support in times of need, whether manpower or financial contributions, is important. Ongoing efforts that support our communities are also vital to our success. In September, for the 12th consecutive year, Site Selection magazine named Entergy as one of the nation's top utilities in economic development. Entergy plays a vital role in economic development efforts across our service area, which brings business, jobs, and community support to our states. Sustainability is a key focus here at Entergy. Once again, we were named to the Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index. We are very proud of this achievement. DJSI is one of the most respected independent sustainability measures in the world. We are the only electric utility to receive this honor 18 years in a row. And for the past 5 years, we have made a perfect score in the climate strategy category. To be named to this respected list year-after-year is a clear acknowledgment of Entergy's commitment to implementing sustainability practices that serve our customers, employees, communities and our owners.
Last Friday, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.93 per share. This is the fifth straight year of steady predictable growth in our dividend and with this declaration, we'll pay a total of $3.66 per share in common dividends this year, just under 70% payout at our guidance midpoint. As we mentioned last quarter, we expect to grow our dividend each year and plan to increase the growth to be more in line with our earnings, starting in 2021.
This has been another successful quarter for our company and our stakeholders, as we continue to execute on our path to be the premier utility in every aspect of our business. We have among the lowest retail rates in the country. The states we serve benefit from strong industrial growth. We are an industry leader in sustainability. We invest in our communities and we invest in our employees and our culture. The fundamentals that underlie our steady predictable growth are strong. First, we have a robust capital plan which benefits our customers and supports the growth of the business and economic development in our communities. We have no shortage of investment opportunities beyond our current forecast period. As a utility with some of the lowest rates in the country, we always remain diligent in managing the cost impact to our customers and will continue to do so. Second, we have constructed regulatory mechanisms, which give us the opportunity for fair and timely recovery of our capital plan. As we've noted in the past, we have a unique line of sight with approximately 90% of our capital plan ready for execution from a regulatory perspective and approximately 90% expected to be recovered through annual FRPs and riders. And third, we have a proven track record and ability to execute on major capital projects with cost and schedule certainty. This clear line of sight and our ability to execute our capital plan on time and on budget combined with the progressive regulatory mechanisms that ensure timely recovery of our investments supports our outlooks today.
And as we continue to identify sources of customer savings, including O&M and production cost efficiency, energy efficiency and industrial growth, we aspire to do even better.
I will now turn the call over to Drew."

As Leo mentioned, we had another successful quarter and with our strong results, we are raising the midpoint of our 2019 guidance by $0.05 and narrowing the range. Also we remain firmly on track to meet our longer-term outlooks.
As you can see on Slide 4, on a per-share basis, Entergy adjusted earnings were $2.52, $0.17 higher than the third quarter of 2018, including the effect of dilution. Turning to Slide 5, rate actions in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas contributed positively to the quarter's results as did higher sales volume in the unbilled period.
Overall, revenue was a little higher than we anticipated due to weather. Bill sales volume declined versus last year, which was in part due to fewer days billed. Volume in the unbilled period was positive as they capture the offset, the fewer days billed as well as warmer weather at the end of September. Other drivers for the quarter's results included regulatory charges last year -- included regulatory charges last year to return the benefits in the lower federal tax rate to customers, higher other O&M due largely to higher spending on information technology and customer initiatives, including distribution operations, partially offset by lower nuclear cost. Drivers related to our growth such as higher depreciation expense, including the St. Charles Power Station, which came online at the end of May, lower decommissioning trust fund returns and lastly, a higher share count affected this quarter's results on a per-share basis.
Looking at EWC on Slide 6. As reported earnings were $1.27 per share lower than the prior year. Drivers for the quarter included the absence of tax items recorded in the third quarter 2018, lower revenue due to the shutdown of Pilgrim as well as lower capacity pricing, lower decommissioning trust fund returns and higher asset write-offs and impairment charges related to the sale of Pilgrim. Partially offsetting the decrease was lower other O&M due to lower spending on nuclear operations and looking ahead, we still expect EWC to provide slightly positive net cash to parent from 2019 through 2022.
Turning to Slide 7. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $1.065 billion, a $286 million increase from a year ago. The change was driven by lower amount of unprotected excess ADIT returned to customers, lower pension contributions and lower ARO spending at EWC. Partially offsetting were higher severances and retention payments at EWC.
Turning to our guidance and outlook on Slide 8. For 2019, we have raised the midpoint to $5.35 as a result of weather returning back to normal for the year and mitigating strategies we put in place earlier in the year. We expect our results to come in around the midpoint of our updated range. Our targeted adjusted EPS growth remains at 5% to 7% off of our original 2019 guidance midpoint. Our outlooks include a new year, 2022, which is in line with this growth rate. More information will be available in our EEI materials.
Moving to our credit metrics on Slide 9, our parent debt-to-total debt is 20.5% and our FFO to debt is 14.2%. This includes the effects of returning $469 million of unprotected excess ADIT to customers over the last 12 months. Excluding this giveback and certain items related to our exit of EWC, FFO to debt would be 17.6%. But we still have to return some unprotected excess ADIT to customers. I'm happy to report that the bulk of the credit impact is now behind us. We remain committed to our targets of at or above 15% for FFO -- for FFO to debt by 2020 and below 25% for parent debt-to-total debt as well as maintaining our investment-grade profile.
This is another successful quarter with strong results. We were able to raise our 2019 guidance midpoint and we're firmly on track to achieve longer-term outlooks. We continue to execute on our plans to deliver steady, predictable growth in earnings and dividends through customer-centric investment. And as Leo mentioned, we aspire to do even better as we continue to develop our culture of continuous improvement.
And now, the Entergy team is available to answer questions."

Other than that, it's just a continuation of the plan. We should start to see a leveling off of the cost of construction there.

Can you talk a bit more about CapEx reflected in your outlook around both renewables in light of what AEP in Wind Catcher is doing in Arkansas and prospects to mirror that to any extent?

Our objective, and we believe we'll continue to meet it, has been to keep our bill inflation level consistent with inflation. And as you recall, even in last quarter, when we were able to come up with some continuous improvement ideas and change our capital plan, the bill pass actually went down from where it would have otherwise been. So we think we're going to continue to be able to manage that with the current capital plan that we have going forward. On the -- I'm not sure, I'm going to remember all of these, but I think, on the renewables from a CapEx standpoint, we mentioned on the last call that we still see the need to replace the significant amount of our aging generation and that a portion of that will be gas, a portion of that could be renewables. We outlined a 7,000 to 8,000-megawatt need and a roughly 50-50 gas to renewables standpoint there. We're not really doing anything outside of meeting our own customers' needs with the generation that we've got, so that's -- that '22 to '30 time frame. So that's still, obviously, we're adding some scale on the renewable front, but -- and there are scale economies obviously if us doing it. So we continue to see that as a part of our resource plan, but it's really just part of the resource plan like everything else given the fully integrated nature that we have. As far as transmission expenditures, nothing has really changed in that from the last quarter. And I'll open it up to my team to correct me or -- and I think I answered all of the questions."

The first thing I think from our perspective is that the macro fundamentals that we see that have been driving our industrial growth are still very much in place. The low inputs from energy perspective, low gas prices, for example, or low power prices, the spreads of natural gas to oil or the spread geographically to Europe or Asia, those still remain very fundamentally sound along with, of course, some of our natural advantages here on the Gulf Coast, access to the Gulf Coast; access to the river; the ready, willing and able workforce; the strong and supportive communities, all those things continue to be very supportive. And so -- and then you take our industrial base, it is some of the most modern and competitive in the world and so we expect it to continue to run. In fact, that's what we have seen for our large industrials this year. We've seen our refiners, our chlor-alkali facilities, our petrochem facilities continue to perform very well. Where we've had challenges are people that are coming up online. So we have new construction that is in place or taking place and it's just not ramping up as fast as we anticipated. We've been talking about that for a couple of quarters. And the small industrial space, our small industrial space has been surprisingly strong despite all the economic headline, except for one area in Arkansas, we've had some agricultural customers, which are seasonally oriented and typically are pumping a lot of water. We had a lot of floods in the spring and that carried over into the summer into our 3 -- into this quarter. So our small industrial sales were down, but that was 2/3 of the driver right there. And so we continue to see opportunities in the industrial space with all the fundamentals still in place. And I'll turn it over to Rod to talk about what we have been seeing."

That said, the rider that was passed gave us an opportunity as we look beyond Montgomery County to have more contemporaneous rate recovery. From a regulatory process perspective, we still have to have the -- remember the legislation only enabled the commission to provide that relief, we still have to go through the process of rulemaking through the PUCT to put that rider in effect. And from our vantage point, as we think about the capital plan in Texas, we have not yet determined how we wish to time the availability of the rate cases and mechanism and the contemporaneous rulemaking around that rider. We still have to go to the PUCT and candidly, that conversation is ongoing because they are the parties who would be part of that regulatory process. But think about it this way. We'll go to the commission to ask for rulemaking that would take advantage of the legislation to put the actual rider in effect for ongoing recovery. So from a timing standpoint, we don't want to set an expectation that there is immediate upside.

We are pleased to report third quarter adjusted earnings per share of $2.52. Drew will go over the details, but the bottom line is that these are strong results that allow us to raise our 2019 guidance midpoint by $0.05 and narrow the range. We also remain firmly on track to achieve our longer-term outlooks. With 3 quarters behind us, we've completed many of our key deliverables for the year to keep us on track to achieve our goal to be the premier utility, including a few important milestones this quarter.
Furthering our orderly exit from EWC, in late August the NRC approved our license transfer application for Pilgrim Nuclear Power Station. And shortly after that, we completed the sale to a subsidiary of Holtec International. This is the second sale that we have successfully completed of a nonoperating nuclear plant and the third in the industry. This is also the second time the NRC has determined that Holtec has the financial and technical capabilities to decommission nuclear plants. As a reminder, we have agreements to sell our last 2 remaining merchant nuclear plants to Holtec.
We've also had significant accomplishments at the utility. Providing added clarity to our investment plan, the Mississippi Public Service Commission approved our proposal to purchase the Choctaw generation station. We expect to close the transaction soon. The commission's order also included a stipulation supporting timely and full cost recovery of the asset. We expect the plan to be included in rates with minimal lag, similar to how we have recovered cost of past acquisitions in Mississippi. Purchasing this clean and modern 810-megawatt combined-cycle natural gas turbine is a good outcome for our stakeholders and is expected to result in approximately $100 million in net benefits for Entergy Mississippi's customers.
We also have a solid track record of completing major generation projects on time and on budget or better, supported by a solid capital projects management team. We are on track with Lake Charles Power Station and New Orleans Power Station, which are expected to come online next year. Montgomery County Power Station in Texas is also on schedule and expected to come online in mid-2021.
On the renewables front, construction has begun on one of the largest solar facilities currently planned for Louisiana. Capital Region Solar is a 50-megawatt solar project being built in West Baton Rouge Parish. Once completed, the facility will offset the equivalent of nearly 19,000 passenger vehicles' emissions each year. We will purchase the output under a 20-year agreement. We are working with our regulators to expand and customize our portfolio for renewable energy solutions to meet our customers' expectations and to achieve our sustainability goals.
Turning to regulatory proceedings. Entergy Louisiana's new rates became effective in September. The company's annual FRP evaluation provides a simpler process that aligns rates and costs better than traditional rate cases. In Arkansas, we've reached an unopposed settlement on the company's annual FRP, which we are filing today. The settlement is in line with our initial expectations. We anticipate a final decision from the Arkansas Commission by the end of the year.
In New Orleans, the city -- the Council Utility Committee issued a resolution that if adopted would set a revenue requirement that is below what we believe to be just and reasonable for Entergy New Orleans and our customers. We continue to work with council members to reach a fair outcome when the council takes up the matter in early November.  This continued progress on regulatory proceedings is an important component of our success as it improves clarity on the recoverability of our investments and solidifies our financial commitments.
Another growing part of our company that we are excited about is our innovation center. This group is developing product and service concepts to meet the evolving expectations of our utility customers and the communities we serve. The team employs a rigorous work process, focused on exploring customer frictions and feedback, product design, market opportunities and more. For example, last quarter, I highlighted Entergy New Orleans' new program that puts solar panels on low-income customers' homes. Under this program, Entergy will install the rooftop solar system at no cost from the customers and give them a credit on their monthly bills. That idea came out of our innovation team.
Another concept developed that is now being implemented is a customer-sided backup generation solution for commercial and small industrial customers. The generators will be owned by Entergy and would allow those businesses to operate as usual during widespread outages. For example, retail businesses would be able to provide services to the general public during significant weather events. In other times, when needed, the resource can be deployed by the utility, which benefits all customers.
Entergy-owned, customer-sided generation is an innovative win-win solution. It provides an economical alternative to businesses to remain open when our communities need them most and it provides us the utility and added resource when the system needs it. Entergy Texas recently announced a pilot of this concept in its service area and Entergy Mississippi has a filing pending before the Public Service Commission. Our plan is to eventually implement this idea at all operating companies.
Innovation and new technologies will be an important part of our business as we continue to explore solutions to improve our customers' everyday lives.
As many of you know, there have been 3 significant storms in the last few months. Hurricane Dorian made landfall on the East Coast in early September. Entergy sent nearly 500 workers to the Carolina coast to help with the restoration efforts. Then a few weeks later Tropical Storm Imelda made landfall in Texas bringing 20 to 40 inches of rain over the impacted service area. We deployed more than 1,000 workers both from Entergy and from other utilities. At the peak, we had approximately 38,000 customers without power. Service was restored in 95% of our customers within 4 days. Just this past weekend, Tropical Storm Olga moved through Louisiana. The storm brought heavy rain and winds in excess of 50 miles per hour. At its peak, Olga disrupted electric service to more than 92,000 customers. The storm team of more than 1,000 workers restored the vast majority of outages within 2 days. Entergy employees have a long history of working together after natural disasters. They work to restore power for our customers and to assist our communities after an event. They also help coworkers who are impacted. In addition to volunteer support, the company has established employee assistance funds to provide financial assistance for affected employees.
Providing support in times of need, whether manpower or financial contributions, is important. Ongoing efforts that support our communities are also vital to our success. In September, for the 12th consecutive year, Site Selection magazine named Entergy as one of the nation's top utilities in economic development. Entergy plays a vital role in economic development efforts across our service area, which brings business, jobs, and community support to our states. Sustainability is a key focus here at Entergy. Once again, we were named to the Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index. We are very proud of this achievement. DJSI is one of the most respected independent sustainability measures in the world. We are the only electric utility to receive this honor 18 years in a row. And for the past 5 years, we have made a perfect score in the climate strategy category. To be named to this respected list year-after-year is a clear acknowledgment of Entergy's commitment to implementing sustainability practices that serve our customers, employees, communities and our owners.
Last Friday, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.93 per share. This is the fifth straight year of steady predictable growth in our dividend and with this declaration, we'll pay a total of $3.66 per share in common dividends this year, just under 70% payout at our guidance midpoint. As we mentioned last quarter, we expect to grow our dividend each year and plan to increase the growth to be more in line with our earnings, starting in 2021.
This has been another successful quarter for our company and our stakeholders, as we continue to execute on our path to be the premier utility in every aspect of our business. We have among the lowest retail rates in the country. The states we serve benefit from strong industrial growth. We are an industry leader in sustainability. We invest in our communities and we invest in our employees and our culture. The fundamentals that underlie our steady predictable growth are strong. First, we have a robust capital plan which benefits our customers and supports the growth of the business and economic development in our communities. We have no shortage of investment opportunities beyond our current forecast period. As a utility with some of the lowest rates in the country, we always remain diligent in managing the cost impact to our customers and will continue to do so. Second, we have constructed regulatory mechanisms, which give us the opportunity for fair and timely recovery of our capital plan. As we've noted in the past, we have a unique line of sight with approximately 90% of our capital plan ready for execution from a regulatory perspective and approximately 90% expected to be recovered through annual FRPs and riders. And third, we have a proven track record and ability to execute on major capital projects with cost and schedule certainty. This clear line of sight [ and ] our ability to execute our capital plan on time and on budget combined with the progressive regulatory mechanisms that ensure timely recovery of our investments supports our outlooks today.
And as we continue to identify sources of customer savings, including O&M and production cost efficiency, energy efficiency and industrial growth, we aspire to do even better.
I will now turn the call over to Drew."

As Leo mentioned, we had another successful quarter and with our strong results, we are raising the midpoint of our 2019 guidance by $0.05 and narrowing the range. Also we remain firmly on track to meet our longer-term outlooks.
As you can see on Slide 4, on a per-share basis, Entergy adjusted earnings were $2.52, $0.17 higher than the third quarter of 2018, including the effect of dilution. Turning to Slide 5, rate actions in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas contributed positively to the quarter's results as did higher sales volume in the unbilled period.
Overall, revenue was a little higher than we anticipated due to weather. Bill sales volume declined versus last year, which was in part due to fewer days billed. Volume in the unbilled period was positive as they capture the offset, the fewer days billed, as well as warmer weather at the end of September. Other drivers for the quarter's results included regulatory charges last year -- included regulatory charges last year to return the benefits [ in ] the lower federal tax rate to customers, higher other O&M due largely to higher spending on information technology and customer initiatives, including distribution operations, partially offset by lower nuclear cost. Drivers related to our growth such as higher depreciation expense, including the St. Charles Power Station, which came online at the end of May, lower decommissioning trust fund returns and lastly, a higher share count affected this quarter's results on a per-share basis.
Looking at EWC on Slide 6. [ As ] reported earnings were $1.27 per share lower than the prior year. Drivers for the quarter included the absence of tax items recorded in the third quarter 2018, lower revenue due to the shutdown of Pilgrim as well as lower capacity pricing, lower decommissioning trust fund returns and higher asset write-offs and impairment charges related to the sale of Pilgrim. Partially offsetting the decrease was lower other O&M due to lower spending on nuclear operations and looking ahead, we still expect EWC to provide slightly positive net cash [ to parent ] from 2019 through 2022.
Turning to Slide 7. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $1.065 billion, a $286 million increase from a year ago. The change was driven by lower amount of unprotected [ excess ] ADIT returned to customers, lower pension contributions and lower ARO spending at EWC. Partially offsetting were higher severances and retention payments at EWC.
Turning to our guidance and outlook on Slide 8. For 2019, we have raised the midpoint to $5.35 as a result of weather returning back to normal for the year and mitigating strategies we put in place earlier in the year. We expect our results to come in around the midpoint of our updated range. Our targeted adjusted EPS growth remains at 5% to 7% off of our original 2019 guidance midpoint. Our outlooks include a new year, 2022, which is in line with this growth rate. More information will be available in our EEI materials.
Moving to our credit metrics on Slide 9, our parent debt-to-total debt is 20.5% and our FFO to debt is 14.2%. This includes the effects of returning $469 million of unprotected excess ADIT to customers over the last 12 months. Excluding this giveback and certain items related to our exit of EWC, FFO to debt would be 17.6%. But we still have to return some unprotected excess ADIT to customers. I'm happy to report that the bulk of the credit impact is now behind us. We remain committed to our targets of at or above 15% for FFO -- for FFO to debt by 2020 and below 25% for parent debt-to-total debt as well as maintaining our investment-grade profile.
This is another successful quarter with strong results. We were able to raise our 2019 guidance midpoint and we're firmly on track to achieve longer-term outlooks. We continue to execute on our plans to deliver steady, predictable growth in earnings and dividends through customer-centric investments. And as Leo mentioned, we aspire to do even better as we continue to develop our culture of continuous improvement.
And now, the Entergy team is available to answer questions."

Other than that, it's just a continuation of the plan. We should start to see a leveling off of the cost of construction there. As we mentioned before, given the fact that we've done the ramp out into staffing and put the processes and procedures in place that we need to keep things on track. So that's kind of it, that will be the next thing that you'll see publicly.

So we think we're going to continue to be able to manage that with the current capital plan that we have going forward. On the -- I'm not sure, I'm going to remember all of these, but I think, on the renewables from a CapEx standpoint, we mentioned on the last call that we still see the need to replace the significant amount of our aging generation and that a portion of that will be gas, a portion of that could be renewables. We outlined a 7,000 to 8,000-megawatt need and a roughly 50-50 gas to renewables standpoint there. We're not really doing anything outside of meeting our own customers' needs with the generation that we've got, so that's -- that '22 to '30 time frame. So that's still, obviously, we're adding some scale on the renewable front, but -- and [ there are ] scale economies obviously of us doing it. So we continue to see that as a part of our resource plan, but it's really just part of the resource plan like everything else given the fully integrated nature that we have.

The first thing I think from our perspective is that the macro fundamentals that we see that have been driving our industrial growth are still very much in place.

And so -- and then you take our industrial base, it is some of the most modern and competitive in the world and so we expect it to continue to run. In fact, that's what we have seen for our large industrials this year. We've seen our refiners, our chlor-alkali facilities, our petrochem facilities continue to perform very well. Where we've had challenges are people that are coming up online. So we have new construction that is in place or taking place and it's just not ramping up as fast as we anticipated. We've been talking about that for a couple of quarters. And the small industrial space, our small industrial space has been surprisingly strong despite all the economic headline, except for one area in Arkansas, we've had some agricultural customers, which are seasonally oriented and typically are pumping a lot of water. We had a lot of floods in the spring and that carried over into the summer into our 3 -- into this quarter. So our small industrial sales were down, but that was 2/3 of the driver right there. And so we continue to see opportunities in the industrial space with all the fundamentals still in place. And I'll turn it over to Rod to talk about what we have been seeing."

But I guess the short answer to your question is, yes, we would anticipate the ability to earn our allowed return in both Arkansas and Mississippi."

And more or less post Montgomery County, how we should think about the rider mechanism because it was obviously approved after you guys came out with the original plan? So as you guys thinking about adding additional generation in the rider, is that sort of incremental to your growth prospects?"

As we stated in prior conversations, that rider was not going to create an immediate material difference in our outlook. What we talked about was, particularly, given the schedule with Montgomery County that we would shape the rate case to the extent that we needed to ensure that the recovery of Montgomery County that's reflected in our existing plan, it was shaped with the timing of that rate case. That said, the rider that was passed gave us an opportunity as we look beyond Montgomery County to have more contemporaneous rate recovery. From a regulatory process perspective, we still have to have the -- remember the legislation only enabled the commission to [ provide  ] that relief, we still have to go through the process of rulemaking through the PUCT to put that rider in effect. And from our vantage point, as we think about the capital plan in Texas, we have not yet determined how we wish to time the availability of the rate cases and mechanism and the contemporaneous rulemaking around that rider. We still have to [ through ] the PUCT and candidly, that conversation is ongoing because they are the parties who would be part of that regulatory process. But think about it this way. We'll go to the commission to ask for rulemaking that would take advantage of the legislation to put the actual rider in effect for ongoing recovery. So from a timing standpoint, we don't want to set an expectation that there is this immediate upside. So we'll be shaping the rate case and the regulatory process around that rider as we make the capital plan for Texas in the generation space a little more clear. There will be more on that, but it is not something immediate. I don't want to set that expectation."

In terms of [ chart driving ] future capital, I mean, the resource plan will be what the resource plan will be. I mean that's a dynamic of our business across all the generation types is that we've got that aging fleet that needs to be refurbished and we've been doing that for over 10 years. And if you look back in time, since we started our portfolio transformation, we've added and deactivated roughly equal amounts of capacity and we'll continue to do that going forward. Obviously, what the regulatory mechanisms do is provide an opportunity for there being more certainty for our customers and for our investors in terms of us having the financial flexibility to make sure we continue to make those investments. Same goes with -- on renewable front. They will be part of the resource plan to meet the needs our customers have. We're not doing them outside of that customer base to meet any other needs. So the regulatory process isn't going to drive a need for a new power plant. For example, that it will provide a lot of certainty around the financial flexibility we have to invest in those power plants."
