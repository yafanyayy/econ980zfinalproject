I'll first go over Q3 results before moving on to guidance. I'll then turn the call over to Mark and Larry.

I'll first go over Q3 results before moving on to guidance. I'll then turn the call over to Mark and Larry. As in prior quarters, I'll review our non-GAAP results using constant dollar growth rate, unless I say otherwise.
Total Cloud Services and License Support revenue for the quarter was $6.7 billion, up 4% in constant currency, and now accounts for nearly 70% of total company revenue, largely recurring revenue. As in past quarters, we're seeing robust double-digit growth rate for total cloud revenue in all regions, with especially strong growth in Asia Pacific.
In terms of product categories, ERP grew in the mid-30s and the verticals grew in the high 30s. Our software business, which is the totaling of Cloud Services and License Support revenue with Cloud License and On-Premise License revenue is 82% of total revenue and it grew 3% in constant currency.
Our software business has remained extremely stable and resilient as we have made the transition to faster-growing SaaS business that entailed trading nonrecurring upfront license revenue for recurrent long-term subscription revenue.
Through adoption of Autonomous Database and OCI, we're now shifting the focus for our infrastructure business to the cloud. As a percentage of our total software business, cloud is now more than double what it was just 3 years ago and provides us with the ability to accelerate overall software revenue growth as this mix shift continues.
GAAP applications total revenue were $2.8 billion, up 7%, and GAAP infrastructure total revenue were $5.1 billion, up 2%. The gross margin for Cloud Services and License Support was 86%, essentially the same as last year with continuing improvement in SaaS gross margins, stability in software support growth gross margins and continued investment in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. Once our cloud business is at scale, I expect our gross margins will go significantly higher.
Total revenue for the quarter was $9.6 billion, up 3% from last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $4.3 billion, up 5% from last year, and the operating margins was 44%, up from 43% last year.
This quarter last year was greatly impacted by the change in the U.S. tax law, so comparing the GAAP numbers is not very meaningful after pretax income. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 20%, up from 16% catch-up rate last year, and non-GAAP EPS was $0.87 in USD, and up 12% in constant currency. This quarter, the GAAP tax rate was 11% and GAAP EPS was $0.76.
Operating cash flow over the last 4 quarters is $14.8 billion. Over the last 4 quarters, capital expenditures were $1.6 billion and free cash flow was $13.2 billion, down 1% due to timing differences of tax payments and working capital items.
We have more than $40 billion in cash and marketable securities. The short-term deferred revenue balance is $8 billion, up 5% in constant currency. The remaining performance obligations, or what I'll refer to as contract backlog, will be in the Q, and is now $31.5 billion, of which approximately 62% will be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months.
Since we remain committed to returning value to shareholders through acquisitions, internal investments and a return of capital with stock repurchases and dividends, this quarter, we repurchased 206 million shares for a total of $10 billion. Over the last 12 months, we have repurchased 728 million shares and reduced the absolute shares outstanding by nearly 16%. And the Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend 26% from $0.19 to $0.24 per share.
Turning to currency. I expect the strengthening U.S. dollar will continue with a currency headwind of 3% for Q4 revenue and a $0.03 headwind to earnings per share.
Okay, so with that, let me turn to the guidance. So for Q4, total revenues are expected to grow 1% to 3% in constant currency and 0 to negative 2% in U.S. dollars. Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to grow between 15% to 19%, and be between $1.08 and $1.12 in constant currency, so we will deliver double-digit non-GAAP EPS growth for fiscal year 2019.
Taking into account the $0.03 currency headwind, non-GAAP EPS for Q4 in USD is expected to grow between 12% and 16%, and be between $1.05 and $1.09 in USD.
My EPS guidance assumes a base tax rate of 20%. However, onetime tax events could cause actual tax rate for any given quarter to vary from our base tax rate, but I expect that in normalizing for onetime tax events, our tax rate will average around 20%.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mark for his comments."

It was a solid quarter for us, from top to bottom. Total revenue was up 3% in constant currency with Cloud Services and License Support, up 4% and EPS 12% -- plus 12% in constant currency.In our apps ecosystem, we continued our momentum,",1021,"Thanks, Safra. It was a solid quarter for us, from top to bottom. Total revenue was up 3% in constant currency with Cloud Services and License Support, up 4% and EPS 12% -- plus 12% in constant currency.
In our apps ecosystem, we continued our momentum, growing at 7%, and that was acceleration for us, and over $11 billion in trailing 12-months revenue and 92% of that is now recurring. We continue to grow revenue faster than market, and we have an enormous opportunity ahead of us in ERP and HCM.
In terms of SaaS revenue and bookings, Fusion apps were up 35%. By the way, our overall ERP and HCM annualized and SaaS revenue is now $2.8 billion, and that's up in the mid-20s. Then Fusion apps, 35% up, Fusion ERP with revenue was up 47% organically. NetSuite revenue was up 28%. Bookings were up actually even higher in the mid-30s.
Our vertical revenue was up 38%, and our annualized revenue in the verticals is now over $800 million.
I'm going to redo a quick quote from IDC, and I have to read it precisely or I get cards and letters. So let me just make sure I do this exactly as written.
""Per IDC's latest annual market share results, Oracle is the #1 enterprise applications vendor in North America based on market share and revenue, surpassing Salesforce.com and SAP."" We've seen this momentum building, so this is not any surprise to us, but I think it's always better when you can see it in real numbers from somebody other than us.
Let me switch briefly to infrastructure. Our GAAP tech ecosystem is $21 billion on a trailing 12-months basis and Q3 was up 2%. In Autonomous Database, our momentum continues to build. We're going to have 4,000 new trials that were added in Q3 alone, nearly 1,000 paying customers. We're adding many new customers and we're seeing great pull-through and with 20% of our autonomous data warehouse trials also using analytics. We now have over 35 referenceable customers and we expect to be greater than 100 soon.
Cloud and customer revenue was up triple digits for the fourth consecutive quarter. To overall, a solid quarter, as we had our revenue targets inside 12% EPS growth. The strength of our bookings growth along with climbing renewal rates gives me the confidence that our cloud apps business is only going to strengthen from here. And going forward, given the visibility we have into the revenue backlog, which Safra touched on a bit earlier.
Looking forward, I do expect FY '20 revenue growth will be higher than FY '19. And EPS this year will be certainly grow double digits, as Safra mentioned. 
I'm going to give you a few customer wins as well, try to give you a flavor for what happened in the quarter for us. Now most of these didn't affect our revenue, most of these obviously are all really bookings that occurred in the quarter, but I thought I'd give you some context about some people in our user base as well as outside our user base. 
So for example, Cromp Group in the Netherlands E-Business Suite migration; MasterBrand's Cabinets in the U.S. in E-Business Suite migration; ThyssenKrupp in Germany in E-Business Suite migration; Willis Towers Watson E-Business Suite migration. I gave you those, just a few of those examples. Those are core, sort of, E-Business Suite, Black & Veach was another one engineering company, core, sort of, E-Business Suite customers as we see this acceleration of our user base move into the cloud. Got a couple of people, soft ERP migrations, Emica, Mutual in the quarter, Depaul University and that's a slew of wins again. And I referenced that a lot of the ERP user base that's out there today is outside of our user base or even our traditional on-premise competitor from, if you will, the old days.
ON Semiconductor, nice win in the quarter. Packaging Corporation of America, again, outside of our user bass. For the quarter, Eaton, another manufacturer. I try to spread it all the way in the Netherlands. And I could go on, which, in the sake of time, I won't, although I mentioned Ashford Hospitality. These are, again, outside our user base that are brand-new customer or brand-new customers to Oracle in the area of ERP.
In HCM, Abu Dhabi airports; ADT; Alorica; [indiscernible] BloomBank; Great Canadian Gaming. We got really nice win at the company called the Novo Healthcare, this again was not inside our user base. These were attritional loss in customer, where we actually get multipillar ERP back-office and HCM connected together.
So anyway, I'll stop there in the sake of time, but just to really, again, very impressive set of customers and a good mix of net new logos as well as movement from our user base. We had a pretty good quarter and it was some really quality names on the platform site. [indiscernible] Generali Search Services in Italy; Joanne Stores, Tran Stout Italia, Unicorp, I mean some really nice beginnings of what you're seeing as we move to our gen 2 cloud and Autonomous Database. I did want to make a couple of quick comments in our growing relationship with The Gap. So it was a global retailer. I think most of you know revenue of greater than $16 billion, and we've been working with The Gap in their transformation to a truly multi-cloud environment but using many, many Oracle Technologies, it may include really everything we got SaaS, PaaS, delivering innovation, reliability and scalability in every turn. And as part of even the things they're using in the private cloud, those are all really enabled by Exadata, and we're really thrilled to be Gap's strategic partner there for its spin out their new retail brands and stores faster.
And so that's the few quick wins for the quarter. So overall, good solid quarter for us on the income statement side, but also in the quality of these bookings that we're describing -- I have been describing. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry."

Oracle's future rests on 2 strategic businesses: cloud applications and Cloud Infrastructure. The growth in our cloud applications business has been driven by our Fusion Suite and NetSuite.
Both the Fusion Suite of applications and NetSuite are growing very, very rapidly, and Mark gave you the numbers. As the names imply, both Fusion and NetSuite are integrated suites of applications locations, including sales, service, human resources, financials, supply chain and manufacturing applications. No other cloud services provider has such a comprehensive suite of applications covering both the front office and the back office.
Most customers want their cloud services provider to make their applications work together. Customers do not like to be responsible for the complex process of integrating lots of different applications, running on lots of different vendors' clouds. We think our integrated suite approach to the cloud applications business is a primary reason for the very rapid growth in our cloud applications market share.
The introduction of our Gen 2, a highly secure infrastructure featuring Autonomous Database has been very well received. During Q3, we had nearly 1,000 paying Autonomous Database customers and over 4,000 active trials. Our infrastructure technology is highly differentiated from AWS. Each one of our cloud computers has a separate security processor and memory to insulate customers from intruding upon each other. And it also makes our cloud control code inaccessible by customers.
No other cloud services provider offers this kind of protection across their entire public cloud. The Oracle's Autonomous Database is the only database that can respond to a security threat by automatically patching itself while still running your application. No downtime is required. No other database has this capability.
Oracle Technology leadership in cloud infrastructure and database plus our market leadership in cloud applications make us very optimistic about our future.
I'll turn it back to you, operator."

Last month when we were together at our tech conference, you reiterated that fiscal second half '19 sales growth would accelerate on a constant-currency basis versus the first half, and I'm not trying to be nitpicky but I think it doesn't look like it's accelerating much. So I'm just wondering has anything changed? And I also wanted to ask about fiscal '20, which you just mentioned that fiscal '20 constant currency growth would be higher than fiscal '19. I guess what I'm wondering is should we be thinking that, that constant currency growth acceleration that you're referring to for fiscal '20 is similar to the type of acceleration on the second half of fiscal '19? Or could it be more meaningful?"

Second half is, whatever your adjective is around to grow faster than first half. FY '20, faster than '19. When you're getting underneath more of the drivers, at a big level first, our growing businesses are becoming a bigger part of our total than our other businesses. So as an example, just one example, cloud ERP gets bigger, hardware gets smaller, obviously, those have offsetting effects. In addition, we have the things that attach with that, for example, our consulting services business now in on-premise has been declining, but our cloud consulting is inclining as does our overall bookings. So as a result, these just offset each other. Within it, clearly, I've given you the numbers on certain parts of our apps as an example of ERP and HCM, which are just growing substantively. Larry's comments about Autonomous Database are 2 huge drivers of growth as we go forward. So I think all those statements, '19 versus '19, second half, first half, '19 to '20 are all where you're going to see acceleration of top line growth in CD."

So we've been collecting references and studying the 1,000 customers and the 4,000 trials, and what they find encouraging about the Autonomous Database. Certainly, we'll call it productivity improvements. The fact that they can go from not having a database, not having a hardware, literally log on to our cloud, create an instance, get -- move their data and be up and running and doing the useful things in 5 minutes is proving to be a shock to a lot of our customers. So getting things up and running quickly. Productivity has been a very big issue. We've got 1 customer who's done a series of tests, they were an AWS user, and I know we have these ads that promise cut your AWS bill in half. They found that we were running 11.5x faster than they were running at AWS, and they cut their bill by 80%.

Some people, they had an existing data warehouse and we adjust the compatibility, being able to take an existing data warehouse, not spooling up a new one in 5 minutes, we're taking existing data warehouse, lifting it and shifting it over. So we're seeing all 3 of those use cases. Productivity -- or motivators, I should say. Productivity, compatibility and cost, all driving the usage of Autonomous Database."

If the fact that -- you add to the fact to Larry's point that this database tunes itself, creates also an index, it's actually labor less and can reapply talent to another area. If it did nothing but that, it would be valuable. If it did nothing but give you better security and give you pricing performance, and so this is a release that the reason you're seeing the trials and the level why you hear enthusiasm the way it is, is the customer response is just extremely high because it just makes business sense. This isn't something sold 5 levels down or 4 levels down in the order. This can be sold to the top of the company, if you will, at the CEO level. So it's why it's such an exciting release test because it has so many business benefits to our customers as opposed to maybe the fact that you would think of traditionally many of our benefits, if you will, is technical. It's difficult to explain to a CEO what multitenant is and what in-memory is, than frankly the benefits I just described."

And our strategy has been very simple, and -- but I know I said it before, but it's been, frankly, no more complicated than adding salespeople internationally and domestically. We've done both to, if you will, localize the product for more countries. We've done many new countries that we've now released. In addition to that, we've been building out more verticals what we call suite success, where we actually bundle in the implementation with what we sell. And that's very, very popular with our customers. And so I think the team has also done a marvelous job executionally.

The researchers that I mentioned earlier that's moving from AWS and for their cost savings, they're doing a combination of machine learning and computer vision to look at tissue samples and detect anomalous cells. [indiscernible] using computers to diagnose cancer. And then as a combination of machine learning and the Autonomous Database. And that's an all new application. So there are several people that are coming in with all new applications in the cloud. Especially the ones moving away from AWS. Then there are traditional on-premise customers, who are simply taking one of their millions of Oracle databases, because there are millions of these things out there and just lifting one of those databases either transaction processing and the associated application, either transaction processing application or a data warehousing application, just lifting it intact, moving the data over and moving the application over to compute within the data over to Autonomous Database, and running the same exact thing in the cloud. They're experiencing, sometimes shocking performance improvements also. And I know we have 1 customer that moved from on-premise into the cloud and the cloud system ran many times faster than their on-premise system. Then there are customers that are moving new -- existing big Oracle customers that are moving new development. The new applications that they're developing from developing them on-premise, they move test and development into the cloud. And they are the ones that, again, the general reaction there is they're much, much more productive, getting running is much cheaper to do test and development much more responsive, much more productive to move test and development from their on-premise infrastructure to the cloud infrastructure. So online transaction and processing, lifting and shifting applications, data warehousing lifting and shifting, test and development, moving from AWS, there are lots of different use cases."

So we've got a lot of underpinning improving dynamics in terms of net new customers in addition to moving more database and certainly analytical data warehousing is probably the biggest individual driver of everything we've got."

And those 2 vendors together have less than 50% of the market. We have more Fortune 500 customers, for example. They have many big customers, but the blizzard of implementations -- or there's a blizzard of companies that have the more than 50% market share, 54%, 55%, most of them have moved into private equity. They're not even public companies. They're on their second or third term through private equity. They've got no migration plan to the cloud. They've got implementation, I could go on and on with all of these. And that's why as I mentioned earlier, we actually line up our development resources and our sales resources, very focused on these competitors. They would have names like, I mentioned a couple like McCormack & Dodge, if you've heard of them. IBM, believe it or not, actually has got an old ERP system. There's a company called Deltek, I mean, there's a company called Lawson,  a company called Ethica, there's tens and tens of these to your point, and these are old, old pieces of code. These need to move. They need to move to a more modern platform and they are, perhaps, as attractive as any other market. And in fairness, our user base actually knows our cloud roadmap. They actually have confidence in our R&D. They know we're going to be there to migrate them when they want to be there. They actually have less of a sense of urgency, in many cases, to move than the companies you're describing, Brad, because they're in much more desperate situations without a roadmap, without knowing how they're going to get from here to there, knowing their competitors are beginning to move. So we have as much success today, and if you ask one of our salespeople, would you rather have one of these competitive territories where you're going after one of these niche vendors? Or would you rather have an E-Business Suite territory? Many of our salespeople say give me that competitive territory because there's an absolute need to move as quick as you can. So yes, it's an incredibly attractive market and that's why you hear us keep talking about it so much because the addition of fact is when we sell ERP, we continue to see an attach rate to HCM, and, frankly, an attach rate to even some of our other apps in the CX and front office area as well, so it's why we're so focused on that opportunity."

I'll first go over Q3 results before moving on to guidance. I'll then turn the call over to Mark and Larry. 
As in prior quarters, I'll review our non-GAAP results using constant dollar growth rate, unless I say otherwise.
Total Cloud Services and License Support revenue for the quarter was $6.7 billion, up 4% in constant currency, and now accounts for nearly 70% of total company revenue, largely recurring revenue. As in past quarters, we're seeing robust double-digit growth rates for total cloud revenue in all regions, with especially strong growth in Asia Pacific.
In terms of product categories, ERP grew in the mid-30s and the verticals grew in the high 30s. Our software business, which is the totaling of Cloud Services and License Support revenue with Cloud License and On-Premise License revenue is 82% of total revenue and it grew 3% in constant currency.
Our software business has remained extremely stable and resilient as we have made the transition to faster-growing SaaS business that entailed trading nonrecurring upfront license revenue for recurrent long-term subscription revenue.
Through adoption of autonomous database and OCI, we're now shifting the focus for our infrastructure business to the cloud. As a percentage of our total software business, cloud is now more than double what it was just 3 years ago and provides us with the ability to accelerate overall software revenue growth as this mix shift continues.
GAAP applications total revenue were $2.8 billion, up 7%, and GAAP infrastructure total revenue were $5.1 billion, up 2%. The gross margin for Cloud Services and License Support was 86%, essentially the same as last year with continuing improvement in SaaS gross margins, stability in software support growth gross margins and continued investment in Oracle cloud infrastructure. Once our cloud business is at scale, I expect our gross margins will go significantly higher.
Total revenue for the quarter was $9.6 billion, up 3% from last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $4.3 billion, up 5% from last year, and the operating margins was 44%, up from 43% last year.
This quarter last year was greatly impacted by the change in the U.S. tax book, so comparing the GAAP numbers is not very meaningful after pretax income. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 20%, up from 16% catch-up rate last year, and non-GAAP EPS was $0.87 in USD, and up 12% in constant currency. This quarter, the GAAP tax rate was 11% and GAAP EPS was $0.76.
Operating cash flow over the last 4 quarters is $14.8 billion. Over the last 4 quarters, capital expenditures were $1.6 billion and free cash flow was $13.2 billion, down 1% due to timing differences of tax payments and working capital items.
We have more than $40 billion in cash and marketable securities. The short-term deferred revenue balance is $8 billion, up 5% in constant currency. The remaining performance obligations, or what I'll refer to as contract backlog, will be in the Q, and is now $31.5 billion, of which approximately 62% will be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months.
Since we remain committed to returning value to shareholders through acquisitions, internal investments and a return of capital with stock repurchases and dividends, this quarter, we repurchased 206 million shares for a total of $10 billion. Over the last 12 months, we repurchased 728 million shares and reduced the absolute shares outstanding by nearly 16%. And the Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend 26% from $0.19 to $0.24 per share.
Turning to currency. I expect the strengthening U.S. dollar will continue with a currency headwind of 3% for Q4 revenue and a $0.03 headwind to earnings per share.
Okay, so with that, let me turn to the guidance. So for Q4, total revenues are expected to grow 1% to 3% in constant currency and 0 to negative 2% in U.S. dollars. Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to grow between 15% to 19%, and be between $1.08 and $1.12 in constant currency, so we will deliver double-digit non-GAAP EPS growth for fiscal year 2019.
Taking into account the $0.03 currency headwind, non-GAAP EPS for Q4 in USD is expected to grow between 12% and 16%, and be between $1.05 and $1.09 in USD.
My EPS guidance assumes a base tax rate of 20%. However, onetime tax events could cause actual tax rates for any given quarter to vary from our base tax rate, but I expect that in normalizing for onetime tax events, our tax rate will average around 20%.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mark for his comments."

Total revenue was up 3% in constant currency with Cloud Services and License Support, up 4% and EPS 12% -- plus 12% in constant currency.In our apps ecosystem, we continued our momentum, g",1015,"Thanks, Safra. Thanks. Solid quarter for us, from top to bottom. Total revenue was up 3% in constant currency with Cloud Services and License Support, up 4% and EPS 12% -- plus 12% in constant currency.
In our apps ecosystem, we continued our momentum, growing at 7%, and that was an acceleration for us, and over $11 billion in trailing 12-months revenue and 92% of that is now recurring. We continue to grow revenue faster than market, and we have an enormous opportunity ahead of us in ERP and HCM.
In terms of SaaS revenue and bookings, Fusion apps were up 35%. By the way, our overall ERP and HCM annualized SaaS revenue is now $2.8 billion, and that's up in the mid-20s.  Turn to Fusion apps, 35% up, Fusion ERP with -- revenue was up 47% organically. NetSuite revenue was up 28%. Bookings were up actually even higher in the mid-30s.
Our vertical revenue was up 38%, and our annualized revenue in the verticals is now over $800 million.
I'm going to read you a quick quote from IDC, and I have to read it precisely or I'll get cards and letters. So let me just make sure I do this exactly as it's written.
""Per IDC's latest annual market share results, Oracle is the #1 enterprise applications vendor in North America based on market share and revenue, surpassing Salesforce.com and SAP."" We've seen this momentum building, so this is not any surprise to us, but I think it's always better when you can see it in real numbers from somebody other than us.
Let me switch briefly to infrastructure. Our GAAP tech ecosystem is $21 billion on a trailing 12-months basis and Q3 was up 2%. In Autonomous Database, our momentum continues to build. We now have 4,000 new trials that were added in Q3 alone, nearly 1,000 paying customers. We're adding many new customers and we're seeing great pull-through and with 20% of our autonomous data warehouse trials also using analytics. We now have over 35 referenceable customers and we expect to be greater than 100 soon.
Cloud and customer revenue was up triple digits for the fourth consecutive quarter. So overall, a solid quarter, as we hit our revenue targets and saw a 12% EPS growth. The strength of our bookings growth along with climbing renewal rates gives me the confidence that our cloud apps business is only going to strengthen from here and going forward, given the visibility we have into the revenue backlog, which Safra touched on a bit earlier.
Looking forward, I do expect FY '20 revenue growth will be higher than FY '19. And EPS this year will be certainly -- grow double digits, as Safra mentioned. 
I'm going to give you a few customer wins as well, try to give you a flavor for what happened in the quarter for us. Now most of these didn't affect our revenue, most of these obviously are all really bookings that occurred in the quarter, but I thought I'd give you some context about some people in our user base as well as outside our user base. 
So for example, Tromp Group in the Netherlands E-Business Suite migration; MasterBrand Cabinets in the U.S. in E-Business Suite migration; thyssenkrupp in Germany in E-Business Suite migration; Willis Towers Watson E-Business Suite migration. I gave you those, just a few of those examples. Those are core, sort of, E-Business Suite, Black & Veatch was another one engineering company, core, sort of, E-Business Suite customers as we see this acceleration of our user base move into the cloud. Got a couple PeopleSoft ERP migrations, Amica Mutual in the quarter, Depaul University. And then a slew of wins again. And I referenced that a lot of the ERP user base that's out there today is outside of our user base or even our traditional on-premise competitor from, if you will, the old days.
ON semiconductor, nice win in the quarter. Packaging Corporation of America, again, outside of our user base for the quarter.  Eaton, leather manufacturer. [indiscernible] in the Netherlands. I could go on, which, in the sake of time, I won't, although I mentioned Ashford Hospitality. These are, again, outside our user base that are brand-new customers to Oracle in the area of ERP.
In HCM, Abu Dhabi Airports; ADT; Alorica; BLOM BANK; Great Canadian Gaming. We had a really nice win in the company called the Nova Healthcare. This again was not inside our user base. These were attritional Lawson customer, where we actually get multipillar ERP back-office and HCM connected together.
So anyway, I'll stop there in the sake of time, but just to really, again, very impressive set of customers and a good mix of net new logos as well as movement from our user base. We had a pretty good quarter and it was some really quality names on the platform side. Fair Isaac, Generali insurance services in Italy; JOANN Stores; Trans Italia; Unicorp, I mean some really nice beginnings of what you're seeing as we move toward gen 2 cloud and Autonomous Database. I did want to make a couple of quick comments in our growing relationship with The Gap. So it was a global retailer. It's, I think, most of you know with revenue of greater than $16 billion, and we've been working with The Gap in their transformation to what's really a multi-cloud environment but using many, many Oracle Technologies, may include really everything we got SaaS, PaaS, delivering innovation, reliability and scalability at every turn. And as part of even the things they're using in the private cloud, those are all really enabled by Exadata, and we're really thrilled to be Gap's strategic partner in their efforts to spin up their new retail brands and stores faster.
And so that's the few quick wins for the quarter. So overall, good solid quarter for us on the income statement side, but also in the quality of these bookings that we're describing or that I have been describing. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry."

Oracle's future rests on 2 strategic businesses: cloud applications and Cloud Infrastructure. The growth in our cloud applications business has been driven by our Fusion Suite and NetSuite.
Both the Fusion Suite of applications and NetSuite are growing very, very rapidly, and Mark gave you the numbers. As the names imply, both Fusion and NetSuite are integrated suites of applications, including sales, service, human resources, financials, supply chain and manufacturing applications. No other cloud services provider has such a comprehensive suite of applications covering both the front office and the back office.
Most customers want their cloud services provider to make their applications work together. Customers do not like to be responsible for the complex process of integrating lots of different applications, running on lots of different vendors' clouds. We think our integrated suite approach to the cloud applications business is a primary reason for the very rapid growth in our cloud applications market share.
The introduction of our Gen 2, a highly secure infrastructure, featuring the Oracle Autonomous Database has been very well received. During Q3, we had nearly 1,000 paying Autonomous Database customers and over 4,000 active trials. Our infrastructure technology is highly differentiated from AWS. Each one of our cloud computers has a separate security processor and memory to insulate customers from intruding upon each other. And it also makes our cloud control code inaccessible by customers.
No other cloud services provider offers this kind of protection across their entire public cloud. The Oracle Autonomous Database is the only database that can respond to a security threat by automatically patching itself while it's still running your application. No downtime is required. No other database has this capability.
Oracle Technology leadership in cloud infrastructure and database plus our market leadership in cloud applications makes us very optimistic about our future.
I'll turn it back to you, operator."

Last month when we were together at our tech conference, you reiterated that fiscal second half '19 sales growth would accelerate on a constant-currency basis versus the first half, and I'm not trying to be nitpicky but I think it doesn't look like it's accelerating much. So I was just wondering if anything changed. And I also wanted to ask about fiscal '20, which you've just mentioned that fiscal '20 constant currency growth would be higher than fiscal '19. I guess what I'm wondering is should we be thinking that, that constant currency growth acceleration that you're referring to for fiscal '20 is similar to the type of acceleration on the second half of fiscal '19? Or could it be more meaningful?"

When you're getting underneath at what are the drivers, at a big level, first, our growing businesses are becoming a bigger part of our total than our other businesses. So as an example, just one example, cloud ERP gets bigger, hardware gets smaller, obviously, those have offsetting effects. In addition, we have the things that attach with that, for example, our consulting services business now in on-premise has been declining, but our cloud consulting is inclining as does our overall bookings. So as a result, these just offset each other. Within it, clearly, I've given you the numbers on certain parts of our apps as the example of ERP and HCM, which are just growing substantively. Larry's comments about Autonomous Database are 2 huge drivers of growth as we go forward. So I think all of those statements, '19 versus '18, second half, first half, '19 to '20 are all where you're going to see acceleration of top line growth in CD."

So we've been collecting references and studying the 1,000 customers and the 4,000 trials, and what they find encouraging about the Autonomous Database. Certainly, we'll call it productivity improvements. The fact that they can go from not having a database, not having a hardware, literally log on to our cloud, create an instance, get -- move their data and be up and running and doing the useful things in 5 minutes is proving to be a shock to a lot of our customers. So getting things up and running quickly. Productivity has been a very big issue. We've got 1 customer who's done a series of tests, they were an AWS user, and I know we have these ads that promise cut your AWS bill in half. They found that we were running 11.5x faster than they were running in AWS, and they cut their bill by 80%. So that's -- and these are university researchers, so they're very, very cost sensitive and they felt it was worthwhile making the move just because we were much less expensive. Autonomous Database was way less expensive than Redshift or Aurora at Amazon. Some people, they had an existing data warehouse and with just the compatibility, being able to take an existing data warehouse, not spooling up a new one in 5 minutes, but taking an existing data warehouse, lifting it and shifting it over.

They, in many cases, have to discuss it with their audit committees. And the fact that now patching goes from a problem to where they pass that to us and it gets done instantaneously, we have many customers who said, if this thing did nothing but that, I would migrate to Autonomous Database. If the fact that -- you add to the fact to Larry's point that this database tunes itself, creates all its own index, is it actually it's labor less and can you reapply talent to another area. If it did nothing but that, it would be valuable. If it did nothing but give you better security and give you pricing performance, and so this is a release that the reason you're seeing the trials and the level why you hear our enthusiasm the way it is, is the customer response is just extremely high because it just makes business sense. This isn't something sold 5 levels down or 4 levels down in the order. This can be sold at the top of the company, if you will, at the CEO level. So it's why it's such an exciting release test because at this point it has so many business benefits to our customers as opposed to maybe the fact that you would think of traditionally many of our benefits being, if you will, technical.

We deploy our sales force against those brands and against those industries as well as into our own user base. And the reason I read the references the way I read them was so you get a flavor that both our own user base is beginning to move in bigger numbers as well as the fact that we get competitive. Remember, most of that user base is not sitting with us or our traditional on-premise competitor. So yes, I mean, clearly it's a point to what I made earlier, and I'll stop after this to say that our growing businesses are becoming bigger and bigger, and you start putting the growth rates I'm describing on numbers like $3 billion, and you can do your own math.

The researchers that I mentioned earlier that are moving from AWS for a big cost savings, they're doing a combination of machine learning and computer vision to look at tissue samples and detect anomalous cells. Cancer based kit are using computers to diagnose cancer and then that's a combination of machine learning and the Autonomous Database. And that's an all new application. So there are several people that are coming in with all new applications in the cloud. Especially the ones moving from AWS. Then there are traditional on-premise customers, who are simply taking one of their millions of Oracle databases, there are millions of these things out there and just lifting one of those databases either transaction processing and the associated application, either transaction processing application or a data warehousing application, just lifting it intact, moving the data over and moving the application over to compute, moving the data over to Autonomous Database, and running the same exact thing in the cloud. They're experiencing, sometimes shocking performance improvements also. I know we have 1 customer that moved from on-premise into the cloud and the cloud system ran many times faster than their on-premise system. Then there are customers that are moving new -- existing big Oracle customers that are moving new development. The new applications that they're developing from developing them on-premise, they move test and development into the cloud. And they are the ones that, again, the general reaction there is they're much, much more productive getting running. It's much cheaper to do test and development, much more responsive, much more productive to move test and development from their on-premise infrastructure to the cloud infrastructure. So online transaction and processing, lifting and shifting applications, data warehousing lifting and shifting, test and development, moving from AWS, there are lots of different use cases."

And those 2 vendors together have less than 50% of the market. We have more Fortune 500 customers, for example. They have many big customers, but the blizzard of implementations -- or there's a blizzard of companies that have the more than 50% market share, 54%, 55%, most of them have moved into private equity. They're not even public companies. They're on their second or third term through private equity. They've got no migration plan to the cloud. They've got 2G -- I could go on and on with all of these. And that's why as I mentioned earlier, we actually line up our development resources and our sales resources, very focused on these competitors. They would have names like, I mentioned a couple like McCormack & Dodge, if you've heard of them. IBM, believe it or not, actually has got an old ERP system. There's a company called Deltek, I mean, there's a company called Lawson, a company called ETHICA, there's tens and tens of these to your point, and these are old, old pieces of code. These need to move. They need to move to a more modern platform and they are, perhaps, as attractive as any other market. And in fairness, our user base actually knows our cloud roadmap. They actually have confidence in our R&D. They know we're going to be there to migrate them when they want to be there. They actually have less of a sense of urgency, in many cases, to move than the companies you're describing, Brad, because they're in much more desperate situations without a roadmap, without knowing how they're going to get from here to there, knowing their competitors are beginning to move. So we have as much success today, and if you ask one of our salespeople, would you rather have one of these competitive territories where you're going after one of these niche vendors? Or would you rather have an E-Business Suite territory? Many of our salespeople say give me that competitive territory because there's an absolute need to move as quick as you can. So yes, it's an incredibly attractive market and it's why you hear us keep talking about it so much because the addition of fact is when we sell ERP, we continue to see an attach rate to HCM, and, frankly, an attach rate to even some of our other apps in the CX and front office area as well, so it's why we're so focused on that opportunity."

I'll first go over Q3 results before moving on to guidance. I'll then turn the call over to Mark and Larry. As in prior quarters, I'll review our non-GAAP results using constant dollar growth rates, unless I say otherwise.
Total Cloud Services and License Support revenue for the quarter was $6.7 billion, up 4% in constant currency, and now accounts for nearly 70% of total company revenue, largely recurring revenue. As in past quarters, we are seeing robust double-digit growth rates for total cloud revenue in all regions, with especially strong growth in Asia Pacific.
In terms of product categories, ERP grew in the mid-30s and the verticals grew in the high 30s. Our software business, which is the totaling of Cloud Services and License Support revenue with Cloud License and On-Premise License revenue, is 82% of total revenue and it grew 3% in constant currency.
Our software business has remained extremely stable and resilient as we have made the transition to faster-growing SaaS business that entailed trading nonrecurring upfront license revenue for recurrent long-term subscription revenue.
Through adoption of autonomous database and OCI, we're now shifting the focus for our infrastructure business to the cloud. As a percentage of our total software business, cloud is now more than double what it was just 3 years ago and provides us with the ability to accelerate overall software revenue growth as this mix shift continues.
GAAP applications total revenue were $2.8 billion, up 7%, and GAAP infrastructure total revenue were $5.1 billion, up 2%. The gross margin for Cloud Services and License Support was 86%, essentially the same as last year with continuing improvement in SaaS gross margins, stability in software support gross margins and continued investment in Oracle cloud infrastructure. Once our cloud business is at scale, I expect our gross margins will go significantly higher.
Total revenue for the quarter was $9.6 billion, up 3% from last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $4.3 billion, up 5% from last year, and the operating margin was 44%, up from 43% last year.
This quarter last year was greatly impacted by the change in the U.S. tax book, so comparing the GAAP numbers is not very meaningful after pretax income. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 20%, up from 16% catch-up rate last year, and non-GAAP EPS was $0.87 in USD, and up 12% in constant currency. This quarter, the GAAP tax rate was 11% and GAAP EPS was $0.76.
Operating cash flow over the last 4 quarters is $14.8 billion. Over the last 4 quarters, capital expenditures were $1.6 billion and free cash flow was $13.2 billion, down 1% due to timing differences of tax payments and working capital items.
We have more than $40 billion in cash and marketable securities. The short-term deferred revenue balance is $8 billion, up 5% in constant currency. The remaining performance obligations, or what I'll refer to as contract backlog, will be in the Q, and is now $31.5 billion, of which approximately 62% will be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months.
Since we remain committed to returning value to shareholders through acquisitions, internal investments and a return of capital with stock repurchases and dividends, this quarter, we repurchased 206 million shares for a total of $10 billion. Over the last 12 months, we repurchased 728 million shares and reduced the absolute shares outstanding by nearly 16%. And the Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend 26% from $0.19 to $0.24 per share.
Turning to currency. I expect the strengthening U.S. dollar will continue with a currency headwind of 3% for Q4 revenue and a $0.03 headwind to earnings per share.
Okay, so with that, let me turn to the guidance. So for Q4, total revenues are expected to grow 1% to 3% in constant currency and 0 to negative 2% in U.S. dollars. Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to grow between 15% to 19%, and be between $1.08 and $1.12 in constant currency, so we will deliver double-digit non-GAAP EPS growth for fiscal year 2019.
Taking into account the $0.03 currency headwind, non-GAAP EPS for Q4 in USD is expected to grow between 12% and 16%, and be between $1.05 and $1.09 in USD.
My EPS guidance assumes a base tax rate of 20%. However, onetime tax events could cause actual tax rates for any given quarter to vary from our base tax rate. But I expect that in normalizing for onetime tax events, our tax rate will average around 20%.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mark for his comments."

Thanks. Solid quarter for us, from top to bottom. Total revenue was up 3% in constant currency with Cloud Services and License Support, up 4% and EPS 12% -- plus 12% in constant currency.
In our apps ecosystem, we continued our momentum, growing at 7%, and that was an acceleration for us, and over $11 billion in trailing 12-months revenue and 92% of that is now recurring. We continue to grow revenue faster than market, and we have an enormous opportunity ahead of us in ERP and HCM.
In terms of SaaS revenue and bookings, Fusion apps were up 35%. By the way, our overall ERP and HCM annualized SaaS revenue is now $2.8 billion, and that's up in the mid-20s. Again, Fusion apps, 35% up, Fusion ERP where revenue was up 47% organically. NetSuite revenue was up 28%. Bookings were up actually even higher in the mid-30s.
Our vertical revenue was up 38%, and our annualized revenue in the verticals is now over $800 million.
I'm going to read you a quick quote from IDC, and I have to read it precisely or I'll get cards and letters. So let me just make sure I do this exactly as it's written.
""Per IDC's latest annual market share results, Oracle is the #1 enterprise applications vendor in North America based on market share and revenue, surpassing Salesforce.com and SAP."" We've seen this momentum building, so this is not any surprise to us, so I think it's always better when you can see it in real numbers from somebody other than us.
Let me switch briefly to infrastructure. Our GAAP tech ecosystem is $21 billion on a trailing 12-months basis and Q3 was up 2%. In Autonomous Database, our momentum continues to build. We now have 4,000 new trials that were added in Q3 alone, nearly 1,000 paying customers. We're adding many new customers and we're seeing great pull-through and with 20% of our autonomous data warehouse trials also using analytics. We now have over 35 referenceable customers and we expect to be greater than 100 soon.
Cloud customer revenue was up triple digits for the fourth consecutive quarter. So overall, a solid quarter, as we hit our revenue targets and saw a 12% EPS growth. The strength of our bookings growth along with climbing renewal rates gives me the confidence that our cloud apps business is only going to strengthen from here and going forward, given the visibility we have into the revenue backlog, which Safra touched on a bit earlier.
Looking forward, I do expect FY '20 revenue growth will be higher than FY '19. And EPS this year will be certainly -- grow double digits, as Safra mentioned. 
I'm going to give you a few customer wins as well, try to give you a flavor for what happened in the quarter for us. Now most of these didn't affect our revenue, most of these, obviously are, all really bookings that occurred in the quarter, but I thought I'd give you some context about some people in our user base as well as outside our user base. 
So for example, Tromp Group in the Netherlands E-Business Suite migration; MasterBrand Cabinets in the U.S. in E-Business Suite migration; thyssenkrupp in Germany in E-Business Suite migration; Willis Towers Watson E-Business Suite migration. I gave you those, just a few of those examples. Those are core, sort of, E-Business Suite, Black & Veatch was another one, engineering company, core, sort of, E-Business Suite customers as we see this acceleration of our user base move into the cloud. Got a couple PeopleSoft ERP migrations, Amica Mutual in the quarter, Depaul University. And then a slew of wins again. And I referenced that a lot of the ERP user base that's out there today is outside of our user base or even our traditional on-premise competitor from, if you will, the old days.
ON semiconductor, nice win in the quarter. Packaging Corporation of America, again, outside of our user base for the quarter.  Eaton, another manufacturer. Atradius Crédito in the Netherlands. I could go on, which, in the sake of time, I won't, although I'll mention Ashford Hospitality. These are, again, outside our user base that are brand-new customers to Oracle in the area of ERP.
In HCM, Abu Dhabi Airports; ADT; Alorica; Banco Davivienda; BLOM BANK; Great Canadian Gaming. We had a really nice win in a company called DeNova Healthcare. This again was not inside our user base. These were attritional Lawson customer, where we actually get multipillar ERP back-office and HCM connected together.
So anyway, I'll stop there in the sake of time, but just a really, again, very impressive set of customers and a good mix of net new logos as well as movement from our user base. We had a pretty good quarter and it was some really quality names on the platform side. Fair Isaac, Generali shared services in Italy; JOANN Stores; Trans -- Trelitalia; Unicorp, I mean, some really nice beginnings of what you're seeing as we move toward gen 2 cloud and Autonomous Database. 
I did want to make a couple of quick comments on our growing relationship with The Gap. So it's a global retailer as, I think, most of you know, with revenue of greater than $16 billion, and we've been working with The Gap in their transformation to what's really a multi-cloud environment but using many, many Oracle Technologies, and they include really everything we got: SaaS, PaaS, delivering innovation, reliability and scalability at every turn. And as part of even the things they're using in the private cloud, those are all really enabled by Exadata, and we're really thrilled to be Gap's strategic partner in their efforts to spin up their new retail brands and stores faster.
And so that's the few quick wins for the quarter. So overall, good solid quarter for us on the income statement side, but also in the quality of these bookings that we're describing or that I've been describing. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry."

Oracle's future rests on 2 strategic businesses: cloud applications and Cloud Infrastructure. The growth in our cloud applications business has been driven by our Fusion Suite and NetSuite.
Both the Fusion Suite of applications and NetSuite are growing very, very rapidly, and Mark gave you the numbers. As the names imply, both Fusion and NetSuite are integrated suites of applications, including sales, service, human resources, financials, supply chain and manufacturing applications. No other cloud services provider has such a comprehensive suite of applications covering both the front office and the back office.
Most customers want their cloud services provider to make their applications work together. Customers do not like to be responsible for the complex process of integrating lots of different applications, running on lots of different vendors' clouds. We think our integrated suite approach to the cloud applications business is a primary reason for the very rapid growth in our cloud applications market share.
The introduction of our Gen 2, highly secure infrastructure, featuring the Oracle Autonomous Database has been very well received. During Q3, we had nearly 1,000 paying Autonomous Database customers and over 4,000 active trials. Our infrastructure technology is highly differentiated from AWS. Each one of our cloud computers has a separate security processor and memory to insulate customers from intruding upon each other. And it also makes our cloud control code inaccessible by customers. No other cloud services provider offers this kind of protection across their entire public cloud. 
The Oracle Autonomous Database is the only database that can respond to a security threat by automatically patching itself while it's still running your application. No downtime is required. No other database has this capability.
Oracle Technology leadership in cloud infrastructure and database plus our market leadership in cloud applications makes us very optimistic about our future.
I'll turn it back to you, operator."

Last month, when we were together at our tech conference, you reiterated that fiscal second half '19 sales growth would accelerate on a constant-currency basis versus the first half. And I'm not trying to be nitpicky but I think it doesn't look like it's accelerating much. So I was just wondering if anything changed. And I also wanted to ask about fiscal '20, which you've just mentioned that fiscal '20 constant-currency revenue growth would be higher than fiscal '19. I guess what I'm wondering is should we be thinking that, that constant currency growth acceleration that you're referring to for fiscal '20 is similar to the type of acceleration on the second half of fiscal '19? Or could it be more meaningful?"

Second half is, whatever adjective is around it, grow faster than first half. FY '20, faster than '19. When you get in underneath at what are the drivers, at a big level, first, our growing businesses are becoming a bigger part of our total than our other businesses. So as an example, just one example, cloud ERP gets bigger, hardware gets smaller, obviously, those have offsetting effects. In addition, we have the things that attach with that, for example, our consulting services business now in on-premise has been declining, but our cloud consulting is inclining as does our overall bookings. So as a result, these just offset each other. Within it, clearly, I've given you the numbers on certain parts of our apps as the example of ERP and HCM, which are just growing substantively. Larry's comments about Autonomous Database are 2 huge drivers of growth as we go forward. So I think all of those statements, '19 versus '18, second half, first half, '19 to '20 are all where you're going to see acceleration of top line growth in CD."

These are really encouraging early signs for us. And then to the point that you bring up, we just don't get the database, we get analytics, we get other services that come with it.

Some of our customers were stunned that they can get a database up and running in 5 minutes. So we've been collecting references and studying the 1,000 customers and the 4,000 trials, and what they find encouraging about the Autonomous Database. Certainly, we'll call it productivity improvements. The fact that they can go from not having a database, not having a hardware, literally log on to our cloud, create an instance, get -- move their data and be up and running and doing useful things in 5 minutes is proving to be a shock to a lot of our customers. So getting things up and running quickly. Productivity has been a very big issue. We've got 1 customer who's done a series of tests. They were an AWS user, and I know we have these ads that promise cut your AWS bill in half. They found that we were running 11.5x faster than they were running in AWS, and they cut their bill by 80%. So a lot -- so that's -- and these are university researchers, so they're very, very cost sensitive and they felt it was worthwhile making the move just because we were much less expensive. Autonomous Database was way less expensive than Redshift or Aurora at Amazon. Some people, they had an existing data warehouse and it was just the compatibility, being able to take an existing data warehouse, not spooling up a new one in 5 minutes, but taking an existing data warehouse, lifting it and shifting it over. So we're seeing all 3 of those use cases. Productivity -- motivators, I should say. Productivity, compatibility and cost, all driving the usage of Autonomous Database."

I mean it's not like we're talking about partitioning or something like that. When you talk about the fact that this database patches itself, our customers at the CEO level now understand what a patch is. They understand why it's so important, why it's so strategic. They, in many cases, have to discuss it with their audit committees. And the fact that now patching goes from a problem to where they pass that to us and it gets done instantaneously, we have many customers who said, if this thing did nothing but that, I would migrate to Autonomous Database. If the fact that -- you add to the fact to Larry's point that this database tunes itself, creates all its own index, is it actually it's labor less and can you reapply talent to another area. If it did nothing but that, it would be valuable. If it did nothing but give you better security and give you price and performance, and so this is a release that the reason you're seeing the trials and the level why you hear our enthusiasm the way it is, is the customer response is just extremely high because it just makes business sense. This isn't something sold 5 levels down or 4 levels down in the order. This can be sold at the top of the company, if you will, at the CEO level. So it's why it's such an exciting release test because at this point it has so many business benefits to our customers as opposed to maybe the fact that you would think of traditionally many of our benefits being, if you will, technical. It's different explaining to a CEO what multitenant is and what in-memory is than frankly the benefits I've just described."

The researchers that I mentioned earlier that are moving from AWS for big cost savings, they're doing a combination of machine learning and computer vision to look at tissue samples and detect anomalous cells. Cancer based kit are using computers to diagnose cancer and that's a combination of machine learning and the Autonomous Database. And that's an all-new application. So there are several people that are coming in with all-new applications in the cloud. Especially the ones moving from AWS. Then there are traditional on-premise customers, who are simply taking one of their millions of Oracle databases, there are millions of these things out there and just lifting one of those databases either transaction processing and the associated application, either transaction processing application or a data warehousing application, just lifting it intact, moving the data over and moving the application over to compute, moving the data over to Autonomous Database, and running the same exact thing in the cloud. They're experiencing, sometimes shocking performance improvements also. I know we had 1 customer that moved from on-premise into the cloud and the cloud system ran many times faster than their on-premise system. Then there are customers that are moving new -- existing big Oracle customers that are moving new developments. The new applications that they're developing from developing them on-premise, they move test and development into the cloud. And they are the ones that, again, the general reaction there is they're much, much more productive getting running. It's much cheaper to do test and development, much more responsive, much more productive to move test and development from their on-premise infrastructure to the cloud infrastructure. So online transaction and processing, lifting and shifting applications, data warehousing lifting and shifting, test and development, moving from AWS, there are lots of different use cases."

So we've got a lot of underpinning improving dynamics -- in my opinion, they're improving dynamics, in terms of net new customers in addition to moving of our database and certainly, analytical data warehousing is probably the biggest individual driver of anything we've got."

And those 2 vendors together have less than 50% of the market. We have more Fortune 500 customers, for example. They have many big customers, but the blizzard of implementations -- or there's a blizzard of companies that have the more than 50% market share, 54%, 55%, most of them have moved into private equity. They're not even public companies. They're on their second or third turn through private equity. They've got no migration plan to the cloud. They've got 2G -- I could go on and on with all of these. And that's why as I mentioned earlier, we actually line up our development resources and our sales resources, very focused on these competitors. They would have names like, I mentioned a couple, like McCormack & Dodge, if you've heard of them. IBM, believe it or not, actually has got an old ERP system. There's a company called Deltek, I mean, there's a company called Lawson, a company called [ ETHICA ], there's tens and tens of these to your point, and these are old, old pieces of code. These need to move. They need to move to a more modern platform and they are, perhaps, as attractive as any other market. And in fairness, our user base actually knows our cloud road map. They actually have confidence in our R&D. They know we're going to be there to migrate them when they want to be there. They actually have less of a sense of urgency, in many cases, to move than the companies you're describing, Brad, because they're in much more desperate situations without a road map, without knowing how they're going to get from here to there, knowing their competitors are beginning to move. So we have as much success today, and if you ask one of our salespeople, would you rather have one of these competitive territories where you're going after one of these niche vendors, or would you rather have an E-Business Suite territory, many of our salespeople say, ""Give me that competitive territory,"" because there's an absolute need to move as quick as you can. So yes, it's an incredibly attractive market and it's why you hear us keep talking about it so much because the additional fact is when we sell ERP, we continue to see an attach rate to HCM, and, frankly, an attach rate to even some of our other apps in the CX and front office area as well, so it's why we're so focused on that opportunity."

I'll first go over Q3 results before moving on to guidance. I'll then turn the call over to Mark and Larry. As in prior quarters, I'll review our non-GAAP results using constant dollar growth rates, unless I say othe",771,"Thanks, Ken. Good afternoon, everyone. I'll first go over Q3 results before moving on to guidance. I'll then turn the call over to Mark and Larry. As in prior quarters, I'll review our non-GAAP results using constant dollar growth rates, unless I say otherwise.
Total Cloud Services and License Support revenue for the quarter was $6.7 billion, up 4% in constant currency, and now accounts for nearly 70% of total company revenue, largely recurring revenue. As in past quarters, we are seeing robust double-digit growth rates for total cloud revenue in all regions, with especially strong growth in Asia Pacific.
In terms of product categories, ERP grew in the mid-30s and the verticals grew in the high 30s. Our software business, which is the totaling of Cloud Services and License Support revenue with Cloud License and On-Premise License revenue, is 82% of total revenue and it grew 3% in constant currency.
Our software business has remained extremely stable and resilient as we have made the transition to faster-growing SaaS business that entailed trading nonrecurring upfront license revenue for recurrent long-term subscription revenue.
Through adoption of autonomous database and OCI, we're now shifting the focus for our infrastructure business to the cloud. As a percentage of our total software business, cloud is now more than double what it was just 3 years ago and provides us with the ability to accelerate overall software revenue growth as this mix shift continues.
GAAP applications total revenue were $2.8 billion, up 7%, and GAAP infrastructure total revenue were $5.1 billion, up 2%. The gross margin for Cloud Services and License Support was 86%, essentially the same as last year with continuing improvement in SaaS gross margins, stability in software support gross margins and continued investment in Oracle cloud infrastructure. Once our cloud business is at scale, I expect our gross margins will go significantly higher.
Total revenue for the quarter was $9.6 billion, up 3% from last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $4.3 billion, up 5% from last year, and the operating margin was 44%, up from 43% last year.
This quarter last year was greatly impacted by the change in the U.S. tax book, so comparing the GAAP numbers is not very meaningful after pretax income. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 20%, up from 16% catch-up rate last year, and non-GAAP EPS was $0.87 in USD, and up 12% in constant currency. This quarter, the GAAP tax rate was 11% and GAAP EPS was $0.76.
Operating cash flow over the last 4 quarters is $14.8 billion. Over the last 4 quarters, capital expenditures were $1.6 billion and free cash flow was $13.2 billion, down 1% due to timing differences of tax payments and working capital items.
We have more than $40 billion in cash and marketable securities. The short-term deferred revenue balance is $8 billion, up 5% in constant currency. The remaining performance obligations, or what I'll refer to as contract backlog, will be in the Q, and is now $31.5 billion, of which approximately 62% will be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months.
Since we remain committed to returning value to shareholders through acquisitions, internal investments and a return of capital with stock repurchases and dividends, this quarter, we repurchased 206 million shares for a total of $10 billion. Over the last 12 months, we repurchased 728 million shares and reduced the absolute shares outstanding by nearly 16%. And the Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend 26% from $0.19 to $0.24 per share.
Turning to currency. I expect the strengthening U.S. dollar will continue with a currency headwind of 3% for Q4 revenue and a $0.03 headwind to earnings per share.
Okay, so with that, let me turn to the guidance. So for Q4, total revenues are expected to grow 1% to 3% in constant currency and 0 to negative 2% in U.S. dollars. Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to grow between 15% to 19%, and be between $1.08 and $1.12 in constant currency, so we will deliver double-digit non-GAAP EPS growth for fiscal year 2019.
Taking into account the $0.03 currency headwind, non-GAAP EPS for Q4 in USD is expected to grow between 12% and 16%, and be between $1.05 and $1.09 in USD.
My EPS guidance assumes a base tax rate of 20%. However, onetime tax events could cause actual tax rates for any given quarter to vary from our base tax rate. But I expect that in normalizing for onetime tax events, our tax rate will average around 20%.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mark for his comments."

Thanks. Solid quarter for us, from top to bottom. Total revenue was up 3% in constant currency with Cloud Services and License Support, up 4% and EPS 12% -- plus 12% in constant currency.
In our apps ecosystem, we continued our momentum, growing at 7%, and that was an acceleration for us, and over $11 billion in trailing 12-months revenue and 92% of that is now recurring. We continue to grow revenue faster than market, and we have an enormous opportunity ahead of us in ERP and HCM.
In terms of SaaS revenue and bookings, Fusion apps were up 35%. By the way, our overall ERP and HCM annualized SaaS revenue is now $2.8 billion, and that's up in the mid-20s. Again, Fusion apps, 35% up, Fusion ERP where revenue was up 47% organically. NetSuite revenue was up 28%. Bookings were up actually even higher in the mid-30s.
Our vertical revenue was up 38%, and our annualized revenue in the verticals is now over $800 million.
I'm going to read you a quick quote from IDC, and I have to read it precisely or I'll get cards and letters. So let me just make sure I do this exactly as it's written.
""Per IDC's latest annual market share results, Oracle is the #1 enterprise applications vendor in North America based on market share and revenue, surpassing Salesforce.com and SAP."" We've seen this momentum building, so this is not any surprise to us, so I think it's always better when you can see it in real numbers from somebody other than us.
Let me switch briefly to infrastructure. Our GAAP tech ecosystem is $21 billion on a trailing 12-months basis and Q3 was up 2%. In Autonomous Database, our momentum continues to build. We now have 4,000 new trials that were added in Q3 alone, nearly 1,000 paying customers. We're adding many new customers and we're seeing great pull-through and with 20% of our autonomous data warehouse trials also using analytics. We now have over 35 referenceable customers and we expect to be greater than 100 soon.
Cloud customer revenue was up triple digits for the fourth consecutive quarter. So overall, a solid quarter, as we hit our revenue targets and saw a 12% EPS growth. The strength of our bookings growth along with climbing renewal rates gives me the confidence that our cloud apps business is only going to strengthen from here and going forward, given the visibility we have into the revenue backlog, which Safra touched on a bit earlier.
Looking forward, I do expect FY '20 revenue growth will be higher than FY '19. And EPS this year will be certainly -- grow double digits, as Safra mentioned. 
I'm going to give you a few customer wins as well, try to give you a flavor for what happened in the quarter for us. Now most of these didn't affect our revenue, most of these, obviously are, all really bookings that occurred in the quarter, but I thought I'd give you some context about some people in our user base as well as outside our user base. 
So for example, Tromp Group in the Netherlands E-Business Suite migration; MasterBrand Cabinets in the U.S. in E-Business Suite migration; thyssenkrupp in Germany in E-Business Suite migration; Willis Towers Watson E-Business Suite migration. I gave you those, just a few of those examples. Those are core, sort of, E-Business Suite, Black & Veatch was another one, engineering company, core, sort of, E-Business Suite customers as we see this acceleration of our user base move into the cloud. Got a couple PeopleSoft ERP migrations, Amica Mutual in the quarter, Depaul University. And then a slew of wins again. And I referenced that a lot of the ERP user base that's out there today is outside of our user base or even our traditional on-premise competitor from, if you will, the old days.
ON semiconductor, nice win in the quarter. Packaging Corporation of America, again, outside of our user base for the quarter.  Eaton, another manufacturer. Atradius Crédito in the Netherlands. I could go on, which, in the sake of time, I won't, although I'll mention Ashford Hospitality. These are, again, outside our user base that are brand-new customers to Oracle in the area of ERP.
In HCM, Abu Dhabi Airports; ADT; Alorica; Banco Davivienda; BLOM BANK; Great Canadian Gaming. We had a really nice win in a company called DeNova Healthcare. This again was not inside our user base. These were attritional Lawson customer, where we actually get multipillar ERP back-office and HCM connected together.
So anyway, I'll stop there in the sake of time, but just a really, again, very impressive set of customers and a good mix of net new logos as well as movement from our user base. We had a pretty good quarter and it was some really quality names on the platform side. Fair Isaac, Generali shared services in Italy; JOANN Stores; Trans -- Trenitalia; Unicorp, I mean, some really nice beginnings of what you're seeing as we move toward gen 2 cloud and Autonomous Database. 
I did want to make a couple of quick comments on our growing relationship with The Gap. So it's a global retailer as, I think, most of you know, with revenue of greater than $16 billion, and we've been working with The Gap in their transformation to what's really a multi-cloud environment but using many, many Oracle Technologies, and they include really everything we got: SaaS, PaaS, delivering innovation, reliability and scalability at every turn. And as part of even the things they're using in the private cloud, those are all really enabled by Exadata, and we're really thrilled to be Gap's strategic partner in their efforts to spin up their new retail brands and stores faster.
And so that's the few quick wins for the quarter. So overall, good solid quarter for us on the income statement side, but also in the quality of these bookings that we're describing or that I've been describing. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry."

Oracle's future rests on 2 strategic businesses: cloud applications and Cloud Infrastructure. The growth in our cloud applications business has been driven by our Fusion Suite and NetSuite.
Both the Fusion Suite of applications and NetSuite are growing very, very rapidly, and Mark gave you the numbers. As the names imply, both Fusion and NetSuite are integrated suites of applications, including sales, service, human resources, financials, supply chain and manufacturing applications. No other cloud services provider has such a comprehensive suite of applications covering both the front office and the back office.
Most customers want their cloud services provider to make their applications work together. Customers do not like to be responsible for the complex process of integrating lots of different applications, running on lots of different vendors' clouds. We think our integrated suite approach to the cloud applications business is a primary reason for the very rapid growth in our cloud applications market share.
The introduction of our Gen 2, highly secure infrastructure, featuring the Oracle Autonomous Database has been very well received. During Q3, we had nearly 1,000 paying Autonomous Database customers and over 4,000 active trials. Our infrastructure technology is highly differentiated from AWS. Each one of our cloud computers has a separate security processor and memory to insulate customers from intruding upon each other. And it also makes our cloud control code inaccessible by customers. No other cloud services provider offers this kind of protection across their entire public cloud. 
The Oracle Autonomous Database is the only database that can respond to a security threat by automatically patching itself while it's still running your application. No downtime is required. No other database has this capability.
Oracle Technology leadership in cloud infrastructure and database plus our market leadership in cloud applications makes us very optimistic about our future.
I'll turn it back to you, operator."

Second half is, whatever adjective is around it, grow faster than first half. FY '20, faster than '19. When you get in underneath at what are the drivers, at a big level, first, our growing businesses are becoming a bigger part of our total than our other businesses. So as an example, just one example, cloud ERP gets bigger, hardware gets smaller, obviously, those have offsetting effects. In addition, we have the things that attach with that, for example, our consulting services business now in on-premise has been declining, but our cloud consulting is inclining as does our overall bookings. So as a result, these just offset each other. Within it, clearly, I've given you the numbers on certain parts of our apps as the example of ERP and HCM, which are just growing substantively. Larry's comments about Autonomous Database are 2 huge drivers of growth as we go forward. So I think all of those statements, '19 versus '18, second half, first half, '19 to '20 are all where you're going to see acceleration of top line growth in CD."

Some of our customers were stunned that they can get a database up and running in 5 minutes. So we've been collecting references and studying the 1,000 customers and the 4,000 trials, and what they find encouraging about the Autonomous Database. Certainly, we'll call it productivity improvements. The fact that they can go from not having a database, not having a hardware, literally log on to our cloud, create an instance, get -- move their data and be up and running and doing useful things in 5 minutes is proving to be a shock to a lot of our customers. So getting things up and running quickly. Productivity has been a very big issue. We've got 1 customer who's done a series of tests. They were an AWS user, and I know we have these ads that promise cut your AWS bill in half. They found that we were running 11.5x faster than they were running in AWS, and they cut their bill by 80%. So a lot -- so that's -- and these are university researchers, so they're very, very cost sensitive and they felt it was worthwhile making the move just because we were much less expensive. Autonomous Database was way less expensive than Redshift or Aurora at Amazon. Some people, they had an existing data warehouse and it was just the compatibility, being able to take an existing data warehouse, not spooling up a new one in 5 minutes, but taking an existing data warehouse, lifting it and shifting it over. So we're seeing all 3 of those use cases. Productivity -- motivators, I should say. Productivity, compatibility and cost, all driving the usage of Autonomous Database."

When you talk about the fact that this database patches itself, our customers at the CEO level now understand what a patch is. They understand why it's so important, why it's so strategic. They, in many cases, have to discuss it with their audit committees. And the fact that now patching goes from a problem to where they pass that to us and it gets done instantaneously, we have many customers who said, if this thing did nothing but that, I would migrate to Autonomous Database. If the fact that -- you add to the fact to Larry's point that this database tunes itself, creates all its own index, is it actually it's labor less and can you reapply talent to another area. If it did nothing but that, it would be valuable. If it did nothing but give you better security and give you price and performance, and so this is a release that the reason you're seeing the trials and the level why you hear our enthusiasm the way it is, is the customer response is just extremely high because it just makes business sense. This isn't something sold 5 levels down or 4 levels down in the order. This can be sold at the top of the company, if you will, at the CEO level. So it's why it's such an exciting release test because at this point it has so many business benefits to our customers as opposed to maybe the fact that you would think of traditionally many of our benefits being, if you will, technical.

So there are several people that are coming in with all-new applications in the cloud. Especially the ones moving from AWS. Then there are traditional on-premise customers, who are simply taking one of their millions of Oracle databases, there are millions of these things out there and just lifting one of those databases either transaction processing and the associated application, either transaction processing application or a data warehousing application, just lifting it intact, moving the data over and moving the application over to compute, moving the data over to Autonomous Database, and running the same exact thing in the cloud. They're experiencing, sometimes shocking performance improvements also. I know we had 1 customer that moved from on-premise into the cloud and the cloud system ran many times faster than their on-premise system. Then there are customers that are moving new -- existing big Oracle customers that are moving new developments. The new applications that they're developing from developing them on-premise, they move test and development into the cloud. And they are the ones that, again, the general reaction there is they're much, much more productive getting running. It's much cheaper to do test and development, much more responsive, much more productive to move test and development from their on-premise infrastructure to the cloud infrastructure. So online transaction and processing, lifting and shifting applications, data warehousing lifting and shifting, test and development, moving from AWS, there are lots of different use cases."

And 80% are in our user base, roughly 70%, 75%, there's net no competition at all and the transaction is simply, as Larry described, a migration. 75% are actually into the LOB as opposed to IT, which I look at is very good news as well. So we've got a lot of underpinning improving dynamics -- in my opinion, they're improving dynamics, in terms of net new customers in addition to moving of our database and certainly, analytical data warehousing is probably the biggest individual driver of anything we've got."

And those 2 vendors together have less than 50% of the market. We have more Fortune 500 customers, for example. They have many big customers, but the blizzard of implementations -- or there's a blizzard of companies that have the more than 50% market share, 54%, 55%, most of them have moved into private equity. They're not even public companies. They're on their second or third turn through private equity. They've got no migration plan to the cloud. They've got 2G -- I could go on and on with all of these. And that's why as I mentioned earlier, we actually line up our development resources and our sales resources, very focused on these competitors. They would have names like, I mentioned a couple, like McCormack & Dodge, if you've heard of them. IBM, believe it or not, actually has got an old ERP system. There's a company called Deltek, I mean, there's a company called Lawson, a company called [ ETHICA ], there's tens and tens of these to your point, and these are old, old pieces of code. These need to move. They need to move to a more modern platform and they are, perhaps, as attractive as any other market. And in fairness, our user base actually knows our cloud road map. They actually have confidence in our R&D. They know we're going to be there to migrate them when they want to be there. They actually have less of a sense of urgency, in many cases, to move than the companies you're describing, Brad, because they're in much more desperate situations without a road map, without knowing how they're going to get from here to there, knowing their competitors are beginning to move. So we have as much success today, and if you ask one of our salespeople, would you rather have one of these competitive territories where you're going after one of these niche vendors, or would you rather have an E-Business Suite territory, many of our salespeople say, ""Give me that competitive territory,"" because there's an absolute need to move as quick as you can. So yes, it's an incredibly attractive market and it's why you hear us keep talking about it so much because the additional fact is when we sell ERP, we continue to see an attach rate to HCM, and, frankly, an attach rate to even some of our other apps in the CX and front office area as well, so it's why we're so focused on that opportunity."

I'll first go over Q3 results before moving on to guidance. I'll then turn the call over to Mark and Larry. As in prior quarters, I'll review our non-GAAP results using constant dollar growth rates, unless I say othe",771,"Thanks, Ken. Good afternoon, everyone. I'll first go over Q3 results before moving on to guidance. I'll then turn the call over to Mark and Larry. As in prior quarters, I'll review our non-GAAP results using constant dollar growth rates, unless I say otherwise.
Total Cloud Services and License Support revenue for the quarter was $6.7 billion, up 4% in constant currency, and now accounts for nearly 70% of total company revenue, largely recurring revenue. As in past quarters, we are seeing robust double-digit growth rates for total cloud revenue in all regions, with especially strong growth in Asia Pacific.
In terms of product categories, ERP grew in the mid-30s and the verticals grew in the high 30s. Our software business, which is the totaling of Cloud Services and License Support revenue with Cloud License and On-Premise License revenue, is 82% of total revenue and it grew 3% in constant currency.
Our software business has remained extremely stable and resilient as we have made the transition to faster-growing SaaS business that entailed trading nonrecurring upfront license revenue for recurrent long-term subscription revenue.
Through adoption of autonomous database and OCI, we're now shifting the focus for our infrastructure business to the cloud. As a percentage of our total software business, cloud is now more than double what it was just 3 years ago and provides us with the ability to accelerate overall software revenue growth as this mix shift continues.
GAAP applications total revenue were $2.8 billion, up 7%, and GAAP infrastructure total revenue were $5.1 billion, up 2%. The gross margin for Cloud Services and License Support was 86%, essentially the same as last year with continuing improvement in SaaS gross margins, stability in software support gross margins and continued investment in Oracle cloud infrastructure. Once our cloud business is at scale, I expect our gross margins will go significantly higher.
Total revenue for the quarter was $9.6 billion, up 3% from last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $4.3 billion, up 5% from last year, and the operating margin was 44%, up from 43% last year.
This quarter last year was greatly impacted by the change in the U.S. tax book, so comparing the GAAP numbers is not very meaningful after pretax income. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 20%, up from 16% catch-up rate last year, and non-GAAP EPS was $0.87 in USD, and up 12% in constant currency. This quarter, the GAAP tax rate was 11% and GAAP EPS was $0.76.
Operating cash flow over the last 4 quarters is $14.8 billion. Over the last 4 quarters, capital expenditures were $1.6 billion and free cash flow was $13.2 billion, down 1% due to timing differences of tax payments and working capital items.
We have more than $40 billion in cash and marketable securities. The short-term deferred revenue balance is $8 billion, up 5% in constant currency. The remaining performance obligations, or what I'll refer to as contract backlog, will be in the Q, and is now $31.5 billion, of which approximately 62% will be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months.
Since we remain committed to returning value to shareholders through acquisitions, internal investments and a return of capital with stock repurchases and dividends, this quarter, we repurchased 206 million shares for a total of $10 billion. Over the last 12 months, we repurchased 728 million shares and reduced the absolute shares outstanding by nearly 16%. And the Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend 26% from $0.19 to $0.24 per share.
Turning to currency. I expect the strengthening U.S. dollar will continue with a currency headwind of 3% for Q4 revenue and a $0.03 headwind to earnings per share.
Okay, so with that, let me turn to the guidance. So for Q4, total revenues are expected to grow 1% to 3% in constant currency and 0 to negative 2% in U.S. dollars. Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to grow between 15% to 19%, and be between $1.08 and $1.12 in constant currency, so we will deliver double-digit non-GAAP EPS growth for fiscal year 2019.
Taking into account the $0.03 currency headwind, non-GAAP EPS for Q4 in USD is expected to grow between 12% and 16%, and be between $1.05 and $1.09 in USD.
My EPS guidance assumes a base tax rate of 20%. However, onetime tax events could cause actual tax rates for any given quarter to vary from our base tax rate. But I expect that in normalizing for onetime tax events, our tax rate will average around 20%.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mark for his comments."

Thanks. Solid quarter for us, from top to bottom. Total revenue was up 3% in constant currency with Cloud Services and License Support, up 4% and EPS 12% -- plus 12% in constant currency.
In our apps ecosystem, we continued our momentum, growing at 7%, and that was an acceleration for us, and over $11 billion in trailing 12-months revenue and 92% of that is now recurring. We continue to grow revenue faster than market, and we have an enormous opportunity ahead of us in ERP and HCM.
In terms of SaaS revenue and bookings, Fusion apps were up 35%. By the way, our overall ERP and HCM annualized SaaS revenue is now $2.8 billion, and that's up in the mid-20s. Again, Fusion apps, 35% up, Fusion ERP where revenue was up 47% organically. NetSuite revenue was up 28%. Bookings were up actually even higher in the mid-30s.
Our vertical revenue was up 38%, and our annualized revenue in the verticals is now over $800 million.
I'm going to read you a quick quote from IDC, and I have to read it precisely or I'll get cards and letters. So let me just make sure I do this exactly as it's written.
""Per IDC's latest annual market share results, Oracle is the #1 enterprise applications vendor in North America based on market share and revenue, surpassing Salesforce.com and SAP."" We've seen this momentum building, so this is not any surprise to us, so I think it's always better when you can see it in real numbers from somebody other than us.
Let me switch briefly to infrastructure. Our GAAP tech ecosystem is $21 billion on a trailing 12-months basis and Q3 was up 2%. In Autonomous Database, our momentum continues to build. We now have 4,000 new trials that were added in Q3 alone, nearly 1,000 paying customers. We're adding many new customers and we're seeing great pull-through and with 20% of our autonomous data warehouse trials also using analytics. We now have over 35 referenceable customers and we expect to be greater than 100 soon.
Cloud customer revenue was up triple digits for the fourth consecutive quarter. So overall, a solid quarter, as we hit our revenue targets and saw a 12% EPS growth. The strength of our bookings growth along with climbing renewal rates gives me the confidence that our cloud apps business is only going to strengthen from here and going forward, given the visibility we have into the revenue backlog, which Safra touched on a bit earlier.
Looking forward, I do expect FY '20 revenue growth will be higher than FY '19. And EPS this year will be certainly -- grow double digits, as Safra mentioned. 
I'm going to give you a few customer wins as well, try to give you a flavor for what happened in the quarter for us. Now most of these didn't affect our revenue, most of these, obviously are, all really bookings that occurred in the quarter, but I thought I'd give you some context about some people in our user base as well as outside our user base. 
So for example, Tromp Group in the Netherlands E-Business Suite migration; MasterBrand Cabinets in the U.S. in E-Business Suite migration; thyssenkrupp in Germany in E-Business Suite migration; Willis Towers Watson E-Business Suite migration. I gave you those, just a few of those examples. Those are core, sort of, E-Business Suite, Black & Veatch was another one, engineering company, core, sort of, E-Business Suite customers as we see this acceleration of our user base move into the cloud. Got a couple PeopleSoft ERP migrations, Amica Mutual in the quarter, Depaul University. And then a slew of wins again. And I referenced that a lot of the ERP user base that's out there today is outside of our user base or even our traditional on-premise competitor from, if you will, the old days.
ON semiconductor, nice win in the quarter. Packaging Corporation of America, again, outside of our user base for the quarter.  Eaton, another manufacturer. Atradius Crédito in the Netherlands. I could go on, which, in the sake of time, I won't, although I'll mention Ashford Hospitality. These are, again, outside our user base that are brand-new customers to Oracle in the area of ERP.
In HCM, Abu Dhabi Airports; ADT; Alorica; Banco Davivienda; BLOM BANK; Great Canadian Gaming. We had a really nice win in a company called DeNova Healthcare. This again was not inside our user base. These were attritional Lawson customer, where we actually get multipillar ERP back-office and HCM connected together.
So anyway, I'll stop there in the sake of time, but just a really, again, very impressive set of customers and a good mix of net new logos as well as movement from our user base. We had a pretty good quarter and it was some really quality names on the platform side. Fair Isaac, Generali shared services in Italy; JOANN Stores; Trans -- Trenitalia; Unicorp, I mean, some really nice beginnings of what you're seeing as we move toward gen 2 cloud and Autonomous Database. 
I did want to make a couple of quick comments on our growing relationship with The Gap. So it's a global retailer as, I think, most of you know, with revenue of greater than $16 billion, and we've been working with The Gap in their transformation to what's really a multi-cloud environment but using many, many Oracle Technologies, and they include really everything we got: SaaS, PaaS, delivering innovation, reliability and scalability at every turn. And as part of even the things they're using in the private cloud, those are all really enabled by Exadata, and we're really thrilled to be Gap's strategic partner in their efforts to spin up their new retail brands and stores faster.
And so that's the few quick wins for the quarter. So overall, good solid quarter for us on the income statement side, but also in the quality of these bookings that we're describing or that I've been describing. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry."

Oracle's future rests on 2 strategic businesses: cloud applications and Cloud Infrastructure. The growth in our cloud applications business has been driven by our Fusion Suite and NetSuite.
Both the Fusion Suite of applications and NetSuite are growing very, very rapidly, and Mark gave you the numbers. As the names imply, both Fusion and NetSuite are integrated suites of applications, including sales, service, human resources, financials, supply chain and manufacturing applications. No other cloud services provider has such a comprehensive suite of applications covering both the front office and the back office.
Most customers want their cloud services provider to make their applications work together. Customers do not like to be responsible for the complex process of integrating lots of different applications, running on lots of different vendors' clouds. We think our integrated suite approach to the cloud applications business is a primary reason for the very rapid growth in our cloud applications market share.
The introduction of our Gen 2, highly secure infrastructure, featuring the Oracle Autonomous Database has been very well received. During Q3, we had nearly 1,000 paying Autonomous Database customers and over 4,000 active trials. Our infrastructure technology is highly differentiated from AWS. Each one of our cloud computers has a separate security processor and memory to insulate customers from intruding upon each other. And it also makes our cloud control code inaccessible by customers. No other cloud services provider offers this kind of protection across their entire public cloud. 
The Oracle Autonomous Database is the only database that can respond to a security threat by automatically patching itself while it's still running your application. No downtime is required. No other database has this capability.
Oracle Technology leadership in cloud infrastructure and database plus our market leadership in cloud applications makes us very optimistic about our future.
I'll turn it back to you, operator."

And I also wanted to ask about fiscal '20, which you've just mentioned that fiscal '20 constant-currency revenue growth would be higher than fiscal '19. I guess what I'm wondering is should we be thinking that, that constant currency growth acceleration that you're referring to for fiscal '20 is similar to the type of acceleration on the second half of fiscal '19?

When you get in underneath at what are the drivers, at a big level, first, our growing businesses are becoming a bigger part of our total than our other businesses. So as an example, just one example, cloud ERP gets bigger, hardware gets smaller, obviously, those have offsetting effects. In addition, we have the things that attach with that, for example, our consulting services business now in on-premise has been declining, but our cloud consulting is inclining as does our overall bookings. So as a result, these just offset each other. Within it, clearly, I've given you the numbers on certain parts of our apps as the example of ERP and HCM, which are just growing substantively. Larry's comments about Autonomous Database are 2 huge drivers of growth as we go forward. So I think all of those statements, '19 versus '18, second half, first half, '19 to '20 are all where you're going to see acceleration of top line growth in CD."

Some of our customers were stunned that they can get a database up and running in 5 minutes. So we've been collecting references and studying the 1,000 customers and the 4,000 trials, and what they find encouraging about the Autonomous Database. Certainly, we'll call it productivity improvements. The fact that they can go from not having a database, not having a hardware, literally log on to our cloud, create an instance, get -- move their data and be up and running and doing useful things in 5 minutes is proving to be a shock to a lot of our customers. So getting things up and running quickly. Productivity has been a very big issue. We've got 1 customer who's done a series of tests. They were an AWS user, and I know we have these ads that promise cut your AWS bill in half. They found that we were running 11.5x faster than they were running in AWS, and they cut their bill by 80%. So a lot -- so that's -- and these are university researchers, so they're very, very cost sensitive and they felt it was worthwhile making the move just because we were much less expensive. Autonomous Database was way less expensive than Redshift or Aurora at Amazon. Some people, they had an existing data warehouse and it was just the compatibility, being able to take an existing data warehouse, not spooling up a new one in 5 minutes, but taking an existing data warehouse, lifting it and shifting it over. So we're seeing all 3 of those use cases. Productivity -- motivators, I should say. Productivity, compatibility and cost, all driving the usage of Autonomous Database."

I mean it's not like we're talking about partitioning or something like that. When you talk about the fact that this database patches itself, our customers at the CEO level now understand what a patch is. They understand why it's so important, why it's so strategic. They, in many cases, have to discuss it with their audit committees. And the fact that now patching goes from a problem to where they pass that to us and it gets done instantaneously, we have many customers who said, if this thing did nothing but that, I would migrate to Autonomous Database. If the fact that -- you add to the fact to Larry's point that this database tunes itself, creates all its own index, is it actually it's labor less and can you reapply talent to another area. If it did nothing but that, it would be valuable. If it did nothing but give you better security and give you price and performance, and so this is a release that the reason you're seeing the trials and the level why you hear our enthusiasm the way it is, is the customer response is just extremely high because it just makes business sense. This isn't something sold 5 levels down or 4 levels down in the order. This can be sold at the top of the company, if you will, at the CEO level. So it's why it's such an exciting release test because at this point it has so many business benefits to our customers as opposed to maybe the fact that you would think of traditionally many of our benefits being, if you will, technical. It's different explaining to a CEO what multitenant is and what in-memory is than frankly the benefits I've just described."

The researchers that I mentioned earlier that are moving from AWS for big cost savings, they're doing a combination of machine learning and computer vision to look at tissue samples and detect anomalous cells. Cancer based kit are using computers to diagnose cancer and that's a combination of machine learning and the Autonomous Database. And that's an all-new application. So there are several people that are coming in with all-new applications in the cloud. Especially the ones moving from AWS. Then there are traditional on-premise customers, who are simply taking one of their millions of Oracle databases, there are millions of these things out there and just lifting one of those databases either transaction processing and the associated application, either transaction processing application or a data warehousing application, just lifting it intact, moving the data over and moving the application over to compute, moving the data over to Autonomous Database, and running the same exact thing in the cloud. They're experiencing, sometimes shocking performance improvements also. I know we had 1 customer that moved from on-premise into the cloud and the cloud system ran many times faster than their on-premise system. Then there are customers that are moving new -- existing big Oracle customers that are moving new developments. The new applications that they're developing from developing them on-premise, they move test and development into the cloud. And they are the ones that, again, the general reaction there is they're much, much more productive getting running. It's much cheaper to do test and development, much more responsive, much more productive to move test and development from their on-premise infrastructure to the cloud infrastructure.

And those 2 vendors together have less than 50% of the market. We have more Fortune 500 customers, for example. They have many big customers, but the blizzard of implementations -- or there's a blizzard of companies that have the more than 50% market share, 54%, 55%, most of them have moved into private equity. They're not even public companies. They're on their second or third turn through private equity. They've got no migration plan to the cloud. They've got 2G -- I could go on and on with all of these. And that's why as I mentioned earlier, we actually line up our development resources and our sales resources, very focused on these competitors. They would have names like, I mentioned a couple, like McCormack & Dodge, if you've heard of them. IBM, believe it or not, actually has got an old ERP system. There's a company called Deltek, I mean, there's a company called Lawson, a company called [ ETHICA ], there's tens and tens of these to your point, and these are old, old pieces of code. These need to move. They need to move to a more modern platform and they are, perhaps, as attractive as any other market. And in fairness, our user base actually knows our cloud road map. They actually have confidence in our R&D. They know we're going to be there to migrate them when they want to be there. They actually have less of a sense of urgency, in many cases, to move than the companies you're describing, Brad, because they're in much more desperate situations without a road map, without knowing how they're going to get from here to there, knowing their competitors are beginning to move. So we have as much success today, and if you ask one of our salespeople, would you rather have one of these competitive territories where you're going after one of these niche vendors, or would you rather have an E-Business Suite territory, many of our salespeople say, ""Give me that competitive territory,"" because there's an absolute need to move as quick as you can. So yes, it's an incredibly attractive market and it's why you hear us keep talking about it so much because the additional fact is when we sell ERP, we continue to see an attach rate to HCM, and, frankly, an attach rate to even some of our other apps in the CX and front office area as well, so it's why we're so focused on that opportunity."

I'll first go over Q3 results before moving on to guidance. I'll then turn the call over to Mark and Larry. As in prior quarters, I'll review our non-GAAP results using constant dollar growth rates, unless I say othe",771,"Thanks, Ken. Good afternoon, everyone. I'll first go over Q3 results before moving on to guidance. I'll then turn the call over to Mark and Larry. As in prior quarters, I'll review our non-GAAP results using constant dollar growth rates, unless I say otherwise.
Total Cloud Services and License Support revenue for the quarter was $6.7 billion, up 4% in constant currency, and now accounts for nearly 70% of total company revenue, largely recurring revenue. As in past quarters, we are seeing robust double-digit growth rates for total cloud revenue in all regions, with especially strong growth in Asia Pacific.
In terms of product categories, ERP grew in the mid-30s and the verticals grew in the high 30s. Our software business, which is the totaling of Cloud Services and License Support revenue with Cloud License and On-Premise License revenue, is 82% of total revenue and it grew 3% in constant currency.
Our software business has remained extremely stable and resilient as we have made the transition to faster-growing SaaS business that entailed trading nonrecurring upfront license revenue for recurrent long-term subscription revenue.
Through adoption of autonomous database and OCI, we're now shifting the focus for our infrastructure business to the cloud. As a percentage of our total software business, cloud is now more than double what it was just 3 years ago and provides us with the ability to accelerate overall software revenue growth as this mix shift continues.
GAAP applications total revenue were $2.8 billion, up 7%, and GAAP infrastructure total revenue were $5.1 billion, up 2%. The gross margin for Cloud Services and License Support was 86%, essentially the same as last year with continuing improvement in SaaS gross margins, stability in software support gross margins and continued investment in Oracle cloud infrastructure. Once our cloud business is at scale, I expect our gross margins will go significantly higher.
Total revenue for the quarter was $9.6 billion, up 3% from last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $4.3 billion, up 5% from last year, and the operating margin was 44%, up from 43% last year.
This quarter last year was greatly impacted by the change in the U.S. tax book, so comparing the GAAP numbers is not very meaningful after pretax income. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 20%, up from 16% catch-up rate last year, and non-GAAP EPS was $0.87 in USD, and up 12% in constant currency. This quarter, the GAAP tax rate was 11% and GAAP EPS was $0.76.
Operating cash flow over the last 4 quarters is $14.8 billion. Over the last 4 quarters, capital expenditures were $1.6 billion and free cash flow was $13.2 billion, down 1% due to timing differences of tax payments and working capital items.
We have more than $40 billion in cash and marketable securities. The short-term deferred revenue balance is $8 billion, up 5% in constant currency. The remaining performance obligations, or what I'll refer to as contract backlog, will be in the Q, and is now $31.5 billion, of which approximately 62% will be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months.
Since we remain committed to returning value to shareholders through acquisitions, internal investments and a return of capital with stock repurchases and dividends, this quarter, we repurchased 206 million shares for a total of $10 billion. Over the last 12 months, we repurchased 728 million shares and reduced the absolute shares outstanding by nearly 16%. And the Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend 26% from $0.19 to $0.24 per share.
Turning to currency. I expect the strengthening U.S. dollar will continue with a currency headwind of 3% for Q4 revenue and a $0.03 headwind to earnings per share.
Okay, so with that, let me turn to the guidance. So for Q4, total revenues are expected to grow 1% to 3% in constant currency and 0 to negative 2% in U.S. dollars. Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to grow between 15% to 19%, and be between $1.08 and $1.12 in constant currency, so we will deliver double-digit non-GAAP EPS growth for fiscal year 2019.
Taking into account the $0.03 currency headwind, non-GAAP EPS for Q4 in USD is expected to grow between 12% and 16%, and be between $1.05 and $1.09 in USD.
My EPS guidance assumes a base tax rate of 20%. However, onetime tax events could cause actual tax rates for any given quarter to vary from our base tax rate. But I expect that in normalizing for onetime tax events, our tax rate will average around 20%.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mark for his comments."

Total revenue was up 3% in constant currency with Cloud Services and License Support, up 4% and EPS 12% -- plus 12% in constant currency.In our apps ecosystem, we continued our momentum, g",1014,"Thanks, Safra. Thanks. Solid quarter for us, from top to bottom. Total revenue was up 3% in constant currency with Cloud Services and License Support, up 4% and EPS 12% -- plus 12% in constant currency.
In our apps ecosystem, we continued our momentum, growing at 7% and that was an acceleration for us, and over $11 billion in trailing 12-months revenue and 92% of that is now recurring. We continue to grow revenue faster than market, and we have an enormous opportunity ahead of us in ERP and HCM.
In terms of SaaS revenue and bookings, Fusion apps were up 35%. By the way, our overall ERP and HCM annualized SaaS revenue is now $2.8 billion, and that's up in the mid-20s. Again, Fusion apps, 35% up, Fusion ERP where revenue was up 47% organically. NetSuite revenue was up 28%. Bookings were up actually even higher in the mid-30s.
Our vertical revenue was up 38%, and our annualized revenue in the verticals is now over $800 million.
I'm going to read you a quick quote from IDC, and I have to read it precisely or I'll get cards and letters. So let me just make sure I do this exactly as it's written.
""Per IDC's latest annual market share results, Oracle is the #1 enterprise applications vendor in North America based on market share and revenue, surpassing Salesforce.com and SAP."" We've seen this momentum building, so this is not any surprise to us, so I think it's always better when you can see it in real numbers from somebody other than us.
Let me switch briefly to infrastructure. Our GAAP tech ecosystem is $21 billion on a trailing 12-months basis and Q3 was up 2%. In Autonomous Database, our momentum continues to build. We now have 4,000 new trials that were added in Q3 alone, nearly 1,000 paying customers. We're adding many new customers and we're seeing great pull-through and with 20% of our autonomous data warehouse trials also using analytics. We now have over 35 referenceable customers and we expect to be greater than 100 soon.
Cloud customer revenue was up triple digits for the fourth consecutive quarter. So overall, a solid quarter, as we hit our revenue targets and saw a 12% EPS growth. The strength of our bookings growth along with climbing renewal rates gives me the confidence that our cloud apps business is only going to strengthen from here and going forward, given the visibility we have into the revenue backlog, which Safra touched on a bit earlier.
Looking forward, I do expect FY '20 revenue growth will be higher than FY '19. And EPS this year will be certainly -- grow double digits, as Safra mentioned. 
I'm going to give you a few customer wins as well, try to give you a flavor for what happened in the quarter for us. Now most of these didn't affect our revenue, most of these, obviously are, all really bookings that occurred in the quarter, but I thought I'd give you some context about some people in our user base as well as outside our user base. 
So for example, Tromp Group in the Netherlands E-Business Suite migration; MasterBrand Cabinets in the U.S. in E-Business Suite migration; thyssenkrupp in Germany in E-Business Suite migration; Willis Towers Watson E-Business Suite migration. I gave you those, just a few of those examples. Those are core, sort of, E-Business Suite, Black & Veatch was another one, engineering company, core, sort of, E-Business Suite customers as we see this acceleration of our user base move into the cloud. Got a couple PeopleSoft ERP migrations, Amica Mutual in the quarter, Depaul University. And then a slew of wins again. And I referenced that a lot of the ERP user base that's out there today is outside of our user base or even our traditional on-premise competitor from, if you will, the old days.
ON semiconductor, nice win in the quarter. Packaging Corporation of America, again, outside of our user base for the quarter.  Eaton, another manufacturer. Atradius Crédito in the Netherlands. I could go on, which, in the sake of time, I won't, although I'll mention Ashford Hospitality. These are, again, outside our user base that are brand-new customers to Oracle in the area of ERP.
In HCM, Abu Dhabi Airports; ADT; Alorica; Banco Davivienda; BLOM BANK; Great Canadian Gaming. We had a really nice win in a company called DeNova Healthcare. This again was not inside our user base. These were attritional Lawson customer, where we actually get multipillar ERP back-office and HCM connected together.
So anyway, I'll stop there in the sake of time, but just a really, again, very impressive set of customers and a good mix of net new logos as well as movement from our user base. We had a pretty good quarter and it was some really quality names on the platform side. Fair Isaac, Generali shared services in Italy; JOANN Stores; Trans -- Trenitalia; Unicorp, I mean, some really nice beginnings of what you're seeing as we move toward gen 2 cloud and Autonomous Database. 
I did want to make a couple of quick comments on our growing relationship with The Gap. So it's a global retailer as, I think, most of you know, with revenue of greater than $16 billion, and we've been working with The Gap in their transformation to what's really a multi-cloud environment but using many, many Oracle Technologies, and they include really everything we got: SaaS, PaaS, delivering innovation, reliability and scalability at every turn. And as part of even the things they're using in the private cloud, those are all really enabled by Exadata, and we're really thrilled to be Gap's strategic partner in their efforts to spin up their new retail brands and stores faster.
And so that's the few quick wins for the quarter. So overall, good solid quarter for us on the income statement side, but also in the quality of these bookings that we're describing or that I've been describing. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry."

Oracle's future rests on 2 strategic businesses: cloud applications and Cloud Infrastructure. The growth in our cloud applications business has been driven by our Fusion Suite and NetSuite.
Both the Fusion Suite of applications and NetSuite are growing very, very rapidly, and Mark gave you the numbers. As the names imply, both Fusion and NetSuite are integrated suites of applications, including sales, service, human resources, financials, supply chain and manufacturing applications. No other cloud services provider has such a comprehensive suite of applications covering both the front office and the back office.
Most customers want their cloud services provider to make their applications work together. Customers do not like to be responsible for the complex process of integrating lots of different applications, running on lots of different vendors' clouds. We think our integrated suite approach to the cloud applications business is a primary reason for the very rapid growth in our cloud applications market share.
The introduction of our Gen 2, highly secure infrastructure, featuring the Oracle Autonomous Database has been very well received. During Q3, we had nearly 1,000 paying Autonomous Database customers and over 4,000 active trials. Our infrastructure technology is highly differentiated from AWS. Each one of our cloud computers has a separate security processor and memory to insulate customers from intruding upon each other. And it also makes our cloud control code inaccessible by customers. No other cloud services provider offers this kind of protection across their entire public cloud. 
The Oracle Autonomous Database is the only database that can respond to a security threat by automatically patching itself while it's still running your application. No downtime is required. No other database has this capability.
Oracle Technology leadership in cloud infrastructure and database plus our market leadership in cloud applications makes us very optimistic about our future.
I'll turn it back to you, operator."

Last month, when we were together at our tech conference, you reiterated that fiscal second half '19 sales growth would accelerate on a constant-currency basis versus the first half. And I'm not trying to be nitpicky but I think it doesn't look like it's accelerating much. So I was just wondering if anything changed. And I also wanted to ask about fiscal '20, which you've just mentioned that fiscal '20 constant-currency revenue growth would be higher than fiscal '19. I guess what I'm wondering is should we be thinking that, that constant currency growth acceleration that you're referring to for fiscal '20 is similar to the type of acceleration on the second half of fiscal '19? Or could it be more meaningful?"

Second half is, whatever adjective is around it, grow faster than first half. FY '20, faster than '19. When you get in underneath at what are the drivers, at a big level, first, our growing businesses are becoming a bigger part of our total than our other businesses. So as an example, just one example, cloud ERP gets bigger, hardware gets smaller, obviously, those have offsetting effects. In addition, we have the things that attach with that, for example, our consulting services business now in on-premise has been declining, but our cloud consulting is inclining as does our overall bookings. So as a result, these just offset each other. Within it, clearly, I've given you the numbers on certain parts of our apps as the example of ERP and HCM, which are just growing substantively. Larry's comments about Autonomous Database are 2 huge drivers of growth as we go forward. So I think all of those statements, '19 versus '18, second half, first half, '19 to '20 are all where you're going to see acceleration of top line growth in CD."

The fact that they can go from not having a database, not having a hardware, literally log on to our cloud, create an instance, get -- move their data and be up and running and doing useful things in 5 minutes is proving to be a shock to a lot of our customers. So getting things up and running quickly. Productivity has been a very big issue. We've got 1 customer who's done a series of tests. They were an AWS user, and I know we have these ads that promise cut your AWS bill in half. They found that we were running 11.5x faster than they were running in AWS, and they cut their bill by 80%. So a lot -- so that's -- and these are university researchers, so they're very, very cost sensitive and they felt it was worthwhile making the move just because we were much less expensive. Autonomous Database was way less expensive than Redshift or Aurora at Amazon. Some people, they had an existing data warehouse and it was just the compatibility, being able to take an existing data warehouse, not spooling up a new one in 5 minutes, but taking an existing data warehouse, lifting it and shifting it over. So we're seeing all 3 of those use cases. Productivity -- motivators, I should say. Productivity, compatibility and cost, all driving the usage of Autonomous Database."

I mean it's not like we're talking about partitioning or something like that. When you talk about the fact that this database patches itself, our customers at the CEO level now understand what a patch is. They understand why it's so important, why it's so strategic. They, in many cases, have to discuss it with their audit committees. And the fact that now patching goes from a problem to where they pass that to us and it gets done instantaneously, we have many customers who said, if this thing did nothing but that, I would migrate to Autonomous Database. If the fact that -- you add to the fact to Larry's point that this database tunes itself, creates all its own index, is it actually it's labor less and can you reapply talent to another area. If it did nothing but that, it would be valuable. If it did nothing but give you better security and give you price and performance, and so this is a release that the reason you're seeing the trials and the level why you hear our enthusiasm the way it is, is the customer response is just extremely high because it just makes business sense. This isn't something sold 5 levels down or 4 levels down in the order. This can be sold at the top of the company, if you will, at the CEO level. So it's why it's such an exciting release test because at this point it has so many business benefits to our customers as opposed to maybe the fact that you would think of traditionally many of our benefits being, if you will, technical. It's different explaining to a CEO what multitenant is and what in-memory is than frankly the benefits I've just described."

We've done both to, if you will, localize the product for more countries. We've done many new countries that we've now released. In addition to that, we've been building out more verticals, what we call SuiteSuccess, where we actually bundled in the implementation with what we sell.

The researchers that I mentioned earlier that are moving from AWS for big cost savings, they're doing a combination of machine learning and computer vision to look at tissue samples and detect anomalous cells. Cancer based kit are using computers to diagnose cancer and that's a combination of machine learning and the Autonomous Database. And that's an all-new application. So there are several people that are coming in with all-new applications in the cloud. Especially the ones moving from AWS. Then there are traditional on-premise customers, who are simply taking one of their millions of Oracle databases, there are millions of these things out there and just lifting one of those databases either transaction processing and the associated application, either transaction processing application or a data warehousing application, just lifting it intact, moving the data over and moving the application over to compute, moving the data over to Autonomous Database, and running the same exact thing in the cloud. They're experiencing, sometimes shocking performance improvements also. I know we had 1 customer that moved from on-premise into the cloud and the cloud system ran many times faster than their on-premise system. Then there are customers that are moving new -- existing big Oracle customers that are moving new developments. The new applications that they're developing from developing them on-premise, they move test and development into the cloud. And they are the ones that, again, the general reaction there is they're much, much more productive getting running. It's much cheaper to do test and development, much more responsive, much more productive to move test and development from their on-premise infrastructure to the cloud infrastructure. So online transaction and processing, lifting and shifting applications, data warehousing lifting and shifting, test and development, moving from AWS, there are lots of different use cases."

And those 2 vendors together have less than 50% of the market. We have more Fortune 500 customers, for example. They have many big customers, but the blizzard of implementations -- or there's a blizzard of companies that have the more than 50% market share, 54%, 55%, most of them have moved into private equity. They're not even public companies. They're on their second or third turn through private equity. They've got no migration plan to the cloud. They've got 2G -- I could go on and on with all of these. And that's why as I mentioned earlier, we actually line up our development resources and our sales resources, very focused on these competitors. They would have names like, I mentioned a couple, like McCormack & Dodge, if you've heard of them. IBM, believe it or not, actually has got an old ERP system. There's a company called Deltek, I mean, there's a company called Lawson, a company called [ ETHICA ], there's tens and tens of these to your point, and these are old, old pieces of code. These need to move. They need to move to a more modern platform and they are, perhaps, as attractive as any other market. And in fairness, our user base actually knows our cloud road map. They actually have confidence in our R&D. They know we're going to be there to migrate them when they want to be there. They actually have less of a sense of urgency, in many cases, to move than the companies you're describing, Brad, because they're in much more desperate situations without a road map, without knowing how they're going to get from here to there, knowing their competitors are beginning to move. So we have as much success today, and if you ask one of our salespeople, would you rather have one of these competitive territories where you're going after one of these niche vendors, or would you rather have an E-Business Suite territory, many of our salespeople say, ""Give me that competitive territory,"" because there's an absolute need to move as quick as you can. So yes, it's an incredibly attractive market and it's why you hear us keep talking about it so much because the additional fact is when we sell ERP, we continue to see an attach rate to HCM, and, frankly, an attach rate to even some of our other apps in the CX and front office area as well, so it's why we're so focused on that opportunity."

As in prior quarters, I'll review our non-GAAP results using constant dollar growth rates unless I say otherwise. Now the effects of currency movements in Q4 were largely as expected, maybe a smidge more incremental headwind than expected, but that was not a full percentage more. Anyway, total cloud services and license support revenues for the quarter were $6.8 billion, up 3%, while cloud license and on-premise license revenues were $2.5 billion, up 15%. In particular, technology license growth was up 19%, making it abundantly clear that customers are investing in the Oracle platform. The key database options necessary to run the Oracle Autonomous Database service grew 21%. I cannot stress enough the stability and growth of our base of customers quarter-after-quarter.

And in our BYOL, bring your own license model, they have the portability to use their licenses on-premise, in the cloud or via hybrid environment. This popularity is largely because our products are capable of doing things others just can't do, whether it's security, performance or scalability and in our cloud, autonomous capabilities. As our customers adopt our technologies, whether via licenses or cloud services, our overall customer base is growing and that growth is starting to accelerate. 
In addition, the recent interconnect agreement with Microsoft will only help accelerate the transition from on-premise database to the Autonomous Database service. 
Now to the numbers. The gross margin for cloud services and license support was 86%. And as we continue to scale and grow, I expect this will go even higher. Total revenues for the quarter were $11.1 billion, up 4% from last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $5.3 billion, up 7% from last year and the operating margin was 47%, which was up from 46% last year. The non-GAAP tax rates for the quarter was at 16.4%, slightly below our base tax rate of 20% as a result of some discrete items and EPS was $1.16 in U.S. dollars and up 27% in constant currency and 23% in USD. 
The GAAP tax rate was 3.3%, also a result of some discrete items and GAAP EPS was $1.07 in U.S. dollars and up 41% in constant currency, 36% in U.S. dollars. 
Now moving on to recap the full fiscal year, total cloud services and license support revenue was $26.7 billion, growing 4%. Total company revenues for the year was $39.5 billion, growing 3% compared to 2% total revenue growth in FY '18. Non-GAAP EPS was USD 3.52, up 19% in constant currency, up 16% in U.S. dollars, driven by operating income growth, share repurchases and lower tax rate. This is mirrored in our operating margin percentage for the full year, which was up slightly to 44% this year. 
As a reminder, our best ever full year operating margin was 47% and I expect we will surpass that in the coming years as our total revenue growth accelerates and we benefit from greater scale in our business. Operating cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $14.6 billion, lower than last year, only because, as you will see at the bottom of our cash flow statement in the 10-K, FY '19 cash tax payments were $1.3 billion higher this year, including the $610 million installement towords the transition tax in Q2 and nearly $540 million in higher tax payments in Q4. 
Capital expenditures for the year were $1.7 billion and free cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $12.9 billion. We now have approximately $38 billion in cash and marketable securities. The short-term deferred revenue balance is $8.4 billion, up 3% in constant currency. 
As we said before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisition, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and the dividend. This quarter, we repurchased 112 million shares for a total of $6 billion. Over the last 12 months, we have repurchased 734 million shares for a total of $36 billion. Over the last 5 years, we have reduced the shares outstanding by almost 25% with nearly 60% of the total reduction this past year in FY '19. 
In addition, we've paid out dividends of $2.9 billion over the last 12 months and the Board of Directors again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.24 per share. 
Now to the guidance. My guidance today is a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency. Assuming being current exchange rates remain the same as they are now, currency should have about a 1% negative effect on total revenues and about $0.01 negative effect on EPS. So for Q1, total revenues are expected to grow between 1% to 3% in constant currency and assuming a 1% currency headwind, total revenues are expected to grow between 0% and 2% in USD. 
Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to grow between 14% to 16% and be between $0.81 and $0.83 in constant currency. And assuming the $0.01 headwind, non-GAAP EPS in USD is expected to grow between 12% and 14% and be between $0.80 and $0.82 in USD. 
Now this past year, we grew 3% and for fiscal year 2020, I expect total revenue will grow faster than last year constant currency, of course, and that we will once again reported double-digit EPS growth. Total CapEx for fiscal year '20 is expected to be about $2.2 billion, but it could move a little depending on our bookings. My EPS guidance for Q1 and fiscal year '20 assumes a base rate of 20%. However, onetime tax events could cause actual tax rates for any given quarter to vary from our base both higher or lower, but I expect that in normalizing for these onetime tax event, our tax rate will average around 20% for fiscal year 2020. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Mark for his comments."

Total revenue was up 4% in constant currency with cloud license and support up 3% and EPS up 27% in constant currency. 
In apps, we had great momentum. We grew 6% for the year. We're now at $11.5 billion in trailing 12 months revenue, 92% of that We continue to grow revenue faster than market and we have just an enormous opportunity in front of us here in ERP and HCM and I'll talk to that in a second. 
In SaaS revenue and bookings, let me just give you a few stats to give you some context of what happened. Overall, ERP and HCM annualized SaaS revenue is now $2.9 billion or call it $3 billion and it was up in the high 20s. Fusion apps revenue was plus 36% in Q4 and up 32% for the full year. Fusion HCM was up 25% in Q4, solid growth with nice wins that I'll discuss again in a second. Fusion ERP revenue was up 44% and also up 44% for the full year. 
NetSuite ERP was up 28% in Q4 as the strong momentum continues. They had strong bookings in the quarter. And I remind you that last Q4, they had 72% growth in bookings. In addition, there was a plus 30% growth in bookings this Q4. And that's what drove this revenue growth. And when we acquired NetSuite, we had roughly 15% growth rates and those have doubled now since the acquisition. 
In our verticals, revenue was up 19% and 32% for the year. In our data-as-a-service, just to give you some further context within our SaaS business, our challenges related to the broader privacy issues continued and revenue was down 15%. 
Now I'm going to give you an IDC quote that I have to read as it is, so I can't improvise. But let me give you the quotes, the words and then the close quotes. "" Per IDC's latest annual market share results, Oracle gained the most market share globally out of all enterprise applications SaaS vendors 3 years running, in calendar year '16, '17 and '18. "" And I can't improvise on that quote, although I'd like to. So anyway, we assess strong momentum in the app space. I'll talk to you about some of the wins in a second. 
In our infrastructure ecosystem, the ecosystem was $21.1 billion on a trailing 12-month basis and Q4 was up 7% with database up mid-single digits driven by mid-teens database license growth and let me repeat that, mid-teens database license growth. Autonomous Database and I'm telling you, while the numbers helped us in Q4, they were still small, but if you extrapolate them, they are relatively, not relatively, they are very significant. More than 5000 new trials were added in Q4 alone. We've had a great pull-through business with 40% of our Q4 wins, so 40% of the time we were  on an Autonomous Database, we pull-through analytics. 
We're adding many new customers. So of all the customers we're adding with Autonomous database and you might think we're replacing just our base, which by the way, we're to do, about 20% of our customers are just brand-new to Oracle. they were not an Oracle database customer when they bought the Autonomous Database. And new workloads are 40% meaning that I'm an Oracle database customer, but I'm putting a different workload on the Autonomous Database than I had on the Oracle Database. So we have both new and existing customers doing both. 
Now to Safra's point, she hit it briefly, I want to hit it just a little harder. In the key database options that you need to run autonomous, this being and multi-tenant and if you want the SLA, our license growth was up 21%. So what do you think the market's growing, 2, 3, 3.4 whatever number you think from your favorite analyst, this was a huge share gain customer for us or share gain quarter for us in database. It was a solid quarter. We exceeded our revenue targets and saw 27% EPS growth. Our bookings growth climbed with our renewal rates meaning our continued renewal rates existing customers gives us confidence that our cloud apps business will also just continue to strengthen from here. 
Now I thought I'll give you just a couple of key wins we had during the quarter. I'm going to try and give you a little more color of the typical size of the companies we're selling to. I might even try and give you a little bit of who we replaced in the deal and give you some rhythms so you get a feel for all of this. Some of our key wins and I'll focus on some back office wins Insurance, about $2 billion company, Coronado a mining company in Australia, $2.3 billion company that's an interesting one because I used to compete with them when I was in NCR bought and was an customer was an SAP customer. They combined the 2 and they will be going to Oracle Cloud ERP. So next door to run Oracle Cloud ERP. 
out of Brazil, about $31.3 billion, they bought ERP supply chain and procurement, fantastic win for us and they were running on Brazilian ERP company. And so they are not new to Oracle which is a $1 billion company, bought really our whole ERP suit, ERP planning, supply chain, procurement. They did it against a background of basically having a little bit of everything. They had a little bit of EDS, a little bit of SAP, a little bit of Microsoft and replaced it all with Oracle Cloud. 
Now, this company you may have never heard of the reason I've heard of them is their stock symbol on New York's Stock Exchange was HP. And for years, I wanted their stock symbol and they are about a $1.6 billion company. And while I never got the stock symbol from them, we have replaced with Oracle Cloud ERP at 
So anyway, that will just give you some idea on that. Ferguson, which is one of the largest plumping wholesale and distribution company, they are $21 billion company. They bought ERP, EPM, supply chain, procurement, just a tremendous, tremendous win for us and looking to partner with them in the U.S., another tremendous win for us. Right Medical, which was very competitive, Emerson Electric University, which has deployed not only all of our financials in ERP, but are deploying our new student scheduling system, which deals with all of commissions, not commissions, but grants and discounting, very difficult stuff to deal with so a very key win for us in the quarter. A great HCM win at Waste Management. Waste management is a $13 billion company in Houston. This is HCM, payroll, talent, some amount of ERP. Tiffany, I'm sure all of you want something from Tiffany for some important occasion. Tiffany will be running on our HCM location. Okay. I'm getting a sign to stop here, but it was a very good quarter in terms of just quality logos. And I think what I was -- let me just try to do one -- maybe a couple of other things for you just to give you some flavor. So we get asked this in Q&A a lot. 
I'm just waiting down the list. And of what I'm looking is about 150 on my page, I'd say 120,  bought more than 1 module from us. And if I read the competitors or the incumbents that got replaced, they start SAP, EBS, EBS Microsoft, Infinium, Microsoft, EBS, I mean, I could go on and on, but that will give you a flavor that we're getting as many and I didn't do this accounting exactly, but as many of our logos from outside of the traditional Oracle user base as we are from the Oracle user base. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry."

It's not even bookings that bookings that lead to increased consumption triggers our just-in-time provisioning of hardware into our public clouds.

Why is it attractive to -- why is it difficult to attract developers because developers write applications and most important applications are ISV applications, which are used across the board. So I don't think anything has changed at all. Developers were always, if you will, the foundation of our business. We have over 1 million developers in our ecosystem already. And most ISVs, most of the current ISVs in the cloud use the Oracle database. I mean, everything the Salesforce.com runs pretty much -- is running on the Oracle Database. Everything that SAP acquired to run in the cloud, runs on the Oracle database. Now I know SAP says they're going to move to HANA, but they said that 6 years ago, haven't quite got there yet. Anyway, we go after developers and in fact, yesterday, we were putting the finishing touches of a program we're going to be announcing to developers which is basically free services to developers if you will. So developers in entrepreneurs is a free service. We'll be able to provide this free service that let developers to start on the Oracle Cloud, build their applications and graduate from being a maybe a solo entrepreneur, some place in a dorm in MIT to eventually being an entrepreneur starting a company and then becoming an ISV.

Okay. So I'm sorry and repeat my answer. So the answer is, there are 2 options are required for Autonomous Database, one is the multi-tenancy option and that allows let's say, an existing ISV to take an application that was never meant for the cloud, move into our Autonomous Database with the multi-tenancy option and suddenly, without changing their application, their application becomes a multi-tenant cloud application, that's one key feature and we've seen sales of that skyrocket. The other key feature of Autonomous Database that's required to use Autonomous Database is this feature called is the ability to use multiple computers to run a single application or single database instance. 
So in case one of those computers should fail, we tolerate that failure and the application keeps running because we have multiple computers. You might have 1, you might have 2, 3, for year-over-year lose 1  or 2, you still have 2, 3, 4 left, whatever you configure the system. We will only configure Autonomous Database with multiple computers. Autonomous Database never fails. You must have the option to ensure that options are growing more rapidly than you would expect being driven again by consumption of the Autonomous Database. So we're seeing very, very rapid adoption and it's another thing initial transaction, a lot of our existing customers might come on with a very small project, let's say, $30,000 ARR project and within 60, 90, 120 days, that becomes $120,000 project. And after another few months, it becomes $0.5 million project. So we're really optimistic about this business. And the optimism and I'm just back to what I said earlier, the optimism was not guidance, which is based on sales forecast. The thing that I find fascinating are the consumption data curves, which shows our consumption rate growing much faster than the fields currently anticipated.

I think, to your point, SAP is forcing all their customers to a new platform by the beginning of 2025, that forces all their customers to move and all the changes, not just the changes they just made but all the changes they made to the code have to be remade to the code. And what that means is they have to roll up a big new bill to move called earlier Hannah. And it's a big damn bill and so the poor CIO or CFO, whoever this guy is, has to show up to the Board and says to the Board of Directors, we've got a $500 million bill to move to Hannah. And you all on the phone are smart. My guess is the Board members says something clever like what's Hannah and the guy goes well, it's a platform and the guy goes, what's the platform? And he goes it's a new thing we run our ERP on, and he okay, and it costs $500 million and the guy goes What do we get for? We get some new plumbing and we get some new ideas I guess that meeting goes very badly. And somewhere in the meeting, the customer goes who else have you talked to? Do we have an alternative? Can we not do it? Could we go with somebody else? 
So yes, I mean, I think, it's an incredibly interesting strategy on their part to put all their customers in play. Do we get calls from customers that we haven't been called or talked to in 20 years? The answer is, yes. And is it because and remember, Heather, you know this that when we sold to customers 15 years ago, they never really talk to us and that is vice versa because you expected to stay with these ERP systems forever. So yes, some percent of their base will move as a result of just this because it's a lot of money for not getting much, real simple. And the rest of the"

I think the greater story you can see here is the NetSuite story that we doubled the rate. And if I didn't say enough things about NetSuite because I'm sure the NetSuite team is listening, let me say NetSuite, NetSuite, NetSuite. They have just done a fabulous job and they are doing a fabulous job not just growing internationally but growing domestically. A lot of this performance in NetSuite is just pure U.S. domestic performance, more sales people, more industries, micro industries that we build for, better execution. So between NetSuite and Fusion, we've just had a really good run. I won't tell you everything is perfect, which is really good news. With these numbers, we can do better. We can do better.

We have what we now call OCI Classic, which really is frozen and we are moving all of our customers, almost moved all of our customers to our Gen 2 Cloud. Our Gen 2 Cloud is dramatically better, I think, not only than our Gen 1 Cloud but other peoples existing clouds. We have without going to a lot of this, we have an architecture where we have 2 separate computers in each computer that you rent, if you will. And we have the Intel computer and then we have another processor with separate memory that has all of our cloud control code. So that's very different than Amazon or Google or Azure as an architecture every single computer in our Gen 2 Cloud is really 2 computers. The one that the customer uses and another one that we use to manage the cloud and encrypt the data encapsulate the messaging and virtualize the messaging and do all of that. It's impossible for a cloud customer to get our code and hack it. And it's also impossible for our programmers to look at our customer's data. So we did this. The redid our architecture because we decided that existing architectures, infrastructure architectures had just too many vulnerabilities. And so we said okay, we're going to phrase, we're going to invest in Gen 2 that gives us much more secure, much more reliable platform and much faster, it's also much faster. We have much faster networking I'm not going into all of that, but this is a huge differentiator between us and everybody else. And customers are beginning to see that. They are beginning to understand the architectural differences. A lot of the world security agencies are now coming to us and saying, this looks really good we're going to go with this, not Amazon or somebody else because of these architectural distinctions. Also, a bunch of people are running high performance workloads on our cloud, we have a much fancier network. We have RDMA capability built into our network that other guys don't have, that's because we didn't have in Gen 1, we have in Gen 2. It allows us to run large machine learning workloads, our rendering, our simulations, all sorts of high-performance computing way better than our competitors. So they're a bunch of applications we just do better and people are beginning to notice and they are beginning to move and bought."

As you can see, we had a terrific quarter with total revenue growth 1 point above the high end of my guidance and earnings per share $0.07 above the high end of my U.S. dollar guidance. I'll first go over Q4 and reca",1041,"Thanks, Ken. Good afternoon, everyone. As you can see, we had a terrific quarter with total revenue growth 1 point above the high end of my guidance and earnings per share $0.07 above the high end of my U.S. dollar guidance. I'll first go over Q4 and recap fiscal year 2019 before moving on to my guidance. I'll then turn the call over to Larry and Mark for their comments. 
As in prior quarters, I'll review our non-GAAP results using constant dollar growth rates unless I say otherwise. Now the effects of currency movements in Q4 were largely as expected, maybe a smidge more incremental headwind than expected, but that was not a full percentage more. Anyway, total Cloud Services and License Support revenues for the quarter were $6.8 billion, up 3%, while Cloud License and On-Premise License revenues were $2.5 billion, up 15%. In particular, technology license growth was up 19%, making it abundantly clear that customers are investing in the Oracle platform. The key database options necessary to run the Oracle Autonomous Database service grew 21%. I cannot stress enough the stability and growth of our base of customers quarter-after-quarter. 
Our customers are maintaining and expanding this Oracle environment. And in our BYOL route, Bring Your Own License model, they have the portability to use their licenses on-premise, in the cloud or via hybrid environment. This popularity is largely because our products are capable of doing things others just can't do, whether it's security, performance or scalability, and in our cloud, autonomous capabilities. As our customers adopt our technologies, whether via licenses or cloud services, our overall customer base is growing and that growth is starting to accelerate. 
In addition, the recent interconnect agreement with Microsoft will only help accelerate the transition from on-premise database to the Autonomous Database service. 
Now to the numbers. The gross margin for Cloud Services and License Support was 86%. And as we continue to scale and grow, I expect this will go even higher. Total revenues for the quarter were $11.1 billion, up 4% from last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $5.3 billion, up 7% from last year. And the operating margin was 47%, which was up from 46% last year. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was at 16.4%, slightly below our base tax rate of 20% as a result of some discrete items. And EPS was $1.16 in U.S. dollars and up 27% in constant currency and 23% in USD. 
The GAAP tax rate was 3.3%, also a result of some discrete items. And GAAP EPS was $1.07 in U.S. dollars and up 41% in constant currency, 36% in U.S. dollars. 
Now moving on to recap the full fiscal year. Total Cloud Services and License Support revenue was $26.7 billion, growing 4%. Total company revenues for the year was $39.5 billion, growing 3% compared to 2% total revenue growth in FY '18. Non-GAAP EPS was USD 3.52, up 19% in constant currency, up 16% in U.S. dollars, driven by operating income growth, share repurchases and lower tax rate. This is mirrored in our operating margin percentage for the full year, which was up slightly to 44% this year. 
As a reminder, our best ever full year operating margin was 47%, and I expect we will surpass that in the coming years as our total revenue growth accelerates and we benefit from greater scale in our business. 
Operating cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $14.6 billion, lower than last year, only because, as you will see at the bottom of our cash flow statement in the 10-K, FY '19 cash tax payments were $1.3 billion higher this year, including the $610 million installment towards the transition tax in Q2 and nearly $540 million in higher tax payments in Q4. 
Capital expenditures for the year were $1.7 billion. And free cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $12.9 billion. We now have approximately $38 billion in cash and marketable securities. The short-term deferred revenue balance is $8.4 billion, up 3% in constant currency. 
As we said before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and the dividend. This quarter, we repurchased 112 million shares for a total of $6 billion. Over the last 12 months, we have repurchased 734 million shares for a total of $36 billion. Over the last 5 years, we have reduced the shares outstanding by almost 25% with nearly 60% of the total reduction this past year in FY '19. 
In addition, we've paid out dividends of $2.9 billion over the last 12 months and the Board of Directors again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.24 per share. 
Now to the guidance. My guidance today is a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency. Assuming the current exchange rates remain the same as they are now, currency should have about 1% negative effect on total revenues and about $0.01 negative effect on EPS. So for Q1, total revenues are expected to grow between 1% to 3% in constant currency. And assuming a 1% currency headwind, total revenues are expected to grow between 0% and 2% in USD. 
Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to grow between 14% to 16% and be between $0.81 and $0.83 in constant currency. And assuming the $0.01 headwind, non-GAAP EPS in USD is expected to grow between 12% and 14% and be between $0.80 and $0.82 in USD. 
Now this past year, we grew 3%. And for fiscal year 2020, I expect total revenue will grow faster than last year constant currency, of course, and that we will once again report double-digit EPS growth. Total CapEx for fiscal year '20 is expected to be about $2.2 billion, but it could move a little depending on our bookings. My EPS guidance for Q1 and fiscal year '20 assumes our base rate of 20%. However, onetime tax events could cause actual tax rates for any given quarter to vary from our base, both higher or lower. But I expect that in normalizing for these onetime tax events, our tax rate will average around 20% for fiscal year 2020. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Mark for his comments."

Total revenue was up 4% in constant currency with Cloud License and Support up 3% and EPS up 27% in constant currency. 
In apps, we had a great momentum. We grew 6% for the year. We're now at $11.5 billion in trailing 12 months' revenue, 92% of that recurred. We continue to grow revenue faster than market. And we have just an enormous opportunity in front of us here in ERP and HCM, and I'll talk to that in a second. 
In SaaS revenue and bookings, let me just give you a few stats to give you some context of what happened. Overall ERP and HCM annualized SaaS revenue is now $2.9 billion or call it $3 billion, and it was up in the high 20s. Fusion apps revenue was plus 36% in Q4 and up 32% for the full year. Fusion HCM was up 25% in Q4, solid growth with nice wins that I'll discuss again in a second. Fusion ERP revenue was up 44% and also up 44% for the full year. 
NetSuite ERP was up 28% in Q4 as the strong momentum continues. They had strong bookings in the quarter. And I remind you that last Q4, they had 72% growth in bookings. In addition, there was a plus 30% growth in bookings this Q4. And that's what drove this revenue growth. And when we acquired NetSuite, we had roughly 15% growth rates, and those have doubled now since the acquisition. 
In our verticals, revenue was up 19% and 32% for the year. In our Data as a Service, just to give you some further context within our SaaS business, our challenges related to the broader privacy issues continued and revenue was down 15%. 
Now I'm going to give you an IDC quote that I have to read as it is, so I can't improvise. But let me give you the quotes, the words and then the close quotes. ""Per IDC's latest annual market share results, Oracle gained the most market share globally out of all enterprise applications SaaS vendors 3 years running, in calendar year '16, '17 and '18. "" And I can't improvise on that quote, although I'd like to. So anyway, we just have strong momentum in the app space. I'll talk to you about some of the wins in a second. 
In our infrastructure ecosystem, the GapTech ecosystem was $21.1 billion on a trailing 12 months' basis and Q4 was up 7% with database up mid-single digits, driven by mid-teens database license growth. And let me repeat that, mid-teens database license growth. 
Autonomous Database, and I'm telling you, while the numbers helped us in Q4, they were still small. But the -- if you extrapolate them, they are relatively -- not relatively, they are very significant. More than 5,000 new trials were added in Q4 alone. We've got a great pull-through business with 40% of our Q4 wins, so 40% of the time we were on an Autonomous Database, we pulled through analytics. 
We're adding many new customers. So of all the customers we're adding with Autonomous Database, and you might think we're replacing just our base, which by the way we declined to do, about 20% of our customers are just brand new to Oracle. They were not an Oracle Database customer when they bought the Autonomous Database. And new workloads are 40%, meaning that I'm an Oracle Database customer, but I'm putting a different workload on the Autonomous Database than I had on the Oracle Database. So we have both new and existing customers doing both. 
Now to Safra's point, and she hit it briefly, I want to hit it just a little harder. In the key database options that you need to run autonomous, so these being a rack and multi-tenant and Active Data Guard if you want the SLA, our license growth was up 21%. So what do you think the market is growing, 2, 3, 3.4, whatever number you think from your favorite analyst, this was a huge share gain customer for us -- or share gain quarter for us in database. It was a solid quarter. We exceeded our revenue target and saw 27% EPS growth. Our bookings growth climbed with our renewal rates, meaning our continuing renewal rates of existing customers gives us confidence that our cloud apps business will also just continue to strengthen from here. 
Now I thought I'd give you just a couple of key wins we had during the quarter. And I'm going to try and give you a little more color of the typical size of the companies we're selling to. I might even try and give you a little bit about who we replaced in the deal and give you some rhythm, so you get a feel for all of this. Some of our key wins, and I'll focus on some back office wins, Argo Insurance (sic) [ Group ], about $2 billion company; Coronado Curragh, a mining company in Australia, $2.3 billion company. Diebold Nixdorf, that's an interesting one, because I used to compete with them when I was in NCR. Diebold bought Nixdorf. And Diebold was an EBS customer. Nixdorf was an SAP customer. They combined the 2, and they will be going to Oracle Cloud ERP. So whole Diebold Nixdorf will run on Oracle Cloud ERP. 
NG, out of Brazil, about $1.3 billion, they bought ERP supply chain and procurement, fantastic win for us. And they were running on TOTVS, a Brazilian ERP company. And so they are net new to Oracle. Exterion, which is a $1 billion company, bought our whole -- really our whole ERP suite, ERP planning, supply chain, procurement. They did it against a background of basically having a little bit of everything. They had a little bit of EBS, a little bit of SAP and a little bit of Microsoft and replaced it all with the Oracle Cloud. 
Now this company you may never have heard of, Helmerich & Payne, the reason I've heard of them is their stock symbol on The New York Stock Exchange was HP. And for years, I wanted their stock symbol. And they are about a $1.6 billion company. And while I never got the stock symbol from them, we have replaced Epicor with Oracle Cloud ERP at Helmerich & Payne.
So anyway, that would just give you some idea on that. Ferguson, which is one of the largest plumping wholesale and distribution company, they're a $21 billion company. They bought ERP, EPM, supply chain, procurement, just a tremendous, tremendous win for us and very looking to partner with them. Santander in the U.S., another tremendous win for us. Wright Medical, which was very competitive. Emerson Electric, Rutgers University, which has deployed not only all of our financials and ERP, but are deploying our new student scheduling system, which deals with all of commissions and -- not commissions, but grants and discounting, very difficult stuff to deal within higher ed. So a very key win for us in the quarter. 
A great HCM win at Waste Management. Waste Management is a $13 billion company in Houston. This is HCM, payroll, talent, some amount of ERP. Tiffany, I'm sure all of you bought something from Tiffany for some important occasion, Tiffany will be running on our HCM location. 
Okay. I'm getting a sign to stop here, but it was a very good quarter in terms of just quality logos. And I think what I was -- let me just try to do one -- maybe a couple of other things for you just to give you some flavor. So we get asked this in Q&A a lot. 
I'm just reading down the list. And of what I'm looking at is about 150 on my page, I'd say 120 bought more than one module from us. And if I read the competitors or the incumbents that got replaced, they start SAP, EBS, TOTVS, Microsoft, Epicor, Infor, Lawson, Infinium, Microsoft, EBS, I mean, I could go on and on. But that will give you a flavor that we're getting as many, and I didn't do this accounting exactly, but as many of our logos from outside of the traditional Oracle user base as we are from the Oracle user base. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry."

It's not even bookings that drive it. Bookings that lead to increased consumption triggers our just-in-time provisioning of our hardware into our public clouds.

Why is it attractive to -- why is it difficult to attract developers, because developers write applications and most important applications are ISV applications, which are used across the board. So I don't think anything has changed at all. Developers were always, if you will, the foundation of our business. We have over 1 million developers in our ecosystem already. And most ISVs, most of the current ISVs in the cloud use the Oracle Database. I mean, everything the Salesforce.com runs pretty much is running on the Oracle Database. Everything that SAP acquired to run in the cloud runs on the Oracle Database. Now I know SAP said they're going to move to HANA, but they said that 6 years ago, haven't quite gotten there yet. Anyway, the -- we go after developers -- and in fact, yesterday, we were putting the finishing touches of a program we're going to be announcing to developers that are Open World, which is basically free services to developers, if you will. So developers and college entrepreneurs can -- this is free service. We'll be able to provide this free service that will let developers to start on the Oracle Cloud, build their applications and graduate from being maybe a solo entrepreneur some place in a dorm in MIT to eventually being an entrepreneur starting a company and then becoming an ISV. That's the cycle we want to sign up people early, and we have all sorts of cloud programs we're putting in place to do that."

So the answer, there are 2 options required for Autonomous Database. One is the multi-tenancy option, and that allows, let's say, an existing ISV to take an application that was never meant for the cloud, move it to our Autonomous Database with the multi-tenancy option, and suddenly, without changing their application, their application becomes a multi-tenant cloud application. That's one key feature and we've seen sales of that skyrocket. The other key feature of Autonomous Database that's required to use Autonomous Database is this feature called rack. Rack is the ability to use multiple computers to run a single application or single database instance. 
So in case one of those computers should fail, we tolerate that failure and the application keeps running, because we have multiple computers. You might have 1. You might have 2, 3, 4. But you lose 1 or 2, you still have 2, 3, 4 left, whatever you -- however you configure the system. We will only configure Autonomous Database with multiple computers. Autonomous Database never fails. You must have the rack option to ensure that. Rack options are growing more rapidly than you would expect, being driven again by consumption of the Autonomous Database. So we're seeing very, very rapid adoption. In fact, it's -- and another thing -- to add a little color to this, initial transaction, a lot of our existing customers might come on with a very small project, let's say, $30,000 ARR project. And within 60, 90, 120 days, that becomes $120,000 project. And after another few months, it becomes $0.5 million project. So we're really optimistic about this business. And the optimism -- and I'm just back to what I said earlier, the optimism was not in Safra's guidance, which is based on sales forecast. The thing that I find fascinating are the consumption data curves, which shows our consumption rate growing much faster than the fields currently anticipating.

How much of an opportunity is that for you to go and potentially win back some of those customers or to win some of those customers for the first time?

That forces all their customers to move and all the changes, not just the changes they've just made, but all the changes they've made to the code have to be remade to the code. And what that means is they have to roll up a big new bill to move to this thing Larry called earlier, HANA. And it's a big damn bill. And so the poor CIO or CFO, whoever this guy is, has to show up to the Board and says to the Board of Directors, we've got a $500 million bill to move to HANA. And you all on the phone are smart. My guess is the Board members says something clever like what's HANA. And the guy goes, well, it's a platform. And the guy goes, well, what's a platform? And he goes, well, it's a new thing we run our ERP on. And he goes, okay. And it costs $500 million. And the guy goes, oh. And he goes what do we get for it? And he goes, well, we get some new plumbing and we get some new this. I just think that meeting goes very badly. And somewhere in the meeting, the customer goes who else have you talked to? Do we have an alternative? Can we not do it? Could we go with somebody else? 
So yes, I mean, I think it's an incredibly interesting strategy on their part to put all their customers in play. Do we get calls from customers that we haven't been called or talked to in 20 years? The answer is yes. And is it because -- and remember, Heather, you know this that when we sold to customers 15 years ago, they never really talked to us after that and vice versa, because you expected to stay with these ERP systems forever.

And if I didn't say enough things about NetSuite, because I'm sure the NetSuite team is listening. Let me say, NetSuite, NetSuite, NetSuite. They have just done a fabulous job and they are doing a fabulous job not just growing internationally, but growing domestically. A lot of this performance in NetSuite is just pure U.S. domestic performance, more salespeople, more industries, micro industries that we build for, better execution. And so between NetSuite and Fusion, we've just had a really good run. I won't tell you everything is perfect, which is really good news. With these numbers, we can do better. We can do better.

Our Gen 2 Cloud is dramatically better, I think, not only than our Gen 1 Cloud, but other people, the existing clouds. We have -- without going through a lot on this, we have an architecture where we have 2 separate computers in each computer that you rent, if you will. And we have the Intel computer that you rent and then we have another processor with separate memory that has all of our cloud control code. So that's very different than Amazon or Google or Azure as an architecture. Every single computer in our Gen 2 Cloud is really 2 computers, the one that the customer uses and another one that we use to manage the cloud and encrypt the data and encapsulate the messaging and virtualize the messaging and do all of that. The -- it's impossible for a cloud customer to get at our code and hack it. And it's also impossible for our programmers to look at our customers' data. So we did this. We redid our architecture, because we decided that existing architectures, infrastructure architectures had just too many vulnerabilities. And so we bit the bullet, said, okay, we're going to freeze OCI Classic, we're going to invest in Gen 2 that gives us much more secure, much more reliable platform. And in fact, it'll be much faster. It's also much faster. We have much faster networking, I'm not going into all of that. But this is a huge differentiator between us and everybody else. And customers are beginning to see that. They are beginning to understand the architectural differences. A lot of the world security agencies are now coming to us and saying, hey, this looks really good, we're going to go with this, not Amazon or somebody else because of these architectural distinctions. Also, a bunch of people are running high-performance workloads on our cloud. We have a much fancier network. We have RDMA capability built into our network that the other guys don't have. That's because we redid. We didn't have in Gen 1, we have in Gen 2. It allows us to run large machine learning workloads, our rendering, our simulations, all sorts of high-performance computing way better than our competitors. So there are a bunch of applications we just do better and people are beginning to notice and they are beginning to move and buy."

I'll first go over Q4 and reca",1041,"Thanks, Ken. Good afternoon, everyone. As you can see, we had a terrific quarter with total revenue growth 1 point above the high end of my guidance and earnings per share $0.07 above the high end of my U.S. dollar guidance. I'll first go over Q4 and recap fiscal year 2019 before moving on to my guidance. I'll then turn the call over to Larry and Mark for their comments. 
As in prior quarters, I'll review our non-GAAP results using constant dollar growth rates unless I say otherwise. Now the effects of currency movements in Q4 were largely as expected, maybe a smidge more incremental headwind than expected, but that was not a full percentage more. Anyway, total Cloud Services and License Support revenues for the quarter were $6.8 billion, up 3%, while Cloud License and On-Premise License revenues were $2.5 billion, up 15%. In particular, technology license growth was up 19%, making it abundantly clear that customers are investing in the Oracle platform. The key database options necessary to run the Oracle Autonomous Database service grew 21%. I cannot stress enough the stability and growth of our base of customers quarter-after-quarter. 
Our customers are maintaining and expanding their Oracle environment. And in our BYOL, Bring Your Own License model, they have the portability to use their licenses on-premise, in the cloud or via hybrid environment. This popularity is largely because our products are capable of doing things others just can't do, whether it's security, performance or scalability, and in our cloud, autonomous capabilities. As our customers adopt our technologies, whether via licenses or cloud services, our overall customer base is growing and that growth is starting to accelerate. 
In addition, the recent interconnect agreement with Microsoft will only help accelerate the transition from on-premise database to the Autonomous Database service. 
Now to the numbers. The gross margin for Cloud Services and License Support was 86%. And as we continue to scale and grow, I expect this will go even higher. Total revenues for the quarter were $11.1 billion, up 4% from last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $5.3 billion, up 7% from last year. And the operating margin was 47%, which was up from 46% last year. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was at 16.4%, slightly below our base tax rate of 20% as a result of some discrete items. And EPS was $1.16 in U.S. dollars and up 27% in constant currency and 23% in USD. 
The GAAP tax rate was 3.3%, also a result of some discrete items. And GAAP EPS was $1.07 in U.S. dollars and up 41% in constant currency, 36% in U.S. dollars. 
Now moving on to recap the full fiscal year. Total Cloud Services and License Support revenue was $26.7 billion, growing 4%. Total company revenues for the year was $39.5 billion, growing 3% compared to 2% total revenue growth in FY '18. Non-GAAP EPS was USD 3.52, up 19% in constant currency, up 16% in U.S. dollars, driven by operating income growth, share repurchases and lower tax rate. This is mirrored in our operating margin percentage for the full year, which was up slightly to 44% this year. 
As a reminder, our best ever full year operating margin was 47%, and I expect we will surpass that in the coming years as our total revenue growth accelerates and we benefit from greater scale in our business. 
Operating cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $14.6 billion, lower than last year, only because, as you will see at the bottom of our cash flow statement in the 10-K, FY '19 cash tax payments were $1.3 billion higher this year, including the $610 million installment towards the transition tax in Q2 and nearly $540 million in higher tax payments in Q4. 
Capital expenditures for the year were $1.7 billion. And free cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $12.9 billion. We now have approximately $38 billion in cash and marketable securities. The short-term deferred revenue balance is $8.4 billion, up 3% in constant currency. 
As we've said before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and a dividend. This quarter, we repurchased 112 million shares for a total of $6 billion. Over the last 12 months, we have repurchased 734 million shares for a total of $36 billion. Over the last 5 years, we have reduced the shares outstanding by almost 25% with nearly 60% of the total reduction this past year in FY '19. 
In addition, we've paid out dividends of $2.9 billion over the last 12 months and the Board of Directors again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.24 per share. 
Now to the guidance. My guidance today is a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency. Assuming the current exchange rates remain the same as they are now, currency should have about a 1% negative effect on total revenues and about $0.01 negative effect on EPS. So for Q1, total revenues are expected to grow between 1% to 3% in constant currency. And assuming a 1% currency headwind, total revenues are expected to grow between 0% and 2% in USD. 
Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to grow between 14% to 16% and be between $0.81 and $0.83 in constant currency. And assuming the $0.01 headwind, non-GAAP EPS in USD is expected to grow between 12% and 14% and be between $0.80 and $0.82 in USD. 
Now this past year, we grew 3%. And for fiscal year 2020, I expect total revenue will grow faster than last year constant currency, of course, and that we will once again report double-digit EPS growth. Total CapEx for fiscal year '20 is expected to be about $2.2 billion, but it could move a little depending on our bookings. My EPS guidance for Q1 and fiscal year '20 assumes our base rate of 20%. However, onetime tax events could cause actual tax rates for any given quarter to vary from our base, both higher or lower. But I expect that in normalizing for these onetime tax events, our tax rate will average around 20% for fiscal year 2020. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Mark for his comments."

Total revenue was up 4% in constant currency with Cloud License and Support up 3% and EPS up 27% in constant currency. 
In apps, we had a great momentum. We grew 6% for the year. We're now at $11.5 billion in trailing 12 months' revenue, 92% of that recurs. We continue to grow revenue faster than market. And we have just an enormous opportunity in front of us in ERP and HCM, and I'll talk to that in a second. 
In SaaS revenue and bookings, let me just give you a few stats to give you some context of what happened. Overall ERP and HCM annualized SaaS revenue is now $2.9 billion or call it $3 billion, and it was up in the high 20s. Fusion apps revenue was plus 36% in Q4 and up 32% for the full year. Fusion HCM was up 25% in Q4, solid growth with nice wins that I'll discuss again in a second. Fusion ERP revenue was up 44% and also up 44% for the full year. 
NetSuite ERP was up 28% in Q4 as the strong momentum continues. They had strong bookings in the quarter. And I remind you that last Q4, they had 72% growth in bookings. In addition, there was a plus 30% growth in bookings this Q4. And that's what drove this revenue growth. And when we acquired NetSuite, we had roughly 15% growth rates, and those have darn near doubled now since the acquisition. 
In our verticals, revenue was up 19% and 32% for the year. In our Data as a Service, just to give you some further context within our SaaS business, our challenges related to the broader privacy issues continued and revenue was down 15%. 
Now I'm going to give you an IDC quote that I have to read as-is, so I can't improvise. But let me give you the quotes, the words and then the close quotes. ""Per IDC's latest annual market share results, Oracle gained the most market share globally out of all enterprise applications SaaS vendors 3 years running, in calendar year '16, '17 and '18."" And I can't improvise on that quote, although I'd like to. So anyway, we just have strong momentum in the app space. I'll talk to you about some of the wins in a second. 
In our infrastructure ecosystem, the GapTech ecosystem was $21.1 billion on a trailing 12 months' basis and Q4 was up 7% with database up mid-single digits, driven by mid-teens database license growth. And let me repeat that, mid-teens database license growth. 
Autonomous Database, and I'm telling you, while the numbers helped us in Q4, they were still small. But the -- if you extrapolate them, they are relatively -- not relatively, they are very significant. More than 5,000 new trials were added in Q4 alone. We've got a great pull-through business with 40% of our Q4 wins, so 40% of the time we win on Autonomous Database, we pull through analytics. 
We're adding many new customers. So of all the customers we're adding with Autonomous Database, and you might think we're replacing just our base, which by the way we'd be glad to do, about 20% of our customers are just brand new to Oracle. They were not an Oracle Database customer when they bought the Autonomous Database. And new workloads are 40%, meaning that I'm an Oracle Database customer, but I'm putting a different workload on the Autonomous Database than I had on the Oracle Database. So we have both new and existing customers doing both. 
Now to Safra's point, and she hit it briefly, I want to hit it just a little harder. In the key database options that you need to run autonomous, so these being rack and multi-tenant and Active Data Guard if you want the SLA, our license growth was up 21%. So what do you think the market is growing, 2, 3, 3.4, whatever number you think from your favorite analyst, this was a huge share gain customer for us -- or share gain quarter for us in database. It was a solid quarter. We exceeded our revenue target and saw 27% EPS growth. Our bookings growth climbed with our renewal rates, meaning our continuing renewal rates of existing customers gives us confidence that our cloud apps business will also just continue to strengthen from here. 
Now I thought I'd give you just a couple of key wins we had during the quarter. And I'm going to try and give you a little more color of the typical size of the companies we're selling to. I might even try and give you a little bit about who we replaced in the deal and give you some rhythm, so you get a feel for all of this. Some of our key wins, and I'll focus on some back office wins, Argo Insurance (sic) [ Group ], about a $2 billion company; Coronado Curragh, a mining company in Australia, $2.3 billion company. Diebold Nixdorf, that's an interesting one, because I used to compete with them when I was at NCR. Diebold bought Nixdorf. And Diebold was an EBS customer. Nixdorf was an SAP customer. They combined the 2, and they will be going to Oracle Cloud ERP. The whole Diebold Nixdorf will run on Oracle Cloud ERP. 
NG, out of Brazil, about $1.3 billion, they bought ERP supply chain and procurement, fantastic win for us. And they were running on TOTVS, a Brazilian ERP company. And so they are net new to Oracle. Exterion, which is a $1 billion company, bought our whole -- really our whole ERP suite, ERP planning, supply chain, procurement. They did it against a background of basically having a little bit of everything. They had a little bit of EBS, a little bit of SAP and a little bit of Microsoft and replaced it all with the Oracle Cloud. 
Now this company you may never have heard of, Helmerich & Payne, the reason I've heard of them is their stock symbol on The New York Stock Exchange was HP. And for years, I wanted their stock symbol. And they are about a $1.6 billion company. And while I never got the stock symbol from them, we have replaced Epicor with Oracle Cloud ERP at Helmerich & Payne.
So anyway, that would just give you some idea on that. Ferguson, which is one of the largest plumbing wholesale and distribution companies, they're a $21 billion company. They bought ERP, EPM, supply chain, procurement, just a tremendous, tremendous win for us and very looking to partner with them. Santander in the U.S., another tremendous win for us. Wright Medical, which was very competitive. Emerson Electric, Rutgers University, which has deployed not only all of our financials and ERP, but are deploying our new student scheduling system, which deals with all of commissions and -- not commissions, but grants and discounting, very difficult stuff to deal with in higher ed. So a very key win for us in the quarter. 
A great HCM win at Waste Management. Waste Management is a $13 billion company in Houston. This is HCM, payroll, talent, some amount of ERP. Tiffany, I'm sure all of you bought something from Tiffany for some important occasion, Tiffany will be running on our HCM location. 
Okay. I'm getting a sign to stop here, but it was a very good quarter in terms of just quality logos. And I think what I was -- let me just try to do one -- maybe a couple of other things for you just to give you some flavor. So we get asked this in Q&A a lot. 
I'm just reading down the list. And of what I'm looking at is about 150 on my page, I'd say 120 bought more than one module from us. And if I read the competitors or the incumbents that got replaced, they start SAP, EBS, EBS, TOTVS, Microsoft, Epicor, Epicor, Infor, Lawson, Infinium, Microsoft, EBS, I mean, I could go on and on. But that will give you a flavor that we're getting as many, and I didn't do this accounting exactly, but as many of our logos from outside of the traditional Oracle user base as we are from the Oracle user base. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry."

It's not even bookings that drive it. Bookings that lead to increased consumption triggers our just-in-time provisioning of our hardware into our public clouds.

Why is it attractive to -- why is it good to attract developers, because developers write applications and the most important applications are ISV applications, which are used across the board. So I don't think anything has changed at all. Developers were always, if you will, the foundation of our business. We have over 1 million developers in our ecosystem already. And most ISVs, most of the current ISVs in the cloud use the Oracle Database. I mean, everything the Salesforce.com runs pretty much is running on the Oracle Database. Everything that SAP acquired to run in the cloud runs on the Oracle Database. Now I know SAP said they're going to move to HANA, but they said that 6 years ago, haven't quite gotten there yet. Anyway, the -- we go after developers -- and in fact, yesterday, we were putting the finishing touches of a program we're going to be announcing to developers at Oracle OpenWorld, which is basically free services to developers, forever, if you will. So developers and college entrepreneurs can -- this is free service. We'll be able to provide this free service that will let developers to start on the Oracle Cloud, build their applications and graduate from being maybe a solo entrepreneur some place in a dorm in MIT to eventually being an entrepreneur starting a company and then becoming an ISV. That's the cycle we want to sign up people early, and we have all sorts of cloud programs we're putting in place to be able to do that."

So in case one of those computers should fail, there's -- our systems are fault tolerant, they keep running. So the Autonomous Database never breaks. Let me say that again, never breaks."

So the answer, there are 2 options required for Autonomous Database. One is the multi-tenancy option, and that allows, let's say, an existing ISV to take an application that was never meant for the cloud, move it to our Autonomous Database with the multi-tenancy option, and suddenly, without changing their application, their application becomes a multi-tenant cloud application. That's one key feature and we've seen sales of that skyrocket. The other key feature of Autonomous Database that's required to use Autonomous Database is this feature called rack. Rack is the ability to use multiple computers to run a single application or a single database instance. 
So in case one of those computers should fail, we tolerate that failure and the application keeps running, because we have multiple computers. You might have one. You might have 2, 3, 4. But you lose 1 or 2, you still have 2, 3, 4 left, whatever you -- however you configure the system. We will only configure Autonomous Database with multiple computers. Autonomous Database never fails. You must have the rack option to ensure that. Rack options are growing more rapidly than you would expect, being driven again by consumption of the Autonomous Database. So we're seeing very, very rapid adoption. In fact, it's -- and another thing -- to add a little color to this, initial transaction, a lot of our existing customers might come on with a very small project, let's say, a $30,000 ARR project. And within 60, 90, 120 days, that becomes $120,000 project. And after another few months, it becomes $0.5 million project. So we're really optimistic about this business. And the optimism -- and I'm just back to what I said earlier, the optimism was not in Safra's guidance, which is based on sales forecast. The thing that I find fascinating are the consumption data curves, which shows our consumption rate growing much faster than the fields currently anticipating. To me, that's just wonderfully encouraging, and hopefully, this is the beginning of the trend. We'll find out soon."

And also I wanted to ask you, I mean, SAP is going through where they are trying to get customers to replatform. How much of an opportunity is that for you to go and potentially win back some of those customers or to win some of those customers for the first time?

I think, to your point, SAP is forcing all their customers to a new platform by beginning of 2025. That forces all their customers to move and all the changes, not just the changes they've just made, but all the changes they made to the code have to be remade to the code. And what that means is they have to roll up a big new bill to move to this thing Larry called earlier, HANA. And it's a big damn bill. And so the poor CIO or CFO, whoever this guy is, has to show up to the Board and says to the Board of Directors, we've got a $500 million bill to move to HANA. And you all on the phone are smart. My guess is the Board members says something clever like what's HANA. And the guy goes, well, it's a platform. And the guy goes, well, what's a platform? And he goes, well, it's a new thing we run our ERP on. The guy goes, oh, okay. And it costs $500 million? And the guy goes, oh, yes. And he goes what do we get for it? And he goes, well, we get some new plumbing and we get some new this. I just think that meeting goes very badly. And somewhere in the meeting, the customer goes who else have you talked to? Do we have an alternative? Could we not do it? Could we go with somebody else? 
So yes, I mean, I think it's a incredibly interesting strategy on their part to put all their customers at play. Do we get calls from customers that we haven't been called or talked to in 20 years? The answer is yes. And is it because -- and remember, Heather, you know this that when we sold to customers 15 years ago, they never really talked to SAP after that and vice versa, because you're expected to stay with these ERP systems forever. So yes, some percent of their base will move as a result of just this, because it's a lot of money for not getting much, real simple. And the rest of the..."

I think the greatest story you can see here is the NetSuite story that we doubled the rate. And if I didn't say enough things about NetSuite, because I'm sure the NetSuite team is listening. Let me say, NetSuite, NetSuite, NetSuite. They have just done a fabulous job and they are doing a fabulous job not just growing internationally, but growing domestically. A lot of this performance in NetSuite is just pure U.S. domestic performance, more salespeople, more industries, micro industries that we build for, better execution. And so between NetSuite and Fusion, we've just had a really good run. I won't tell you everything is perfect, which is really good news. With these numbers, we can do better. We can do better.

We had what we now call OCI Classic, which really is frozen and we're moving all of our customers -- almost moved all of our customers to our Gen 2 Cloud. Our Gen 2 Cloud is dramatically better, I think, not only than our Gen 1 Cloud, but other people's, the existing clouds. We have -- without going through a lot on this, we have an architecture where we have 2 separate computers in each computer that you rent, if you will. And we have the Intel computer that you rent and then we have another processor with separate memory that has all of our cloud control code. So that's very different than Amazon or Google or Azure as an architecture. That's true with every single computer in our Gen 2 Cloud is really 2 computers, the one that the customer uses and another one that we use to manage the cloud and encrypt the data and encapsulate the messaging and virtualize the messaging and do all of that. The -- it's impossible for a cloud customer to get at our code and hack it. And it's also impossible for our programmers to look at our customers' data. So we did this. We redid our architecture, because we decided that existing architectures, infrastructure architectures had just too many vulnerabilities. And so we bit the bullet, said, okay, we're going to freeze OCI Classic, we're going to invest in Gen 2 that gives us this much more secure, much more reliable platform. And in fact, it'll be much faster. It's also much faster. We have much faster networking, I'm not going into all of that. But this is a huge differentiator between us and everybody else. And customers are beginning to see that. They are beginning to understand the architectural differences. A lot of the world security agencies are now coming to us and saying, hey, this looks really good, we're going to go with this, not Amazon or somebody else because of these architectural distinctions. Also, a bunch of people are running high-performance workloads on our cloud. We have a much fancier network. We have RDMA capability built into our network that the other guys don't have. That's because we redid that. We didn't have it in Gen 1, we have it in Gen 2. It allows us to run large machine learning workloads, rendering, simulations, all sorts of high-performance computing way better than our competitors. So there are a bunch of applications we just do better and people are beginning to notice and they are beginning to move and buy."

As you can see, we had a terrific quarter with total revenue growth 1 point above the high end of my guidance and earnings per share $0.07 above the high end of my U.S. dollar guidance. I'll first go over Q4 and recap fiscal year 2019 before moving on to my guidance. I'll then turn the call over to Larry and Mark for their comments. 
As in prior quarters, I'll review our non-GAAP results using constant dollar growth rates unless I say otherwise. Now the effects of currency movements in Q4 were largely as expected, maybe a smidge more incremental headwind than expected, but that was not a full percentage more. Anyway, total Cloud Services and License Support revenues for the quarter were $6.8 billion, up 3%, while Cloud License and On-Premise License revenues were $2.5 billion, up 15%. In particular, technology license growth was up 19%, making it abundantly clear that customers are investing in the Oracle platform. The key database options necessary to run the Oracle Autonomous Database service grew 21%. I cannot stress enough the stability and growth of our base of customers quarter-after-quarter. 
Our customers are maintaining and expanding their Oracle environment. And in our BYOL, Bring Your Own License model, they have the portability to use their licenses on-premise, in the cloud or via hybrid environment. This popularity is largely because our products are capable of doing things others just can't do, whether it's security, performance or scalability, and in our cloud, autonomous capabilities. As our customers adopt our technologies, whether via licenses or cloud services, our overall customer base is growing and that growth is starting to accelerate. 
In addition, the recent interconnect agreement with Microsoft will only help accelerate the transition from on-premise database to the Autonomous Database service. 
Now to the numbers. The gross margin for Cloud Services and License Support was 86%. And as we continue to scale and grow, I expect this will go even higher. Total revenues for the quarter were $11.1 billion, up 4% from last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $5.3 billion, up 7% from last year. And the operating margin was 47%, which was up from 46% last year. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was at 16.4%, slightly below our base tax rate of 20% as a result of some discrete items. And EPS was $1.16 in U.S. dollars and up 27% in constant currency and 23% in USD. 
The GAAP tax rate was 3.3%, also a result of some discrete items. And GAAP EPS was $1.07 in U.S. dollars and up 41% in constant currency, 36% in U.S. dollars. 
Now moving on to recap the full fiscal year. Total Cloud Services and License Support revenue was $26.7 billion, growing 4%. Total company revenues for the year was $39.5 billion, growing 3% compared to 2% total revenue growth in FY '18. Non-GAAP EPS was USD 3.52, up 19% in constant currency, up 16% in U.S. dollars, driven by operating income growth, share repurchases and lower tax rate. This is mirrored in our operating margin percentage for the full year, which was up slightly to 44% this year. 
As a reminder, our best ever full year operating margin was 47%, and I expect we will surpass that in the coming years as our total revenue growth accelerates and we benefit from greater scale in our business. 
Operating cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $14.6 billion, lower than last year, only because, as you will see at the bottom of our cash flow statement in the 10-K, FY '19 cash tax payments were $1.3 billion higher this year, including the $610 million installment towards the transition tax in Q2 and nearly $540 million in higher tax payments in Q4. 
Capital expenditures for the year were $1.7 billion. And free cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $12.9 billion. We now have approximately $38 billion in cash and marketable securities. The short-term deferred revenue balance is $8.4 billion, up 3% in constant currency. 
As we've said before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and a dividend. This quarter, we repurchased 112 million shares for a total of $6 billion. Over the last 12 months, we have repurchased 734 million shares for a total of $36 billion. Over the last 5 years, we have reduced the shares outstanding by almost 25% with nearly 60% of the total reduction this past year in FY '19. 
In addition, we've paid out dividends of $2.9 billion over the last 12 months and the Board of Directors again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.24 per share. 
Now to the guidance. My guidance today is a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency. Assuming the current exchange rates remain the same as they are now, currency should have about a 1% negative effect on total revenues and about $0.01 negative effect on EPS. So for Q1, total revenues are expected to grow between 1% to 3% in constant currency. And assuming a 1% currency headwind, total revenues are expected to grow between 0% and 2% in USD. 
Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to grow between 14% to 16% and be between $0.81 and $0.83 in constant currency. And assuming the $0.01 headwind, non-GAAP EPS in USD is expected to grow between 12% and 14% and be between $0.80 and $0.82 in USD. 
Now this past year, we grew 3%. And for fiscal year 2020, I expect total revenue will grow faster than last year constant currency, of course, and that we will once again report double-digit EPS growth. Total CapEx for fiscal year '20 is expected to be about $2.2 billion, but it could move a little depending on our bookings. My EPS guidance for Q1 and fiscal year '20 assumes our base rate of 20%. However, onetime tax events could cause actual tax rates for any given quarter to vary from our base, both higher or lower. But I expect that in normalizing for these onetime tax events, our tax rate will average around 20% for fiscal year 2020. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Mark for his comments."

Total revenue was up 4% in constant currency with Cloud License and Support up 3% and EPS up 27% in constant currency. 
In apps, we had a great momentum. We grew 6% for the year. We're now at $11.5 billion in trailing 12 months' revenue, 92% of that recurs. We continue to grow revenue faster than market. And we have just an enormous opportunity in front of us in ERP and HCM, and I'll talk to that in a second. 
In SaaS revenue and bookings, let me just give you a few stats to give you some context of what happened. Overall ERP and HCM annualized SaaS revenue is now $2.9 billion or call it $3 billion, and it was up in the high 20s. Fusion apps revenue was plus 36% in Q4 and up 32% for the full year. Fusion HCM was up 25% in Q4, solid growth with nice wins that I'll discuss again in a second. Fusion ERP revenue was up 44% and also up 44% for the full year. 
NetSuite ERP was up 28% in Q4 as the strong momentum continues. They had strong bookings in the quarter. And I remind you that last Q4, they had 72% growth in bookings. In addition, there was a plus 30% growth in bookings this Q4. And that's what drove this revenue growth. And when we acquired NetSuite, we had roughly 15% growth rates, and those have darn near doubled now since the acquisition. 
In our verticals, revenue was up 19% and 32% for the year. In our Data as a Service, just to give you some further context within our SaaS business, our challenges related to the broader privacy issues continued and revenue was down 15%. 
Now I'm going to give you an IDC quote that I have to read as-is, so I can't improvise. But let me give you the quotes, the words and then the close quotes. ""Per IDC's latest annual market share results, Oracle gained the most market share globally out of all enterprise applications SaaS vendors 3 years running, in calendar year '16, '17 and '18."" And I can't improvise on that quote, although I'd like to. So anyway, we just have strong momentum in the app space. I'll talk to you about some of the wins in a second. 
In our infrastructure ecosystem, the GapTech ecosystem was $21.1 billion on a trailing 12 months' basis and Q4 was up 7% with database up mid-single digits, driven by mid-teens database license growth. And let me repeat that, mid-teens database license growth. 
Autonomous Database, and I'm telling you, while the numbers helped us in Q4, they were still small. But the -- if you extrapolate them, they are relatively -- not relatively, they are very significant. More than 5,000 new trials were added in Q4 alone. We've got a great pull-through business with 40% of our Q4 wins, so 40% of the time we win on Autonomous Database, we pull through analytics. 
We're adding many new customers. So of all the customers we're adding with Autonomous Database, and you might think we're replacing just our base, which by the way we'd be glad to do, about 20% of our customers are just brand new to Oracle. They were not an Oracle Database customer when they bought the Autonomous Database. And new workloads are 40%, meaning that I'm an Oracle Database customer, but I'm putting a different workload on the Autonomous Database than I had on the Oracle Database. So we have both new and existing customers doing both. 
Now to Safra's point, and she hit it briefly, I want to hit it just a little harder. In the key database options that you need to run autonomous, so these being rack and multi-tenant and Active Data Guard if you want the SLA, our license growth was up 21%. So what do you think the market is growing, 2, 3, 3.4, whatever number you think from your favorite analyst, this was a huge share gain customer for us -- or share gain quarter for us in database. It was a solid quarter. We exceeded our revenue target and saw 27% EPS growth. Our bookings growth climbed with our renewal rates, meaning our continuing renewal rates of existing customers gives us confidence that our cloud apps business will also just continue to strengthen from here. 
Now I thought I'd give you just a couple of key wins we had during the quarter. And I'm going to try and give you a little more color of the typical size of the companies we're selling to. I might even try and give you a little bit about who we replaced in the deal and give you some rhythm, so you get a feel for all of this. Some of our key wins, and I'll focus on some back office wins, Argo Insurance (sic) [ Group ], about a $2 billion company; Coronado Curragh, a mining company in Australia, $2.3 billion company. Diebold Nixdorf, that's an interesting one, because I used to compete with them when I was at NCR. Diebold bought Nixdorf. And Diebold was an EBS customer. Nixdorf was an SAP customer. They combined the 2, and they will be going to Oracle Cloud ERP. The whole Diebold Nixdorf will run on Oracle Cloud ERP. 
NG, out of Brazil, about $1.3 billion, they bought ERP supply chain and procurement, fantastic win for us. And they were running on TOTVS, a Brazilian ERP company. And so they are net new to Oracle. Exterion, which is a $1 billion company, bought our whole -- really our whole ERP suite, ERP planning, supply chain, procurement. They did it against a background of basically having a little bit of everything. They had a little bit of EBS, a little bit of SAP and a little bit of Microsoft and replaced it all with the Oracle Cloud. 
Now this company you may never have heard of, Helmerich & Payne, the reason I've heard of them is their stock symbol on The New York Stock Exchange was HP. And for years, I wanted their stock symbol. And they are about a $1.6 billion company. And while I never got the stock symbol from them, we have replaced Epicor with Oracle Cloud ERP at Helmerich & Payne.
So anyway, that would just give you some idea on that. Ferguson, which is one of the largest plumbing wholesale and distribution companies, they're a $21 billion company. They bought ERP, EPM, supply chain, procurement, just a tremendous, tremendous win for us and very looking to partner with them. Santander in the U.S., another tremendous win for us. Wright Medical, which was very competitive. Emerson Electric, Rutgers University, which has deployed not only all of our financials and ERP, but are deploying our new student scheduling system, which deals with all of commissions and -- not commissions, but grants and discounting, very difficult stuff to deal with in higher ed. So a very key win for us in the quarter. 
A great HCM win at Waste Management. Waste Management is a $13 billion company in Houston. This is HCM, payroll, talent, some amount of ERP. Tiffany, I'm sure all of you bought something from Tiffany for some important occasion, Tiffany will be running on our HCM location. 
Okay. I'm getting a sign to stop here, but it was a very good quarter in terms of just quality logos. And I think what I was -- let me just try to do one -- maybe a couple of other things for you just to give you some flavor. So we get asked this in Q&A a lot. 
I'm just reading down the list. And of what I'm looking at is about 150 on my page, I'd say 120 bought more than one module from us. And if I read the competitors or the incumbents that got replaced, they start SAP, EBS, EBS, TOTVS, Microsoft, Epicor, Epicor, Infor, Lawson, Infinium, Microsoft, EBS, I mean, I could go on and on. But that will give you a flavor that we're getting as many, and I didn't do this accounting exactly, but as many of our logos from outside of the traditional Oracle user base as we are from the Oracle user base. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry."

It's not even bookings that drive it. Bookings that lead to increased consumption triggers our just-in-time provisioning of our hardware into our public clouds.

Why is it attractive to -- why is it good to attract developers, because developers write applications and the most important applications are ISV applications, which are used across the board. So I don't think anything has changed at all. Developers were always, if you will, the foundation of our business. We have over 1 million developers in our ecosystem already. And most ISVs, most of the current ISVs in the cloud use the Oracle Database. I mean, everything the Salesforce.com runs pretty much is running on the Oracle Database. Everything that SAP acquired to run in the cloud runs on the Oracle Database. Now I know SAP said they're going to move to HANA, but they said that 6 years ago, haven't quite gotten there yet. Anyway, the -- we go after developers -- and in fact, yesterday, we were putting the finishing touches of a program we're going to be announcing to developers at Oracle OpenWorld, which is basically free services to developers, forever, if you will. So developers and college entrepreneurs can -- this is free service. We'll be able to provide this free service that will let developers to start on the Oracle Cloud, build their applications and graduate from being maybe a solo entrepreneur some place in a dorm in MIT to eventually being an entrepreneur starting a company and then becoming an ISV. That's the cycle we want to sign up people early, and we have all sorts of cloud programs we're putting in place to be able to do that."

That's one key feature and we've seen sales of that skyrocket. The other key feature of Autonomous Database that's required to use Autonomous Database is this feature called rack. Rack is the ability to use multiple computers to run a single application or a single database instance. 
So in case one of those computers should fail, we tolerate that failure and the application keeps running, because we have multiple computers. You might have one. You might have 2, 3, 4. But you lose 1 or 2, you still have 2, 3, 4 left, whatever you -- however you configure the system. We will only configure Autonomous Database with multiple computers. Autonomous Database never fails. You must have the rack option to ensure that. Rack options are growing more rapidly than you would expect, being driven again by consumption of the Autonomous Database. So we're seeing very, very rapid adoption. In fact, it's -- and another thing -- to add a little color to this, initial transaction, a lot of our existing customers might come on with a very small project, let's say, a $30,000 ARR project. And within 60, 90, 120 days, that becomes $120,000 project. And after another few months, it becomes $0.5 million project. So we're really optimistic about this business. And the optimism -- and I'm just back to what I said earlier, the optimism was not in Safra's guidance, which is based on sales forecast. The thing that I find fascinating are the consumption data curves, which shows our consumption rate growing much faster than the fields currently anticipating. To me, that's just wonderfully encouraging, and hopefully, this is the beginning of the trend. We'll find out soon."

And also I wanted to ask you, I mean, SAP is going through where they are trying to get customers to replatform. How much of an opportunity is that for you to go and potentially win back some of those customers or to win some of those customers for the first time?

I think, to your point, SAP is forcing all their customers to a new platform by beginning of 2025. That forces all their customers to move and all the changes, not just the changes they've just made, but all the changes they made to the code have to be remade to the code. And what that means is they have to roll up a big new bill to move to this thing Larry called earlier, HANA. And it's a big damn bill. And so the poor CIO or CFO, whoever this guy is, has to show up to the Board and says to the Board of Directors, we've got a $500 million bill to move to HANA. And you all on the phone are smart. My guess is the Board members says something clever like what's HANA. And the guy goes, well, it's a platform. And the guy goes, well, what's a platform? And he goes, well, it's a new thing we run our ERP on. The guy goes, oh, okay. And it costs $500 million? And the guy goes, oh, yes. And he goes what do we get for it? And he goes, well, we get some new plumbing and we get some new this. I just think that meeting goes very badly. And somewhere in the meeting, the customer goes who else have you talked to? Do we have an alternative? Could we not do it? Could we go with somebody else? 
So yes, I mean, I think it's an incredibly interesting strategy on their part to put all their customers at play. Do we get calls from customers that we haven't been called or talked to in 20 years? The answer is yes. And is it because -- and remember, Heather, you know this that when we sold to customers 15 years ago, they never really talked to SAP after that and vice versa, because you're expected to stay with these ERP systems forever. So yes, some percent of their base will move as a result of just this, because it's a lot of money for not getting much, real simple. And the rest of the..."

I think the greatest story you can see here is the NetSuite story that we doubled the rate. And if I didn't say enough things about NetSuite, because I'm sure the NetSuite team is listening. Let me say, NetSuite, NetSuite, NetSuite. They have just done a fabulous job and they are doing a fabulous job not just growing internationally, but growing domestically. A lot of this performance in NetSuite is just pure U.S. domestic performance, more salespeople, more industries, micro industries that we build for, better execution. And so between NetSuite and Fusion, we've just had a really good run. I won't tell you everything is perfect, which is really good news. With these numbers, we can do better. We can do better.

Our Gen 2 Cloud is dramatically better, I think, not only than our Gen 1 Cloud, but other people's, the existing clouds. We have -- without going through a lot on this, we have an architecture where we have 2 separate computers in each computer that you rent, if you will. And we have the Intel computer that you rent and then we have another processor with separate memory that has all of our cloud control code. So that's very different than Amazon or Google or Azure as an architecture. That's true with every single computer in our Gen 2 Cloud is really 2 computers, the one that the customer uses and another one that we use to manage the cloud and encrypt the data and encapsulate the messaging and virtualize the messaging and do all of that. The -- it's impossible for a cloud customer to get at our code and hack it. And it's also impossible for our programmers to look at our customers' data. So we did this. We redid our architecture, because we decided that existing architectures, infrastructure architectures had just too many vulnerabilities. And so we bit the bullet, said, okay, we're going to freeze OCI Classic, we're going to invest in Gen 2 that gives us this much more secure, much more reliable platform. And in fact, it'll be much faster. It's also much faster. We have much faster networking, I'm not going into all of that. But this is a huge differentiator between us and everybody else. And customers are beginning to see that. They are beginning to understand the architectural differences. A lot of the world security agencies are now coming to us and saying, hey, this looks really good, we're going to go with this, not Amazon or somebody else because of these architectural distinctions. Also, a bunch of people are running high-performance workloads on our cloud. We have a much fancier network. We have RDMA capability built into our network that the other guys don't have. That's because we redid that. We didn't have it in Gen 1, we have it in Gen 2. It allows us to run large machine learning workloads, rendering, simulations, all sorts of high-performance computing way better than our competitors. So there are a bunch of applications we just do better and people are beginning to notice and they are beginning to move and buy."

And so the effects of the currency movements in Q1 were modestly more than expected with a 1.3% headwind to total revenues and $0.01 headwind to earnings per share, both results were in line with my guidance range. 
Total Cloud Services and License Support revenues for the quarter were $6.8 billion, up 4% and accounting for nearly 3/4 of total company revenues, and most of all of this revenue is recurring. Cloud and On-premise License revenues were $812 million, down 6%, coming off 15% license growth last quarter. And as a reminder, because Q1 is normally our smallest quarter, we tend to see more volatility in new software license growth rates in Q1. 
In terms of ecosystems, GAAP applications ecosystem revenues were $2.8 billion, up 3%, with Fusion apps up nearly 40%, including Fusion ERP up mid-40s and Fusion HCM, up low 30.  NetSuite ERP was up in the mid-20s. Vertical SaaS was up high single digits, while data cloud was down in the low teens. 
On a trailing 12-month basis, more than 90% of our application ecosystem revenue is now recurring. GAAP, infrastructure ecosystem revenues were $4.8 billion, up 3%, with total database revenue up similarly highlighted by BYOL and Autonomous Database revenues, both up triple digits, but also small base for now. 
On a trailing 12-month basis, more than [ 3 quarters ] of our infrastructure ecosystem is now recurring. In terms of geographies, we saw double-digit revenue growth in cloud revenue in all regions with especially strong results in Latin America and Asia Pacific. The gross margin for Cloud Services and License Support was 86%. And as we continue to scale and grow, I expect our cloud gross margins will go higher, driving an acceleration in our gross profit growth. 
Total revenue for the quarter were $9.2 billion, up 1% from last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $3.8 billion, up 4% from last year, and the operating margin was 42%, up from 41% last year. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was at 9.8%, slightly below our base tax rate of 20%, and EPS was $0.81 in USD and up 16% in constant dollar and 14% in USD. The GAAP tax rate was 13.9%, and GAAP EPS was USD 0.63 in and up 13% in constant currency and 11% in USD. 
Operating cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $13.8 billion. Over the last 4 quarters, capital expenditures were $1.7 billion, and free cash flow was $12.2 billion. We now have approximately $36 billion in cash and marketable securities, and the short-term deferred revenue balance is $10.9 billion. As we've said before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisition, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and the dividend. 
This quarter, we repurchased 89 million shares for a total of $5 billion. Over the last 12 months, we've repurchased 611 million shares for a total of $31 billion. And over the last 5 years, we have reduced the shares outstanding by more than 25%. The Board of Directors increased the authorization for share repurchases by an additional $15 billion and again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.24 per share. 
My guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currencies. Assuming current exchange rates remain the same as they are now, currency should have a 1% negative effect on total revenue and $0.01 negative on EPS. Of course, that could change. So for Q2, total revenues are expected to grow 1% to 3% in constant currency, and assuming a 1% currency headwind, total revenues are expected to grow from 0 to 2% in U.S. dollars. Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to grow between 10% to 12% and be between $0.88 and $0.90 in constant currency, and assuming the $0.01 headwind, non-GAAP EPS in U.S. dollars is expected to grow between 1 -- 9% and 11% and be between USD 0.87 and USD 0.89. 
For fiscal 2020 and the third consecutive fiscal quarter, I expect that we will report double-digit EPS growth in constant currency. Total CapEx for fiscal year '20 is expected to be around $2.2 billion, but it could move a little depending on our bookings and how much we need to invest to accommodate them. My EPS guidance for Q2 and fiscal '20 assumes a base tax rate of 20%. However, onetime tax events could cause actual tax rates for any given quarter to vary from our base tax rate. But I expect that in normalizing for these onetime tax events, our tax rate will average around 20% for fiscal year 2020. 
I'm turning the call over to Larry for his comments who will spend a little time highlighting some of the key wins we had during the quarter, with emphasis on back office applications and then talk about autonomous database."

And we have a massive opportunity ahead of us in both ERP and HCM. Not only do we have an enormous installed base of existing ERP and HCM customers who can operate to the cloud, but more than half of the current ERP and HCM market is served by companies who have no SaaS upgrade path. These companies' products are vulnerable to being replaced, and we're in the process of replacing them. Our investments in Fusion has not only enabled our strong back-office results over the last few years, but they've positioned us to become not just the biggest back office player in the cloud, which we already are, but the biggest back office player. Period. Cloud on-premises, call it. 
So with that, here are some key Fusion ERP wins from Q1. DP World, Shaw Communications, Bangkok Bank of Thailand is upgrading their e-business suite with our Fusion Financial Cloud service and our Fusion Financial and Enterprise performance management. Envision Healthcare, where we beat Workday, and we're replacing Envision Healthcare's legacy system, which is an in 4 [indiscernible] system. Express Scripts, who is in the process of migrating from Hyperion on-premise to the Fusion EPM in the cloud. This is their first cloud application. Lyft, who is operating a portion of their ERP system that was started about it next week, but is now Fusion as they plan for growth going forward. Media News Room, another competitive win against Workday. National Oil Varco in a nice expansion both their EPM and supply chain management that was closed last year. So they're just -- they're adding more products, they're adding more of our overall Fusion suite. NGL Energy Partners has also bought our Fusion ERP suite and supply chain management. National Gaming is an online gaming company. And that was a competitive win against the unnamed German company located at a town called Waldorf. Standard Group Limited, a large garment manufacturer where we beat that same Waldorf German company. Southern Company is a utility that was running e-business suite and PeopleSoft. E-business suite financials and PeopleSoft HCM, and they're moving to the Fusion Cloud suite overall. Financials, HCM, everything. 
Continuing, we've got some great -- some great holdup HCM wins. BAE Systems chose Fusion HCM to upgrade their HR technology and standardize on the cloud. Dubai Holdings where we're expanding our relationship by adding both Fusion HCM and Taleo over recruited. Envision Healthcare is adding infusion HCM to the already-purchased Fusion ERP suite. A very large transportation entity in the U.K. and airport, who is a long-term E-Business suite customer is moving from on-premise to the Fusion suite in the cloud. 
Here's a company everyone's always heard of and probably visited many times, McDonald's. McDonald's McDonald's chose our HCM, they chose our payroll -- and this was a battle between us and Workday, we won, and we're displacing their on-premise legacy system. 
Nestlé, Southwest Gas, where we're displacing SAP, and we beat Workday as Southwest Gas decided to move from SAP on-premise to the cloud, and they fit us. 
The University of Texas, and we're actually engaged with them on not only providing cloud technology, but also consulting support to migrate them from PeopleSoft and on-premise to the Fusion HCM in the cloud. 
And it's just not a bunch of customer wins that marks our success. Industry analysts, including IDC, are taking notice as they survey their customers. In the 2019 SaaS Path Survey that IDC released in May of 2019, it surveyed over 1,500 of their SaaS customers on their experience with offsets vendors, including Oracle, SAP, Salesforce, Workday, Microsoft, all of them. Oracle SaaS had the highest rating among all SaaS vendors survey period. So you can see, we're at the beginning of a back office upgrade cycle that will benefit our applications ecosystem for years to come. We're already overwhelmingly the largest ERP system in the cloud. And again, it won't be long before we're just the largest ERP supplier period. 
The second area I'd like to talk about is the Autonomous Database because we think this is a game changer. A game changer. Interesting term. It's like a cliche, a little bit of marketing hype. 
Let me explain how important this is. Autonomous technology is the key element that differentiates a second generation cloud from the first generation cloud. Now for the first generation cloud, your real benefit, you were going to rent computers and you only pay for what you use. And the benefit of a second generation -- not so great benefit, obviously. It's a first-generation cloud, pay for what you use when you use it. Second-generation cloud, not only do we deliver the benefits of pay-per-per use, we also take the human labor out of running the cloud. That's an even bigger economic savings. The sharing computers and renting computers is not as costly as paying for the labor to run those computers. So from an economic advantage, a second-generation autonomous cloud is much less expensive to run than a first-generation cloud. But that's not what's really important. What's really important is the second-generation autonomous cloud prevents data theft, which you can never do in a first-generation manual cloud. 
Let me point out how reasonable Amazon was when they refused to accept responsibility for the configuration errors made by the people at Capital One. They have a policies that you have control of your data, you have control of your system, you are responsible for running your system. And if you make mistakes, it's on you, it's not us. That is not an unreasonable position. When you have a totally manual system and your users are responsible for configuring the system, when your users are responsible for backing the system up, when your users are responsible for encrypting the data, when you users are responsible for patching the systems, user errors can lead to catastrophic results. 
In a manual system, there's no way to prevent that. In an Autonomous system, the Capital One data breach could never have happened because the Oracle Autonomous Database doesn't let human being configure the system. It configures itself automatically. The Oracle Autonomous Database system doesn't ask human beings to patch it, to close security holes. The system automatically patches itself while running. The Oracle Database doesn't ask if you want to back it up or if you want to encrypt your data, it does all of this automatically while it's running. The only way you can prevent dataset is to eliminate human error. The only way you can do that was with an autonomous database, and we have one and our competitors don't. This is a very big deal. What's the greatest thing about autonomous driving? And I was looking forward to autonomous driving, then they see the threat Uber and all this other stuff, but okay, that's all interesting. The greatest thing about autonomous driving, it's going to reduce human pilot error and cut down on accidents, by 90%, 95%, 98%, 99%. It's going to save lives. It's going to stop -- come close to eliminating pilot error. The Oracle Autonomous Database, you're a self-driving database, prevent users from making catastrophic mistakes, resulting in data loss. And there is no way to do it in a manual cloud. End of story.  That's what I mean by a game changer. You want to prevent data theft, you better be prepared to pay less because we take the labor out, it's huge cost savings. And we -- there are no human beings involved, and they can't make those common mistakes. 
All right. So we're still early on the Autonomous Database in terms of -- it's only been around -- we announced it in Open World 2017, 2 years ago, and really showed up in 2018, and now we're beginning to get some traction with this exciting new technology. It's proving to be the most exciting and successful new product offering in the history of our company. 
So here -- I'm sorry -- all right. So here's some recent data. In Q1, we added more than 3,700 new Autonomous Database trials. We now have over 2,000 customers, paying customers, for the Autonomous Database. We're seeing incredible pull-through with the Autonomous Database. I mean, when you come to Oracle, the Oracle Cloud use the Autonomous Database, and then you use a variety of other services. About 45% of the people who are using autonomous database are also using the our Oracle Analytics cloud. By the way, they're also using Microsoft analytics, they're using Cognos, they're using a variety of other tools, but primarily, they're using Oracle analytics. 
We've added many customers through autonomous database that weren't Oracle customers at all. Now 13% of the people using autonomous database have never bought a database from Oracle Corporation. 43% of the workloads that are going on to autonomous database are net new. They're not moving them from on-premise to Autonomous Database, but half of them are from -- to Autonomous Database. Almost the other half or 43% are just net new applications. We've had some fabulous wins in the quarter. Obviously, I'm not going to mention. We have over 500 wins, autonomous database wins in the quarter. I'm not going to mention all 500. But 7-Eleven is moving all their point-of-sale data to the autonomous data warehouse, Cargojet Canada, Johnson Controls, LatAm Airlines is moving their on-premise data centers to OCI to get the advantage and security of the autonomous database. Siemens Energy, Stanley Black & Decker, getting much faster data reporting on their analytics. Oh, yes, and one more company, moving to the autonomous databases, Uber. 
And with that, let's turn it back to the operator."

So there was a Cloud Services and License Support was strong this quarter, but license was not as strong as we modeled it anyway. And I realize it's a seasonally slow first quarter, and you said it follows the strongest and really strong fourth quarter as strong as we've seen in quite some time. But is there anything else you can share on that line? Any further color? For instance, BYOL has got a lot of traction, right? And could that cause your financials just to start to trend more seasonally sort of like you used to? I mean, it started to get a little more even in its still seasonal, but a little more even. Should we be starting to think of seasonality, how Oracle used to be even more seasonal? Or we're also hearing, and you guys -- you hear it, too. You hear from some other companies that talk about macro pressure. Are you seeing any of that at all? I'm just curious. Any color would be helpful."

First of all, outside of North America, our license was up quite a bit, in fact, internationally. What we had done in North America is we did do a split in the sales force. We've been telegraphing that we were doing that before we split the North America tech sales force between selling cloud, a group selling cloud, and a group selling new licenses. So the group selling new license was a new group. And so I expect that they will more than recover during the year. But that is the only -- that's the only weakness we had, and it was simply just a slow start as we rewarded the North America tech sales forces would split it. So there's no macro issue. There's no actual regular issue. And of course, the thing is that in Q1, small numbers make a big difference, and so they just kind of outsized.

So people buy multi-tenant, they buy rack, they buy in memory, they then pick out like those options and their existing licenses up and they move them to the cloud. 
So some of those sales were delayed because of the reorg, but we think the demand is enormous. And we think the leading indicator is just the number of trials we've signed up in Q1. 
So our cloud sales force, in terms of the cloud activity. We had incredible cloud activity. And we expect -- again, we signed more than 500 deals, Autonomous Database deals in Q1, 3,700 new trials to 500 signed paying customers more than, and we expect to double that in Q2. So we expect to go from well over 1,000 paying customers and that pipeline to just start building. That is the best early indicator.

We're picking on Lawson and we actually have sales territories which are Lawson Healthcare sales territory. So we go after the Lawson Healthcare customers, and we've rolled up a bunch of those. I'd say about 1/3 of their customers of Lawson Healthcare customers are in our pipeline. Either already converted or in our pipeline. So we expect to win all of those. We've just added some new sales territories, which are Lawson in retail territories, which is a combination of our Fusion financials and our retail merchandising products. And we think we -- that's also a very vulnerable company that in for really what they tried. A lot of people have tried to build cloud systems. It's not easy. I can attest to that. I have lots of cars. But in the Fusion, Fusion, just 10 years to get-go. I mean, it's a big deal. And that suite that overnight success to 20 -- been in business over 20 years, Salesforce been in business over 20 years. It takes a while to build these very complicated systems. And Lawson doesn't really have anything. So we're taking a bunch of their customers. 
But the one that's extraordinary is that SAP really does not have a true cloud system. SAP is doing some hosting there on a 2 cloud system. And now we're seeing kind of some of their larger -- not the very largest companies, but some of their medium, large companies go ahead and pick us, and we're converting them. But we are in conversations with their very largest SAP's very, very largest customers. We're in the middle of converting one of their very, very largest customers. And we think that, of course, is a huge opportunity. We think we -- right now, Oracle and SAP has about half the European market. I'm sorry, it's a very long answer. We have a -- the 2 of us have about half the European market, and the other half of the European market, as you say, highly fragmented. We started out by targeting the highly fragmented guys who are really weak and vulnerable, but we think the opportunity exists to roll it all up. 
If you look at our market share, I mean, I'm almost afraid to mention what our market share in ERP in the cloud is. What is it? 95%. I mean, I don't know. I mean, just -- I guess that, but I don't know because I don't know if any other cloud ERP system other than NetSuite and Fusion. So maybe 9% to 5% is low. I mean, it's -- I mean, it sounds a little crazy, but SAP, SAP really did not rewrite their code, they really don't have a cloud system, and we have an opportunity to go after them and just put that aside. And then that whole other half of the ERP marketplace, which is companies that a lot of people have never heard of. And yes, I think we can consolidate virtually all of that. I mean, I don't want to crazy opportunity. You don't see this happen very well."

I mean, when Safra gives you a forecast, she's not forecasting. So this curve is incredibly steep growth curve in autonomous database. So we're giving you, I would say, a conservative point of view, especially in terms of autonomous database. And -- but again, this is the case where we have a technology that nobody else has. A, we are the dominant database supplier on the planet earth. We're bigger than IBM and Microsoft combined. In the previous battles, the previous war on-premise, we were bigger than Microsoft and IBM combined, our 2 biggest competitors. 
The cloud, they're a bunch of open source cloud databases, and they're a lot of more specialized. And then there probably dozen of them or more for that matter. But none of them are autonomous, none of them are secure, none of them packs themselves while running, none of them give you 99.995% availability. I mean, we're 100x more reliable. I mean, seriously, 100x more reliable than these guys. We have the only system that we can pretty much ensure that your data can't be stolen because you're -- because you can't make pilot errors. You can't commit -- you can't make mistakes because all that -- all of those decisions are automated. So it's another -- I mean, so we're sitting in 2 markets that we have an opportunity of completely dominating and own it. One is ERP, where we've been in it for a while and you actually can see the data, you can actually see the curve, and the curve's -- we have enough years of data that you can see the slope of the curve, and you can do these market share studies, even there are always analyst reports and all that. And we've made great progress in that, and you can see it. 
In the autonomous database, all you can do is listen to me talk about this extraordinary technology. And we're so early on in the curve, we've got such little data in the curve. I understand, and even we're playing let's wait and see what this turns out to be. But we have this gigantic installed base that's, I think, going to go with autonomous database. But it's not just that. It's not safe to go to any other database. That's a pretty good differentiator. And it's our second extraordinary opportunity. The ERP back office in the cloud, autonomous database in the cloud. We're successful in those 2 markets. Should be enough to make a living."

I was wondering just we've seen a lot of results since August, early August come in where maybe results haven't been as good as people wide. I'm just wondering if you're seeing -- if you saw any elongation in the sales cycles, if there's anything you can share with us there just globally from what you've been seeing? 
And then secondly, just a question related to OCI, and I know, obviously, open roles next week, there'll be a lot of partners to talk to.

And -- but we're not stopping at Autonomous Database. At OpenWorld, we'll be announcing a whole bunch of new autonomous services. No one is doing this. But we're not talking to autonomous Database. So you're going to see a bunch of arguments where we take that same machine learning technology to develop other autonomous services. And we're on our way. I mean, it's our goal to deliver the world's first and only completely autonomous cloud, the most important thing in keeping your data set. But we'd like -- I mean, you really should have an autonomous operating system, you should have usually have a bunch of autonomous services in that to operate that cloud so human beings aren't given the opportunity to make mistakes. And people can concentrate on building applications rather than managing the plumbing of the cloud, which is complicated and error prone and expensive. So we want to take -- get rid of the expense, get rid of the errors, start with the autonomous database, you'll see a bunch more announcements of new autonomous services in OCI. And OCI is definitely on a roll. If people come to look at autonomous database, they look around in the Oracle Cloud and they see our analytics. Our compute, I can talk about all these other things. But we have -- we really have a second-generation cloud that's highly differentiated from our friends at Amazon or Google."

And I think the strategy of land and expand, which is what Amazon has used in marketing their products, you get in them for one project and you're successful on that project and you go to the next project, it's been very different than the way Oracle has been selling in the past. We have adopted with autonomous database. We've adopted that land, start small, get in there on a project that demonstrates how great this technology is and then get another project, another project after that. So we've adopted this land-and-expand approach. And we have many examples where people have been successful in their first projects have moved on to 2 more, move on -- and then moved on to 10 more after that. 
So our -- so we see, again, the opportunity is gigantic. The fact that we have 4 -- that we added 4,000 -- almost 4,000 trials, short of 4,000 trials in Q1 as an example of how we're really getting traction now and the word is getting out about how good the Autonomous Database is.

They've not brought those critical large and security-conscious workloads, they've not brought them to the cloud so far. They didn't bring them to the other vendors. The other vendors are all actually having trouble in the enterprise with these important workflows. They've been waiting for us. And so as they've started to bring smaller workloads in, they can start quite small, and then their next buy is 10x the size, and the opportunities often a 1,000x the size. And that's what we're starting to see. 
How long will it take? I don't know. We're not -- we're trying to just go with it. You have to understand that many of these can also go, just pay as you go, they're never forecasted. A customer just tries it, and before you know it, it's expanding. The opportunity is literally enormous because many of these workloads that can't go to the cloud any other way. Those that have tried have been either unsuccessful or it's been both expensive and risk their security situation. So this is a very, very powerful moment for us. We're not going to overplay it here. We're just going to ride along with it. You're going to hear at Open World from some of these customers, and it's very much like originally, when we start to talk to you about our Engineered systems, where a customer would try a little bit, they'll try one a quarter, and before you know it, they had dozens.

So first, yes, this was a very quick close, but we've got the technology and the people to do it. 
Let me just answer your deferred revenue comment. So I just want you to understand, gross deferred revenue is actually up 3%, okay? But we net it to a bunch of things that ultimately are simply timing changes related to collections. And so that's really the only thing. There's nothing unusual. Next quarter, you may see something different. It's literally a matter of when we pay some things and that kind of shows up in the operating cash flow. But in deferred revenue, it's simply timing of collections. There's a little bit impacted by currency, but the gross deferred revenue number is actually up 3%. It's just netted down, and it's just a matter of the timing of our collections. So nothing to see here."

Of course, September 11 is an important day for our country and for us at Oracle. Many of you know that we lost 11 of our employees and many friends that day, and we honor all the victims today and every day. May their memories be a blessing to all of us.
We originally planned to hold this call tomorrow. However, as Mark will be taking a leave of absence for health-related reasons, we felt it made sense to share all of our news at once. Mark was extremely engaged with the business through the end of the quarter, but now he needs to focus on his health and taking care of himself. As the 3 of us have always worked as a team on managing Oracle, Larry and I will cover Mark's responsibilities during his absence with support from the rest of our strong management team.
Now switching to the first quarter. I will review our non-GAAP results using constant dollar growth rates unless I state otherwise. And though the effects of the currency movements in Q1 were modestly more than expected with a 1.3% headwind to total revenues and $0.01 headwind to earnings per share, both results were in line with my guidance range. Total Cloud Services and License Support revenues for the quarter were $6.8 billion, up 4% and accounting for nearly 3/4 of total company revenues, and most of all of this revenue is recurring. Cloud and On-Premise License revenues were $812 million, down 6%, coming off 15% license growth last quarter. And as a reminder, because Q1 is normally our smallest quarter, we tend to see more volatility in new software license growth rates in Q1.
In terms of ecosystems, GAAP applications ecosystem revenues were $2.8 billion, up 3%, with Fusion apps up nearly 40%, including Fusion ERP up mid-40s and Fusion HCM, up low 30s. NetSuite ERP was up in the mid-20s. Vertical SaaS was up high single digits, while Data Cloud was down in the low teens. On a trailing 12-month basis, more than 90% of our application ecosystem revenue is now recurring. GAAP infrastructure ecosystem revenues were $4.8 billion, up 3%, with total database revenue up similarly highlighted by BYOL and Autonomous Database revenues, both up triple digits, but also small base for now. On a trailing 12-month basis, more than 3/4 of our infrastructure ecosystem is now recurring.
In terms of geographies, we saw double-digit revenue growth in cloud revenue in all regions with especially strong results in Latin America and Asia Pacific. The gross margin for Cloud Services and License Support was 86%. And as we continue to scale and grow, I expect our cloud gross margins will go higher, driving an acceleration in our gross profit growth.
Total revenues for the quarter were $9.2 billion, up 1% from last year; non-GAAP operating income was $3.8 billion, up 4% from last year; and the operating margin was 42%, up from 41% last year. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was at 9.8%, slightly below our base tax rate of 20%, and EPS was USD 0.81 and up 16% in constant dollar and 14% in USD. The GAAP tax rate was 13.9%, and GAAP EPS was USD 0.63 and up 13% in constant currency and 11% in USD.
Operating cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $13.8 billion. Over the last 4 quarters, capital expenditures were $1.7 billion, and free cash flow was $12.2 billion. We now have approximately $36 billion in cash and marketable securities, and the short-term deferred revenue balance is $10.9 billion. As we've said before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisition, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and the dividend.
This quarter, we repurchased 89 million shares for a total of $5 billion. Over the last 12 months, we've repurchased 611 million shares for a total of $31 billion. And over the last 5 years, we have reduced the shares outstanding by more than 25%. The Board of Directors increased the authorization for share repurchases by an additional $15 billion and again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.24 per share.
My guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currencies. Assuming current exchange rates remain the same as they are now, currency should have a 1% negative effect on total revenue and $0.01 negative on EPS. Of course, that could change. So for Q2, total revenues are expected to grow 1% to 3% in constant currency. And assuming a 1% currency headwind, total revenues are expected to grow from 0 to 2% in U.S. dollars. Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to grow between 10% to 12% and be between $0.88 and $0.90 in constant currency. And assuming the $0.01 headwind, non-GAAP EPS in U.S. dollars is expected to grow between 1 -- 9% and 11% and be between USD 0.87 and USD 0.89.
For fiscal 2020 and the third consecutive fiscal quarter, I expect that we will report double-digit EPS growth in constant currency. Total CapEx for fiscal year '20 is expected to be around $2.2 billion, but it could move a little depending on our bookings and how much we need to invest to accommodate them. My EPS guidance for Q2 and fiscal '20 assumes a base tax rate of 20%. However, onetime tax events could cause actual tax rates for any given quarter to vary from our base tax rate. But I expect that in normalizing for these onetime tax events, our tax rate will average around 20% for fiscal year 2020.
I'm turning the call over to Larry for his comments who will spend a little time highlighting some of the key wins we had during the quarter with emphasis on back-office applications and then talk about autonomous database."

And we have a massive opportunity ahead of us in both ERP and HCM. Not only do we have an enormous installed base of existing ERP and HCM customers who can operate to the cloud, but more than half of the current ERP and HCM market is served by companies who have no SaaS upgrade path. These companies' products are vulnerable to being replaced, and we're in the process of replacing them. Our investments in Fusion has not only enabled our strong back-office results over the last few years, but they've positioned us to become not just the biggest back-office player in the cloud, which we already are, but the biggest back-office player, period. Cloud, on-premises, all of it.
So with that, here are some key Fusion ERP wins from Q1: DP World; Shaw Communications; Bangkok Bank of Thailand, who's upgrading their e-business suite with our Fusion Financials Cloud Service and our Fusion Financial Enterprise Performance Management; Envision Healthcare, where we beat Workday, and we're replacing Envision Healthcare's legacy system, which is an Infor Lawson system; Express Scripts, who's in the process of migrating from Hyperion on-premise to the Fusion EPM in the cloud, this is their first cloud application; Lyft, who's operating a portion of their ERP system that was -- started out as NetSuite but is now Fusion as they plan for growth going forward; media newsroom, another competitive win against Workday; National Oilwell Varco, in a nice expansion, both their EPM and supply chain management, that we closed last year, so they're just -- they're adding more products, they're adding more of our overall Fusion suite; NGL Energy Partners has also bought our Fusion ERP suite and supply chain management; Penn National Gaming is an online gaming company, and that was a competitive win against the unnamed German company located at a town called Waldorf; Standard Group Limited, a large garment manufacturer, where we beat that same Waldorf German company; Southern Company is a utility that was running E-Business Suite and PeopleSoft, E-Business Suite Financials and PeopleSoft HCM, and they're moving to the Fusion Cloud suite overall, Financials HCM, everything.
Continuing, we've got some great additional just HCM wins. BAE Systems chose Fusion HCM to upgrade their HR technology and standardize on the cloud. Dubai Holdings, where we're expanding our relationship by adding both Fusion HCM and Taleo for recruiting. Envision Healthcare is adding infusion HCM to the already-purchased Fusion ERP suite. A very large transportation entity in the U.K., an airport, who is a long-term E-Business Suite customer, is moving from on-premise to the Fusion suite in the cloud. Here's a company everyone's always heard of and probably has visited many times, McDonald's. McDonald's chose our HCM. They chose our payroll. And they -- this was a battle between us and Workday. We won. And we're displacing their on-premise legacy system. Nestlé; Southwest Gas, where we're displacing SAP, and we beat Workday as Southwest Gas decided to move from SAP on-premise to the cloud, and they picked us. The University of Texas, and we're actually engaged with them on not only providing cloud technology but also consulting support to migrate them from PeopleSoft on-premise to the Fusion HCM in the cloud.
And it's just not a bunch of customer wins that marks our success. Industry analysts, including IDC, are taking notice as they survey their customers. In the 2019 SaaS/PaaS survey that IDC released in May of 2019, it surveyed over 1,500 of their SaaS customers on their experience with all SaaS vendors, including Oracle, SAP, Salesforce, Workday, Microsoft, all of them. Oracle SaaS had the highest rating among all SaaS vendor survey, period. So you can see, we're at the beginning of a back-office upgrade cycle that will benefit our applications ecosystem for years to come. We're already overwhelmingly the largest ERP system in the cloud. And again, it won't be long before we're just the largest ERP supplier, period.
The second area I'd like to talk about is the Autonomous Database because we think this is a game changer. All right, game changer, interesting term. It sounds like a cliché, a little bit of marketing hype. Let me explain how important this is. Autonomous technology is the key element that differentiates a second-generation cloud from a first-generation cloud. Now in the first-generation cloud, your real benefit was you were going to rent computers, and you only pay for what you use. And the benefit of a second generation -- and not so great benefit, obviously, the first-generation cloud, pay for what you use when you use it. Second-generation cloud, not only do we deliver the benefits of pay per use, we also take the human labor out of running the cloud. That's an even bigger economic savings. Sharing computers and renting computers is not as costly as paying for the labor to run those computers. So from an economic advantage, a second-generation autonomous cloud is much less expensive to run than a first-generation cloud. But that's not what's really important. What's really important is the second-generation autonomous cloud prevents data theft, which you can never do in a first-generation manual cloud.
Let me point out how reasonable Amazon was when they refused to accept responsibility for the configuration errors made by the people at Capital One. They have a policy, so you have control of your data. You have control of your system. You are responsible for running your system. And if you make mistakes, it's on you, it's not on us. That is not an unreasonable position. When you have a totally manual system and your users are responsible for configuring the system, when your users are responsible for backing the system up, when your users are responsible for encrypting the data, when your users are responsible for patching the systems, user errors can lead to catastrophic results.
In a manual system, there's no way to prevent that. In an autonomous system, the Capital One data breach could never have happened because the Oracle Autonomous Database doesn't let a human being configure the system, it configures itself automatically. The Oracle Autonomous Database system doesn't ask human beings to patch it, to close security holes. The system automatically patches itself while running. The Oracle Database doesn't ask if you want to back it up or if you want to encrypt your data, it does all of this automatically while it's running. The only way you can prevent data theft is to eliminate human error. The only way you can do that was with an autonomous database, and we have one, and our competitors don't. This is a very big deal.
What's the greatest thing about autonomous driving? I was looking forward to autonomous driving. Then they've seen the threat to Uber and all this other stuff. But okay, that's all interesting. The greatest thing about autonomous driving, it's going to reduce human pilot error and cut down on accidents by 90%, 95%, 98%, 99%. It's going to save lives. It's going to stop -- come close to eliminating pilot error. The Oracle Autonomous Database, the Oracle self-driving database, prevents users from making catastrophic mistakes, resulting in data loss. And there is no way to do it in a manual cloud, end of story. That's what I mean by game changer. You want to prevent data theft, you better be prepared to pay less because we take the labor out, huge cost savings, and we -- there are no human beings involved, and they can't make those common mistakes.
All right. So we're still early on in the Autonomous Database in terms of -- it's only been around -- we announced it in Open World 2017 2 years ago and really showed up in 2018, and now we're beginning to get some traction with this exciting new technology. It's proving to be the most exciting and successful new product offering in the history of our company.
So here -- I'm sorry, I'm missing -- all right, so here's some recent data. In Q1, we added more than 3,700 new Autonomous Database trials. We now have over 2,000 customers, paying customers, for the Autonomous Database. We're seeing incredible pull-through with the Autonomous Database. And you come to Oracle -- the Oracle Cloud to use the Autonomous Database, and then you use a variety of other services. About 45% of the people who are using Autonomous Database are also using our Oracle Analytics Cloud. By the way, they're also using Microsoft analytics, they're using Cognos, they're using a variety of other tools. But primarily, they're using Oracle Analytics.
We've added many customers to Autonomous Database that weren't Oracle customers at all. 13% of the people using Autonomous Database had never bought a database from Oracle Corporation. 43% of the workloads that are going on to Autonomous Database are net new. They're not moving them from on-premise to the Autonomous Database, but half of them move from on-premise to Autonomous Database. Almost the other half, 43%, are just net-new applications.
We've had some fabulous wins in the quarter. Obviously, I'm not going to mention -- we have over 500 wins, Autonomous Database wins, in the quarter. I'm not going to mention all 500. But 7-Eleven is moving all their point-of-sale data to the Autonomous Data warehouse, Cargojet Canada, Johnson Controls, LATAM Airlines is moving their on-premise data centers to OCI to get the advantage and security of the Autonomous Database. Siemens Energy, Stanley Black & Decker, getting much faster data reporting on their analytics. Oh, yes, and one more company, moving to the Autonomous Database is Uber.
And with that, let's turn it back to the operator."

But is there anything else you can share on that line? Any further color? For instance, BYOL has got a lot of traction, right? And could that cause your financials just to start to trend more seasonally sort of like it used to? I mean it started to get a little more even, it's still seasonal but a little more even. Should we be starting to think of seasonality, how Oracle used to be even more seasonal?

We've been telegraphing that we were doing that before we split the North America tech sales force between selling cloud, a group selling cloud; and a group selling new licenses. So the group selling new license was a new group, and so I expect that they will more than recover during the year. But that is the only weakness we had, and it was simply just a slow start as we reorg-ed the North America tech sales force since we split it. So there's no macro issue. There's no actual regular issue. And of course, the thing is that in Q1, small numbers make a big difference, and so they just kind of outsized.

Again, the reorg in North America had a great impact on that because those are license sales, and then they bring those licenses to the cloud. So people buy multi-tenant. They buy rack. They buy in memory. They then pick up those options and their existing licenses up, and they move them to the cloud. So some of those sales were delayed because of the reorg, but we think the demand is enormous. And we think the leading indicator is just the number of trials we've signed up in Q1. So our cloud sales force, in terms of the cloud activity, we had incredible cloud activity. And we expect -- again, we signed more than 500 deals, Autonomous Database deals, in Q1. 3,700 new trials, the 500 signed paying customers, more of them, and we expect to double that in Q2. So we expect to go from well over 1,000 paying customers and that pipeline to just start building. That is the best early indicator.

We actually have sales territories which are Lawson Healthcare sales territories. So we go out there -- the Lawson Healthcare customers, and we've rolled up a bunch of those. I'd say about 1/3 of their customers, of Lawson Healthcare customers, are in our pipeline -- either already converted or in our pipeline. So we expect to win all of those. We've just added some new sales territories, which are Lawson retail territories, which is a combination of our Fusion Financials and our retail merchandising products. And we think -- we -- that's also a very vulnerable company that Infor really -- well, they tried. A lot of people have tried to build cloud systems. It's not easy. I can attest to that. I have lots of scars. But I mean Fusion took 10 years to get going. I mean, it's a big deal. And NetSuite, that overnight success took 20 -- been in business over 20 years. Salesforce has been in business over 20 years. It takes a while to build these very complicated systems. And Lawson doesn't really have anything, so we're taking a bunch of their customers.
But the one that's extraordinary is that SAP really does not have a true cloud system. SAP is doing some hosting, they don't have a true cloud systems. And now we're seeing kind of some of their larger -- not the very largest companies, but some of their medium, large companies go ahead and pick us, and we're converting them. But we are in conversations with their very largest -- SAP's very, very largest customers. We're in the middle of converting one of their very, very largest customers.

We have about half -- the 2 of us have about half of the European market. And the other half of the European market, as you say, highly fragmented.

I mean when Safra gives you a forecast, she's not forecasting some -- this incredibly steep growth curve in Autonomous Database. So we're giving you, I would say, a conservative point of view, especially in terms of Autonomous Database. And -- but again, this is the case where we have a technology that nobody else has. A, we are the dominant database supplier on the planet right now. We're bigger than IBM and Microsoft combined. In the previous battles, in the previous war on-premise, we were bigger than Microsoft and IBM combined, our 2 biggest competitors.
The cloud -- there are a bunch of open source cloud databases, and a lot of more specialized, I mean there are probably a dozen of them or more for that matter. But none of them are autonomous. None of them are secure. None of them task themselves while running. None of them give you 99.995% availability. I mean they're -- we're 100x more reliable. I mean seriously, 100x more reliable than these guys. We have the only system that we can pretty much ensure that your data can't be stolen because you're -- because you can't make pilot errors. You can't commit -- you can't make mistakes because that's -- all those decisions are automated.
So it's another -- I mean so we're sitting in 2 markets that we have an opportunity of completely dominating and owning. One is ERP, where we've been in it for a while and you actually can see the data, you can actually see the curve, and the curve's -- we have enough years of data that you can see the slope of the curve, and you can do these market share studies. There are always analyst reports and all that. And we've made great progress in that, and you can see it.
In the Autonomous Database, all you can do is listen to me talk about this extraordinary technology. And we're so early on in the curve, we've got such little data in the curve. I understand -- and even we're playing let's wait and see what this turns out to be. But we have this gigantic installed base that's, I think, going to go with Autonomous Database. But it's not just that, it's not safe to go to any other database. That's a pretty good differentiator. And it's our second extraordinary opportunity. ERP back-office in the cloud, Autonomous Database in the cloud, we're successful in those 2 markets, it should be enough to make a living."

We've adopted that land, start small, get in there on a project that demonstrates how great this technology is, and then get another project and another project after that. So we've adopted this land-and-expand approach. And we have many examples where people have been successful in their first projects and have moved on to 2 more, moved on to -- and then moved on to 10 more after that.
So we see -- again, the opportunity is gigantic. The fact that we have 4 -- that we added 4,000 -- almost 4,000 trials, short of 4,000 trials, in Q1 is an example of how we're really getting traction now, and the word is getting out about how good the Autonomous Database is, how big is it as an overall market."

They've not brought those critical, large and security-conscious workloads. They've not brought them to the cloud so far. They didn't bring them to the other vendors. The other vendors are all actually having trouble in the enterprise with these important workloads. They have been waiting for us. And so as they've started to bring smaller workloads in, they can start quite small. And then their next buy is 10x the size, and the opportunities often 1,000x the size. And that's what we're starting to see. How long will it take? I don't know. We're not -- we're trying to just go with it. You have to understand that many of these can also go, just pay as you go, they're never forecasted. A customer just tries it, and before you know it, it's expanding. The opportunity is literally enormous because many of these workloads, they can't go to the cloud any other way. Those that have tried have been either unsuccessful or it's been both expensive and risk their security situation.
So this is a very, very powerful moment for us. We're not going to overplay it here. We're just going to ride along with it. You're going to hear at Open World from some of these customers.

And is it -- kind of in terms of going bigger, is it kind of a question of functionality and capability or more around referenceability? Because if I look at your -- you just deleveraged full quarter's numbers. You closed the quarter in 11, 12 days and were able to deliver that, which is kind of a record I've seen. And you guys are using Oracle Fusion. So it's really power -- it seems like a very powerful solution. So I'm just wondering what's holding it back at this point."

Let me just answer your deferred revenue comment. So I just want you to understand, gross deferred revenue is actually up 3%, okay? But we net it to a bunch of things that ultimately are simply timing changes related to collections. And so that's really the only thing. There's nothing unusual, next quarter, you may see something different. It's literally a matter of when we pay some things, and that kind of shows up in the operating cash flow. But in deferred revenue, it's simply timing of collections. There's a little bit impacted by currency, but the gross deferred revenue number is actually up 3%. It's just netted down, and it's just a matter of the timing of our collections, so nothing to see here."

Almost every business leader I talk to in Germany wants to make the migration, they just have to be assured that it will work. Now we're going to get -- we've won some deals in the high and at mid-market against SAP incumbents, and they're in the process of converting. And if we can get them converted much faster and get them live much faster then we can -- this one jumped in, this one of the largest enterprises on earth that we're converting.

Of course, September 11 is an important day for our country and for us at Oracle. Many of you know that we lost 11 of our employees and many friends that day, and we honor all the victims today and every day. May their memories be a blessing to all of us.
We originally planned to hold this call tomorrow. However, as Mark will be taking a leave of absence for health-related reasons, we felt it made sense to share all of our news at once. Mark was extremely engaged with the business through the end of the quarter, but now he needs to focus on his health and taking care of himself. As the 3 of us have always worked as a team on managing Oracle, Larry and I will cover Mark's responsibilities during his absence with support from the rest of our strong management team.
Now switching to the first quarter. I will review our non-GAAP results using constant dollar growth rates unless I state otherwise. And though the effects of the currency movements in Q1 were modestly more than expected with a 1.3% headwind to total revenues and $0.01 headwind to earnings per share, both results were in line with my guidance range. Total Cloud Services and License Support revenues for the quarter were $6.8 billion, up 4% and accounting for nearly 3/4 of total company revenues, and most of all of this revenue is recurring. Cloud and On-Premise License revenues were $812 million, down 6%, coming off 15% license growth last quarter. And as a reminder, because Q1 is normally our smallest quarter, we tend to see more volatility in new software license growth rates in Q1.
In terms of ecosystems, GAAP applications ecosystem revenues were $2.8 billion, up 3%, with Fusion apps up nearly 40%, including Fusion ERP up mid-40s and Fusion HCM, up low 30s. NetSuite ERP was up in the mid-20s. Vertical SaaS was up high single digits, while Data Cloud was down in the low teens. On a trailing 12-month basis, more than 90% of our application ecosystem revenue is now recurring. GAAP infrastructure ecosystem revenues were $4.8 billion, up 3%, with total database revenue up similarly highlighted by BYOL and Autonomous Database revenues, both up triple digits, but also small base for now. On a trailing 12-month basis, more than 3/4 of our infrastructure ecosystem is now recurring.
In terms of geographies, we saw double-digit revenue growth in cloud revenue in all regions with especially strong results in Latin America and Asia Pacific. The gross margin for Cloud Services and License Support was 86%. And as we continue to scale and grow, I expect our cloud gross margins will go higher, driving an acceleration in our gross profit growth.
Total revenues for the quarter were $9.2 billion, up 1% from last year; non-GAAP operating income was $3.8 billion, up 4% from last year; and the operating margin was 42%, up from 41% last year. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was at 9.8%, slightly below our base tax rate of 20%, and EPS was USD 0.81 and up 16% in constant dollar and 14% in USD. The GAAP tax rate was 13.9%, and GAAP EPS was USD 0.63 and up 13% in constant currency and 11% in USD.
Operating cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $13.8 billion. Over the last 4 quarters, capital expenditures were $1.7 billion, and free cash flow was $12.2 billion. We now have approximately $36 billion in cash and marketable securities, and the short-term deferred revenue balance is $10.9 billion. As we've said before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisition, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and the dividend.
This quarter, we repurchased 89 million shares for a total of $5 billion. Over the last 12 months, we've repurchased 611 million shares for a total of $31 billion. And over the last 5 years, we have reduced the shares outstanding by more than 25%. The Board of Directors increased the authorization for share repurchases by an additional $15 billion and again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.24 per share.
My guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currencies. Assuming current exchange rates remain the same as they are now, currency should have a 1% negative effect on total revenue and $0.01 negative on EPS. Of course, that could change. So for Q2, total revenues are expected to grow 1% to 3% in constant currency. And assuming a 1% currency headwind, total revenues are expected to grow from 0 to 2% in U.S. dollars. Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to grow between 10% to 12% and be between $0.88 and $0.90 in constant currency. And assuming the $0.01 headwind, non-GAAP EPS in U.S. dollars is expected to grow between 1 -- 9% and 11% and be between USD 0.87 and USD 0.89.
For fiscal 2020 and the third consecutive fiscal quarter, I expect that we will report double-digit EPS growth in constant currency. Total CapEx for fiscal year '20 is expected to be around $2.2 billion, but it could move a little depending on our bookings and how much we need to invest to accommodate them. My EPS guidance for Q2 and fiscal '20 assumes a base tax rate of 20%. However, onetime tax events could cause actual tax rates for any given quarter to vary from our base tax rate. But I expect that in normalizing for these onetime tax events, our tax rate will average around 20% for fiscal year 2020.
I'm turning the call over to Larry for his comments who will spend a little time highlighting some of the key wins we had during the quarter with emphasis on back-office applications and then talk about autonomous database."

And we have a massive opportunity ahead of us in both ERP and HCM. Not only do we have an enormous installed base of existing ERP and HCM customers who can operate to the cloud, but more than half of the current ERP and HCM market is served by companies who have no SaaS upgrade path. These companies' products are vulnerable to being replaced, and we're in the process of replacing them. Our investments in Fusion has not only enabled our strong back-office results over the last few years, but they've positioned us to become not just the biggest back-office player in the cloud, which we already are, but the biggest back-office player, period. Cloud, on-premises, all of it.
So with that, here are some key Fusion ERP wins from Q1: DP World; Shaw Communications; Bangkok Bank of Thailand, who's upgrading their e-business suite with our Fusion Financials Cloud Service and our Fusion Financial Enterprise Performance Management; Envision Healthcare, where we beat Workday, and we're replacing Envision Healthcare's legacy system, which is an Infor Lawson system; Express Scripts, who's in the process of migrating from Hyperion on-premise to the Fusion EPM in the cloud, this is their first cloud application; Lyft, who's operating a portion of their ERP system that was -- started out as NetSuite but is now Fusion as they plan for growth going forward; media newsroom, another competitive win against Workday; National Oilwell Varco, in a nice expansion, both their EPM and supply chain management, that we closed last year, so they're just -- they're adding more products, they're adding more of our overall Fusion suite; NGL Energy Partners has also bought our Fusion ERP suite and supply chain management; Penn National Gaming is an online gaming company, and that was a competitive win against the unnamed German company located at a town called Waldorf; Standard Group Limited, a large garment manufacturer, where we beat that same Waldorf German company; Southern Company is a utility that was running E-Business Suite and PeopleSoft, E-Business Suite Financials and PeopleSoft HCM, and they're moving to the Fusion Cloud suite overall, Financials HCM, everything.
Continuing, we've got some great additional just HCM wins. BAE Systems chose Fusion HCM to upgrade their HR technology and standardize on the cloud. Dubai Holdings, where we're expanding our relationship by adding both Fusion HCM and Taleo for recruiting. Envision Healthcare is adding infusion HCM to the already-purchased Fusion ERP suite. A very large transportation entity in the U.K., an airport, who is a long-term E-Business Suite customer, is moving from on-premise to the Fusion suite in the cloud. Here's a company everyone's always heard of and probably has visited many times, McDonald's. McDonald's chose our HCM. They chose our payroll. And they -- this was a battle between us and Workday. We won. And we're displacing their on-premise legacy system. Nestlé; Southwest Gas, where we're displacing SAP, and we beat Workday as Southwest Gas decided to move from SAP on-premise to the cloud, and they picked us. The University of Texas, and we're actually engaged with them on not only providing cloud technology but also consulting support to migrate them from PeopleSoft on-premise to the Fusion HCM in the cloud.
And it's just not a bunch of customer wins that marks our success. Industry analysts, including IDC, are taking notice as they survey their customers. In the 2019 SaaS/PaaS survey that IDC released in May of 2019, it surveyed over 1,500 of their SaaS customers on their experience with all SaaS vendors, including Oracle, SAP, Salesforce, Workday, Microsoft, all of them. Oracle SaaS had the highest rating among all SaaS vendor survey, period. So you can see, we're at the beginning of a back-office upgrade cycle that will benefit our applications ecosystem for years to come. We're already overwhelmingly the largest ERP system in the cloud. And again, it won't be long before we're just the largest ERP supplier, period.
The second area I'd like to talk about is the Autonomous Database because we think this is a game changer. All right, game changer, interesting term. It sounds like a cliché, a little bit of marketing hype. Let me explain how important this is. Autonomous technology is the key element that differentiates a second-generation cloud from a first-generation cloud. Now in the first-generation cloud, your real benefit was you were going to rent computers, and you only pay for what you use. And the benefit of a second generation -- and not so great benefit, obviously, the first-generation cloud, pay for what you use when you use it. Second-generation cloud, not only do we deliver the benefits of pay per use, we also take the human labor out of running the cloud. That's an even bigger economic savings. Sharing computers and renting computers is not as costly as paying for the labor to run those computers. So from an economic advantage, a second-generation autonomous cloud is much less expensive to run than a first-generation cloud. But that's not what's really important. What's really important is the second-generation autonomous cloud prevents data theft, which you can never do in a first-generation manual cloud.
Let me point out how reasonable Amazon was when they refused to accept responsibility for the configuration errors made by the people at Capital One. They have a policy, so you have control of your data. You have control of your system. You are responsible for running your system. And if you make mistakes, it's on you, it's not on us. That is not an unreasonable position. When you have a totally manual system and your users are responsible for configuring the system, when your users are responsible for backing the system up, when your users are responsible for encrypting the data, when your users are responsible for patching the systems, user errors can lead to catastrophic results.
In a manual system, there's no way to prevent that. In an autonomous system, the Capital One data breach could never have happened because the Oracle Autonomous Database doesn't let a human being configure the system, it configures itself automatically. The Oracle Autonomous Database system doesn't ask human beings to patch it, to close security holes. The system automatically patches itself while running. The Oracle Database doesn't ask if you want to back it up or if you want to encrypt your data, it does all of this automatically while it's running. The only way you can prevent data theft is to eliminate human error. The only way you can do that was with an autonomous database, and we have one, and our competitors don't. This is a very big deal.
What's the greatest thing about autonomous driving? I was looking forward to autonomous driving. Then they've seen the threat to Uber and all this other stuff. But okay, that's all interesting. The greatest thing about autonomous driving, it's going to reduce human pilot error and cut down on accidents by 90%, 95%, 98%, 99%. It's going to save lives. It's going to stop -- come close to eliminating pilot error. The Oracle Autonomous Database, the Oracle self-driving database, prevents users from making catastrophic mistakes, resulting in data loss. And there is no way to do it in a manual cloud, end of story. That's what I mean by game changer. You want to prevent data theft, you better be prepared to pay less because we take the labor out, huge cost savings, and we -- there are no human beings involved, and they can't make those common mistakes.
All right. So we're still early on in the Autonomous Database in terms of -- it's only been around -- we announced it in Open World 2017 2 years ago and really showed up in 2018, and now we're beginning to get some traction with this exciting new technology. It's proving to be the most exciting and successful new product offering in the history of our company.
So here -- I'm sorry, I'm missing -- all right, so here's some recent data. In Q1, we added more than 3,700 new Autonomous Database trials. We now have over 2,000 customers, paying customers, for the Autonomous Database. We're seeing incredible pull-through with the Autonomous Database. And you come to Oracle -- the Oracle Cloud to use the Autonomous Database, and then you use a variety of other services. About 45% of the people who are using Autonomous Database are also using our Oracle Analytics Cloud. By the way, they're also using Microsoft analytics, they're using Cognos, they're using a variety of other tools. But primarily, they're using Oracle Analytics.
We've added many customers to Autonomous Database that weren't Oracle customers at all. 13% of the people using Autonomous Database had never bought a database from Oracle Corporation. 43% of the workloads that are going on to Autonomous Database are net new. They're not moving them from on-premise to the Autonomous Database, but half of them move from on-premise to Autonomous Database. Almost the other half, 43%, are just net-new applications.
We've had some fabulous wins in the quarter. Obviously, I'm not going to mention -- we have over 500 wins, Autonomous Database wins, in the quarter. I'm not going to mention all 500. But 7-Eleven is moving all their point-of-sale data to the Autonomous Data warehouse, Cargojet Canada, Johnson Controls, LATAM Airlines is moving their on-premise data centers to OCI to get the advantage and security of the Autonomous Database. Siemens Energy, Stanley Black & Decker, getting much faster data reporting on their analytics. Oh, yes, and one more company, moving to the Autonomous Database is Uber.
And with that, let's turn it back to the operator."

So there was -- Cloud Services and License Support was strong this quarter, but License was not as strong as we modeled it anyway. And I realize it's a seasonally slow first quarter, and you said it follows the strongest and yes, really strong fourth quarter, as strong as we've seen in quite some time. But is there anything else you can share on that line? Any further color? For instance, BYOL has got a lot of traction, right?

So the group selling new license was a new group, and so I expect that they will more than recover during the year. But that is the only weakness we had, and it was simply just a slow start as we reorg-ed the North America tech sales force since we split it. So there's no macro issue. There's no actual regular issue. And of course, the thing is that in Q1, small numbers make a big difference, and so they just kind of outsized.

Larry, last quarter, you had really strong results in the database options and most especially the ones related to the Autonomous Database. I'm just curious, in this quarter, again, a seasonally softer first quarter, but can you talk about the options themselves? And I'm thinking more about things like -- my favorite is multi-tenancy, but there's others that are important, too."

Again, the reorg in North America had a great impact on that because those are license sales, and then they bring those licenses to the cloud. So people buy multi-tenant. They buy rack. They buy in memory. They then pick up those options and their existing licenses up, and they move them to the cloud. So some of those sales were delayed because of the reorg, but we think the demand is enormous. And we think the leading indicator is just the number of trials we've signed up in Q1. So our cloud sales force, in terms of the cloud activity, we had incredible cloud activity. And we expect -- again, we signed more than 500 deals, Autonomous Database deals, in Q1. 3,700 new trials, the 500 signed paying customers, more of them, and we expect to double that in Q2. So we expect to go from well over 1,000 paying customers and that pipeline to just start building. That is the best early indicator. And that will drive not only cloud revenue but also license revenue because of the options."

We actually have sales territories which are Lawson Healthcare sales territories. So we go out there -- the Lawson Healthcare customers, and we've rolled up a bunch of those. I'd say about 1/3 of their customers, of Lawson Healthcare customers, are in our pipeline -- either already converted or in our pipeline. So we expect to win all of those. We've just added some new sales territories, which are Lawson retail territories, which is a combination of our Fusion Financials and our retail merchandising products. And we think -- we -- that's also a very vulnerable company that Infor really -- well, they tried. A lot of people have tried to build cloud systems. It's not easy. I can attest to that. I have lots of scars. But I mean Fusion took 10 years to get going. I mean it's a big deal. And NetSuite, that overnight success took 20 -- been in business over 20 years. Salesforce has been in business over 20 years. It takes a while to build these very complicated systems. And Lawson doesn't really have anything, so we're taking a bunch of their customers.
But the one that's extraordinary is that SAP really does not have a true cloud system. SAP is doing some hosting, they don't have a true cloud systems. And now we're seeing kind of some of their larger -- not the very largest companies, but some of their medium, large companies go ahead and pick us, and we're converting them. But we are in conversations with their very largest -- SAP's very, very largest customers. We're in the middle of converting one of their very, very largest customers. And we think that, of course, is the huge opportunity. We think we -- right now, Oracle and SAP has about half the European market. I'm sorry, it's a very long answer. We have about half -- the 2 of us have about half of the European market. And the other half of the European market, as you say, highly fragmented. We started out by targeting the highly fragmented guys who are really weak and vulnerable, but we think the opportunity exists to roll it all up.

Well, because the growth rate is so extraordinary, we don't -- we're not forecasting it. I mean when Safra gives you a forecast, she's not forecasting some -- this incredibly steep growth curve in Autonomous Database. So we're giving you, I would say, a conservative point of view, especially in terms of Autonomous Database. And -- but again, this is the case where we have a technology that nobody else has. A, we are the dominant database supplier on the planet right now. We're bigger than IBM and Microsoft combined. In the previous battles, in the previous war on-premise, we were bigger than Microsoft and IBM combined, our 2 biggest competitors.
The cloud -- there are a bunch of open source cloud databases, and a lot of more specialized, I mean there are probably a dozen of them or more for that matter. But none of them are autonomous. None of them are secure. None of them task themselves while running. None of them give you 99.995% availability. I mean they're -- we're 100x more reliable. I mean seriously, 100x more reliable than these guys. We have the only system that we can pretty much ensure that your data can't be stolen because you're -- because you can't make pilot errors. You can't commit -- you can't make mistakes because that's -- all those decisions are automated.
So it's another -- I mean so we're sitting in 2 markets that we have an opportunity of completely dominating and owning. One is ERP, where we've been in it for a while and you actually can see the data, you can actually see the curve, and the curve's -- we have enough years of data that you can see the slope of the curve, and you can do these market share studies. There are always analyst reports and all that. And we've made great progress in that, and you can see it.
In the Autonomous Database, all you can do is listen to me talk about this extraordinary technology. And we're so early on in the curve, we've got such little data in the curve. I understand -- and even we're playing let's wait and see what this turns out to be. But we have this gigantic installed base that's, I think, going to go with Autonomous Database. But it's not just that, it's not safe to go to any other database. That's a pretty good differentiator. And it's our second extraordinary opportunity. ERP back-office in the cloud, Autonomous Database in the cloud, we're successful in those 2 markets, it should be enough to make a living."

But we're not talking about Autonomous Database. So you're going to see a bunch of arguments where we take that same machine learning technology to develop other autonomous services. And we're on our way. I mean it's our goal to deliver the world's first and only completely autonomous cloud, the most important thing in keeping your data sites. But we'd like -- I mean you really should have an autonomous operating system. You should have a bunch of autonomous services in that to operate that cloud, so human beings aren't given the opportunity to make mistakes, and people can concentrate on building applications rather than managing the plumbing of the cloud, which is complicated and error prone and expensive.
So we want to take -- get rid of the expense, get rid of the errors. Starting with Autonomous Database, you'll see a bunch more announcements of new autonomous services in OCI. And OCI is definitely on a roll.

And I think the strategy of land and expand, which is what Amazon has used in marketing their products, so you get in for one project and you're successful on that project then you go to the next project, it's been very different than the way Oracle has been selling in the past. We have adopted with Autonomous Database. We've adopted that land, start small, get in there on a project that demonstrates how great this technology is, and then get another project and another project after that. So we've adopted this land-and-expand approach. And we have many examples where people have been successful in their first projects and have moved on to 2 more, moved on to -- and then moved on to 10 more after that.
So we see -- again, the opportunity is gigantic. The fact that we have 4 -- that we added 4,000 -- almost 4,000 trials, short of 4,000 trials, in Q1 is an example of how we're really getting traction now, and the word is getting out about how good the Autonomous Database is, how big is it as an overall market."

They've not brought those critical, large and security-conscious workloads. They've not brought them to the cloud so far. They didn't bring them to the other vendors. The other vendors are all actually having trouble in the enterprise with these important workloads. They have been waiting for us. And so as they've started to bring smaller workloads in, they can start quite small. And then their next buy is 10x the size, and the opportunities often 1,000x the size. And that's what we're starting to see. How long will it take? I don't know. We're not -- we're trying to just go with it. You have to understand that many of these can also go, just pay as you go, they're never forecasted. A customer just tries it, and before you know it, it's expanding. The opportunity is literally enormous because many of these workloads, they can't go to the cloud any other way. Those that have tried have been either unsuccessful or it's been both expensive and risk their security situation.
So this is a very, very powerful moment for us. We're not going to overplay it here. We're just going to ride along with it. You're going to hear at Open World from some of these customers.

Let me just answer your deferred revenue comment. So I just want you to understand, gross deferred revenue is actually up 3%, okay? But we net it to a bunch of things that ultimately are simply timing changes related to collections. And so that's really the only thing. There's nothing unusual, next quarter, you may see something different. It's literally a matter of when we pay some things, and that kind of shows up in the operating cash flow. But in deferred revenue, it's simply timing of collections. There's a little bit impacted by currency, but the gross deferred revenue number is actually up 3%.

Almost every business leader I talk to in Germany wants to make the migration, they just have to be assured that it will work.

Of course, September 11 is an important day for our country and for us at Oracle. Many of you know that we lost 11 of our employees and many friends that day, and we honor all the victims today and every day. May their memories be a blessing to all of us.
We originally planned to hold this call tomorrow. However, as Mark will be taking a leave of absence for health-related reasons, we felt it made sense to share all of our news at once. Mark was extremely engaged with the business through the end of the quarter, but now he needs to focus on his health and taking care of himself. As the 3 of us have always worked as a team on managing Oracle, Larry and I will cover Mark's responsibilities during his absence with support from the rest of our strong management team.
Now switching to the first quarter. I will review our non-GAAP results using constant dollar growth rates unless I state otherwise. And though the effects of the currency movements in Q1 were modestly more than expected with a 1.3% headwind to total revenues and $0.01 headwind to earnings per share, both results were in line with my guidance range. Total Cloud Services and License Support revenues for the quarter were $6.8 billion, up 4% and accounting for nearly 3/4 of total company revenues, and most of all of this revenue is recurring. Cloud and On-Premise License revenues were $812 million, down 6%, coming off 15% license growth last quarter. And as a reminder, because Q1 is normally our smallest quarter, we tend to see more volatility in new software license growth rates in Q1.
In terms of ecosystems, GAAP applications ecosystem revenues were $2.8 billion, up 3%, with Fusion apps up nearly 40%, including Fusion ERP up mid-40s and Fusion HCM, up low 30s. NetSuite ERP was up in the mid-20s. Vertical SaaS was up high single digits, while Data Cloud was down in the low teens. On a trailing 12-month basis, more than 90% of our application ecosystem revenue is now recurring. GAAP infrastructure ecosystem revenues were $4.8 billion, up 3%, with total database revenue up similarly highlighted by BYOL and Autonomous Database revenues, both up triple digits, but also small base for now. On a trailing 12-month basis, more than 3/4 of our infrastructure ecosystem is now recurring.
In terms of geographies, we saw double-digit revenue growth in cloud revenue in all regions with especially strong results in Latin America and Asia Pacific. The gross margin for Cloud Services and License Support was 86%. And as we continue to scale and grow, I expect our cloud gross margins will go higher, driving an acceleration in our gross profit growth.
Total revenues for the quarter were $9.2 billion, up 1% from last year; non-GAAP operating income was $3.8 billion, up 4% from last year; and the operating margin was 42%, up from 41% last year. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was at 9.8%, slightly below our base tax rate of 20%, and EPS was USD 0.81 and up 16% in constant dollar and 14% in USD. The GAAP tax rate was 13.9%, and GAAP EPS was USD 0.63 and up 13% in constant currency and 11% in USD.
Operating cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $13.8 billion. Over the last 4 quarters, capital expenditures were $1.7 billion, and free cash flow was $12.2 billion. We now have approximately $36 billion in cash and marketable securities, and the short-term deferred revenue balance is $10.9 billion. As we've said before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisition, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and the dividend.
This quarter, we repurchased 89 million shares for a total of $5 billion. Over the last 12 months, we've repurchased 611 million shares for a total of $31 billion. And over the last 5 years, we have reduced the shares outstanding by more than 25%. The Board of Directors increased the authorization for share repurchases by an additional $15 billion and again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.24 per share.
My guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currencies. Assuming current exchange rates remain the same as they are now, currency should have a 1% negative effect on total revenue and $0.01 negative on EPS. Of course, that could change. So for Q2, total revenues are expected to grow 1% to 3% in constant currency. And assuming a 1% currency headwind, total revenues are expected to grow from 0 to 2% in U.S. dollars. Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to grow between 10% to 12% and be between $0.88 and $0.90 in constant currency. And assuming the $0.01 headwind, non-GAAP EPS in U.S. dollars is expected to grow between 1 -- 9% and 11% and be between USD 0.87 and USD 0.89.
For fiscal 2020 and the third consecutive fiscal quarter, I expect that we will report double-digit EPS growth in constant currency. Total CapEx for fiscal year '20 is expected to be around $2.2 billion, but it could move a little depending on our bookings and how much we need to invest to accommodate them. My EPS guidance for Q2 and fiscal '20 assumes a base tax rate of 20%. However, onetime tax events could cause actual tax rates for any given quarter to vary from our base tax rate. But I expect that in normalizing for these onetime tax events, our tax rate will average around 20% for fiscal year 2020.
I'm turning the call over to Larry for his comments who will spend a little time highlighting some of the key wins we had during the quarter with emphasis on back-office applications and then talk about autonomous database."

And we have a massive opportunity ahead of us in both ERP and HCM. Not only do we have an enormous installed base of existing ERP and HCM customers who can operate to the cloud, but more than half of the current ERP and HCM market is served by companies who have no SaaS upgrade path. These companies' products are vulnerable to being replaced, and we're in the process of replacing them. Our investments in Fusion has not only enabled our strong back-office results over the last few years, but they've positioned us to become not just the biggest back-office player in the cloud, which we already are, but the biggest back-office player, period. Cloud, on-premises, all of it.
So with that, here are some key Fusion ERP wins from Q1: DP World; Shaw Communications; Bangkok Bank of Thailand, who's upgrading their e-business suite with our Fusion Financials Cloud Service and our Fusion Financial Enterprise Performance Management; Envision Healthcare, where we beat Workday, and we're replacing Envision Healthcare's legacy system, which is an Infor Lawson system; Express Scripts, who's in the process of migrating from Hyperion on-premise to the Fusion EPM in the cloud, this is their first cloud application; Lyft, who's operating a portion of their ERP system that was -- started out as NetSuite but is now Fusion as they plan for growth going forward; media newsroom, another competitive win against Workday; National Oilwell Varco, in a nice expansion, both their EPM and supply chain management, that we closed last year, so they're just -- they're adding more products, they're adding more of our overall Fusion suite; NGL Energy Partners has also bought our Fusion ERP suite and supply chain management; Penn National Gaming is an online gaming company, and that was a competitive win against the unnamed German company located at a town called Waldorf; Standard Group Limited, a large garment manufacturer, where we beat that same Waldorf German company; Southern Company is a utility that was running E-Business Suite and PeopleSoft, E-Business Suite Financials and PeopleSoft HCM, and they're moving to the Fusion Cloud suite overall, Financials HCM, everything.
Continuing, we've got some great additional just HCM wins. BAE Systems chose Fusion HCM to upgrade their HR technology and standardize on the cloud. Dubai Holdings, where we're expanding our relationship by adding both Fusion HCM and Taleo for recruiting. Envision Healthcare is adding infusion HCM to the already-purchased Fusion ERP suite. A very large transportation entity in the U.K., an airport, who is a long-term E-Business Suite customer, is moving from on-premise to the Fusion suite in the cloud. Here's a company everyone's always heard of and probably has visited many times, McDonald's. McDonald's chose our HCM. They chose our payroll. And they -- this was a battle between us and Workday. We won. And we're displacing their on-premise legacy system. Nestlé; Southwest Gas, where we're displacing SAP, and we beat Workday as Southwest Gas decided to move from SAP on-premise to the cloud, and they picked us. The University of Texas, and we're actually engaged with them on not only providing cloud technology but also consulting support to migrate them from PeopleSoft on-premise to the Fusion HCM in the cloud.
And it's just not a bunch of customer wins that marks our success. Industry analysts, including IDC, are taking notice as they survey their customers. In the 2019 SaaS/PaaS survey that IDC released in May of 2019, it surveyed over 1,500 of their SaaS customers on their experience with all SaaS vendors, including Oracle, SAP, Salesforce, Workday, Microsoft, all of them. Oracle SaaS had the highest rating among all SaaS vendor survey, period. So you can see, we're at the beginning of a back-office upgrade cycle that will benefit our applications ecosystem for years to come. We're already overwhelmingly the largest ERP system in the cloud. And again, it won't be long before we're just the largest ERP supplier, period.
The second area I'd like to talk about is the Autonomous Database because we think this is a game changer. All right, game changer, interesting term. It sounds like a cliché, a little bit of marketing hype. Let me explain how important this is. Autonomous technology is the key element that differentiates a second-generation cloud from a first-generation cloud. Now in the first-generation cloud, your real benefit was you were going to rent computers, and you only pay for what you use. And the benefit of a second generation -- and not so great benefit, obviously, the first-generation cloud, pay for what you use when you use it. Second-generation cloud, not only do we deliver the benefits of pay per use, we also take the human labor out of running the cloud. That's an even bigger economic savings. Sharing computers and renting computers is not as costly as paying for the labor to run those computers. So from an economic advantage, a second-generation autonomous cloud is much less expensive to run than a first-generation cloud. But that's not what's really important. What's really important is the second-generation autonomous cloud prevents data theft, which you can never do in a first-generation manual cloud.
Let me point out how reasonable Amazon was when they refused to accept responsibility for the configuration errors made by the people at Capital One. They have a policy, so you have control of your data. You have control of your system. You are responsible for running your system. And if you make mistakes, it's on you, it's not on us. That is not an unreasonable position. When you have a totally manual system and your users are responsible for configuring the system, when your users are responsible for backing the system up, when your users are responsible for encrypting the data, when your users are responsible for patching the systems, user errors can lead to catastrophic results.
In a manual system, there's no way to prevent that. In an autonomous system, the Capital One data breach could never have happened because the Oracle Autonomous Database doesn't let a human being configure the system, it configures itself automatically. The Oracle Autonomous Database system doesn't ask human beings to patch it, to close security holes. The system automatically patches itself while running. The Oracle Database doesn't ask if you want to back it up or if you want to encrypt your data, it does all of this automatically while it's running. The only way you can prevent data theft is to eliminate human error. The only way you can do that was with an autonomous database, and we have one, and our competitors don't. This is a very big deal.
What's the greatest thing about autonomous driving? I was looking forward to autonomous driving. Then they've seen the threat to Uber and all this other stuff. But okay, that's all interesting. The greatest thing about autonomous driving, it's going to reduce human pilot error and cut down on accidents by 90%, 95%, 98%, 99%. It's going to save lives. It's going to stop -- come close to eliminating pilot error. The Oracle Autonomous Database, the Oracle self-driving database, prevents users from making catastrophic mistakes, resulting in data loss. And there is no way to do it in a manual cloud, end of story. That's what I mean by game changer. You want to prevent data theft, you better be prepared to pay less because we take the labor out, huge cost savings, and we -- there are no human beings involved, and they can't make those common mistakes.
All right. So we're still early on in the Autonomous Database in terms of -- it's only been around -- we announced it in Open World 2017 2 years ago and really showed up in 2018, and now we're beginning to get some traction with this exciting new technology. It's proving to be the most exciting and successful new product offering in the history of our company.
So here -- I'm sorry, I'm missing -- all right, so here's some recent data. In Q1, we added more than 3,700 new Autonomous Database trials. We now have over 2,000 customers, paying customers, for the Autonomous Database. We're seeing incredible pull-through with the Autonomous Database. And you come to Oracle -- the Oracle Cloud to use the Autonomous Database, and then you use a variety of other services. About 45% of the people who are using Autonomous Database are also using our Oracle Analytics Cloud. By the way, they're also using Microsoft analytics, they're using Cognos, they're using a variety of other tools. But primarily, they're using Oracle Analytics.
We've added many customers to Autonomous Database that weren't Oracle customers at all. 13% of the people using Autonomous Database had never bought a database from Oracle Corporation. 43% of the workloads that are going on to Autonomous Database are net new. They're not moving them from on-premise to the Autonomous Database, but half of them move from on-premise to Autonomous Database. Almost the other half, 43%, are just net-new applications.
We've had some fabulous wins in the quarter. Obviously, I'm not going to mention -- we have over 500 wins, Autonomous Database wins, in the quarter. I'm not going to mention all 500. But 7-Eleven is moving all their point-of-sale data to the Autonomous Data warehouse, Cargojet Canada, Johnson Controls, LATAM Airlines is moving their on-premise data centers to OCI to get the advantage and security of the Autonomous Database. Siemens Energy, Stanley Black & Decker, getting much faster data reporting on their analytics. Oh, yes, and one more company, moving to the Autonomous Database is Uber.
And with that, let's turn it back to the operator."

So there was -- Cloud Services and License Support was strong this quarter, but License was not as strong as we modeled it anyway. And I realize it's a seasonally slow first quarter, and you said it follows the strongest and yes, really strong fourth quarter, as strong as we've seen in quite some time. But is there anything else you can share on that line? Any further color? For instance, BYOL has got a lot of traction, right? And could that cause your financials just to start to trend more seasonally sort of like it used to? I mean it started to get a little more even, it's still seasonal but a little more even. Should we be starting to think of seasonality, how Oracle used to be even more seasonal? Or we're also hearing, you guys, you hear it, too, you hear from some other companies that talk about macro pressure. Are you seeing any of that at all?

First of all, outside of North America, our license was up, up quite a bit, in fact, internationally. What we had done in North America is we did do a split in the sales force. We've been telegraphing that we were doing that before we split the North America tech sales force between selling cloud, a group selling cloud; and a group selling new licenses. So the group selling new license was a new group, and so I expect that they will more than recover during the year. But that is the only weakness we had, and it was simply just a slow start as we reorg-ed the North America tech sales force since we split it. So there's no macro issue. There's no actual regular issue. And of course, the thing is that in Q1, small numbers make a big difference, and so they just kind of outsized.

Again, the reorg in North America had a great impact on that because those are license sales, and then they bring those licenses to the cloud. So people buy multi-tenant. They buy rack. They buy in memory. They then pick up those options and their existing licenses up, and they move them to the cloud. So some of those sales were delayed because of the reorg, but we think the demand is enormous. And we think the leading indicator is just the number of trials we've signed up in Q1. So our cloud sales force, in terms of the cloud activity, we had incredible cloud activity. And we expect -- again, we signed more than 500 deals, Autonomous Database deals, in Q1. 3,700 new trials, the 500 signed paying customers, more of them, and we expect to double that in Q2. So we expect to go from well over 1,000 paying customers and that pipeline to just start building. That is the best early indicator.

We've just added some new sales territories, which are Lawson retail territories, which is a combination of our Fusion Financials and our retail merchandising products. And we think -- we -- that's also a very vulnerable company that Infor really -- well, they tried. A lot of people have tried to build cloud systems. It's not easy. I can attest to that. I have lots of scars. But I mean Fusion took 10 years to get going. I mean it's a big deal. And NetSuite, that overnight success took 20 -- been in business over 20 years. Salesforce has been in business over 20 years. It takes a while to build these very complicated systems. And Lawson doesn't really have anything, so we're taking a bunch of their customers.
But the one that's extraordinary is that SAP really does not have a true cloud system. SAP is doing some hosting, they don't have a true cloud systems. And now we're seeing kind of some of their larger -- not the very largest companies, but some of their medium, large companies go ahead and pick us, and we're converting them. But we are in conversations with their very largest -- SAP's very, very largest customers. We're in the middle of converting one of their very, very largest customers.

We have about half -- the 2 of us have about half of the European market. And the other half of the European market, as you say, highly fragmented.

Well, because the growth rate is so extraordinary, we don't -- we're not forecasting it. I mean when Safra gives you a forecast, she's not forecasting some -- this incredibly steep growth curve in Autonomous Database. So we're giving you, I would say, a conservative point of view, especially in terms of Autonomous Database. And -- but again, this is the case where we have a technology that nobody else has. A, we are the dominant database supplier on the planet right now. We're bigger than IBM and Microsoft combined. In the previous battles, in the previous war on-premise, we were bigger than Microsoft and IBM combined, our 2 biggest competitors.
The cloud -- there are a bunch of open source cloud databases, and a lot of more specialized, I mean there are probably a dozen of them or more for that matter. But none of them are autonomous. None of them are secure. None of them task themselves while running. None of them give you 99.995% availability. I mean they're -- we're 100x more reliable. I mean seriously, 100x more reliable than these guys. We have the only system that we can pretty much ensure that your data can't be stolen because you're -- because you can't make pilot errors. You can't commit -- you can't make mistakes because that's -- all those decisions are automated.
So it's another -- I mean so we're sitting in 2 markets that we have an opportunity of completely dominating and owning. One is ERP, where we've been in it for a while and you actually can see the data, you can actually see the curve, and the curve's -- we have enough years of data that you can see the slope of the curve, and you can do these market share studies. There are always analyst reports and all that. And we've made great progress in that, and you can see it.
In the Autonomous Database, all you can do is listen to me talk about this extraordinary technology. And we're so early on in the curve, we've got such little data in the curve. I understand -- and even we're playing let's wait and see what this turns out to be. But we have this gigantic installed base that's, I think, going to go with Autonomous Database. But it's not just that, it's not safe to go to any other database. That's a pretty good differentiator. And it's our second extraordinary opportunity. ERP back-office in the cloud, Autonomous Database in the cloud, we're successful in those 2 markets, it should be enough to make a living."

And -- but we're not stopping at Autonomous Database. At Open World, we'll be announcing a whole bunch of new autonomous services. No one is doing this. But we're not talking about Autonomous Database. So you're going to see a bunch of arguments where we take that same machine learning technology to develop other autonomous services. And we're on our way. I mean it's our goal to deliver the world's first and only completely autonomous cloud, the most important thing in keeping your data sites. But we'd like -- I mean you really should have an autonomous operating system. You should have a bunch of autonomous services in that to operate that cloud, so human beings aren't given the opportunity to make mistakes, and people can concentrate on building applications rather than managing the plumbing of the cloud, which is complicated and error prone and expensive.
So we want to take -- get rid of the expense, get rid of the errors. Starting with Autonomous Database, you'll see a bunch more announcements of new autonomous services in OCI. And OCI is definitely on a roll. If people come to look at Autonomous Database, they look around in the Oracle Cloud and they see our analytics, our compute, I can talk about all these other things, but we have -- we really have a second-generation cloud that's highly differentiated from our friends in Amazon or Google."

I mean they were the innovator in cloud, and I give them credit for that. And I think the strategy of land and expand, which is what Amazon has used in marketing their products, so you get in for one project and you're successful on that project then you go to the next project, it's been very different than the way Oracle has been selling in the past. We have adopted with Autonomous Database. We've adopted that land, start small, get in there on a project that demonstrates how great this technology is, and then get another project and another project after that. So we've adopted this land-and-expand approach. And we have many examples where people have been successful in their first projects and have moved on to 2 more, moved on to -- and then moved on to 10 more after that.
So we see -- again, the opportunity is gigantic. The fact that we have 4 -- that we added 4,000 -- almost 4,000 trials, short of 4,000 trials, in Q1 is an example of how we're really getting traction now, and the word is getting out about how good the Autonomous Database is, how big is it as an overall market."

They've not brought those critical, large and security-conscious workloads. They've not brought them to the cloud so far. They didn't bring them to the other vendors. The other vendors are all actually having trouble in the enterprise with these important workloads. They have been waiting for us. And so as they've started to bring smaller workloads in, they can start quite small. And then their next buy is 10x the size, and the opportunities often 1,000x the size. And that's what we're starting to see. How long will it take? I don't know. We're not -- we're trying to just go with it. You have to understand that many of these can also go, just pay as you go, they're never forecasted. A customer just tries it, and before you know it, it's expanding. The opportunity is literally enormous because many of these workloads, they can't go to the cloud any other way. Those that have tried have been either unsuccessful or it's been both expensive and risk their security situation.
So this is a very, very powerful moment for us. We're not going to overplay it here. We're just going to ride along with it. You're going to hear at Open World from some of these customers. And it's very much like originally, when we start to talk to you about our Engineered Systems where a customer would try a little bit, they'll try 1 a quarter.

So first, yes, this was a very quick close, but we've got the technology and the people to do it.
Let me just answer your deferred revenue comment. So I just want you to understand, gross deferred revenue is actually up 3%, okay? But we net it to a bunch of things that ultimately are simply timing changes related to collections. And so that's really the only thing. There's nothing unusual, next quarter, you may see something different. It's literally a matter of when we pay some things, and that kind of shows up in the operating cash flow. But in deferred revenue, it's simply timing of collections. There's a little bit impacted by currency, but the gross deferred revenue number is actually up 3%.

Almost every business leader I talk to in Germany wants to make the migration, they just have to be assured that it will work. Now we're going to get -- we've won some deals in the high and at mid-market against SAP incumbents, and they're in the process of converting. And we can get them converted much faster and get them live much faster than we can -- this one jumped in, this one of the largest enterprises on earth that we're converting.

But before I start, I'd like to acknowledge and thank you all for the many, many sincere condolences we received upon Mark's passing. Thank you. They mean a lot to us. 
As you can see, we had another solid quarter. This quarter, we finished with total revenue growth within my guidance range and EPS at the high end. Cloud Services and License Support continue to see material growth, and given that it represents more than 70% of our total revenue, it more than offsets declines in some smaller nonstrategic businesses. We continue to be encouraged that our overall revenue growth will further accelerate as we reach the final stages of this ongoing shift in business mix. 
Of late, I've been spending much more time with customers. The overriding theme I hear is the compelling nature of our technology and how it is critical to the success of their businesses: feature-rich, simple, secure, performant and priced right. They see Oracle as being strategic to their ongoing operations, and they tell me repeatedly that Oracle is the right partner to run their mission-critical assets, both in the cloud and on-premise. Their comments reinforce our conviction that our product strategy is right. 
At Oracle, we've upgraded our internal systems to the cloud, and we are sharing our experience with customers by describing the stunning benefits and efficiencies that can be realized from the move and know we have thousands of customers and references, our own experience, adopting Oracle Cloud applications and infrastructure, allows us to serve as a unique and knowledgeable adviser to customers who want to know how to go about their own digital transformation. 
To give you some context, let me share just a few of the many benefits we are seeing in our business. With Fusion ERP cloud, we are now able to close our books and report earnings in 12 days or less. Many companies don't report their results for weeks. And not only can we get our results out faster but we've saved money too. By using the AI and processes in Fusion ERP cloud, we have been able to eliminate more than 30% of our manual accounting activities. And enabled by Fusion HCM cloud, we have seen employee satisfaction levels soar, with all-time high rates for things like hiring and onboarding new employees. 
We've also made it easier for our managers and employees as Fusion HCM reduces the time needed to complete the talent review process by more than 70%. And separately, we're saving more than 20,000 hours of manager time each year with our accelerated job offer process. 
In sales, we're using our front-office cloud platform, augmented with machine learning and our own data cloud, to help our salespeople sell more and sell more quickly. With marketing cloud, campaign planning now takes days rather than weeks and with built-in machine learning, we've seen a doubling in lead conversion. We automatically capture millions of activities in sales cloud each year and with CPQ cloud, ordering is much faster and easier with over 70% of our transactions fully automated. We needed that to handle the increased volumes of transactions as a result of our customers' move to the cloud. 
In addition, we've adopted the Gen2 Infrastructure, including autonomous database for our custom apps. Our internal IT costs to run these systems are down by millions, while at the same time, we are adopting more than 100 new features each quarter. Here at Oracle, we are going to continue using our own cloud technology as an intelligent automation engine and continue to simplify our business model and processes. In turn, I expect that our revenue growth rates will increase and see even more expense efficiencies. And as a result, I expect that you will see us expand our margins and grow EPS double digits for the foreseeable future. 
Now on to the numbers. I'll review our non-GAAP results using constant dollar growth rates unless I state otherwise. Currency for Q2 was largely in line with my guidance at nearly 1%, and the fact that the growth rates look the same in a few categories is simply because of rounding. Total Cloud Services and License Support revenues for the quarter were $6.8 billion, up 3%, accounting for over 70% of total company revenues and most of this is recurring revenue. 
Cloud and On-Premise License revenues were $1.1 billion, down 7% as more of our GBU customers order cloud instead of license. In terms of ecosystem, GAAP application ecosystem revenues were $2.9 billion, up 4%, with Fusion apps up in the low 30s, including Fusion ERP up 38% and Fusion HCM up 23%. NetSuite ERP was up 28%. Vertical SaaS was up low double digits while data cloud stabilized. On a trailing 12-month basis, more than 90% of our application ecosystem revenue is recurring. 
GAAP infrastructure ecosystem revenues were $5 billion, up 1%, with total database revenue up 1% highlighted by BYOL and autonomous database revenues both up over 200% but off a small base for now. On a trailing 12-month basis, more than 3/4 of our infrastructure ecosystem revenue is recurring. Just a few days ago, we were able to get our first Gen2 Exadata Cloud at Customer fully deployed and connected. It was done in just 4 days. Previously, with our Gen1 architecture, this typically took significantly longer. As a result, we are very optimistic about the impact our Gen2 Cloud at Customer will have on our business. No other cloud provider has the right technology to actually do this. 
In terms of geographies, we saw double-digit revenue growth in SaaS revenue in all regions, except EMEA, with especially strong results in Latin America and Japan. Gross margin for Cloud Services and License Support was 85%, down slightly from last quarter due to accelerated investments in our Gen2 cloud to address higher demand worldwide. As we get to scale, I expect our cloud gross margins will grow higher, driving an acceleration in our gross profit growth. 
By the way, our strategic hardware products delivered on-premise, which includes Exadata, grew double digits for the quarter, once again showing that our installed base of customers focused on our world-leading database platform continues to grow. Total revenue for the quarter were $9.6 billion, up 1% from last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $4 billion, essentially unchanged from last year, and operating margin was 42%, down from 43% last year. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 18.8%, slightly below our base tax rate of 20%, and EPS was $0.90 in USD, up 13% in constant currency and 12% in USD. The GAAP tax rate was 17.7% and GAAP EPS was $0.69 in USD, up 15% in constant currency, 14% in USD. 
Operating cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $13.8 billion. Over the last 4 quarters, capital expenditures were $1.6 billion and free cash flow was $12.2 billion. We now have approximately $27 billion in cash and marketable securities and short-term net deferred revenue balance is $8.1 billion, down 1% in constant currency due to timing differences in customer payments. Also, the prior year deferred balance was affected by our transition to ASC 606. Gross deferred revenue was up over 1% in constant currency and would have been up over 3%, if not for the ASC 606 transition changes. 
We remain committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases and prudent use of debt and the dividend. This quarter, we repurchased 91 million shares for a total of $5 billion. Over the last 12 months, we've repurchased nearly 500 million shares for a total of $26 billion. And over the last 5 years, we've reduced the shares outstanding by more than 25%. The Board of Directors again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.24 per share. 
My guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency. Assuming current exchange rates remain the same as they are now, currency should have a 1% negative effect on total revenue and $0.01 negative effect on EPS. So for Q3, total revenues are expected to grow 1% to 3% in constant currency, and assuming a 1% currency headwind, total revenues are expected to grow 1% to 3% in USD. Now I realize that my USD and constant currency revenue guidance sound like they're the same number, but it's just rounding, similar to our revenue growth this quarter. I do expect a currency impact of 1% -- of nearly 1%. 
Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to grow between 10% to 12% and be between $0.96 and $0.98 in constant currency and assuming a $0.01 headwind, non-GAAP EPS in USD is expected to grow between 9% and 11% and be between $0.95 and $0.97 in USD. Total CapEx for fiscal year '20 is expected to be around $2.2 billion, but it could move higher based on demand for data center growth. 
My EPS guidance for Q2 and fiscal year '20 assumes a base tax rate of 20%. However, onetime tax events could cause actual tax rates for any given quarter to vary from our base tax rate. But I expect that in normalizing for those onetime tax benefits -- tax events, our tax rate will average around 20% in fiscal year 2020. 
And finally, for fiscal year 2020, I continue to expect that in constant currency, total revenue will grow faster than last year, and we -- and that we will report double-digit EPS growth for the year. And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry for his comments."

As I've said before, there are 2 key product areas that will determine Oracle's future in the cloud, Cloud ERP applications and the autonomous database. Being the clear #1 in both of these 2 giant applications and infrastructure market segments will enable the success of our other application and infrastructure products in adjacent market segments. This is already happening in applications. 
We have a huge lead in cloud ERP with over 7,000 Fusion ERP customers and 20,000 NetSuite ERP customers. Our closest cloud ERP competitor is Workday, and they claim to have a few hundred ERP customers. Workday's lack of success in cloud ERP is creating opportunities for Oracle in Cloud HCM. More and more, we are seeing HCM as being purchased as a part of an ERP cloud application suite. As a result, today, we have more HCM customers than Workday. 
And we're beginning to see that same integrated suite strategy beginning to drive our sales of CX, customer experience, applications in sales and service and in marketing. SAP never rewrote their ERP applications for the cloud. As a result, SAP's installed base is very vulnerable. We've already replaced and successfully migrated many midsized SAP customers from SAP to Fusion ERP. 
Importantly, a few months from now, in Q1 calendar year 2020, one of SAP's biggest customers will go live on Fusion ERP. Many of SAP's largest customers are already working with us to develop plans to migrate to Fusion ERP. SAP's customer base is up for grabs. They didn't rewrite their applications for the cloud. That has created an enormous opportunity for Oracle. 
We're already declared #1 in the cloud ERP market as measured in market share. And our Cloud ERP business is already growing at a rate of over 30%. By offering a safe and compelling alternative to SAP's old technology, we can increase our applications growth rate far beyond that 30%. We are very, very comfortable that we will be the overwhelming winner and this generation, Cloud ERP business. 
Now let's look at some application wins in the quarter. Advanced publications, a media company, bought ERP, Albertsons, Got ERP, EPM and supply chain. C.H. Robinson Worldwide, a transportation company, bought ERP and EPM. DHL supply chain, big German company, bought ERP, EPM and supply chain. Edwards Life Sciences and medical equipment company bought ERP. 
By the way, I'm not mentioning any HC -- associated HCM deals because I have a separate list for HCM. So a lot of these guys, maybe next quarter, I'll put the HCM deals right next to the ERP deal so you can see -- because I'll be repeating a lot of these names when I get to my HCM list. That's the point I made earlier. That people are now looking at HCM as just another module that we need in the back office. Very important. 
Edwards Life Sciences bought ERP. Ferguson, a manufacturing firm, bought ERP and supply chain; Global Companies, big energy firm bought ERP, EPM and supply chain; NCR, financial services bought ERP, EPM and supply chain; NETSCOUT, telecommunications company, bought supply chain; Mutual Life Assurance bought ERP and supply chain. Southern Star Central Gas Pipeline, a big energy company, bought ERP, Technip another energy company, ERP. 
By the way, SAP is supposed to be very strong in energy. Texas, Children's Health Care, The hospital bought ERP, EPM and supply chain. Unilever bought ERP and supply chain. Baker Hughes Energy Company bought ERP, EPM and supply chain. Carlson Wagonlit Travel Services, ERP, CPM, and supply chain; Kuwait Petroleum, energy company, bought ERP, EPM and supply chain; Liberty Global, communications company, ERP, EPM and supply chain, manpower. The global services company bought ERP, EPM and supply chain, 
Sherwin-Williams, that's what they bought, ERP, EPM and supply chain. The suite, a lot of people are buying multiple modules is not just ERP. It's ERP, it's EPM, enterprise performance management. It's supply chain, it's manufacturing. Bank of New York Mellon bought ERP, EPM and supply chain. 
Airport terminal services. I'm sorry, non-HCM group. Not many of the HCM group, they're all grouped together. Airport Terminal services bought HCM. Apparel, Bosco, Retail, HCM. Bank Saudi bought HCM; Centerpoint Energy, other energy company, bought HCM, Cummins, manufacturing company, HCM; Graybar Electric bought HCM; Hologic, HCM. 
HUS at the hospital, both of the hospitals in Finland, run by the federal government in Finland bought HCM, Mountaineer farms, HCM. North Atlantic Refining, again, this is my HCM list, big energy company, and SAP's stronghold in the energy sector bought HCM from us. Southern Storage central pipeline, big gas company, Energy, HCM. 
Technip, energy company, HCM. Tenet Health Care bought HCM, Texas Children's Hospital, bought HCM and brands bought HCM. Birmingham City Council on HCM, Cage Petroleum Company, a big energy company, bought HCM. MEDNAX Health Care, HCM; Phoenix Life Holdings, HCM. 
In customer experience, Equinix bought service; Ferguson Enterprises bought service; Ferrari bought sales and marketing; Ikea bought service; Nordstrom bought service; PayPal bought marketing, Rabobank, bought service and Santander Bank bought service. 
Okay. Let me move on to the other segment, which is Autonomous Database and Gen2 infrastructure. In the database market, we are the overwhelming #1, with a combination of a dominant share on-premise and very strong market share in the cloud. Though I have yet to see any good data on database market share in the cloud. Our database business is growing very, very rapidly because we have an enormous technology advantage in the cloud over all of our competitors with autonomous databases. 
Autonomous database is the world's only autonomous data. What does that mean? That means when you configure the system, you don't do anything. The system configures itself. Robots configure the system. The reason Capital One lost all that data at AWS is because one of the Capital One people made a configuration error. You can't make configuration errors with the autonomous database because human beings don't configure the system. 
A lot of these above-the-fold headlines of people losing their data are caused by human errors. People forget the patch systems. Remember that one? They patched some but not all of the systems. And Equifax. Equifax, it was [indiscernible] database, didn't get patched. They didn't find them all. Guess what? Autonomous database automatically patches itself when a security flaw is detected. And by the way, they detected that security flow over [indiscernible] at Equifax. They knew about it, they just didn't get around to patching. Patching is hard. They have to find all the databases. You had to schedule downtime. You don't schedule downtime with the autonomous database. You patch the autonomous database while the database is still running. But you don't have to the database. The robots, our robots catch the database. That's why it's autonomous. There's no human labor so there's no human error. So if you're willing to pay less and not have that human labor, you get rid of all those mistakes. 
This is a gigantic technology advantage. By the way, and we're 10x faster than anything Amazon has. That means we're much cheaper than anything Amazon has. Much safer, much easier to use, build applications faster. So we already have thousands of autonomous database customers running in our public cloud. We added 2,000 more this quarter. And our autonomous business, as Safra said, is growing in excess of 200%, [indiscernible] business off a small base. Admittedly, it's a relatively new product but it's on its way to being the most successful new product introduction in our company's history. 
Now this triple-digit growth rate, I expect will spike up dramatically because of another thing Safra just mentioned, our introduction of our autonomous database Cloud at Customer Gen2 Cloud at Customer. Now when people can start putting autonomous database, they're already -- I mean, all our autonomous database customers, let me be clear, are in our public cloud. A lot of our customers, especially those in regulated markets, big banks, people -- government agencies, defense ministries, people have that. They need the autonomous database capabilities behind their firewall in their data center. And over the next few months, we're rolling out this autonomous database Gen2 Cloud at Customer. 
Now all of our cloud competitors are trying to create these outposts of their cloud on the floors of their customers. We actually have it working. And in fact, we're in our second generation of this. We did it early. We did a reasonable first generation job but the second time's a charm. And this new Gen2 stuff was -- can be installed in a day. Now the first one, we installed in 4 days. We expect to do that even faster. There will be more time spent unpacking the hardware and plugging it in than readying the software because it just syncs up with our public cloud, and you're up and running. 
This is going to be a huge opportunity for us to dramatically increase the adoption rate on autonomous database. Very excited about that. The -- okay. The -- when that happens, we think by any measure, we will be -- not only have the overwhelming market share lead on-prem but the overall [indiscernible] market share lead in the cloud. We expect to hold on to our database franchise in a big way. 
So it's interesting that both of our autonomous database and our cloud applications are running in our new Gen2 highly secured infrastructure. And by the end of 2020, by the end of next calendar year, this time next year, I'll be able to say that we have more Gen2 data centers in more countries than Amazon Web Services have data centers, period. We're adding lots and lots of data centers in lots and lots of countries. And again, we'll have more data centers in more countries than Amazon by the end -- a year from now. That's very, very exciting. 
Now let's look at some of our autonomous database and Gen2 infrastructure wins this quarter. Okay. International, big manufacturing firm. Albertsons. This is another -- this is more synergies that -- I've got to mention, when people buy our applications, they buy our ERP applications. They also build data warehouses associated with those applications. They do a lot of work. So a lot of our application customers are beginning to be autonomous database customers and infrastructure customers. So yes, when you buy ERP, you might also buy HCM. But when you buy ERP, you're also going to buy the Fusion data warehouse, which is an autonomous database product and infrastructure product. You're going to buy analytics and our Gen2 data center. You're going to be an infrastructure customer as well as an application customer. And we see a lot of overlap. We often see people buying suites of applications, ERP plus HCM plus sales, things like that, but also applications plus infrastructure. 
Aon Financial Services. Biogen bought autonomous data warehouse. Cisco Systems. Again, Gen2 infrastructure and autonomous data warehouse, Clearstream Services, same thing, Gen2 infrastructure autonomous data warehouse. Embraer Aviation, the Brazilian airplane -- aircraft manufacturer, autonomous database and Gen2 infrastructure. Equity Bank of Kenya, autonomous database, Gen2 infrastructure.

Swiss Post, Gen2 infrastructure, autonomous data warehouse. Target, based in the United States, Autonomous Database, autonomous data warehouse. 
Technip Energy Company, but I've mentioned that but I believe, HCM, ERP, bought the full suite and Gen2 infrastructure and Autonomous Database. The Boston Globe, Gen2 infrastructure, Autonomous Database; Thermos, Autonomous Database, autonomous transaction processing. Hypers, Autonomous Database; Works, Netherlands, Gen2 infrastructure. Tokyo Gas & Electric, autonomous data warehouse, Gen2 infrastructure, Trimark USA, Gen2 infrastructure; Walgreens, autonomous data warehouse, autonomous transaction processing, Gen2 infrastructure.

Baxter Healthcare, autonomous data warehouse; Cigna Corporate Services, autonomous data warehouse, Gen2 infrastructure; Eventbrite, Gen2 infrastructure; Ford Motor Company, Gen2 infrastructure, Autonomous Database, autonomous warehouse; Mary Kay, Gen2 infrastructure; Samsung Electronics, Gen2 infrastructure, Autonomous Database, autonomous transaction processing. 
Vera, Gen2 infrastructure, Autonomous Database, autonomous transaction processing. With that, I will turn it over to the audience for questions."

And I appreciate many customers are including some of the required database option in their deals. But now that you're making it available on Gen2 Cloud at Customer, how should we think about the appetite from your installed base? How material can it be to your financials? And is there anything you might compare it to in Oracle's history?"

The very beginning, that's kind of created Oracle Corporation, right? So we have the very first commercial relational database. We had one before IBM did or anyone else did. So that trade -- that turned this company from an idea into the company that manages most of the world's information. 
So I would say Autonomous Database is that same kind of thing. It is so much different, so much favored to use, so much more reliable than anything else that's in the market, I think everyone is going to use it. Virtually everyone is going to use it. Now that said, it is -- it takes a while when you introduce an all-new product. The good news is we have a huge installed base. Yes, it takes a while for that -- for us to ship, if you will, a next-gen technology and get people comfortable with it and using it. And that first year, we've seen a lot of early adopters but the early adopters are now in the thousands. 
And we think, eventually, the only database will offer its Autonomous Database. It will replace everything else. And by the way, an Autonomous Database is only available in 2 forms. If we put a cloud -- if we put our cloud in your data center, that's our Exadata machine and our middleware machines and all of in our storage in your data center and in our public cloud. So we think it'll be consumed in 1 of those 2 ways and that will replace our entire base. So it means that our existing database business, from a financial standpoint, will more than double or triple, or triple probably is a reasonable estimate to look at. 
Now of course, when you're in your business, it's all about timing. And I wish I could tell you exactly how much we'll sell over the next 18 months. That's kind of tricky. And we don't have that many data points. We have 4 quarters of data points. And the first couple of quarters, it was so new. So we really only have a couple of quarters of data points. All I've been saying is none of us have ever seen an adoption rate like this before."

I don't know if it will stay that way, but that was a very significant headwind for us in that whole business. It is completely stabilized, it grew ever so slightly. Additionally, the adoption in our ERP cloud is now such that it's in the thousands. We have many, many references. And what happens in our business is that once you are sort of obviously referenceable, it becomes much, much easier for other potential customers to move ahead. 
One of the things that has been, to some extent, leading to a wait-and-see attitude by some historically business suite customers, was the adoption of first, availability and now adoption of supply chain. Our supply chain now has many, many customers. And so more of our customers are willing and interested in moving. Remember, every single quarter, 100-plus new features become available. And some of those have been must-have features for extremely happy customers in the business suite. 
Simultaneously, as Larry mentioned, SAP customers do realize that SAP's offerings are not cloud offerings. If you use SAP's technology, you don't get 100 new features every quarter. There's simply a hosted offering, which means that we are the obvious choice for customers who want to go through and really adopt digital approach in their business. And so for us, this is going to be success leads to more success. It's an incredibly virtuous cycle. And as Larry mentioned, what it also means is that additional modules are going with and that's clearly showing up in our other segments. 
And of course, HCM, which is obviously a match and then ultimately, the front office, where we've got a lot of new technology rolling out that is being adopted."

Imagine going from your existing SAP system, taking out work on replacing HANA and that's the only change. Basically, that's the only change. And it's hosted, it's not cloud. There is no cloud. 
I want to say, well, it's easy for Oracle to say, go to SAP's website and try to find the SAP cloud for ERP. I mean,, you can find it for the stuff they bought. You can find it for Callidus, which is on one cloud. You can find it for Ariba, which is on another cloud. You -- I mean, you can find it for little Survey Monkey and all the stuff that they bought. But they forgot to write ERP -- that's their business and they forgot to rewrite ERP there. They're projects that they had to do, they're called business by design fails, they canceled it. 
So there is no cloud option for SAP's customers. They can't go to Workday. Workday can't even handle mid-market ERP. So we're it. So believe me, they want an alternative to SAP. Makes sense, right, that they should want an alternative. But we've just got to demonstrate that we can safely take these enormous companies to the cloud in a way that they're not putting their business in any risk. And that's why this one particular giant implementation, they're watching closely. 
But by the way, they're not just watching and waiting. A number of their biggest customers in the heart of Germany, lots of them are working with -- these are German customers, the core of SAP are working with us and moving some of their divisions already on some of their divisions to Oracle Fusion to persuade themselves that we can do this safely. They've gone that far. They don't want to continue with this obsolete code. 
This is -- this opportunity is gigantic because we have 1 ERP customer -- competitor on-premise. They don't have a cloud offering, that's SAP. And we've got 1 ERP cloud competitor that just is not doing very well. I think a hard time getting their business off the ground. doesn't scale. There are a lot of problems. So we have a chance here to be -- to get what used to be in the old world called gate's share for ERP. And like Microsoft Office, to be the Microsoft Office of ERP and it's sitting there. And we just have to get this last proof point out to SAP's largest customers, yes, we can do this, we can do it safely. And we will be overwhelmingly the largest application company in the cloud."

I think the most interesting thing that's going on is we've decided to take, if you will, an AWS approach to selling Autonomous Database in the cloud. So we almost prefer selling a $30,000 deal to $100,000 deal because a $30,000 deal, we can close in 4 weeks. So we think the way to sell Autonomous Database is to get it installed on a project in one of our customers, get it going, help them become successful. And then once they [indiscernible] once they actually got their hands on autonomous database, and they have working out and they have working projects, working data warehouses, working transaction processing systems, you start land and expand. 
So we are selling thousands and thousands of small deals. And some of those deals are already coming back as larger deals. But our approach again, is to -- and most of it is not BYOL because they're small. I mean, some of it is. Not -- some of it is BYOL but the majority is not BYOL. It was interesting in the early days in ERP when we had ERP, people moving our e-business suite customers. No, they were new logos. In the early days in cloud ERP for us, they were new logos. Believe it or not, we're actually seeing new logos and database. But again, most of them are our customers. But they're not using their existing licenses, they're going ahead and using -- using a standard cloud license what we call take. They pay us [indiscernible] You pay for what you use. I mean, it's the promise of the cloud. 
And we're getting thousands of these because we think the best-selling technique for Autonomous Database is try it get it running, watch. It backs itself up. It upgrades itself. It tunes itself. It configures itself. There's nothing like it. We just got it in those hearts and minds. And the way to do that is go wide across our entire customer base. That's what's going on. And  again, it's working very, very well. I think it's working very, very well because we're seeing -- just beginning to see the first people coming back and going from $30,000 a month to $600,000 a month."

But before I start, I'd like to acknowledge and thank you all for the many, many sincere condolences we received upon Mark's passing. Thank you. They mean a lot to us.
As you can see, we had another solid quarter. This quarter, we finished with total revenue growth within my guidance range and EPS at the high end. Cloud Services and License Support continue to see material growth. And given that it represents more than 70% of our total revenue, it more than offsets declines in some smaller nonstrategic businesses. We continue to be encouraged that our overall revenue growth will further accelerate as we reach the final stages of this ongoing shift in business mix.
Of late, I've been spending much more time with customers. The overriding theme I hear is the compelling nature of our technology and how it is critical to the success of their businesses: feature-rich, simple, secure, performant and priced right. They see Oracle as being strategic to their ongoing operations, and they tell me repeatedly that Oracle is the right partner to run their mission-critical assets, both in the cloud and on-premise. Their comments reinforce our conviction that our product strategy is right.
At Oracle, we've upgraded our internal systems to the cloud, and we are sharing our experience with customers by describing the stunning benefits and efficiencies that can be realized from the move. And knowing we have thousands of customers that references our own experience adopting Oracle Cloud applications and infrastructure allows us to serve as a unique and knowledgeable adviser to customers who want to know how to go about their own digital transformation.
To give you some context, let me share just a few of the many benefits we are seeing in our business. With Fusion ERP cloud, we are now able to close our books and report earnings in 12 days or less. Many companies don't report their results for weeks. And not only can we get our results out faster, but we've saved money, too. By using the AI and processes in Fusion ERP cloud, we have been able to eliminate more than 30% of our manual accounting activities. And enabled by Fusion HCM cloud, we have seen employee satisfaction levels soar with all-time high rates for things like hiring and onboarding new employees. We've also made it easier for our managers and employees as Fusion HCM reduces the time needed to complete the talent review process by more than 70%. And separately, we're saving more than 20,000 hours of manager time each year with our accelerated job offer process.
In sales, we're using our front-office cloud platform, augmented with machine learning and our own data cloud, to help our salespeople sell more and sell more quickly. With Marketing Cloud, campaign planning now takes days rather than weeks. And with built-in machine learning, we've seen a doubling in lead conversion. We automatically capture millions of activities in sales cloud each year. And with CPQ cloud, ordering is much faster and easier with over 70% of our transactions fully automated. We needed that to handle the increased volumes of transactions as a result of our customers' move to the cloud. In addition, we've adopted the Gen2 Infrastructure, including Autonomous Database, for our custom apps. Our internal IT costs to run these systems are down by millions while, at the same time, we are adopting more than 100 new features each quarter.
Here at Oracle, we are going to continue using our own cloud technology as an intelligent automation engine and continue to simplify our business model and processes. In turn, I expect that our revenue growth rates will increase and see even more expense efficiencies. And as a result, I expect that you will see us expand our margins and grow EPS double digits for the foreseeable future.
Now on to the numbers. I'll review our non-GAAP results using constant dollar growth rates, unless I state otherwise. Currency for Q2 was largely in line with my guidance at nearly 1%, and the fact that the growth rates look the same in a few categories is simply because of rounding. Total Cloud Services and License Support revenues for the quarter were $6.8 billion, up 3%, accounting for over 70% of total company revenues and most of this is recurring revenue.
Cloud and On-Premise License revenues were $1.1 billion, down 7% as more of our GBU customers order cloud instead of license. In terms of ecosystem, GAAP application ecosystem revenues were $2.9 billion, up 4%, with Fusion apps up in the low 30s, including Fusion ERP, up 38%; and Fusion HCM, up 23%. NetSuite ERP was up 28%. Vertical SaaS was up low double digits, while data cloud stabilized. On a trailing 12-month basis, more than 90% of our application ecosystem revenue is recurring.
GAAP infrastructure ecosystem revenues were $5 billion, up 1%, with total database revenue up 1% highlighted by BYOL and Autonomous Database revenues, both up over 200% but off a small base for now. On a trailing 12-month basis, more than 3/4 of our infrastructure ecosystem revenue is recurring. Just a few days ago, we were able to get our first Gen2 Exadata Cloud at Customer fully deployed and connected. It was done in just 4 days. Previously, with our Gen1 architecture, this typically took significantly longer. As a result, we are very optimistic about the impact our Gen2 Cloud at Customer will have on our business. No other cloud provider has the right technology to actually do this.
In terms of geographies, we saw double-digit revenue growth in SaaS revenue in all regions, except EMEA, with especially strong results in Latin America and Japan. Gross margin for Cloud Services and License Support was 85%, down slightly from last quarter due to accelerated investments in our Gen2 cloud to address higher demand worldwide. As we get to scale, I expect our cloud gross margins will grow higher, driving an acceleration in our gross profit growth.
By the way, our strategic hardware products delivered on-premise, which includes Exadata, grew double digits for the quarter, once again showing that our installed base of customers focused on our world-leading database platform continues to grow. Total revenue for the quarter were $9.6 billion, up 1% from last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $4 billion, essentially unchanged from last year; and operating margin was 42%, down from 43% last year. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 18.8%, slightly below our base tax rate of 20%; and EPS was $0.90 in USD, up 13% in constant currency and 12% in USD. The GAAP tax rate was 17.7%. And GAAP EPS was $0.69 in USD, up 15% in constant currency, 14% in USD.
Operating cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $13.8 billion. Over the last 4 quarters, capital expenditures were $1.6 billion, and free cash flow was $12.2 billion. We now have approximately $27 billion in cash and marketable securities. And short-term net deferred revenue balance is $8.1 billion, down 1% in constant currency due to timing differences in customer payments. Also, the prior year deferred balance was affected by our transition to ASC 606. Gross deferred revenue was up over 1% in constant currency and would have been up over 3% if not for the ASC 606 transition changes.
We remain committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases and prudent use of debt and the dividend. This quarter, we repurchased 91 million shares for a total of $5 billion. Over the last 12 months, we've repurchased nearly 500 million shares for a total of $26 billion. And over the last 5 years, we've reduced the shares outstanding by more than 25%. The Board of Directors again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.24 per share.
My guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency. Assuming current exchange rates remain the same as they are now, currency should have a 1% negative effect on total revenue and $0.01 negative effect on EPS. So for Q3, total revenues are expected to grow 1% to 3% in constant currency. And assuming a 1% currency headwind, total revenues are expected to grow 1% to 3% in USD. Now I realize that my USD and constant currency revenue guidance sound like they're the same number, but it's just rounding, similar to our revenue growth this quarter. I do expect a currency impact of nearly 1%.
Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to grow between 10% to 12% and be between $0.96 and $0.98 in constant currency. And assuming a $0.01 headwind, non-GAAP EPS in USD is expected to grow between 9% and 11% and be between $0.95 and $0.97 in USD. Total CapEx for fiscal year '20 is expected to be around $2.2 billion, but it could move higher based on demand for data center growth.
My EPS guidance for Q2 and fiscal year '20 assumes a base tax rate of 20%. However, onetime tax events could cause actual tax rates for any given quarter to vary from our base tax rate. But I expect that in normalizing for those onetime tax benefits -- tax events, our tax rate will average around 20% in fiscal year 2020.
And finally, for fiscal year 2020, I continue to expect that in constant currency, total revenue will grow faster than last year, and that we will report double-digit EPS growth for the year.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry for his comments."

As I've said before, there are 2 key product areas that will determine Oracle's future in the cloud: Cloud ERP applications and the Autonomous Database. Being the clear #1 in both of these 2 giant applications and infrastructure market segments will enable the success of our other application and infrastructure products in adjacent market segments.
This is already happening in applications. We have a huge lead in Cloud ERP with over 7,000 Fusion ERP customers and 20,000 NetSuite ERP customers. Our closest cloud ERP competitor is Workday, and they claim to have a few hundred ERP customers. Workday's lack of success in cloud ERP is creating opportunities for Oracle in cloud HCM. More and more, we are seeing HCM as being purchased as a part of an ERP cloud application suite. As a result, today, we have more HCM customers than Workday. And we're beginning to see that same integrated suite strategy beginning to drive our sales of CX, customer experience, applications in sales and service and in marketing.
SAP never rewrote their ERP applications for the cloud. As a result, SAP's installed base is very vulnerable. We've already replaced and successfully migrated many midsized SAP customers from SAP to Fusion ERP. Importantly, a few months from now, in Q1 calendar year 2020, one of SAP's biggest customers will go live on Fusion ERP. Many of SAP's largest customers are already working with us to develop plans to migrate to Fusion ERP. SAP's customer base is up for grabs. They didn't rewrite their applications for the cloud. That has created an enormous opportunity for Oracle.
We're already declared #1 in the cloud ERP market as measured in market share. And our Cloud ERP business is already growing at a rate of over 30%. By offering a safe and compelling alternative to SAP's old technology, we can increase our applications growth rate far beyond that 30%. We are very, very comfortable that we will be the overwhelming winner in this generation cloud ERP business.
Now let's look at some application wins in the quarter. Advanced Publications, media company, bought ERP. Albertsons got ERP, EPM and supply chain. C.H. Robinson Worldwide, transportation company, bought ERP and EPM. DHL Supply Chain, big German company, bought ERP, EPM and supply chain. Edwards Lifesciences, a medical equipment company, bought ERP. By the way, I'm not mentioning any associated HCM deals because I have a separate list for HCM. So a lot of these guys -- maybe next quarter, I'll put the HCM deals right next to the ERP deal so you could see -- because I'll be repeating a lot of these names when I get to my HCM list. That's the point I made earlier that people are now looking at HCM as just another module that we need in the back office. Very important.
Edwards Lifesciences bought ERP. Ferguson, a manufacturing firm, bought ERP and supply chain. Globo company, big energy firm, bought ERP, EPM and supply chain. NCR Financial Services bought ERP, EPM and supply chain. NetScout, telecommunications company, bought supply chain. Mutual Life Assurance bought ERP and supply chain. Southern Star Central Gas Pipeline, a big energy company, bought ERP. Technip, another energy company, bought ERP. By the way, SAP is supposed to be very strong in energy. Texas Children's Health Care Hospital (sic) [ Texas Children's Hospital ] bought ERP, EPM and supply chain. Unilever bought ERP and supply chain. Baker Hughes, energy company, bought ERP, EPM and supply chain. Carlson Wagonlit, travel services, ERP, CPM and supply chain. Kuwait Petroleum, energy company, bought ERP, EPM and supply chain. Liberty Global, communications company, ERP, EPM and supply chain. Manpower, global services company, bought ERP, EPM and supply chain. Sherwin-Williams, that's what they bought: ERP, EPM and supply chain, the suite. A lot of people are buying multiple modules. It's not just ERP. It's ERP, it's EPM, Enterprise Performance Management. It's supply chain. It's manufacturing. Bank of New York Mellon bought ERP, EPM and supply chain.
Airport Terminal Services -- oh, I'm sorry, now I'm on my HCM group. I'm on the HCM group, they're all grouped together. Airport Terminal Services bought HCM. [ Apparel Bosco ], retail, HCM. Banque Saudi fransi bought HCM. CenterPoint Energy, another energy company, bought HCM. Cummins, manufacturing company, HCM; Graybar Electric bought HCM; Hologic, HCM. HUS, that's the hospital -- those hospitals in Finland run by the federal government in Finland, bought HCM; Mountaire Farms, HCM. North Atlantic Refining -- again, this is my HCM list -- a big energy company, and SAP's stronghold in the energy sector bought HCM from us; Southern Star Central Pipeline, big gas company, energy, HCM; Technip, energy company, HCM. Tenet Healthcare bought HCM, Texas Children's Hospital bought HCM and [ Roto Brands ] bought HCM. Birmingham City Council bought HCM. Kuwait Petroleum Company, a big energy company, bought HCM. MEDNAX health care, HCM; Phoenix Life Holdings, HCM. In customer experience, Equinix bought service. Ferguson Enterprises bought service. Ferrari bought sales and marketing. IKEA bought service. Nordstrom bought service. PayPal bought marketing, Rabobank bought service and Santander Bank bought service.
Okay. Let me move on to the other segment, which is Autonomous Database and Gen2 infrastructure. In the database market, we are the overwhelming #1 with a combination of a dominant share on-premise and very strong market share in the cloud. Though I have yet to see any good data on database market share in the cloud. Our database business is growing very, very rapidly because we have an enormous technology advantage in the cloud over all of our competitors with Autonomous Database.
Autonomous Database is the world's only autonomous database. What does that mean? That means when you configure the system, you don't do anything. The system configures itself. Robots configure the system. The reason Capital One lost all that data at AWS is because one of the Capital One people made a configuration error. You can't make configuration errors with the autonomous database because human beings don't configure the system. A lot of these above-the-fold headlines of people losing their data are caused by human errors. People forget to patch systems. Remember that one? They patched some but not all of the systems. And Equifax. Equifax, it was [ patch ] database, didn't get patched. They didn't find them all.
Guess what? Autonomous Database automatically patches itself when a security flaw is detected. And by the way, they detected that security flaw over that time at Equifax. They knew about it. They just didn't get around to patching it. Patching is hard. They have to find all the databases. You have to schedule downtime. You don't schedule downtime with the Autonomous Database. You patch the Autonomous Database while the database is still running. But you don't patch the database. It's the robots. Our robots patch the database. That's why it's autonomous. There's no human labor, so there's no human error. So if you're willing to pay less and not have that human labor, you get rid of all those mistakes.
This is a gigantic technology advantage. By the way, and we're 10x faster than anything Amazon has. That means we're much cheaper than anything Amazon has, much safer, much easier to use, build applications faster. So we already have thousands of Autonomous Database customers running in our public cloud. We added 2,000 more this quarter. And our autonomous business, as Safra said, is growing in excess of 200%, our Autonomous Database business, off a small base. Admittedly, it's a relatively new product, but it's on its way to being the most successful new product introduction in our company's history.
Now this triple-digit growth rate I expect will spike up dramatically because of another thing Safra just mentioned, our introduction of our Autonomous Database Cloud at Customer, Gen2 Cloud at Customer. Now when people can start putting Autonomous Database, they're already -- I mean all our Autonomous Database customers, let me be clear, are in our public cloud. A lot of our customers, especially those in regulated markets, big banks, people -- government agencies, defense ministries, people have thought, they need the Autonomous Database capabilities behind their firewall in their data center. And over the next few months, we're rolling out this Autonomous Database Gen2 Cloud at Customer.
Now all of our cloud competitors are trying to create these outposts of their cloud on the floors of their customers. We actually have it working. And in fact, we're in our second generation of this. We did it early, albeit a reasonable first generation job, but the second time's a charm. And this new Gen2 stuff was -- can be installed in a day. Now the first one we installed in 4 days. We expect to do that even faster. There will be more time spent unpacking the hardware and plugging it in than readying the software because it just syncs up with our public cloud, and you're off and running. This is going to be a huge opportunity for us to dramatically increase the adoption rate on Autonomous Database, very excited about that. When that happens, we think by any measure, we will be -- not only have the overwhelming market share lead on-prem but the overwhelming market share lead in the cloud. We expect to hold on to our database franchise in a big way.
So it's interesting that both of our Autonomous Database and our cloud applications are running in our new Gen2 highly secure infrastructure. And by the end of 2020, by the end of next calendar year, this time next year, I'll be able to say that we have more Gen2 data centers in more countries than Amazon Web Services has data centers, period. We're adding lots and lots of data centers in lots and lots of countries. And again, we'll have more data centers in more countries than Amazon by the end -- a year from now. That's very, very exciting.
Now let's look at some of our Autonomous Database and Gen2 infrastructure wins this quarter. Okay. Afia International, big manufacturing firm; Albertsons. This is another -- this is more synergy that -- I've got to mention, when people buy our applications, they buy our ERP applications. They also build data warehouses associated with those applications. They do a lot of work. So a lot of our application customers are beginning to be Autonomous Database customers and infrastructure customers. So yes, when you buy ERP, you might also buy HCM. But when you buy ERP, you're also going to buy the Fusion data warehouse, which is an Autonomous Database product and an infrastructure product. You're going to buy analytics and our Gen2 data center. You're going to become an infrastructure customer as well as an application customer. And we see a lot of overlap. We often see people buying suites of applications, ERP plus HCM plus sales, things like that, but also applications plus infrastructure.

But now that you're making it available on Gen2 Cloud at Customer, how should we think about the appetite from your installed base? How material can it be to your financials?

I mean either -- in terms of the technological breakthrough, well, I guess, we're the first commercial relational database. At the very beginning, that's kind of what created Oracle Corporation, right? So we have the very first commercial relational database. We had one before IBM did or anyone else did. So that traded -- that turned this company from an idea into the company that manages most of the world's information. So I would say Autonomous Database is that same kind of thing. It is so much different, so much favored to use, so much more reliable than anything else that's in the market. I think everyone is going to use it. Virtually everyone is going to use it. Now that said, it is -- it takes a while when you introduce an all-new product. The good news is we have a huge installed base. It takes a while for that -- for us to ship, if you will, a next-gen technology and get people comfortable with it and using it. And that first year, we've seen a lot of early adopters, but the early adopters are now in the thousands. And we think, eventually, the only database we'll offer is Autonomous Database. It will replace everything else.
And by the way, an Autonomous Database is only available in 2 forms. If we put a cloud -- if we put our cloud in your data center, that's our Exadata machine and our middleware machines, and all of that's in our storage in your data center and in our public cloud. So we think it'll be consumed in one of those 2 ways and that will replace our entire base. So it means that our existing database business, from a financial standpoint, will more than double or triple -- or triple probably is a reasonable estimate to look at. Now of course, when you're in your business, it's all about timing. And I wish I could tell you exactly how much we'll sell over the next 18 months. That's kind of tricky. Now we don't have that many data points. We have 4 quarters of data points. And the first couple of quarters, it was so new. So we really only have a couple of quarters of data points. All I can say is none of us have ever seen an adoption rate like this before."

I don't know if it will stay that way, but that was a very significant headwind for us in that whole business. It has completely stabilized. It grew ever so slightly. Additionally, the adoption in our ERP cloud is now such that -- it's in the thousands. We have many, many references. And what happens in our business is that once you are sort of obviously referenceable, it becomes much, much easier for other potential customers to move ahead. One of the things that had been, to some extent, leading to a wait-and-see attitude by some historically business suite customers was the adoption of, first, availability and now adoption of supply chain. Our supply chain now has many, many customers. And so more of our customers are willing and interested in moving. Remember, every single quarter, 100-plus new features become available. And some of those have been must-have features for extremely happy customers in the business suite.
Simultaneously, as Larry mentioned, SAP customers realize that SAP's offerings are not cloud offerings. If you use SAP's technology, you don't get 100 new features every quarter. Theirs is simply a hosted offering, which means that we are the obvious choice for customers who want to go through and really adopt digital approach in their business. And so for us, this is going to be success leads to more success. It's an incredibly virtuous cycle. And as Larry mentioned, what it also means is that additional modules are going with, and that's clearly showing up in our other segments. And of course, HCM, which is obviously a match and then ultimately, the front office, where we've got a lot of new technology rolling out that is being adopted."

And we've got them live, and we have references. But right at the very apex of SAP's customer base, in their top 50 customers around the world, they're -- looking at this one particular implementation that -- where we expect to go live in March of next year. And I would describe them as rooting for us. They want to have an alternative to a $1 billion SAP upgrade. SAP end-of-life, their current stuff, in 2025. So if you're a big SAP customer, you've got to make it -- in fact, some people have bought -- actually bought ahead -- actually bought S/4HANA in the cloud with no plan -- with no really good plan to implement. It's a 5-year implementation. They're getting price quotes of $1 billion for the upgrade. Imagine going from your existing SAP system, taking out Oracle and replacing HANA, and that's the only change. Basically, that's the only change. And it's hosted, it's not cloud. There is no cloud.
Anyway, I want to say -- well, it's easy for Oracle to say, go to SAP's website and try to find the SAP cloud for ERP. I mean you can find it for the stuff they bought. You can find it for Callidus, which is on one cloud. You can find it for Ariba, which is on another cloud. You -- I mean you can find it for a little SurveyMonkey and all the stuff that they bought. But they forgot to write ERP -- that's their business, and they forgot to rewrite ERP. Their projects that they had to do, called business by design, failed. They canceled it. So there is no cloud option for SAP's customers. They can't go to Workday. Workday can't even handle mid-market ERP. So we're it. So believe me, they want an alternative to SAP. Makes sense, right, that they should want an alternative. But we've just got to demonstrate that we can safely take these enormous companies to the cloud in a way that they're not putting their business in any risk. And that's why this one particular giant implementation, they're watching closely.
But by the way, they're not just watching and waiting. A number of their biggest customers in the heart of Germany, lots of them are working with -- these are German customers, the core of SAP, are working with us and taking some of their -- moving some of their divisions already -- some of their divisions to Oracle Fusion to persuade themselves that we can do this safely. They've gone that far. They don't want to continue with this obsolete code. This is -- this opportunity is gigantic because we have 1 ERP customer on -- competitor on-premise. They don't have a cloud offering, that's SAP. And we've got 1 ERP cloud competitor that just is not doing very well, having a hard time getting their business off the ground, doesn't scale, there are a lot of problems. So we have a chance here to be -- to get what used to be in the old world called gate share for ERP and like Microsoft Office, to be the Microsoft Office of ERP, and it's sitting there. And we just have to get this last proof point out to SAP's largest customers, yes, we can do this, we can do it safely. And we will be overwhelmingly the largest application company in the cloud."

I think the most interesting thing that's going on is we've decided to take, if you will, an AWS approach to selling Autonomous Database in the cloud.

I think the most interesting thing that's going on is we've decided to take, if you will, an AWS approach to selling Autonomous Database in the cloud. So we almost prefer selling a $30,000 deal to $100,000 deal because a $30,000 deal, we can close in 4 weeks. So we think the way to sell Autonomous Database is to get it installed on a project in one of our customers, get it going, help them become successful. And then once they actually got their hands on Autonomous Database, and they have working out -- and they have working projects, working data warehouses, working transaction processing systems, you start land-and-expand.
So we are selling thousands and thousands of small deals. And some of those deals are already coming back as larger deals. But our approach again, is to -- and most of it is not BYOL because they're small. I mean some of it is, not -- some of it is BYOL, but the majority is not BYOL. It was interesting in the early days in ERP, when we had ERP, people said, well, you just moved the e-business suite customers. No, they were new logos. But in the early days, in cloud ERP for us, they were new logos. Believe it or not, we're actually seeing new logos in database. But again, most of them are our customers. But they're not using their existing licenses, they're going ahead and using a standard cloud license, it's called -- what we call takeup. They pay us takeup, you pay for what you use. I mean it's the promise of the cloud.
And we're getting thousands of these because we think the best-selling technique for Autonomous Database is try it, get it running, watch. It backs itself up. It upgrades itself. It tunes itself. It configures itself. There's nothing like it. We just got to win those hearts and minds. And the way to do that is go wide across our entire customer base. That's what's going on. And again, it's working very, very well. I think it's working very, very well because we're seeing -- just beginning to see the first people coming back and going from $30,000 a month to $600,000 a month."

But before I start, I'd like to acknowledge and thank you all for the many, many sincere condolences we received upon Mark's passing. Thank you. They mean a lot to us.
As you can see, we had another solid quarter. This quarter, we finished with total revenue growth within my guidance range and EPS at the high end. Cloud Services and License Support continue to see material growth. And given that it represents more than 70% of our total revenue, it more than offsets declines in some smaller, nonstrategic businesses. We continue to be encouraged that our overall revenue growth will further accelerate as we reach the final stages of this ongoing shift in business mix.
Of late, I've been spending much more time with customers. The overriding theme I hear is the compelling nature of our technology and how it is critical to the success of their businesses: feature-rich, simple, secure, performant and priced right. They see Oracle as being strategic to their ongoing operations, and they tell me repeatedly that Oracle is the right partner to run their mission-critical assets, both in the cloud and on-premise. Their comments reinforce our conviction that our product strategy is right.
At Oracle, we've upgraded our internal systems to the cloud, and we are sharing our experience with customers by describing the stunning benefits and efficiencies that can be realized from the move. And know we have thousands of customers that references our own experience adopting Oracle Cloud applications and infrastructure allows us to serve as a unique and knowledgeable adviser to customers who want to know how to go about their own digital transformation.
To give you some context, let me share just a few of the many benefits we are seeing in our business. With Fusion ERP cloud, we are now able to close our books and report earnings in 12 days or less. Many companies don't report their results for weeks. And not only can we get our results out faster, but we've saved money, too. By using the AI and processes in Fusion ERP cloud, we have been able to eliminate more than 30% of our manual accounting activities. And enabled by Fusion HCM cloud, we have seen employee satisfaction levels soar with all-time high rates for things like hiring and onboarding new employees. We've also made it easier for our managers and employees as Fusion HCM reduces the time needed to complete the talent review process by more than 70%. And separately, we're saving more than 20,000 hours of manager time each year with our accelerated job offer process.
In sales, we're using our front-office cloud platform, augmented with machine learning and our own data cloud, to help our salespeople sell more and sell more quickly. With Marketing Cloud, campaign planning now takes days rather than weeks. And with built-in machine learning, we've seen a doubling in lead conversion. We automatically capture millions of activities in sales cloud each year. And with CPQ cloud, ordering is much faster and easier with over 70% of our transactions fully automated. We needed that to handle the increased volumes of transactions as a result of our customers' move to the cloud. In addition, we've adopted the Gen2 Infrastructure, including Autonomous Database, for our custom apps. Our internal IT costs to run these systems are down by millions while, at the same time, we are adopting more than 100 new features each quarter.
Here at Oracle, we are going to continue using our own cloud technology as an intelligent automation engine and continue to simplify our business model and processes. In turn, I expect that our revenue growth rates will increase and see even more expense efficiencies. And as a result, I expect that you will see us expand our margins and grow EPS double digits for the foreseeable future.
Now on to the numbers. I'll review our non-GAAP results using constant dollar growth rates, unless I state otherwise. Currency for Q2 was largely in line with my guidance at nearly 1%, and the fact that the growth rates looked the same in a few categories is simply because of rounding. Total Cloud Services and License Support revenues for the quarter were $6.8 billion, up 3%, accounting for over 70% of total company revenues and most of this is recurring revenue.
Cloud and On-Premise License revenues were $1.1 billion, down 7% as more of our GBU customers order cloud instead of license. In terms of ecosystem, GAAP application ecosystem revenues were $2.9 billion, up 4%, with Fusion apps up in the low 30s, including Fusion ERP, up 38%; and Fusion HCM, up 23%. NetSuite ERP was up 28%. Vertical SaaS was up low double digits, while data cloud stabilized. On a trailing 12-month basis, more than 90% of our application ecosystem revenue is recurring.
GAAP infrastructure ecosystem revenues were $5 billion, up 1%, with total database revenue up 1% highlighted by BYOL and Autonomous Database revenues, both up over 200% but off a small base for now. On a trailing 12-month basis, more than 3/4 of our infrastructure ecosystem revenue is recurring. Just a few days ago, we were able to get our first Gen2 Exadata Cloud at Customer fully deployed and connected. It was done in just 4 days. Previously, with our Gen1 architecture, this typically took significantly longer. As a result, we are very optimistic about the impact our Gen2 Cloud at Customer will have on our business. No other cloud provider has the right technology to actually do this.
In terms of geographies, we saw double-digit revenue growth in SaaS revenue in all regions, except EMEA, with especially strong results in Latin America and Japan. Gross margin for Cloud Services and License Support was 85%, down slightly from last quarter due to accelerated investments in our Gen2 cloud to address higher demand worldwide. As we get to scale, I expect our cloud gross margins will grow higher, driving an acceleration in our gross profit growth.
By the way, our strategic hardware products delivered on-premise, which includes Exadata, grew double digits for the quarter, once again showing that our installed base of customers focused on our world-leading database platform continues to grow. Total revenue for the quarter were $9.6 billion, up 1% from last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $4 billion, essentially unchanged from last year; and operating margin was 42%, down from 43% last year. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 18.8%, slightly below our base tax rate of 20%; and EPS was $0.90 in USD, up 13% in constant currency and 12% in USD. The GAAP tax rate was 17.7%. And GAAP EPS was $0.69 in USD, up 15% in constant currency, 14% in USD.
Operating cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $13.8 billion. Over the last 4 quarters, capital expenditures were $1.6 billion, and free cash flow was $12.2 billion. We now have approximately $27 billion in cash and marketable securities. And short-term net deferred revenue balance is $8.1 billion, down 1% in constant currency due to timing differences in customer payments. Also, the prior year deferred balance was affected by our transition to ASC 606. Gross deferred revenue was up over 1% in constant currency and would have been up over 3% if not for the ASC 606 transition changes.
We remain committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases and prudent use of debt and the dividend. This quarter, we repurchased 91 million shares for a total of $5 billion. Over the last 12 months, we've repurchased nearly 500 million shares for a total of $26 billion. And over the last 5 years, we've reduced the shares outstanding by more than 25%. The Board of Directors again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.24 per share.
My guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency. Assuming current exchange rates remain the same as they are now, currency should have a 1% negative effect on total revenue and $0.01 negative effect on EPS. So for Q3, total revenues are expected to grow 1% to 3% in constant currency. And assuming a 1% currency headwind, total revenues are expected to grow 1% to 3% in USD. Now I realize that my USD and constant currency revenue guidance sound like they're the same number, but it's just rounding, similar to our revenue growth this quarter. I do expect a currency impact of nearly 1%.
Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to grow between 10% to 12% and be between $0.96 and $0.98 in constant currency. And assuming a $0.01 headwind, non-GAAP EPS in USD is expected to grow between 9% and 11% and be between $0.95 and $0.97 in USD. Total CapEx for fiscal year '20 is expected to be around $2.2 billion, but it could move higher based on demand for data center growth.
My EPS guidance for Q2 and fiscal year '20 assumes a base tax rate of 20%. However, onetime tax events could cause actual tax rates for any given quarter to vary from our base tax rate. But I expect that in normalizing for those onetime tax benefits -- tax events, our tax rate will average around 20% in fiscal year 2020.
And finally, for fiscal year 2020, I continue to expect that in constant currency, total revenue will grow faster than last year, and that we will report double-digit EPS growth for the year.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry for his comments."

As I've said before, there are 2 key product areas that will determine Oracle's future in the cloud: Cloud ERP applications and the Autonomous Database. Being the clear #1 in both of these 2 giant applications and infrastructure market segments will enable the success of our other application and infrastructure products in adjacent market segments.
This is already happening in applications. We have a huge lead in Cloud ERP with over 7,000 Fusion ERP customers and 20,000 NetSuite ERP customers. Our closest cloud ERP competitor is Workday, and they claim to have a few hundred ERP customers. Workday's lack of success in cloud ERP is creating opportunities for Oracle in cloud HCM. More and more, we are seeing HCM as being purchased as a part of an ERP cloud application suite. As a result, today, we have more HCM customers than Workday. And we're beginning to see that same integrated suite strategy beginning to drive our sales of CX, customer experience, applications in sales, in service and in marketing.
SAP never rewrote their ERP applications for the cloud. As a result, SAP's installed base is very vulnerable. We've already replaced and successfully migrated many midsized SAP customers from SAP to Fusion ERP. Importantly, a few months from now, in Q1 calendar year 2020, one of SAP's biggest customers will go live on Fusion ERP. Many of SAP's largest customers are already working with us to develop plans to migrate to Fusion ERP. SAP's customer base is up for grabs. They didn't reroute their applications for the cloud. That has created an enormous opportunity for Oracle.
We're already declared #1 in the cloud ERP market as measured in market share. And our Cloud ERP business is already growing at a rate of over 30%. By offering a safe and compelling alternative to SAP's old technology, we can increase our applications growth rate far beyond that 30%. We are very, very comfortable that we will be overwhelming winner in this generation cloud ERP business.
Now let's look at some application wins in the quarter. Advance Publications, a media company, bought ERP. Albertsons got ERP, EPM and supply chain. C.H. Robinson Worldwide, a transportation company, bought ERP and EPM. DHL Supply Chain, big German company, bought ERP, EPM and supply chain. Edwards Lifesciences, a medical equipment company, bought ERP. By the way, I'm not mentioning any associated HCM deals because I have a separate list for HCM. So a lot of these guys -- maybe next quarter, I'll put the HCM deals right next to the ERP deal so you could see -- because I'll be repeating a lot of these names when I get to my HCM list. That's the point I made earlier that people are now looking at HCM as just another module that we need in the back office. Very important.
Edwards Lifesciences bought ERP. Ferguson, a manufacturing firm, bought ERP and supply chain. Globo companies, big energy firm, bought ERP, EPM and supply chain. NCR Financial Services bought ERP, EPM and supply chain. NetScout, telecommunications company, bought supply chain. Mutual Life Assurance bought ERP and supply chain. Southern Star Central Gas Pipeline, big energy company, bought ERP. Technip, another energy company, bought ERP. By the way, SAP is supposed to be very strong in energy. Texas Children's Health Care -- Hospital bought ERP, EPM and supply chain. Unilever bought ERP and supply chain. Baker Hughes, energy company, bought ERP, EPM and supply chain. Carlson Wagonlit, travel services, ERP, CPM and supply chain. Kuwait Petroleum, energy company, bought ERP, EPM and supply chain. Liberty Global, communications company, ERP, EPM and supply chain. Manpower, the global services company, bought ERP, EPM and supply chain. Sherwin-Williams, that's what they bought: ERP, EPM and supply chain, the suite. A lot of people are buying multiple modules. It's not just ERP. It's ERP, it's EPM, Enterprise Performance Management. It's supply chain. It's manufacturing. Bank of New York Mellon bought ERP, EPM and supply chain.
Airport Terminal Services -- oh, I'm sorry, now I'm on my HCM group. I'm in the HCM group, they're all grouped together. Airport Terminal Services bought HCM. [ Apparel Bosco ], retail, HCM. Banque Saudi fransi bought HCM. CenterPoint Energy, another energy company, bought HCM. Cummins, manufacturing company, HCM; Graybar Electric bought HCM; Holologic (sic) [ Hologic ], HCM. HUS, that's the hospital -- those are the hospitals in Finland run by the federal government in Finland, bought HCM; Mountaire Farms, HCM. North Atlantic Refining -- again, this is my HCM list -- big energy company, and SAP's stronghold in the energy sector, bought HCM from us; Southern Star Central Pipeline, big gas company, energy, HCM; Technip, energy company, HCM. Tenet Healthcare bought HCM, Texas Children's Hospital bought HCM and Whatabrands bought HCM. Birmingham City Council bought HCM. Kuwait Petroleum Company, a big energy company, bought HCM. MEDNAX health care, HCM; Phoenix Life Holdings, HCM. 
In customer experience, Equinix bought service. Ferguson Enterprises bought service. Ferrari bought sales and marketing. IKEA bought service. Nordstrom bought service. PayPal bought marketing, Rabobank bought service and Santander Bank bought service.
Okay. Let me move on to the other segment, which is Autonomous Database and Gen2 infrastructure. In the database market, we are the overwhelming #1 with a combination of a dominant share on-premise and very strong market share in the cloud. Though I have yet to see any good data on database market share in the cloud. Our database business is growing very, very rapidly because we have an enormous technology advantage in the cloud over all of our competitors with Autonomous Database.
Autonomous Database is the world's only autonomous database. What does that mean? That means when you configure the system, you don't do anything. The system configures itself. Robots configure the system. The reason Capital One lost all that data at AWS is because one of the Capital One people made a configuration error. You can't make configuration errors with the autonomous database because human beings don't configure the system. A lot of these above-the-fold headlines of people losing their data are caused by human errors. People forget to patch systems. Remember that one? They patched some but not all of the systems. And Equifax. Equifax, it was a patchy [ structured ] database, didn't get patched. They didn't find them all.
Guess what? Autonomous Database automatically patches itself when a security flaw is detected. And by the way, they detected that security flaw over at Equifax. They knew about it. They just didn't get around to patching it. Patching it is hard. They have to find all the databases. You have to schedule downtime. You don't schedule downtime with the Autonomous Database. You patch the Autonomous Database while the database is still running. But you don't patch the database. It's the robots. Our robots patch the database. That's why it's autonomous. There's no human labor, so there's no human error. So if you're willing to pay less and not have that human labor, you get rid of all those mistakes.
This is a gigantic technology advantage. By the way, and we're 10x faster than anything Amazon has. That means we're much cheaper than anything Amazon has, much safer, much easier to use, builds applications faster. So we already have thousands of Autonomous Database customers running in our public cloud. We added 2,000 more this quarter. And our autonomous business, as Safra said, is growing in excess of 200%, our Autonomous Database business, off a small base. Admittedly, it's a relatively new product, but it's on its way to being the most successful new product introduction in our company's history.
Now this triple-digit growth rate I expect will spike up dramatically because of another thing Safra just mentioned, our introduction of our Autonomous Database Cloud at Customer, Gen2 Cloud at Customer. Now when people can start putting Autonomous Database, they're already -- I mean all our Autonomous Database customers, let me be clear, are in our public cloud. A lot of our customers, especially those in regulated markets, big banks, people -- government agencies, defense ministries, people have got -- they need the Autonomous Database capabilities behind their firewall in their data center. And over the next few months, we're rolling out this Autonomous Database Gen2 Cloud at Customer.
Now all of our cloud competitors are trying to create these outposts of their cloud on the floors of their customers. We actually have it working. And in fact, we're in our second generation of this. We did it early, albeit at a reasonable first generation job, but the second time's a charm. And this new Gen2 stuff was -- can be installed in a day. Now the first one we installed in 4 days. We expect to do that even faster. There will be more time spent unpacking the hardware and plugging it in than readying the software because it just syncs up with our public cloud, and you're off and running. This is going to be a huge opportunity for us to dramatically increase the adoption rate on Autonomous Database, very excited about that. Okay. When that happens, we think by any measure, we will be -- not only have the overwhelming market share lead on-prem but the overwhelming market share lead in the cloud. We expect to hold on to our database franchise in a big way.
So it's interesting that both of our Autonomous Database and our cloud applications are running in our new Gen2 highly secure infrastructure. And by the end of 2020, by the end of next calendar year, this time next year, I'll be able to say that we have more Gen2 data centers in more countries than Amazon Web Services has data centers, period. We're adding lots and lots of data centers in lots and lots of countries. And again, we'll have -- we'll be in more data centers in more countries than Amazon by the end -- a year from now. That's very, very exciting.
Now let's look at some of our Autonomous Database and Gen2 infrastructure wins this quarter. Okay. Afia International, big manufacturing firm; Albertsons. This is another -- this is more synergy that -- I've got to mention, when people buy our applications, they buy our ERP applications. They also build data warehouses associated with those applications. They do a lot of work. So a lot of our application customers are beginning to be Autonomous Database customers and infrastructure customers. So yes, when you buy ERP, you might also buy HCM. But when you buy ERP, you're also going to buy the Fusion data warehouse, which is an Autonomous Database product and an infrastructure product. You're going to buy analytics and our Gen2 data center. You're going to become an infrastructure customer as well as an application customer. And we see a lot of overlap. We often see people buying suites of applications, ERP plus HCM plus sales, things like that, but also applications plus infrastructure.
Aon Financial Services; Biogen bought autonomous data warehouse; Cisco Systems; again, Gen2 infrastructure and autonomous data warehouse; Clearstream Services, same thing, Gen2 infrastructure, autonomous data warehouse; Embraer Aviation, the Brazilian airplane -- aircraft manufacturer, autonomous database and Gen2 infrastructure; Equity Bank of Kenya, autonomous database, Gen2 infrastructure; Fastenal Company, a big distribution company in the United States, Gen2 infrastructure; Health Care Services Corp, Gen2 infrastructure and autonomous database; Interac, Gen2 infrastructure; King Faisal Specialist Hospital & Research Centre, Autonomous Database, autonomous transaction processing; Macquarie University, Autonomous Database, Gen2 infrastructure; Manchester, Autonomous Database and Gen2 infrastructure.

How is our search going for the new -- for a second CEO? We don't have one. We have no plans for having a second CEO. It was an unusual situation where Mark and Safra were an absolutely fantastic team, but we have complete confidence in our existing management team. We're doing a lot of recruiting. You'll see a lot of announcements at the next layer down, that we're hiring a bunch of people at the next layer down who are potential CEOs when both Safra and I retire, which is not anytime soon. And so we're going to strengthen the management team, but one of the strategies for strengthening that team is not to hire a second CEO."

Larry, the momentum in Autonomous Database is fantastic, growing over 100% in your public cloud. But having been in market now for over a year, I know investors are wondering when we might see an inflection in your financial results from Autonomous. And I appreciate many customers are including some of the required database option in their deals. But now that you're making it available on Gen2 Cloud at Customer, how should we think about the appetite from your installed base? How material can it be to your financials? And is there anything you might compare it to in Oracle's history?"
22247,646644192,1883172,"Oracle Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Dec 12, 2019",2019-12-12,"Earnings Calls","Oracle Corporation","Executives","Well, no. I mean either -- in terms of the technological breakthrough, well, yes, I guess, we're the first commercial relational database.

I mean either -- in terms of the technological breakthrough, well, yes, I guess, we're the first commercial relational database. The very beginning, that's kind of what created Oracle Corporation, right? So we had the very first commercial relational database. We had one before IBM did or anyone else did. So that traded -- that turned this company from an idea into the company that manages most of the world's information. So I would say Autonomous Database is that same kind of thing. It is so much different, so much safer to use, so much more reliable than anything else that's in the market. I think everyone is going to use it. Virtually everyone is going to use it. Now that said, it is -- it takes a while when you introduce an all-new product. The good news is we have a huge installed base. It takes a while for that -- for us to ship, if you will, a next-gen technology and get people comfortable with it and using it. And that first year, we've seen a lot of early adopters, but the early adopters are now in the thousands. And we think, eventually, the only database we'll offer is Autonomous Database. It will replace everything else.
And by the way, an Autonomous Database is only available in 2 forms. If we put a cloud -- if we put our cloud in your data center, that's our Exadata machine and our middleware machines, and all of that's in our storage in your data center and in our public cloud. So we think it'll be consumed in one of those 2 ways and that will replace our entire base. So it means that our existing database business, from a financial standpoint, will more than double or triple -- or triple probably is a reasonable estimate to look at. Now of course, when you're in your business, it's all about timing. And I wish I could tell you exactly how much we'll sell over the next 18 months. That's kind of tricky. Now we don't have that many data points. We have 4 quarters of data points. And the first couple of quarters, it was so new. So we really only have a couple of quarters of data points. All I can say is none of us have ever seen an adoption rate like this before."

I don't know if it will stay that way, but that was a very significant headwind for us in that whole business. It has completely stabilized. It grew ever so slightly. Additionally, the adoption in our ERP cloud is now such that it's in the thousands. We have many, many references. And what happens in our business is that once you are sort of obviously referenceable, it becomes much, much easier for other potential customers to move ahead. One of the things that had been, to some extent, leading to a wait-and-see attitude by some historically business suite customers was the adoption of, first, availability and now adoption of supply chain. Our supply chain now has many, many customers. And so more of our customers are willing and interested in moving. Remember, every single quarter, 100-plus new features become available. And some of those have been must-have features for extremely happy customers in the business suite.
Simultaneously, as Larry mentioned, SAP customers realized that SAP's offerings are not cloud offerings. If you use SAP's technology, you don't get 100 new features every quarter. Theirs is simply a hosted offering, which means that we are the obvious choice for customers who want to go through and really adopt a digital approach in their business. And so for us, this is going to be success leads more success. It's an incredibly virtuous cycle. And as Larry mentioned, what it also means is that additional modules are going with, and that's clearly showing up in our other segments. And of course, HCM, which is obviously a match and then ultimately, the front office, where we've got a lot of new technology rolling out that is being adopted."

And we've got them live, and we have references. But right at the very apex of SAP's customer base, in their top 50 customers around the world, they're all looking at this one particular implementation that -- where we expect to go live in March next year. And I would describe them as rooting for us. They want to have an alternative to a $1 billion SAP upgrade. SAP end-of-lifed their current stuff in 2025. So if you're a big SAP customer, you've got to make it -- in fact, some people have bought -- actually bought ahead -- actually bought S/4HANA in the cloud with no plan -- with no really good plan to implement. It's a 5-year implementation. They're getting price quotes of $1 billion for the upgrade. Imagine going from your existing SAP system, taking out Oracle and replacing HANA, and that's the only change. Basically, that's the only change. And it's hosted, it's not cloud. There is no cloud.
Anyway, I want to say -- well, it's easy for Oracle to say, go to SAP's website and try to find the SAP cloud for ERP. I mean you can find it for the stuff they bought. You can find it for Callidus, which is on one cloud. You can find it for Ariba, which is on another cloud. You -- I mean you can find it for little SurveyMonkey and all the stuff that they bought. But they forgot to write ERP -- that's their business, and they forgot to rewrite ERP. Their projects that they had to do, they're called business by design, failed. They canceled it. So there is no cloud option for SAP's customers. They can't go to Workday. Workday can't even handle mid-market ERP. So we're it. So believe me, they want an alternative to SAP. Makes sense, right, that they should want an alternative. But we've just got to demonstrate that we can safely take these enormous companies to the cloud in a way that they're not putting their business in any risk. And that's why this one particular giant implementation, they're watching closely.
But by the way, they're not just watching and waiting. A number of their biggest customers in the heart of Germany, lots of them are working with -- these are German customers, the core of SAP, are working with us and taking some of their -- moving some of their divisions already -- some of their divisions to Oracle Fusion to persuade themselves that we could do this safely. They've gone that far. They don't want to continue with this obsolete code. This is -- this opportunity is gigantic because we have 1 ERP customer on -- competitor on-premise. They don't have a cloud offering, that's SAP. And we've got 1 ERP cloud competitor that just is not doing very well, having a hard time getting their business off the ground, doesn't scale, there are a lot of problems. So we have a chance here to be -- to get what used to be in the old world called gate share for ERP and like Microsoft Office, to be the Microsoft Office of ERP, and it's sitting there. And we just have to get this last proof point out to SAP's largest customers, yes, we can do this, we can do it safely. And we will be overwhelmingly the largest application company in the cloud."

So we almost prefer selling a $30,000 deal to $100,000 deal because a $30,000 deal we can close in 4 weeks. So we think the way to sell Autonomous Database is to get it installed on a project in one of our customers, get it going, help them become successful. And then once they actually got their hands on Autonomous Database, and they have working out -- and they have working projects, working data warehouses, working transaction processing systems, you start land-and-expand.
So we are selling thousands and thousands of small deals. And some of those deals are already coming back as larger deals. But our approach again, is to -- and most of it is not BYOL because they're small. I mean some of it is, not -- some of it is BYOL, but the majority is not BYOL. It was interesting in the early days in ERP, when we had ERP, people said, well, you just move your e-business suite customers. No, they were new logos. But in the early days, in cloud ERP for us, they were new logos. Believe it or not, we're actually seeing new logos in database. But again, most of them are our customers. But they're not using their existing licenses, they're going ahead and using a standard cloud license, it's called -- what we call takeup. They pay us takeup, you pay for what you use. I mean it's the promise of the cloud.
And we're getting thousands of these because we think the best-selling technique for Autonomous Database is try it, get it running, watch. It backs itself up. It upgrades itself. It tunes itself. It configures itself. There's nothing like it. We just got to win those hearts and minds. And the way to do that is go wide across our entire customer base. That's what's going on. And again, it's working very, very well. I think it's working very, very well because we're seeing -- just beginning to see the first people coming back and going from $30,000 a month to $600,000 a month."

But before I start, I'd like to acknowledge and thank you all for the many, many sincere condolences we received upon Mark's passing. Thank you. They mean a lot to us.
As you can see, we had another solid quarter. This quarter, we finished with total revenue growth within my guidance range and EPS at the high end. Cloud Services and License Support continue to see material growth. And given that it represents more than 70% of our total revenue, it more than offsets declines in some smaller, nonstrategic businesses. We continue to be encouraged that our overall revenue growth will further accelerate as we reach the final stages of this ongoing shift in business mix.
Of late, I've been spending much more time with customers. The overriding theme I hear is the compelling nature of our technology and how it is critical to the success of their businesses: feature-rich, simple, secure, performant and priced right. They see Oracle as being strategic to their ongoing operations, and they tell me repeatedly that Oracle is the right partner to run their mission-critical assets, both in the cloud and on-premise. Their comments reinforce our conviction that our product strategy is right.
At Oracle, we've upgraded our internal systems to the cloud, and we are sharing our experience with customers by describing the stunning benefits and efficiencies that can be realized from the move. And know we have thousands of customers that references our own experience adopting Oracle Cloud applications and infrastructure allows us to serve as a unique and knowledgeable adviser to customers who want to know how to go about their own digital transformation.
To give you some context, let me share just a few of the many benefits we are seeing in our business. With Fusion ERP cloud, we are now able to close our books and report earnings in 12 days or less. Many companies don't report their results for weeks. And not only can we get our results out faster, but we've saved money, too. By using the AI and processes in Fusion ERP cloud, we have been able to eliminate more than 30% of our manual accounting activities. And enabled by Fusion HCM cloud, we have seen employee satisfaction levels soar with all-time high rates for things like hiring and onboarding new employees. We've also made it easier for our managers and employees as Fusion HCM reduces the time needed to complete the talent review process by more than 70%. And separately, we're saving more than 20,000 hours of manager time each year with our accelerated job offer process.
In sales, we're using our front-office cloud platform, augmented with machine learning and our own data cloud, to help our salespeople sell more and sell more quickly. With Marketing Cloud, campaign planning now takes days rather than weeks. And with built-in machine learning, we've seen a doubling in lead conversion. We automatically capture millions of activities in sales cloud each year. And with CPQ cloud, ordering is much faster and easier with over 70% of our transactions fully automated. We needed that to handle the increased volumes of transactions as a result of our customers' move to the cloud. In addition, we've adopted the Gen2 Infrastructure, including Autonomous Database, for our custom apps. Our internal IT costs to run these systems are down by millions while, at the same time, we are adopting more than 100 new features each quarter.
Here at Oracle, we are going to continue using our own cloud technology as an intelligent automation engine and continue to simplify our business model and processes. In turn, I expect that our revenue growth rates will increase and see even more expense efficiencies. And as a result, I expect that you will see us expand our margins and grow EPS double digits for the foreseeable future.
Now on to the numbers. I'll review our non-GAAP results using constant dollar growth rates, unless I state otherwise. Currency for Q2 was largely in line with my guidance at nearly 1%, and the fact that the growth rates looked the same in a few categories is simply because of rounding. Total Cloud Services and License Support revenues for the quarter were $6.8 billion, up 3%, accounting for over 70% of total company revenues and most of this is recurring revenue.
Cloud and On-Premise License revenues were $1.1 billion, down 7% as more of our GBU customers order cloud instead of license. In terms of ecosystem, GAAP application ecosystem revenues were $2.9 billion, up 4%, with Fusion apps up in the low 30s, including Fusion ERP, up 38%; and Fusion HCM, up 23%. NetSuite ERP was up 28%. Vertical SaaS was up low double digits, while data cloud stabilized. On a trailing 12-month basis, more than 90% of our application ecosystem revenue is recurring.
GAAP infrastructure ecosystem revenues were $5 billion, up 1%, with total database revenue up 1% highlighted by BYOL and Autonomous Database revenues, both up over 200% but off a small base for now. On a trailing 12-month basis, more than 3/4 of our infrastructure ecosystem revenue is recurring. Just a few days ago, we were able to get our first Gen2 Exadata Cloud at Customer fully deployed and connected. It was done in just 4 days. Previously, with our Gen1 architecture, this typically took significantly longer. As a result, we are very optimistic about the impact our Gen2 Cloud at Customer will have on our business. No other cloud provider has the right technology to actually do this.
In terms of geographies, we saw double-digit revenue growth in SaaS revenue in all regions, except EMEA, with especially strong results in Latin America and Japan. Gross margin for Cloud Services and License Support was 85%, down slightly from last quarter due to accelerated investments in our Gen2 cloud to address higher demand worldwide. As we get to scale, I expect our cloud gross margins will grow higher, driving an acceleration in our gross profit growth.
By the way, our strategic hardware products delivered on-premise, which includes Exadata, grew double digits for the quarter, once again showing that our installed base of customers focused on our world-leading database platform continues to grow. Total revenue for the quarter were $9.6 billion, up 1% from last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $4 billion, essentially unchanged from last year; and operating margin was 42%, down from 43% last year. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 18.8%, slightly below our base tax rate of 20%; and EPS was $0.90 in USD, up 13% in constant currency and 12% in USD. The GAAP tax rate was 17.7%. And GAAP EPS was $0.69 in USD, up 15% in constant currency, 14% in USD.
Operating cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $13.8 billion. Over the last 4 quarters, capital expenditures were $1.6 billion, and free cash flow was $12.2 billion. We now have approximately $27 billion in cash and marketable securities. And short-term net deferred revenue balance is $8.1 billion, down 1% in constant currency due to timing differences in customer payments. Also, the prior year deferred balance was affected by our transition to ASC 606. Gross deferred revenue was up over 1% in constant currency and would have been up over 3% if not for the ASC 606 transition changes.
We remain committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases and prudent use of debt and the dividend. This quarter, we repurchased 91 million shares for a total of $5 billion. Over the last 12 months, we've repurchased nearly 500 million shares for a total of $26 billion. And over the last 5 years, we've reduced the shares outstanding by more than 25%. The Board of Directors again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.24 per share.
My guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency. Assuming current exchange rates remain the same as they are now, currency should have a 1% negative effect on total revenue and $0.01 negative effect on EPS. So for Q3, total revenues are expected to grow 1% to 3% in constant currency. And assuming a 1% currency headwind, total revenues are expected to grow 1% to 3% in USD. Now I realize that my USD and constant currency revenue guidance sound like they're the same number, but it's just rounding, similar to our revenue growth this quarter. I do expect a currency impact of nearly 1%.
Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to grow between 10% to 12% and be between $0.96 and $0.98 in constant currency. And assuming a $0.01 headwind, non-GAAP EPS in USD is expected to grow between 9% and 11% and be between $0.95 and $0.97 in USD. Total CapEx for fiscal year '20 is expected to be around $2.2 billion, but it could move higher based on demand for data center growth.
My EPS guidance for Q2 and fiscal year '20 assumes a base tax rate of 20%. However, onetime tax events could cause actual tax rates for any given quarter to vary from our base tax rate. But I expect that in normalizing for those onetime tax benefits -- tax events, our tax rate will average around 20% in fiscal year 2020.
And finally, for fiscal year 2020, I continue to expect that in constant currency, total revenue will grow faster than last year, and that we will report double-digit EPS growth for the year.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry for his comments."

As I've said before, there are 2 key product areas that will determine Oracle's future in the cloud: Cloud ERP applications and the Autonomous Database.

As I've said before, there are 2 key product areas that will determine Oracle's future in the cloud: Cloud ERP applications and the Autonomous Database. Being the clear #1 in both of these 2 giant applications and infrastructure market segments will enable the success of our other application and infrastructure products in adjacent market segments.
This is already happening in applications. We have a huge lead in Cloud ERP with over 7,000 Fusion ERP customers and 20,000 NetSuite ERP customers. Our closest cloud ERP competitor is Workday, and they claim to have a few hundred ERP customers. Workday's lack of success in cloud ERP is creating opportunities for Oracle in cloud HCM. More and more, we are seeing HCM as being purchased as a part of an ERP cloud application suite. As a result, today, we have more HCM customers than Workday. And we're beginning to see that same integrated suite strategy beginning to drive our sales of CX, customer experience, applications in sales, in service and in marketing.
SAP never rewrote their ERP applications for the cloud. As a result, SAP's installed base is very vulnerable. We've already replaced and successfully migrated many midsized SAP customers from SAP to Fusion ERP. Importantly, a few months from now, in Q1 calendar year 2020, one of SAP's biggest customers will go live on Fusion ERP. Many of SAP's largest customers are already working with us to develop plans to migrate to Fusion ERP. SAP's customer base is up for grabs. They didn't reroute their applications for the cloud. That has created an enormous opportunity for Oracle.
We're already declared #1 in the cloud ERP market as measured in market share. And our Cloud ERP business is already growing at a rate of over 30%. By offering a safe and compelling alternative to SAP's old technology, we can increase our applications growth rate far beyond that 30%. We are very, very comfortable that we will be overwhelming winner in this generation cloud ERP business.
Now let's look at some application wins in the quarter. Advance Publications, a media company, bought ERP. Albertsons got ERP, EPM and supply chain. C.H. Robinson Worldwide, a transportation company, bought ERP and EPM. DHL Supply Chain, big German company, bought ERP, EPM and supply chain. Edwards Lifesciences, a medical equipment company, bought ERP. By the way, I'm not mentioning any associated HCM deals because I have a separate list for HCM. So a lot of these guys -- maybe next quarter, I'll put the HCM deals right next to the ERP deal so you could see -- because I'll be repeating a lot of these names when I get to my HCM list. That's the point I made earlier that people are now looking at HCM as just another module that we need in the back office. Very important.
Edwards Lifesciences bought ERP. Ferguson, a manufacturing firm, bought ERP and supply chain. Globo companies, big energy firm, bought ERP, EPM and supply chain. NCR Financial Services bought ERP, EPM and supply chain. NetScout, telecommunications company, bought supply chain. Mutual Life Assurance bought ERP and supply chain. Southern Star Central Gas Pipeline, big energy company, bought ERP. Technip, another energy company, bought ERP. By the way, SAP is supposed to be very strong in energy. Texas Children's Health Care -- Hospital bought ERP, EPM and supply chain. Unilever bought ERP and supply chain. Baker Hughes, energy company, bought ERP, EPM and supply chain. Carlson Wagonlit, travel services, ERP, CPM and supply chain. Kuwait Petroleum, energy company, bought ERP, EPM and supply chain. Liberty Global, communications company, ERP, EPM and supply chain. Manpower, the global services company, bought ERP, EPM and supply chain. Sherwin-Williams, that's what they bought: ERP, EPM and supply chain, the suite. A lot of people are buying multiple modules. It's not just ERP. It's ERP, it's EPM, Enterprise Performance Management. It's supply chain. It's manufacturing. Bank of New York Mellon bought ERP, EPM and supply chain.
Airport Terminal Services -- oh, I'm sorry, now I'm on my HCM group. I'm in the HCM group, they're all grouped together. Airport Terminal Services bought HCM. [ Apparel Bosco ], retail, HCM. Banque Saudi fransi bought HCM. CenterPoint Energy, another energy company, bought HCM. Cummins, manufacturing company, HCM; Graybar Electric bought HCM; Holologic (sic) [ Hologic ], HCM. HUS, that's the hospital -- those are the hospitals in Finland run by the federal government in Finland, bought HCM; Mountaire Farms, HCM. North Atlantic Refining -- again, this is my HCM list -- big energy company, and SAP's stronghold in the energy sector, bought HCM from us; Southern Star Central Pipeline, big gas company, energy, HCM; Technip, energy company, HCM. Tenet Healthcare bought HCM, Texas Children's Hospital bought HCM and Whatabrands bought HCM. Birmingham City Council bought HCM. Kuwait Petroleum Company, a big energy company, bought HCM. MEDNAX health care, HCM; Phoenix Life Holdings, HCM. 
In customer experience, Equinix bought service. Ferguson Enterprises bought service. Ferrari bought sales and marketing. IKEA bought service. Nordstrom bought service. PayPal bought marketing, Rabobank bought service and Santander Bank bought service.
Okay. Let me move on to the other segment, which is Autonomous Database and Gen2 infrastructure. In the database market, we are the overwhelming #1 with a combination of a dominant share on-premise and very strong market share in the cloud. Though I have yet to see any good data on database market share in the cloud. Our database business is growing very, very rapidly because we have an enormous technology advantage in the cloud over all of our competitors with Autonomous Database.
Autonomous Database is the world's only autonomous database. What does that mean? That means when you configure the system, you don't do anything. The system configures itself. Robots configure the system. The reason Capital One lost all that data at AWS is because one of the Capital One people made a configuration error. You can't make configuration errors with the autonomous database because human beings don't configure the system. A lot of these above-the-fold headlines of people losing their data are caused by human errors. People forget to patch systems. Remember that one? They patched some but not all of the systems. And Equifax. Equifax, it was a patchy [ structured ] database, didn't get patched. They didn't find them all.
Guess what? Autonomous Database automatically patches itself when a security flaw is detected. And by the way, they detected that security flaw over at Equifax. They knew about it. They just didn't get around to patching it. Patching it is hard. They have to find all the databases. You have to schedule downtime. You don't schedule downtime with the Autonomous Database. You patch the Autonomous Database while the database is still running. But you don't patch the database. It's the robots. Our robots patch the database. That's why it's autonomous. There's no human labor, so there's no human error. So if you're willing to pay less and not have that human labor, you get rid of all those mistakes.
This is a gigantic technology advantage. By the way, and we're 10x faster than anything Amazon has. That means we're much cheaper than anything Amazon has, much safer, much easier to use, builds applications faster. So we already have thousands of Autonomous Database customers running in our public cloud. We added 2,000 more this quarter. And our autonomous business, as Safra said, is growing in excess of 200%, our Autonomous Database business, off a small base. Admittedly, it's a relatively new product, but it's on its way to being the most successful new product introduction in our company's history.
Now this triple-digit growth rate I expect will spike up dramatically because of another thing Safra just mentioned, our introduction of our Autonomous Database Cloud at Customer, Gen2 Cloud at Customer. Now when people can start putting Autonomous Database, they're already -- I mean all our Autonomous Database customers, let me be clear, are in our public cloud. A lot of our customers, especially those in regulated markets, big banks, people -- government agencies, defense ministries, people have got -- they need the Autonomous Database capabilities behind their firewall in their data center. And over the next few months, we're rolling out this Autonomous Database Gen2 Cloud at Customer.
Now all of our cloud competitors are trying to create these outposts of their cloud on the floors of their customers. We actually have it working. And in fact, we're in our second generation of this. We did it early, albeit at a reasonable first generation job, but the second time's a charm. And this new Gen2 stuff was -- can be installed in a day. Now the first one we installed in 4 days. We expect to do that even faster. There will be more time spent unpacking the hardware and plugging it in than readying the software because it just syncs up with our public cloud, and you're off and running. This is going to be a huge opportunity for us to dramatically increase the adoption rate on Autonomous Database, very excited about that. Okay. When that happens, we think by any measure, we will be -- not only have the overwhelming market share lead on-prem but the overwhelming market share lead in the cloud. We expect to hold on to our database franchise in a big way.
So it's interesting that both of our Autonomous Database and our cloud applications are running in our new Gen2 highly secure infrastructure. And by the end of 2020, by the end of next calendar year, this time next year, I'll be able to say that we have more Gen2 data centers in more countries than Amazon Web Services has data centers, period. We're adding lots and lots of data centers in lots and lots of countries. And again, we'll have -- we'll be in more data centers in more countries than Amazon by the end -- a year from now. That's very, very exciting.
Now let's look at some of our Autonomous Database and Gen2 infrastructure wins this quarter. Okay. Afia International, big manufacturing firm; Albertsons. This is another -- this is more synergy that -- I've got to mention, when people buy our applications, they buy our ERP applications. They also build data warehouses associated with those applications. They do a lot of work. So a lot of our application customers are beginning to be Autonomous Database customers and infrastructure customers. So yes, when you buy ERP, you might also buy HCM. But when you buy ERP, you're also going to buy the Fusion data warehouse, which is an Autonomous Database product and an infrastructure product. You're going to buy analytics and our Gen2 data center. You're going to become an infrastructure customer as well as an application customer. And we see a lot of overlap. We often see people buying suites of applications, ERP plus HCM plus sales, things like that, but also applications plus infrastructure.
Aon Financial Services; Biogen bought autonomous data warehouse; Cisco Systems; again, Gen2 infrastructure and autonomous data warehouse; Clearstream Services, same thing, Gen2 infrastructure, autonomous data warehouse; Embraer Aviation, the Brazilian airplane -- aircraft manufacturer, autonomous database and Gen2 infrastructure; Equity Bank of Kenya, autonomous database, Gen2 infrastructure; Fastenal Company, a big distribution company in the United States, Gen2 infrastructure; Health Care Services Corp, Gen2 infrastructure and autonomous database; Interac, Gen2 infrastructure; King Faisal Specialist Hospital & Research Centre, Autonomous Database, autonomous transaction processing; Macquarie University, Autonomous Database, Gen2 infrastructure; Manchester, Autonomous Database and Gen2 infrastructure.

With that, I will turn it over to the audience for questions."

I mean either -- in terms of the technological breakthrough, well, yes, I guess we're the first commercial relational database. The very beginning, that's kind of what created Oracle Corporation, right? So we had the very first commercial relational database. We had one before IBM did or anyone else did. So that traded -- that turned this company from an idea into the company that manages most of the world's information. So I would say Autonomous Database is that same kind of thing. It is so much different, so much safer to use, so much more reliable than anything else that's in the market. I think everyone is going to use it. Virtually everyone is going to use it. Now that said, it is -- it takes a while when you introduce an all-new product. The good news is we have a huge installed base. It takes a while for that -- for us to ship, if you will, a next-gen technology and get people comfortable with it and using it. And that first year, we've seen a lot of early adopters, but the early adopters are now in the thousands. And we think, eventually, the only database we'll offer is Autonomous Database. It will replace everything else.
And by the way, an Autonomous Database is only available in 2 forms. If we put a cloud -- if we put our cloud in your data center, that's our Exadata machine and our middleware machines, and all of that's in our storage in your data center and in our public cloud. So we think it'll be consumed in one of those 2 ways and that will replace our entire base. So it means that our existing database business, from a financial standpoint, will more than double or triple -- or triple probably is a reasonable estimate to look at. Now of course, when you're in your business, it's all about timing. And I wish I could tell you exactly how much we'll sell over the next 18 months. That's kind of tricky. Now we don't have that many data points. We have 4 quarters of data points. And the first couple of quarters, it was so new. So we really only have a couple of quarters of data points. All I can say is none of us have ever seen an adoption rate like this before."

I don't know if it will stay that way, but that was a very significant headwind for us in that whole business. It has completely stabilized. It grew ever so slightly. Additionally, the adoption in our ERP cloud is now such that it's in the thousands. We have many, many references. And what happens in our business is that once you are sort of obviously referenceable, it becomes much, much easier for other potential customers to move ahead. One of the things that had been, to some extent, leading to a wait-and-see attitude by some historically business suite customers was the adoption of, first, availability and now adoption of supply chain. Our supply chain now has many, many customers. And so more of our customers are willing and interested in moving. Remember, every single quarter, 100-plus new features become available. And some of those have been must-have features for extremely happy customers in the business suite.
Simultaneously, as Larry mentioned, SAP customers realized that SAP's offerings are not cloud offerings. If you use SAP's technology, you don't get 100 new features every quarter. Theirs is simply a hosted offering, which means that we are the obvious choice for customers who want to go through and really adopt a digital approach in their business. And so for us, this is going to be success leads more success. It's an incredibly virtuous cycle. And as Larry mentioned, what it also means is that additional modules are going with, and that's clearly showing up in our other segments. And of course, HCM, which is obviously a match and then ultimately, the front office, where we've got a lot of new technology rolling out that is being adopted."

And we've got them live, and we have references. But right at the very apex of SAP's customer base, in their top 50 customers around the world, they're all looking at this one particular implementation that -- where we expect to go live in March next year. And I would describe them as rooting for us. They want to have an alternative to a $1 billion SAP upgrade. SAP end-of-lifed their current stuff in 2025. So if you're a big SAP customer, you've got to make it -- in fact, some people have bought -- actually bought ahead -- actually bought S/4HANA in the cloud with no plan -- with no really good plan to implement. It's a 5-year implementation. They're getting price quotes of $1 billion for the upgrade. Imagine going from your existing SAP system, taking out Oracle and replacing HANA, and that's the only change. Basically, that's the only change. And it's hosted, it's not cloud. There is no cloud.
Anyway, I want to say -- well, it's easy for Oracle to say, go to SAP's website and try to find the SAP cloud for ERP. I mean you can find it for the stuff they bought. You can find it for Callidus, which is on one cloud. You can find it for Ariba, which is on another cloud. You -- I mean you can find it for little SurveyMonkey and all the stuff that they bought. But they forgot to write ERP -- that's their business, and they forgot to rewrite ERP. Their projects that they had to do, they're called business by design, failed. They canceled it. So there is no cloud option for SAP's customers. They can't go to Workday. Workday can't even handle mid-market ERP. So we're it. So believe me, they want an alternative to SAP. Makes sense, right, that they should want an alternative. But we've just got to demonstrate that we can safely take these enormous companies to the cloud in a way that they're not putting their business in any risk. And that's why this one particular giant implementation, they're watching closely.
But by the way, they're not just watching and waiting. A number of their biggest customers in the heart of Germany, lots of them are working with -- these are German customers, the core of SAP, are working with us and taking some of their -- moving some of their divisions already -- some of their divisions to Oracle Fusion to persuade themselves that we could do this safely. They've gone that far. They don't want to continue with this obsolete code. This is -- this opportunity is gigantic because we have 1 ERP customer on -- competitor on-premise. They don't have a cloud offering, that's SAP. And we've got 1 ERP cloud competitor that just is not doing very well, having a hard time getting their business off the ground, doesn't scale, there are a lot of problems. So we have a chance here to be -- to get what used to be in the old world called gate share for ERP and like Microsoft Office, to be the Microsoft Office of ERP, and it's sitting there. And we just have to get this last proof point out to SAP's largest customers, yes, we can do this, we can do it safely. And we will be overwhelmingly the largest application company in the cloud."

I think the most interesting thing that's going on is we've decided to take, if you will, an AWS approach to selling Autonomous Database in the cloud. So we almost prefer selling a $30,000 deal to $100,000 deal because a $30,000 deal we can close in 4 weeks. So we think the way to sell Autonomous Database is to get it installed on a project in one of our customers, get it going, help them become successful. And then once they actually got their hands on Autonomous Database, and they have working out -- and they have working projects, working data warehouses, working transaction processing systems, you start land-and-expand.
So we are selling thousands and thousands of small deals. And some of those deals are already coming back as larger deals. But our approach again, is to -- and most of it is not BYOL because they're small. I mean some of it is, not -- some of it is BYOL, but the majority is not BYOL. It was interesting in the early days in ERP, when we had ERP, people said, well, you just move your e-business suite customers. No, they were new logos. But in the early days, in cloud ERP for us, they were new logos. Believe it or not, we're actually seeing new logos in database. But again, most of them are our customers. But they're not using their existing licenses, they're going ahead and using a standard cloud license, it's called -- what we call takeup. They pay us takeup, you pay for what you use. I mean it's the promise of the cloud.
And we're getting thousands of these because we think the best-selling technique for Autonomous Database is try it, get it running, watch. It backs itself up. It upgrades itself. It tunes itself. It configures itself. There's nothing like it. We just got to win those hearts and minds. And the way to do that is go wide across our entire customer base. That's what's going on. And again, it's working very, very well. I think it's working very, very well because we're seeing -- just beginning to see the first people coming back and going from $30,000 a month to $600,000 a month."

But before I start, I'd like to acknowledge and thank you all for the many, many sincere condolences we received upon Mark's passing. Thank you. They mean a lot to us.
As you can see, we had another solid quarter. This quarter, we finished with total revenue growth within my guidance range and EPS at the high end. Cloud Services and License Support continue to see material growth. And given that it represents more than 70% of our total revenue, it more than offsets declines in some smaller, nonstrategic businesses. We continue to be encouraged that our overall revenue growth will further accelerate as we reach the final stages of this ongoing shift in business mix.
Of late, I've been spending much more time with customers. The overriding theme I hear is the compelling nature of our technology and how it is critical to the success of their businesses: feature-rich, simple, secure, performant and priced right. They see Oracle as being strategic to their ongoing operations, and they tell me repeatedly that Oracle is the right partner to run their mission-critical assets, both in the cloud and on-premise. Their comments reinforce our conviction that our product strategy is right.
At Oracle, we've upgraded our internal systems to the cloud, and we are sharing our experience with customers by describing the stunning benefits and efficiencies that can be realized from the move. And know we have thousands of customers that references our own experience adopting Oracle Cloud applications and infrastructure allows us to serve as a unique and knowledgeable adviser to customers who want to know how to go about their own digital transformation.
To give you some context, let me share just a few of the many benefits we are seeing in our business. With Fusion ERP cloud, we are now able to close our books and report earnings in 12 days or less. Many companies don't report their results for weeks. And not only can we get our results out faster, but we've saved money, too. By using the AI and processes in Fusion ERP cloud, we have been able to eliminate more than 30% of our manual accounting activities. And enabled by Fusion HCM cloud, we have seen employee satisfaction levels soar with all-time high rates for things like hiring and onboarding new employees. We've also made it easier for our managers and employees as Fusion HCM reduces the time needed to complete the talent review process by more than 70%. And separately, we're saving more than 20,000 hours of manager time each year with our accelerated job offer process.
In sales, we're using our front-office cloud platform, augmented with machine learning and our own data cloud, to help our salespeople sell more and sell more quickly. With Marketing Cloud, campaign planning now takes days rather than weeks. And with built-in machine learning, we've seen a doubling in lead conversion. We automatically capture millions of activities in sales cloud each year. And with CPQ cloud, ordering is much faster and easier with over 70% of our transactions fully automated. We needed that to handle the increased volumes of transactions as a result of our customers' move to the cloud. In addition, we've adopted the Gen2 Infrastructure, including Autonomous Database, for our custom apps. Our internal IT costs to run these systems are down by millions while, at the same time, we are adopting more than 100 new features each quarter.
Here at Oracle, we are going to continue using our own cloud technology as an intelligent automation engine and continue to simplify our business model and processes. In turn, I expect that our revenue growth rates will increase and see even more expense efficiencies. And as a result, I expect that you will see us expand our margins and grow EPS double digits for the foreseeable future.
Now on to the numbers. I'll review our non-GAAP results using constant dollar growth rates, unless I state otherwise. Currency for Q2 was largely in line with my guidance at nearly 1%, and the fact that the growth rates looked the same in a few categories is simply because of rounding. Total Cloud Services and License Support revenues for the quarter were $6.8 billion, up 3%, accounting for over 70% of total company revenues and most of this is recurring revenue.
Cloud and On-Premise License revenues were $1.1 billion, down 7% as more of our GBU customers order cloud instead of license. In terms of ecosystem, GAAP application ecosystem revenues were $2.9 billion, up 4%, with Fusion apps up in the low 30s, including Fusion ERP, up 38%; and Fusion HCM, up 23%. NetSuite ERP was up 28%. Vertical SaaS was up low double digits, while data cloud stabilized. On a trailing 12-month basis, more than 90% of our application ecosystem revenue is recurring.
GAAP infrastructure ecosystem revenues were $5 billion, up 1%, with total database revenue up 1% highlighted by BYOL and Autonomous Database revenues, both up over 200% but off a small base for now. On a trailing 12-month basis, more than 3/4 of our infrastructure ecosystem revenue is recurring. Just a few days ago, we were able to get our first Gen2 Exadata Cloud at Customer fully deployed and connected. It was done in just 4 days. Previously, with our Gen1 architecture, this typically took significantly longer. As a result, we are very optimistic about the impact our Gen2 Cloud at Customer will have on our business. No other cloud provider has the right technology to actually do this.
In terms of geographies, we saw double-digit revenue growth in SaaS revenue in all regions, except EMEA, with especially strong results in Latin America and Japan. Gross margin for Cloud Services and License Support was 85%, down slightly from last quarter due to accelerated investments in our Gen2 cloud to address higher demand worldwide. As we get to scale, I expect our cloud gross margins will grow higher, driving an acceleration in our gross profit growth.
By the way, our strategic hardware products delivered on-premise, which includes Exadata, grew double digits for the quarter, once again showing that our installed base of customers focused on our world-leading database platform continues to grow. Total revenue for the quarter were $9.6 billion, up 1% from last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $4 billion, essentially unchanged from last year; and operating margin was 42%, down from 43% last year. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 18.8%, slightly below our base tax rate of 20%; and EPS was $0.90 in USD, up 13% in constant currency and 12% in USD. The GAAP tax rate was 17.7%. And GAAP EPS was $0.69 in USD, up 15% in constant currency, 14% in USD.
Operating cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $13.8 billion. Over the last 4 quarters, capital expenditures were $1.6 billion, and free cash flow was $12.2 billion. We now have approximately $27 billion in cash and marketable securities. And short-term net deferred revenue balance is $8.1 billion, down 1% in constant currency due to timing differences in customer payments. Also, the prior year deferred balance was affected by our transition to ASC 606. Gross deferred revenue was up over 1% in constant currency and would have been up over 3% if not for the ASC 606 transition changes.
We remain committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases and prudent use of debt and the dividend. This quarter, we repurchased 91 million shares for a total of $5 billion. Over the last 12 months, we've repurchased nearly 500 million shares for a total of $26 billion. And over the last 5 years, we've reduced the shares outstanding by more than 25%. The Board of Directors again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.24 per share.
My guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency. Assuming current exchange rates remain the same as they are now, currency should have a 1% negative effect on total revenue and $0.01 negative effect on EPS. So for Q3, total revenues are expected to grow 1% to 3% in constant currency. And assuming a 1% currency headwind, total revenues are expected to grow 1% to 3% in USD. Now I realize that my USD and constant currency revenue guidance sound like they're the same number, but it's just rounding, similar to our revenue growth this quarter. I do expect a currency impact of nearly 1%.
Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to grow between 10% to 12% and be between $0.96 and $0.98 in constant currency. And assuming a $0.01 headwind, non-GAAP EPS in USD is expected to grow between 9% and 11% and be between $0.95 and $0.97 in USD. Total CapEx for fiscal year '20 is expected to be around $2.2 billion, but it could move higher based on demand for data center growth.
My EPS guidance for Q2 and fiscal year '20 assumes a base tax rate of 20%. However, onetime tax events could cause actual tax rates for any given quarter to vary from our base tax rate. But I expect that in normalizing for those onetime tax benefits -- tax events, our tax rate will average around 20% in fiscal year 2020.
And finally, for fiscal year 2020, I continue to expect that in constant currency, total revenue will grow faster than last year, and that we will report double-digit EPS growth for the year.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry for his comments."

As I've said before, there are 2 key product areas that will determine Oracle's future in the cloud: Cloud ERP applications and the Autonomous Database. Being the clear #1 in both of these 2 giant applications and infrastructure market segments will enable the success of our other application and infrastructure products in adjacent market segments.
This is already happening in applications. We have a huge lead in Cloud ERP with over 7,000 Fusion ERP customers and 20,000 NetSuite ERP customers. Our closest cloud ERP competitor is Workday, and they claim to have a few hundred ERP customers. Workday's lack of success in cloud ERP is creating opportunities for Oracle in cloud HCM. More and more, we are seeing HCM as being purchased as a part of an ERP cloud application suite. As a result, today, we have more HCM customers than Workday. And we're beginning to see that same integrated suite strategy beginning to drive our sales of CX, customer experience, applications in sales, in service and in marketing.
SAP never rewrote their ERP applications for the cloud. As a result, SAP's installed base is very vulnerable. We've already replaced and successfully migrated many midsized SAP customers from SAP to Fusion ERP. Importantly, a few months from now, in Q1 calendar year 2020, one of SAP's biggest customers will go live on Fusion ERP. Many of SAP's largest customers are already working with us to develop plans to migrate to Fusion ERP. SAP's customer base is up for grabs. They didn't rewrite their applications for the cloud. That has created an enormous opportunity for Oracle.
We're already declared #1 in the cloud ERP market as measured in market share. And our Cloud ERP business is already growing at a rate of over 30%. By offering a safe and compelling alternative to SAP's old technology, we can increase our applications growth rate far beyond that 30%. We are very, very comfortable that we will be overwhelming winner in this generation cloud ERP business.
Now let's look at some application wins in the quarter. Advance Publications, a media company, bought ERP. Albertsons got ERP, EPM and supply chain. C.H. Robinson Worldwide, a transportation company, bought ERP and EPM. DHL Supply Chain, big German company, bought ERP, EPM and supply chain. Edwards Lifesciences, a medical equipment company, bought ERP. By the way, I'm not mentioning any associated HCM deals because I have a separate list for HCM. So a lot of these guys -- maybe next quarter, I'll put the HCM deals right next to the ERP deal so you could see -- because I'll be repeating a lot of these names when I get to my HCM list. That's the point I made earlier that people are now looking at HCM as just another module that we need in the back office. Very important.
Edwards Lifesciences bought ERP. Ferguson, a manufacturing firm, bought ERP and supply chain. Globo companies, big energy firm, bought ERP, EPM and supply chain. NCR Financial Services bought ERP, EPM and supply chain. NetScout, telecommunications company, bought supply chain. Mutual Life Assurance bought ERP and supply chain. Southern Star Central Gas Pipeline, big energy company, bought ERP. Technip, another energy company, bought ERP. By the way, SAP is supposed to be very strong in energy. Texas Children's Health Care -- Hospital bought ERP, EPM and supply chain. Unilever bought ERP and supply chain. Baker Hughes, energy company, bought ERP, EPM and supply chain. Carlson Wagonlit, travel services, ERP, CPM and supply chain. Kuwait Petroleum, energy company, bought ERP, EPM and supply chain. Liberty Global, communications company, ERP, EPM and supply chain. Manpower, the global services company, bought ERP, EPM and supply chain. Sherwin-Williams, that's what they bought: ERP, EPM and supply chain, the suite. A lot of people are buying multiple modules. It's not just ERP. It's ERP, it's EPM, Enterprise Performance Management. It's supply chain. It's manufacturing. Bank of New York Mellon bought ERP, EPM and supply chain.
Airport Terminal Services -- oh, I'm sorry, now I'm on my HCM group. I'm in the HCM group, they're all grouped together. Airport Terminal Services bought HCM. [ Apparel Bosco ], retail, HCM. Banque Saudi fransi bought HCM. CenterPoint Energy, another energy company, bought HCM. Cummins, manufacturing company, HCM; Graybar Electric bought HCM; Holologic (sic) [ Hologic ], HCM. HUS, that's the hospital -- those are the hospitals in Finland run by the federal government in Finland, bought HCM; Mountaire Farms, HCM. North Atlantic Refining -- again, this is my HCM list -- big energy company, and SAP's stronghold in the energy sector, bought HCM from us; Southern Star Central Pipeline, big gas company, energy, HCM; Technip, energy company, HCM. Tenet Healthcare bought HCM, Texas Children's Hospital bought HCM and Whatabrands bought HCM. Birmingham City Council bought HCM. Kuwait Petroleum Company, a big energy company, bought HCM. MEDNAX health care, HCM; Phoenix Life Holdings, HCM. 
In customer experience, Equinix bought service. Ferguson Enterprises bought service. Ferrari bought sales and marketing. IKEA bought service. Nordstrom bought service. PayPal bought marketing, Rabobank bought service and Santander Bank bought service.
Okay. Let me move on to the other segment, which is Autonomous Database and Gen2 infrastructure. In the database market, we are the overwhelming #1 with a combination of a dominant share on-premise and very strong market share in the cloud. Though I have yet to see any good data on database market share in the cloud. Our database business is growing very, very rapidly because we have an enormous technology advantage in the cloud over all of our competitors with Autonomous Database.
Autonomous Database is the world's only autonomous database. What does that mean? That means when you configure the system, you don't do anything. The system configures itself. Robots configure the system. The reason Capital One lost all that data at AWS is because one of the Capital One people made a configuration error. You can't make configuration errors with the autonomous database because human beings don't configure the system. A lot of these above-the-fold headlines of people losing their data are caused by human errors. People forget to patch systems. Remember that one? They patched some but not all of the systems. And Equifax. Equifax, it was a patchy [ structured ] database, didn't get patched. They didn't find them all.
Guess what? Autonomous Database automatically patches itself when a security flaw is detected. And by the way, they detected that security flaw over at Equifax. They knew about it. They just didn't get around to patching it. Patching it is hard. They have to find all the databases. You have to schedule downtime. You don't schedule downtime with the Autonomous Database. You patch the Autonomous Database while the database is still running. But you don't patch the database. It's the robots. Our robots patch the database. That's why it's autonomous. There's no human labor, so there's no human error. So if you're willing to pay less and not have that human labor, you get rid of all those mistakes.
This is a gigantic technology advantage. By the way, and we're 10x faster than anything Amazon has. That means we're much cheaper than anything Amazon has, much safer, much easier to use, builds applications faster. So we already have thousands of Autonomous Database customers running in our public cloud. We added 2,000 more this quarter. And our autonomous business, as Safra said, is growing in excess of 200%, our Autonomous Database business, off a small base. Admittedly, it's a relatively new product, but it's on its way to being the most successful new product introduction in our company's history.
Now this triple-digit growth rate I expect will spike up dramatically because of another thing Safra just mentioned, our introduction of our Autonomous Database Cloud at Customer, Gen2 Cloud at Customer. Now when people can start putting Autonomous Database, they're already -- I mean all our Autonomous Database customers, let me be clear, are in our public cloud. A lot of our customers, especially those in regulated markets, big banks, people -- government agencies, defense ministries, people have got -- they need the Autonomous Database capabilities behind their firewall in their data center. And over the next few months, we're rolling out this Autonomous Database Gen2 Cloud at Customer.
Now all of our cloud competitors are trying to create these outposts of their cloud on the floors of their customers. We actually have it working. And in fact, we're in our second generation of this. We did it early, albeit at a reasonable first generation job, but the second time's a charm. And this new Gen2 stuff was -- can be installed in a day. Now the first one we installed in 4 days. We expect to do that even faster. There will be more time spent unpacking the hardware and plugging it in than readying the software because it just syncs up with our public cloud, and you're off and running. This is going to be a huge opportunity for us to dramatically increase the adoption rate on Autonomous Database, very excited about that. Okay. When that happens, we think by any measure, we will be -- not only have the overwhelming market share lead on-prem but the overwhelming market share lead in the cloud. We expect to hold on to our database franchise in a big way.
So it's interesting that both of our Autonomous Database and our cloud applications are running in our new Gen2 highly secure infrastructure. And by the end of 2020, by the end of next calendar year, this time next year, I'll be able to say that we have more Gen2 data centers in more countries than Amazon Web Services has data centers, period. We're adding lots and lots of data centers in lots and lots of countries. And again, we'll have -- we'll be in more data centers in more countries than Amazon by the end -- a year from now. That's very, very exciting.
Now let's look at some of our Autonomous Database and Gen2 infrastructure wins this quarter. Okay. Afia International, big manufacturing firm; Albertsons. This is another -- this is more synergy that -- I've got to mention, when people buy our applications, they buy our ERP applications. They also build data warehouses associated with those applications. They do a lot of work. So a lot of our application customers are beginning to be Autonomous Database customers and infrastructure customers. So yes, when you buy ERP, you might also buy HCM. But when you buy ERP, you're also going to buy the Fusion data warehouse, which is an Autonomous Database product and an infrastructure product. You're going to buy analytics and our Gen2 data center. You're going to become an infrastructure customer as well as an application customer. And we see a lot of overlap. We often see people buying suites of applications, ERP plus HCM plus sales, things like that, but also applications plus infrastructure.

But now that you're making it available on Gen2 Cloud at Customer, how should we think about the appetite from your installed base? How material can it be to your financials?

I mean either -- in terms of the technological breakthrough, well, yes, I guess we're the first commercial relational database. The very beginning, that's kind of what created Oracle Corporation, right? So we had the very first commercial relational database. We had one before IBM did or anyone else did. So that traded -- that turned this company from an idea into the company that manages most of the world's information. So I would say Autonomous Database is that same kind of thing. It is so much different, so much safer to use, so much more reliable than anything else that's in the market. I think everyone is going to use it. Virtually everyone is going to use it. Now that said, it is -- it takes a while when you introduce an all-new product. The good news is we have a huge installed base. It takes a while for that -- for us to ship, if you will, a next-gen technology and get people comfortable with it and using it. And that first year, we've seen a lot of early adopters, but the early adopters are now in the thousands. And we think, eventually, the only database we'll offer is Autonomous Database. It will replace everything else.
And by the way, an Autonomous Database is only available in 2 forms. If we put a cloud -- if we put our cloud in your data center, that's our Exadata machine and our middleware machines, and all of that's in our storage in your data center and in our public cloud. So we think it'll be consumed in one of those 2 ways and that will replace our entire base. So it means that our existing database business, from a financial standpoint, will more than double or triple -- or triple probably is a reasonable estimate to look at. Now of course, when you're in your business, it's all about timing. And I wish I could tell you exactly how much we'll sell over the next 18 months. That's kind of tricky. Now we don't have that many data points. We have 4 quarters of data points. And the first couple of quarters, it was so new. So we really only have a couple of quarters of data points. All I can say is none of us have ever seen an adoption rate like this before."

I don't know if it will stay that way, but that was a very significant headwind for us in that whole business. It has completely stabilized. It grew ever so slightly. Additionally, the adoption in our ERP cloud is now such that it's in the thousands. We have many, many references. And what happens in our business is that once you are sort of obviously referenceable, it becomes much, much easier for other potential customers to move ahead. One of the things that had been, to some extent, leading to a wait-and-see attitude by some historically business suite customers was the adoption of, first, availability and now adoption of supply chain. Our supply chain now has many, many customers. And so more of our customers are willing and interested in moving. Remember, every single quarter, 100-plus new features become available. And some of those have been must-have features for extremely happy customers in the business suite.
Simultaneously, as Larry mentioned, SAP customers realized that SAP's offerings are not cloud offerings. If you use SAP's technology, you don't get 100 new features every quarter. Theirs is simply a hosted offering, which means that we are the obvious choice for customers who want to go through and really adopt a digital approach in their business. And so for us, this is going to be success leads more success. It's an incredibly virtuous cycle. And as Larry mentioned, what it also means is that additional modules are going with, and that's clearly showing up in our other segments. And of course, HCM, which is obviously a match and then ultimately, the front office, where we've got a lot of new technology rolling out that is being adopted."

And we've got them live, and we have references. But right at the very apex of SAP's customer base, in their top 50 customers around the world, they're all",589,"Yes, I think a lot of SAP is -- again, in the mid-market, we are replacing a lot of SAP customers. And we've got them live, and we have references. But right at the very apex of SAP's customer base, in their top 50 customers around the world, they're all looking at this one particular implementation that -- where we expect to go live in March next year. And I would describe them as rooting for us. They want to have an alternative to a $1 billion SAP upgrade. SAP end-of-lifed their current stuff in 2025. So if you're a big SAP customer, you've got to make it -- in fact, some people have bought -- actually bought ahead -- actually bought S/4HANA in the cloud with no plan -- with no really good plan to implement. It's a 5-year implementation. They're getting price quotes of $1 billion for the upgrade. Imagine going from your existing SAP system, taking out Oracle and replacing HANA, and that's the only change. Basically, that's the only change. And it's hosted, it's not cloud. There is no cloud.
Anyway, I want to say -- well, it's easy for Oracle to say, go to SAP's website and try to find the SAP cloud for ERP. I mean you can find it for the stuff they bought. You can find it for Callidus, which is on one cloud. You can find it for Ariba, which is on another cloud. You -- I mean you can find it for little SurveyMonkey and all the stuff that they bought. But they forgot to write ERP -- that's their business, and they forgot to rewrite ERP. Their projects that they had to do, they're called business by design, failed. They canceled it. So there is no cloud option for SAP's customers. They can't go to Workday. Workday can't even handle mid-market ERP. So we're it. So believe me, they want an alternative to SAP. Makes sense, right, that they should want an alternative. But we've just got to demonstrate that we can safely take these enormous companies to the cloud in a way that they're not putting their business in any risk. And that's why this one particular giant implementation, they're watching closely.
But by the way, they're not just watching and waiting. A number of their biggest customers in the heart of Germany, lots of them are working with -- these are German customers, the core of SAP, are working with us and taking some of their -- moving some of their divisions already -- some of their divisions to Oracle Fusion to persuade themselves that we could do this safely. They've gone that far. They don't want to continue with this obsolete code. This is -- this opportunity is gigantic because we have 1 ERP customer on -- competitor on-premise. They don't have a cloud offering, that's SAP. And we've got 1 ERP cloud competitor that just is not doing very well, having a hard time getting their business off the ground, doesn't scale, there are a lot of problems. So we have a chance here to be -- to get what used to be in the old world called gate share for ERP and like Microsoft Office, to be the Microsoft Office of ERP, and it's sitting there. And we just have to get this last proof point out to SAP's largest customers, yes, we can do this, we can do it safely. And we will be overwhelmingly the largest application company in the cloud."

I think the most interesting thing that's going on is we've decided to take, if you will, an AWS approach to selling Autonomous Database in the cloud.

I think the most interesting thing that's going on is we've decided to take, if you will, an AWS approach to selling Autonomous Database in the cloud. So we almost prefer selling a $30,000 deal to $100,000 deal because a $30,000 deal we can close in 4 weeks. So we think the way to sell Autonomous Database is to get it installed on a project in one of our customers, get it going, help them become successful. And then once they actually got their hands on Autonomous Database, and they have working out -- and they have working projects, working data warehouses, working transaction processing systems, you start land-and-expand.
So we are selling thousands and thousands of small deals. And some of those deals are already coming back as larger deals. But our approach again, is to -- and most of it is not BYOL because they're small. I mean some of it is, not -- some of it is BYOL, but the majority is not BYOL. It was interesting in the early days in ERP, when we had ERP, people said, well, you just move your e-business suite customers. No, they were new logos. But in the early days, in cloud ERP for us, they were new logos. Believe it or not, we're actually seeing new logos in database. But again, most of them are our customers. But they're not using their existing licenses, they're going ahead and using a standard cloud license, it's called -- what we call takeup. They pay us takeup, you pay for what you use. I mean it's the promise of the cloud.
And we're getting thousands of these because we think the best-selling technique for Autonomous Database is try it, get it running, watch. It backs itself up. It upgrades itself. It tunes itself. It configures itself. There's nothing like it. We just got to win those hearts and minds. And the way to do that is go wide across our entire customer base. That's what's going on. And again, it's working very, very well. I think it's working very, very well because we're seeing -- just beginning to see the first people coming back and going from $30,000 a month to $600,000 a month."
