But before I do, I'll first want to put those results and in fact our results of 2017 in context. Ryan Lance managed this company for the business we're in capital-intensive and cyclical. We've embraced this business with the value proposition that we believe should be the new order for E&P companies. Now what do we mean by the new order. We remain positioned on returns, investment cycles up or down. The market is clearly behaviors in this business to change, and we have laid the E&P industry and approach and we believe will attract investors back to the sector. proposition more than 2 years old is fundamental to Over this period, we our sustaining price lower and made our balance sheet stronger. We've grown our resource base, while lowering it's overall cost of supply. We've achieved competitive pressure growth, not chasing after growth and we returned a distinctive payout of cash flows to shareholders, kept our cost and check and generated among the most competitive finance returns in the business. 
We're encouraged that our value proposition is clearly resonating with the margin. First, the value proposition is a mindset is a commitment to began in late '16, worked in 2017 and worked again in 2018. So with that, let me summarize our 2018 results on Slide 4. Starting with strategy column of the left, we held firm in our priorities during this year price touched $80 and also $50 a barrel, but our priorities didn't change. And this consistent approach of generated return on capital employ of 12.6%, that's nearly a 20% improvement over our ROCE with 109 propeller a few years ago. 
We increased our dividend, we accelerated our debt reductions, we achieved our $15 billion target 18 months ahead of plan and we repurchased 3 billion shares. We've executed just over $6 billion of buyback since our program began in late 2016 about 9 days remaining on our existing authorization. Including our dividend and buybacks, we returned about 35% of our CFO to our owners, all this was funded organically from free cash flow. 
We're $5.3 billion of adjusted earnings, $12.3 billion in cash from operations and $5.5 billion of free cash flow. We ended the year was $6.4 billion in cash and short-term investments on the balance sheet and cash means to ensure we can execute our consistent programs, while our buybacks and CapEx through the cycles. Our financial position is very strong, and we exited 2018 A rated by all 3 major credit rating agencies. And we achieved a settlement agreement in our ICC proceedings with to fully recover of $2 billion of which we recognized over $400 million in 2018. Operationally, I'm proud of the way our organization performed. We saved and executed our capital program and achieved underlying production growth of 18% on an adjusted share basis. with strong performance in our business and project start-ups across our regions. 
Finally, we made great progress on our continuing efforts to add to our lower supply resource base and optimize our asset portfolio. We completed a high value asset acquisitions and achieved significant expertise success in Alaska. We progressed our Montney appraisal program in Canada and began exploring on our new Louisiana Austin Chalk play. Our portfolio continued in 2018. We generated about $1.1 billion of disposition proceeds, and we grew preliminary year-end results to 5.3 billion barrels of oil equivalent. The total reserve replacement rate was 147%, and our organic reserve replacement rate was 109%. 
Our year-end resource base now contains roughly 16 billion barrels of oil equivalent with an average cost of supply less than $30 a barrel. This is the field for our continued success in our approach to the business. So in summary, 2018 was a another exceptional year for ConocoPhillips. But again, it is what matters now is what's next, and that's a great segue into 2019. 
So in December, we laid out an operating plan that we believe can and will sustain our success. Its resilience, lower prices, while operating investors virtually uncapped upside to higher prices. This is an intentional and sometimes overlooked aspect of how we positioned ConocoPhillips. We play both ends of the field incentive points. Our 2019 operating plan is summarized on the next slide. 
You will see in the upper right, we're sticking with the core elements of our value proposition, discipline focus on free cash flow generation, investing to grow cash flows and distinctive returns to shareholders. We've already announced the 2019 capital budget of $6.1 billion, plan production growth of 5% to 10% on an per debt adjusted share basis and paying buybacks of $3 billion for a third year in a row. This is consistent with our dollar cost approach to repurchases. 
Our 2019 capital plans grew activity an impactful operating milestones, several of which are shown on this page. I'll make a review of items starting with Alaska. In 2019, we advanced construction at GMT-2 and conducted on the seasonal exploration  in appraisal drilling. In December, even before our campaigned begin, we drove 2 exploration wells from existing patents. Our Montney, 14 well pad program is in full swing in Canada and in the Lower 48 we expect to grow production by about 19%. We're focusing on activities in the early part of the year on testing potential resource financing programs such as of our 5 completion technique, EOR pilots and During these activities, we expect volumes in the Big 3 to be relatively flat in the first half and ramp in the second half of the year. In the Louisiana Austin Chalk, we've already started our wall exploration program and expect to have results later this year. And we expect to advance discussions and decisions on a few major projects in Asia, including in China and the North Field expansion in Qatar and in Australia. The items on this page represent opportunities to add low-cost to supply resource, strengthen our portfolio and create optionality for the future. Importantly. As we see results on these opportunities, we will retain flexibility on how and when we invest in most of these projects. You should expect us to prioritize and phase these investments in a way that's aligned with our value proposition. 
As the year plays out, we'll update you on our results future of these fronts, and we anticipate providing a comprehensive multi-year update to the market in November. We're excited to get another year. We believe our 2019 operating plan reflects what you currently expect from us. It's consistent with our priorities, focused on growing long-term value and underpinned by our commitment to the strong execution. This is our formula for the superior returns to shareholders through the cycles and for many years. It's a formula we believe it works, and we're sticking to it. 
So with that, let me turn the call over to your questions."

So fourth quarter LNG pricing or realizations really reflect third quarter oil prices. So we saw really good revenues in APLNG and of course, they made good progress on reducing cost both from operating side and on refinancing opportunities on the project financing, while I'm here, I know you'd be curious about expectations for 2019, looking forward and I would say you got to pick up price point  because it's going to be a very much influenced by actual realizations during the year, of course, but around say $65 Brent, and I'd probably experienced distributions to be in the $500 million to $550 million range."

What we have been involved in some more strategic and smaller scale acquisitions like adding acreage opportunities in the Montney and the Austin Chalk, but we think we have a clear competitive advantage like the asset deals we did last year up in Alaska. So when we think about that we consider as a quality, diversity, resource debt and operating cost. So we think ,do we add an adding those categories are on the portfolio, but I'll point out the portfolio is in pretty good state, 15 billion barrels, low class of others is based that's well that's given us, it's a deep, it's material. So we're not feeling any pressure to do anything. It's just had to be evaluating and substitutive in the portfolio. That's kind of where we stand as a company. Now the sector consolidation should result in more disciplined capital allocation, lower growth and ultimately strengthening oil prices and help investors back into our sectors. When you consider, I think, that on a sector basis, you had to consider things like the value that you pointed out, synergies, the timing, the market reaction to it and what we find valuation perspective, if you're going to implement a disciplined capital allocation program like we have in place, you need to slow down the growth rate for any acquisition target that you look at, but that growth rate is built of the evaluation and then usually we are to pay a premium on top of that, that makes it extremely difficult. Synergies, tough to realize with some of the pure play equity companies that are out there, unless you have a adjacent acreage and infrastructure, it's just typically not many synergies, timing is tough, low point of the cycle, reluctant to sell and obviously tough as you share reduce something. And then you touched on is what was the market reaction been good. So people have been punished, because they seem to be overpaying. So we pay attention to. We wish we look at it, we watch it, we feel the opportunities going to be competitive in the portfolio. We understand what we like and what might fit, but it takes a real special deal to where we feel like it's a good shareholder capital."

And if you look at the other place about 50% booked in the Bakken, 20% in the Eagle Ford, less than 15% booked in the Permian and less than 1% booked in the Montney. So there is a long period ahead of us of continuing to add SEC reserves as we work through this resource base. So we tend to focus on frankly rather than the reserves is that resource base. And if you look at that from my -- this year, we ran from 15 billion barrels last year with the cost of supply less than 50, 16 billion barrels this year with the cost of supply less than 40.

That's a good fundamental question for the year industry as a whole is how do we industry think about what we have optimum plateau is and the optimum plateau will certainly not just the building infrastructure if you go there and optimal spent all of your money, but certainly, we think this very carefully we rig activity and the pace of infrastructure builds and the pace of technology change. So I think we have a good on how should be managing these assets to optimize the value from our plateau perspective and rig count perspective."

But before I do, I first want to put those results and in fact our results of 2017 in context. Won't have to manage this company for the business we're in, one that's mature, capital intensive and cyclical. We've embraced this view of the business with a value proposition that we believe should be the new order for E&P companies. Now what do we mean by the new order. We mean a value proposition that competes on returns and doesn't change cycles up or down. The market is clearly [indiscernible] that expects behaviors in this business to change, and we have led the E&P industry in a approach that can and we believe will attract investors back to the sector. Our value proposition now more than 2 years old is fundamentally structured to offer this. Over this period, we've driven our sustaining price lower and made our balance sheet stronger. We've simultaneously grown our resource base, while lowering its overall cost of supply. We have achieved competitive per share growth, not chasing absolute growth and we've returned a distinctive payout of cash flows to shareholders, kept our cost in check and generated among the most competitive finance returns in the business.
We're encouraged that our value proposition is clearly resonating with the market. For us, the value proposition is a mindset and a commitment that began in late '16, worked in 2017 and worked again in 2018. So with that, let me summarize our 2018 results on Slide 4. Starting with the strategy column on the left, we held firm on our priorities. During this year, Brent prices touched $80 but also $50 a barrel, but our priorities didn't change. And this consistent approach allowed us to generate a return on capital employed of 12.6%, that's nearly a 20% improvement over our ROCE when Brent was $109 per barrel a few years ago.
We increased our dividend, we accelerated our debt reduction to achieve our $15 billion target 18 months ahead of plan and we repurchased $3 billion of shares. We've executed just over $6 billion of buybacks since our program began in late 2016 with about $9 billion remaining on our existing authorization. Including our dividends and buybacks, we returned about 35% of our CFO to our owners, all this was funded organically from free cash flow.
We have $5.3 billion of adjusted earnings, $12.3 billion in cash from operations and $5.5 billion of free cash flow. We ended the year with $6.4 billion in cash and short-term investments on the balance sheet. The review cash is an accepted means to ensure that we can execute our consistent programs, both our buybacks and CapEx through the cycle. Our financial position is very strong, and we exited 2018 A rated by all 3 major credit rating agencies. And we achieved a settlement agreement in our ICC proceedings with PDVSA to fully recover an arbitration award of about $2 billion of which we recognized over $400 million in 2018. Operationally, I'm proud of the way our organization performed. We saved and executed our capital program and achieved underlying production growth of 18% on a per debt-adjusted share basis. We got help from a strong performance on our Lower 48 business and from project start-ups across our regions.
Finally, we made great progress on our continuing efforts to add to our low cost of supply resource base and optimize our asset portfolio. We completed high-value asset acquisition and achieved significant exploration success in Alaska. We progressed our Montney appraisal program in Canada and began exploring on our new Louisiana Austin Chalk play. Our portfolio high grading continued in 2018. We generated about $1.1 billion of disposition proceeds, and we grew preliminary year-end reserves to 5.3 billion barrels of oil equivalent. The total reserve replacement rate was 147%, and our organic reserve replacement rate was 109%.
Our year-end resource base now contains roughly 16 billion barrels of oil equivalent with an average cost of supply less than $30 a barrel. This is the fuel for our continued success in our approach to the business. So in summary, 2018 was another exceptional year for ConocoPhillips. But again, 2018 is behind us, what matters now is what's next, and that's a great segue into 2019.
So in December, we laid out an operating plan that we believe can and will sustain our success. It's a plan that's resilient to lower prices, while offering investors virtually uncapped upside to higher prices. This is an intentional and sometimes overlooked aspect of how we've positioned ConocoPhillips. We play both ends of the field, offense and defense. Our 2019 operating plan is summarized on the next slide.
You will see in the upper right that we're sticking with the core elements of our value proposition, discipline, focus on free cash flow generation, investing to grow cash flows and distinctive returns to shareholders. We've already announced the 2019 capital budget of $6.1 billion, planned production growth of 5% to 10% on per debt-adjusted share basis and planned buybacks of $3 billion for third year in a row. This is consistent with our dollar cost average approach to repurchases.
Our 2019 capital plans include activity and some potentially impactful operating milestones, several of which are shown on this page. I'll make a quick review of items starting with Alaska. In 2019, we'll advance construction at GMT2 and conduct another seasonal exploration and appraisal drilling. In December, even before our Ice Road campaign began, we drove 2 exploration wells from existing pad. Our Montney 14-well pad program is in full swing in Canada. In the Lower 48 Big 3, we expect to grow production by about 19%. We're focusing our activities in the early part of the year on testing potential resource enhancing programs such as multi-well pilots of our Vintage 5 completion technique, EOR pilot and refrac. During these activities, we expect volumes in the Big 3 to be relatively flat in the first half and ramp in the second half of the year. In the Louisiana Austin Chalk, we've already started our full well exploration program and expect to have results later this year. And we expect to advance discussions and decisions on a few major projects in Asia, including Bohai Phase 4 in China and the North Field expansion in Qatar and Barossa in Australia. The items on this page represent opportunities to add low cost of supply resource, strengthen our portfolio and create optionality for the future. Importantly, as we see results on these opportunities, we'll retain flexibility on how and when we invest in most of these projects. You should expect us to prioritize and phase these investments in a way that's aligned with our value proposition.
As the year plays out, we'll update you on our results across each of these fronts, and we anticipate providing a comprehensive multi-year update to the market in November. We're excited to get another year underway. We believe our 2019 operating plan reflects what you currently expect from us. It's consistent with our priorities, focused on growing long-term value and underpinned by our commitment to strong execution. This is our formula for delivering superior returns to shareholders through the cycle and for many years. It's a formula we believe works, and we're sticking to it.
So with that, let me turn the call over to your questions."

But if we run those rigs continuously, we'd ultimately reach a plateau and we'd be able to hold that plateau for well over a decade, maybe 2 decades. In the Bakken, we -- as Ryan said, we felt we were at plateau, but we had some improved results from drilling in completions there and we had more partner-operated activity. And so we're now at a higher rate than we anticipated and that can probably be sustained close to that rate for a decade or more.

I believe that I had probably guided that the second half would look similar to the first half and we ended up with a larger dividend distribution payment in the fourth quarter of $280 million and that's really a reflection of a number of things, but probably mostly the high realizations, the LNG pricings on a 3-month lag. So fourth quarter LNG pricing or realizations really reflect third quarter oil prices. So we saw really good revenues in APLNG and, of course, they made good progress on reducing cost both on the operating side and on refinancing opportunities on the project financing. While I'm here, I know you'd be curious about expectations for 2019 looking forward, and I would say that you got to bigger price point  because it's going to be a very much influenced by actual realizations during the year, of course, but at around, say, $65 Brent, and I'd probably expect distributions to be in the $500 million to $550 million range."

And so you can go back to a lot of the portfolio changes that we've done to lower our cost of supply and our sustaining price. I think all of these things are reducing the debt and our operating cost, I think, we are from like $10 billion to $6 billion, taking capital down from $17 billion, I believe, in 2014, down to the current level around $6 billion, so just efficiency on all fronts."

I appreciate, it gives us a chance sort of articulate our views a little bit about the M&A side. Really for us, it's about strategic portfolio choices, and we've been pretty deliberate in that space over the last couple of years. And since the spin of the company, it's mostly been on the disposition side with $30 billion, and I would also mind everybody half of that went to the shareholders and half went to reduce the debt on balance sheet. While we have been involved in some more strategic and smaller scale acquisitions like adding acreage opportunities in the Montney and the Austin Chalk, but we think we have a clear competitive advantage like the asset deals we did last year up in Alaska. So when we think about that, we consider as a quality, diversity, resource debt and operating cost. So we think about it, do we add in and add in those 4 categories around the portfolio, but our 2019 portfolio is in pretty good shape, 16 billion barrels of low cost of supply resource base that's front weighted, it's diverse, it's deep, it's material. So we're not feeling any pressure to do anything. It just happened to be value adding and substitutive in the portfolio. That's kind of where we stand as a company. Now broadly within the sector, consolidation should result in more disciplined capital allocation, slower growth and ultimately strengthening oil prices and help investors back into our sectors. When you consider, I think that on a sector basis, you have to consider things like the value that you pointed out, synergies, the timing, the market reaction to it and what we find it's tough on a valuation perspective, if you're going to implement a disciplined capital allocation program like we have in place, you need to slow down the growth rate for any acquisition target that you look at, but that growth rate is built into the evaluation and then you usually have to pay out a premium on top of it, that makes it extremely difficult. Synergies, tough to realize with some of the pure play from the private equity companies that are out there, they're just -- unless you have adjacent acreage and infrastructure, there's just typically not many synergies, timing is tough, the low point of the cycle, board rooms are reluctant to sell and obviously tough to issue shares to go to do something. And then you touched on as well what's the market reaction. It's not that good. So people have been punished because they seem to be overpaying. So we pay attention to it, we look at it, we watch it. We see all the opportunities, got to be competitive in the portfolio. We understand what we like and what might fit, but it takes a real special deal to where we feel like it's a good use of shareholder capital."

And if you look at the other plays, we're about 50% booked in the Bakken, 20% in the Eagle Ford, less than 15% booked in the Permian and less than 1% booked in the Montney. So there is a long period ahead of us of continuing to add SEC reserves as we work through this resource base. So they -- we tend to focus on frankly rather than the reserves is that resource base. And if you look at that from -- for this year, we went from 15 billion barrels last year with a cost of supply of less than $50 to 16 billion barrels this year with a cost of supply of less than $40. So because we've produced about 0.5 billion barrels, that's a resource replacement ratio of 300% and that's what we are -- that's what we really focus on, and I think both from a reserves and a resource perspective, we're in a really good shape.

We're in very regular contact with the officials at PDVSA and they continue to assure us that their intention is to continue to comply with the obligations under the settlement agreement. And I think that their actions over the past 7 or 8 months have indicated that ConocoPhillips is clearly high on their priority list of creditors. So we expect that they will continue to comply. Of course, we don't know -- nobody knows how things are going to change in Venezuela and what that may entail. Their next -- they are now on a quarterly payment schedule for the recovery of the ICC settlement and the next quarterly installment is due next month. And we expect to receive it and it appears that they are making plans to satisfy that obligation. The other part of it is on the U.S. side, related to U.S. government's recent actions, and we're operating under a license from OFAC, the Office of Foreign Assets Control, that we obtained before we entered into the settlement agreement. We have been in contact with OFAC officials as recently as earlier this week and they have assured us that our license is valid that we are strictly complying with that license and they've given us a very good guidance on how to go forward.

This year, we are running a 6 rigs and we'll continue to see growth from that and, as Ryan said, testing some new technology in the completion designs there what we call Vintage 5. And once we understand how those new completion design works, we might revisit what the right pace and what the right plateau rate and so on, but there's a few more years of growth for sure left in the Eagle Ford before we get to plateau. And then the Permian is a long way from plateau. We're running 2 rigs just now you remember last year, but we took a rig out of the Permian as the differentials blew out. I suspect some time over the next year or 2 we'll put the stopped rig back to work again there, but the -- and that will continue to grow for several years before it reaches plateau. That's a good fundamental question here for the industry as a whole is how do we -- how do the industry think about where the optimum plateau is and the optimum plateau is certainly not just [indiscernible] you're overbuilding infrastructure if you go there and the optimum plateau isn't several years because your time, value or money certainly, but we think of this very carefully as we consider the rig -- the pace of rig activity and the pace of infrastructure build and the pace of technology change.

But before I do, I'll first want to put those results and in fact our results of 2017 in context. We're on a path to manage this company for the business we're in, one that's mature, capital intensive and cyclical. We've embraced this view of the business with a value proposition that we believe should be the new order for E&P companies. Now what do we mean by the new order? We mean a value proposition that competes on returns and doesn't change cycles up or down. The market has clearly spoken that it expects behaviors in this business to change, and we have led the E&P industry in an approach that can and we believe will attract investors back to the sector. Our value proposition now more than 2 years old is fundamentally structured to offer this. Over this period, we've driven our sustaining price lower and made our balance sheet stronger. We've simultaneously grown our resource base, while lowering its overall cost of supply. We have achieved competitive per share growth, not chasing absolute growth and we've returned a distinctive payout of cash flows to shareholders, kept our cost in check and generated among the most competitive financial returns in the business.
We're encouraged that our value proposition is clearly resonating with the market. For us, the value proposition is a mind-set and a commitment that began in late '16, worked in 2017 and worked again in 2018. So with that, let me summarize our 2018 results on Slide 4. Starting with the strategy column on the left, we held firm on our priorities. During this year, Brent prices touched $80 but also $50 a barrel, but our priorities didn't change. And this consistent approach allowed us to generate a return on capital employed of 12.6%, that's nearly a 20% improvement over our ROCE when Brent was $109 per barrel just a few years ago.
We increased our dividend, we accelerated our debt reduction to achieve our $15 billion target 18 months ahead of plan and we repurchased $3 billion of shares. We've executed just over $6 billion of buybacks since our program began in late 2016 with about $9 billion remaining on our existing authorization. Including our dividends and buybacks, we returned about 35% of our CFO to our owners, all this was funded organically from free cash flow.
We have $5.3 billion of adjusted earnings, $12.3 billion in cash from operations and $5.5 billion of free cash flow. We ended the year with $6.4 billion in cash and short-term investments on the balance sheet. We view cash as an effective means to ensure that we can execute our consistent programs, both our buybacks and CapEx through the cycles. Our financial position is very strong, and we exited 2018 A rated by all 3 major credit rating agencies. And we achieved a settlement agreement in our ICC proceedings with PDVSA to fully recover an arbitration award of about $2 billion of which we recognized over $400 million in 2018. Operationally, I'm proud of the way our organization performed. We safely executed our capital program and achieved underlying production growth of 18% on a per debt-adjusted share basis. We got help from a strong performance on our Lower 48 business and from project start-ups across our regions.
Finally, we made great progress on our continuing efforts to add to our low cost of supply resource base and optimize our asset portfolio. We completed high-value asset acquisitions and achieved significant exploration success in Alaska. We progressed our Montney appraisal program in Canada and began exploring on our new Louisiana Austin Chalk play. Our portfolio high-grading continued in 2018. We generated about $1.1 billion of disposition proceeds, and we grew preliminary year-end reserves to 5.3 billion barrels of oil equivalent. The total reserve replacement rate was 147%, and our organic reserve replacement rate was 109%.
Our year-end resource base now contains roughly 16 billion barrels of oil equivalent with an average cost of supply of less than $30 a barrel. This is the fuel for our continued success in our approach to the business. So in summary, 2018 was another exceptional year for ConocoPhillips. But again, 2018 is behind us, what matters now is what's next, and that's a great segue into 2019.
So in December, we laid out an operating plan that we believe can and will sustain our success. It's a plan that's resilient to lower prices, while offering investors virtually uncapped upside to higher prices. This is an intentional and sometimes overlooked aspect of how we've positioned ConocoPhillips. We play both ends of the field, offense and defense. Our 2019 operating plan is summarized on the next slide.
You will see in the upper right that we're sticking with the core elements of our value proposition, discipline, a focus on free cash flow generation, investing to grow cash flows and distinctive returns to shareholders. We've already announced the 2019 capital budget of $6.1 billion, planned production growth of 5% to 10% on a per debt-adjusted share basis and planned buybacks of $3 billion for a third year in a row. This is consistent with our dollar cost average approach to repurchases.
Our 2019 capital plans include activity on some potentially impactful operating milestones, several of which are shown on this page. I'll make a quick tour of these items, starting with Alaska. In 2019, we'll advance construction at GMT2 and conduct another season of exploration and appraisal drilling. In December, even before our Ice Road campaign began, we drove 2 exploration wells from existing pads. Our Montney 14-well pad program is in full swing in Canada. In the Lower 48 Big 3, we expect to grow production by about 19%. We're focusing our activities in the early part of the year on testing potential resource enhancing programs such as multi-well pilots of our Vintage 5 completion technique, EOR pilots and refracs. Given these activities, we expect volumes in the Big 3 to be relatively flat in the first half and ramp in the second half of the year. In the Louisiana Austin Chalk, we've already started our full well exploration program and expect to have results later this year. And we expect to advance discussions and decisions on a few major projects in Asia, including Bohai Phase 4 in China and the North Field expansion in Qatar and Barossa in Australia. The items on this page represent opportunities to add low cost of supply resource, strengthen our portfolio and create optionality for the future. Importantly, as we see results on these opportunities, we'll retain flexibility on how and when we invest in most of these projects. You should expect us to prioritize and phase these investments in a way that's aligned with our value proposition.
As the year plays out, we'll update you on our results across each of these fronts, and we anticipate providing a comprehensive multiyear update to the market in November. We're excited to get another year underway. We believe our 2019 operating plan reflects what you've come to expect from us. It's consistent with our priorities, focused on growing long-term value and underpinned by our commitment to strong execution. This is our formula for delivering superior returns to shareholders through the cycles and for many years. It's a formula we believe works, and we're sticking to it.
So with that, let me turn the call over to your questions."

But if we ran those rigs continuously, we'd ultimately reach a plateau and we'd be able to hold that plateau for well over a decade, maybe 2 decades. In the Bakken, we -- as Ryan said, we felt we were at a plateau, but we've had some improved results from our drilling and completions there and we had more partner-operated activity. And so we're now at a higher rate than we anticipated and that can probably be sustained close to that rate for a decade or more. And then, of course, on the Permian, we're very early in the life cycle there. So that's several years of growth ahead of it before it reaches plateau."

I believe that I had probably guided that the second half would look similar to the first half and we ended up with a larger dividend distribution payment in the fourth quarter of $280 million. And that's really a reflection of a number of things, but probably mostly the high realizations, the LNG pricing is on a 3-month lag. So fourth quarter LNG pricing or realizations really reflect third quarter oil prices. So we saw really good revenues in APLNG and, of course, they made good progress on reducing cost both on the operating side and on refinancing opportunities on the project financing debt. While I'm here, I know that you'll be curious about expectations for 2019 looking forward. And I would say that you got to pick a price point because it's going to be a very much influenced by actual realizations during the year, of course, but at around, say, $65 Brent, and I'd probably expect distributions to be in the $500 million to $550 million range."

I think all of these things, reducing the debt and our operating costs, I think, were from like $10 billion to $6 billion, taking capital down from $17 billion, I believe, in 2014, down to the current level around $6 billion, so just efficiency on all fronts."

I appreciate, it gives us a chance sort of articulate our views a little bit about the M&A side. Really for us, it's about strategic portfolio choices, and we've been pretty deliberate in that space over the last couple of years. And since the spin of the company, it's mostly been on the disposition side with $30 billion. And I would also remind everybody half of that went to the shareholders and half went to reduce the debt on the balance sheet. But we have been involved in some more strategic and smaller scale acquisitions like adding acreage opportunities in the Montney and the Austin Chalk and where we think we have a clear competitive advantage, like the asset deals we did last year up in Alaska. So when we think about that, we consider asset quality, diversity, resource debt and operating cost. So we think about, do we add in and add in those 4 categories around the portfolio. But our portfolio is in pretty good shape, 16 billion barrels of low cost supply resource base that's Brent weighted. It's diverse, it's deep, it's material. So we're not feeling any pressure to do anything. It just has to be value-adding and substitutive in the portfolio. That's kind of where we stand as a company. Now broadly within the sector, consolidation should result in more disciplined capital allocation, slower growth and ultimately, strengthening oil prices and help investors back into our sectors. When you consider, I think that on a sector basis, you have to consider things like the value that you pointed out, synergies, the timing, the market reaction to it. And what we find it's tough on a valuation perspective, if you're going to implement a disciplined capital allocation program like we have in place, you need to slow down the growth rate for any acquisition target that you look at, but that growth rate is built into their evaluation and then you usually have to pay a premium on top of it. That makes it extremely difficult. Synergies, tough to realize with some of the pure plays and the private equity companies that are out there. They're just -- unless you have adjacent acreage and infrastructure, there's just typically not many synergies. Timing is tough, at the low point in the cycle. Board rooms are reluctant to sell and obviously tough to issue shares to -- going to go do something. And then you touched on as well what's the market reaction. It's not been good. So people have been punished because they seem to be overpaying. So we pay attention to it, we look at it, we watch it. We see all the opportunities, it's got to be competitive in the portfolio. We understand what we like and what might fit, but it takes a real special deal to where we feel like it's a good use of shareholder capital."

We added 474 through extensions and discoveries and another 52 through revisions and improved recovery. So that's where we get to the 109% organic reserve replacement ratio that Ryan mentioned. And then if you look at the acquisitions and dispositions, the net effect of that was 182 million barrels. We added close to 300 in Alaska through the acquisitions and that was offset by $38 million reduction in the Clair disposition and $68 million from Lower 48.

Because the Lower 48 obviously, the booking schedule there is -- based on SEC rules is limited to what you are anticipating in your 5-year drilling schedule. So when we look at the Eagle Ford, for example, we booked about 500 million barrels of the 2.5 billion barrels that's in our resource base. And if you look at the other plays, we're about 50% booked in the Bakken, 20% in the Eagle Ford, less than 15% booked in the Permian and less than 1% booked in the Montney. So there is a long period ahead of us of continuing to add SEC reserves as we work through this resource base. So they -- what we tend to focus on frankly, rather than the reserves is that resource base. And if you look at that from -- for this year, we went from 15 billion barrels last year with a cost of supply of less than $50 to 16 billion barrels this year with a cost of supply of less than $40. So because we've produced about 0.5 billion barrels, that's a resource replacement ratio of 300% and that's what we are -- that's what we really focus on. And I think both from a reserves and a resource perspective, we're in a really good shape. And specifically to your question, we're in a really good shape in the Lower 48 because of the way those reserves have been booked over time."

If you look at what's happening from last year to this year, for example, last year our operating cost was $5.8 billion, but if you put that in a pro forma basis, reflecting the acquisitions and dispositions, most notably the Kuparuk and Clair transactions, our OpEx would have been $6 billion on a pro forma basis. This year, we're moving to $6.1 billion. But when you look at the underlying production growth, our OpEx for barrel has gone up from 12.6 -- it is 12.6 rather, and that's $0.20 less than last year. So the absolute number is a bit higher than 2018, but the unit cost is lower and that's pretty impressive when you consider that the acquisition in Alaska are relatively high cost barrels. Of course, they're very high value barrels because it's all oil and the sales are Brent. And so the fact that we added those higher cost barrels and still see a reduction in operating cost per barrel, I mean, is a sign that we're settling up.

And also we ask ourselves what the future holds for us, what are commodity prices going to do and that gives us a level of comfort when we have that cash on the balance sheet to know that we can fund the opportunity sets that we have and we can stand the downturns if we see them."

We can sustain a level around where we are just now for a long time, but we don't -- we're usually running 2 or 3 rigs and we are comfortable with that in the Bakken. In Eagle Ford, we're still growing. This year, we are running 6 rigs and we'll continue to see growth from that and we are, as Ryan said, testing some new technology in the completion designs there, what we call Vintage 5. And once we understand how those new completion design works, we might revisit what the right pace and what the right plateau rate is and so on, but there's a few more years of growth for sure left in the Eagle Ford before we get to plateau. And then the Permian is a long way from plateau. We're running 2 rigs just now you remember last year, we took a rig out of the Permian as the differentials blew out. I suspect some time over the next year or 2 we'll put the third rig back to work again there, but the -- and that will continue to grow for several years before it reaches plateau. You're asking a good fundamental question here for the industry as a whole is how do we -- how do the industry think about where the optimum plateau is and the optimum plateau is certainly not just a year or 2. You're overbuilding infrastructure if you go there and the optimum plateau isn't 30 years because your time, value or money is hurting you, but we think of this very carefully as we consider the rig -- the pace of rig activity and the pace of infrastructure build and the pace of technology change. So I think we have a good handle on how we should be managing these assets to optimize the value from a plateau perspective and rig count perspective."

So we completed a single-well pilot last year, and we got really encouraging results there. So what we're doing now is we're going to do 3 multi-well pilots at different locations and at different spacings within Eagle Ford in 2019 and then 2 more we have planned for 2020. So, again, initial results from that late this year and then more results into 2020. We're also advancing a multi-well pilot Vintage 5 test in the Delaware too. That will be later this year, so results there won't come until 2020. So it's a very interesting technology angle to be pursuing here, and we're looking forward to seeing those results.

That's why it's going to take several months after these wells are brought online to really understand how the type curve is evolving and how interference with other wells is behaving. And so it will have a different characteristic of improvement than Vintage 1 through Vintage 4. So far across the rest of our plays, the Bakken, Permian and Montney, we're really implementing completion techniques similar to Vintage 4 just now. We're testing Vintage 5 in the Eagle Ford and as I said, we tested in the Permian also. And we'll then -- we're pretty good at transferring these learnings across the organization quickly.

So that's about 20% growth from '18, and that's going to come through over the first quarter or so and I think Ryan mentioned this in his prepared remarks, the first half is going to be relatively flat. We had really quite exceptional outperformance in 2018 as we went through the year. In particular towards the end of the year, we had -- you know how these programs work, you have -- you drilling multi-well pads so you get lumpiness within each of the individual plays. Towards the end of 2018, we had multi-well pads coming on essentially simultaneously across the Big 3. So we saw a big jump there. And so now we'll be moving towards more of a momentum and we'll be experimenting with these Vintage 5 completions, which take a little bit longer to pump. So that's why expect them to be flat through the first half of the year and then we'll jump up in the second half of the year as we increase the number of completions."

But before I do, I'll first want to put those results and in fact our results of 2017 in context. We're on a path to manage this company for the business we're in, one that's mature, capital intensive and cyclical. We've embraced this view of the business with a value proposition that we believe should be the new order for E&P companies. Now what do we mean by the new order? We mean a value proposition that competes on returns and doesn't change cycles up or down. The market has clearly spoken that it expects behaviors in this business to change, and we have led the E&P industry in an approach that can and we believe will attract investors back to the sector. Our value proposition now more than 2 years old is fundamentally structured to offer this. Over this period, we've driven our sustaining price lower and made our balance sheet stronger. We've simultaneously grown our resource base, while lowering its overall cost of supply. We have achieved competitive per share growth, not chasing absolute growth and we've returned a distinctive payout of cash flows to shareholders, kept our cost in check and generated among the most competitive financial returns in the business.
We're encouraged that our value proposition is clearly resonating with the market. For us, the value proposition is a mind-set and a commitment that began in late '16, worked in 2017 and worked again in 2018. So with that, let me summarize our 2018 results on Slide 4. Starting with the strategy column on the left, we held firm on our priorities. During this year, Brent prices touched $80 but also $50 a barrel, but our priorities didn't change. And this consistent approach allowed us to generate a return on capital employed of 12.6%, that's nearly a 20% improvement over our ROCE when Brent was $109 per barrel just a few years ago.
We increased our dividend, we accelerated our debt reduction to achieve our $15 billion target 18 months ahead of plan and we repurchased $3 billion of shares. We've executed just over $6 billion of buybacks since our program began in late 2016 with about $9 billion remaining on our existing authorization. Including our dividends and buybacks, we returned about 35% of our CFO to our owners, all this was funded organically from free cash flow.
We have $5.3 billion of adjusted earnings, $12.3 billion in cash from operations and $5.5 billion of free cash flow. We ended the year with $6.4 billion in cash and short-term investments on the balance sheet. We view cash as an effective means to ensure that we can execute our consistent programs, both our buybacks and CapEx through the cycles. Our financial position is very strong, and we exited 2018 A rated by all 3 major credit rating agencies. And we achieved a settlement agreement in our ICC proceedings with PDVSA to fully recover an arbitration award of about $2 billion of which we recognized over $400 million in 2018. Operationally, I'm proud of the way our organization performed. We safely executed our capital program and achieved underlying production growth of 18% on a per debt-adjusted share basis. We got help from a strong performance on our Lower 48 business and from project start-ups across our regions.
Finally, we made great progress on our continuing efforts to add to our low cost of supply resource base and optimize our asset portfolio. We completed high-value asset acquisitions and achieved significant exploration success in Alaska. We progressed our Montney appraisal program in Canada and began exploring on our new Louisiana Austin Chalk play. Our portfolio high grading continued in 2018. We generated about $1.1 billion of disposition proceeds, and we grew preliminary year-end reserves to 5.3 billion barrels of oil equivalent. The total reserve replacement rate was 147%, and our organic reserve replacement rate was 109%.
Our year-end resource base now contains roughly 16 billion barrels of oil equivalent with an average cost of supply of less than $30 a barrel. This is the fuel for our continued success in our approach to the business. So in summary, 2018 was another exceptional year for ConocoPhillips. But again, 2018 is behind us, what matters now is what's next, and that's a great segue into 2019.
So in December, we laid out an operating plan that we believe can and will sustain our success. It's a plan that's resilient to lower prices, while offering investors virtually uncapped upside to higher prices. This is an intentional and sometimes overlooked aspect of how we've positioned ConocoPhillips. We play both ends of the field, offense and defense. Our 2019 operating plan is summarized on the next slide.
You will see in the upper right that we're sticking with the core elements of our value proposition, discipline, a focus on free cash flow generation, investing to grow cash flows and distinctive returns to shareholders. We've already announced the 2019 capital budget of $6.1 billion, planned production growth of 5% to 10% on a per debt-adjusted share basis and planned buybacks of $3 billion for a third year in a row. This is consistent with our dollar cost average approach to repurchases.
Our 2019 capital plans include activity on some potentially impactful operating milestones, several of which are shown on this page. I'll make a quick tour of these items, starting with Alaska. In 2019, we'll advance construction at GMT2 and conduct another season of exploration and appraisal drilling. In December, even before our Ice Road campaign began, we drove 2 exploration wells from existing pads. Our Montney 14-well pad program is in full swing in Canada. In the Lower 48 Big 3, we expect to grow production by about 19%. We're focusing our activities in the early part of the year on testing potential resource enhancing programs such as multi-well pilots of our Vintage 5 completion technique, EOR pilots and refracs. Given these activities, we expect volumes in the Big 3 to be relatively flat in the first half and ramp in the second half of the year. In the Louisiana Austin Chalk, we've already started our full well exploration program and expect to have results later this year. And we expect to advance discussions and decisions on a few major projects in Asia, including Bohai Phase 4 in China and the North Field expansion in Qatar and Barossa in Australia. The items on this page represent opportunities to add low cost of supply resource, strengthen our portfolio and create optionality for the future. Importantly, as we see results on these opportunities, we'll retain flexibility on how and when we invest in most of these projects. You should expect us to prioritize and phase these investments in a way that's aligned with our value proposition.
As the year plays out, we'll update you on our results across each of these fronts, and we anticipate providing a comprehensive multiyear update to the market in November. We're excited to get another year underway. We believe our 2019 operating plan reflects what you've come to expect from us. It's consistent with our priorities, focused on growing long-term value and underpinned by our commitment to strong execution. This is our formula for delivering superior returns to shareholders through the cycles and for many years. It's a formula we believe works, and we're sticking to it.
So with that, let me turn the call over to your questions."

As we learn more about our new completion designs, for example, in the Eagle Ford, that may change how we view that. So it's premature to go there. In terms of the rigs for the Big 3 in the fourth quarter, I can give you the list. We -- I don't have them off the top of my head here just now, but we can get those to you."

So in 2018, we had a total of $480 million of distributions from APLNG, and you will recall we had 200 in the first half. I believe that I had probably guided that the second half would look similar to the first half and we ended up with a larger dividend distribution payment in the fourth quarter of $280 million. And that's really a reflection of a number of things, but probably mostly the high realizations, the LNG pricing is on a 3-month lag. So fourth quarter LNG pricing or realizations really reflect third quarter oil prices. So we saw really good revenues in APLNG and, of course, they made good progress on reducing cost both on the operating side and on refinancing opportunities on the project financing debt. While I'm here, I know that you'll be curious about expectations for 2019 looking forward. And I would say that you got to pick a price point because it's going to be a very much influenced by actual realizations during the year, of course, but at around, say, $65 Brent, and I'd probably expect distributions to be in the $500 million to $550 million range."

I appreciate, it gives us a chance sort of articulate our views a little bit about the M&A side. Really for us, it's about strategic portfolio choices, and we've been pretty deliberate in that space over the last couple of years. And since the spin of the company, it's mostly been on the disposition side with $30 billion. And I would also remind everybody half of that went to the shareholders and half went to reduce the debt on the balance sheet. But we have been involved in some more strategic and smaller scale acquisitions like adding acreage opportunities in the Montney and the Austin Chalk and where we think we have a clear competitive advantage, like the asset deals we did last year up in Alaska. So when we think about that, we consider asset quality, diversity, resource debt and operating cost. So we think about, do we add in and add in those 4 categories around the portfolio. But our portfolio is in pretty good shape, 16 billion barrels of low cost supply resource base that's Brent weighted. It's diverse, it's deep, it's material. So we're not feeling any pressure to do anything. It just has to be value-adding and substitutive in the portfolio. That's kind of where we stand as a company. Now broadly within the sector, consolidation should result in more disciplined capital allocation, slower growth and ultimately, strengthening oil prices and help investors back into our sectors. When you consider, I think that on a sector basis, you have to consider things like the value that you pointed out, synergies, the timing, the market reaction to it. And what we find it's tough on a valuation perspective, if you're going to implement a disciplined capital allocation program like we have in place, you need to slow down the growth rate for any acquisition target that you look at, but that growth rate is built into their evaluation and then you usually have to pay a premium on top of it. That makes it extremely difficult. Synergies, tough to realize with some of the pure plays and the private equity companies that are out there. They're just -- unless you have adjacent acreage and infrastructure, there's just typically not many synergies. Timing is tough, at the low point in the cycle. Board rooms are reluctant to sell and obviously tough to issue shares to -- going to go do something. And then you touched on as well what's the market reaction. It's not been good. So people have been punished because they seem to be overpaying. So we pay attention to it, we look at it, we watch it. We see all the opportunities, it's got to be competitive in the portfolio. We understand what we like and what might fit, but it takes a real special deal to where we feel like it's a good use of shareholder capital."

Then we'll take stock of what and when and how we might invest in those opportunities. But I'll tell you I think from our past activity and reputation, we've been intentional about retaining flexibility in many of the projects and we really have the discussion to phase the capital investments over time. I think we've also had a pretty successful track record of divesting assets that don't compete in the portfolio to high-grade it, and that provides another means of flexibility as well.

Because the Lower 48 obviously, the booking schedule there is -- based on SEC rules is limited to what you are anticipating in your 5-year drilling schedule. So when we look at the Eagle Ford, for example, we booked about 500 million barrels of the 2.5 billion barrels that's in our resource base. And if you look at the other plays, we're about 50% booked in the Bakken, 20% in the Eagle Ford, less than 15% booked in the Permian and less than 1% booked in the Montney. So there is a long period ahead of us of continuing to add SEC reserves as we work through this resource base. So they -- what we tend to focus on frankly, rather than the reserves is that resource base. And if you look at that from -- for this year, we went from 15 billion barrels last year with a cost of supply of less than $50 to 16 billion barrels this year with a cost of supply of less than $40. So because we've produced about 0.5 billion barrels, that's a resource replacement ratio of 300% and that's what we are -- that's what we really focus on.

If you look at our OpEx, we're still completely committed to the discipline in our OpEx. If you look at what's happening from last year to this year, for example, last year our operating cost was $5.8 billion, but if you put that in a pro forma basis, reflecting the acquisitions and dispositions, most notably the Kuparuk and Clair transactions, our OpEx would have been $6 billion on a pro forma basis. This year, we're moving to $6.1 billion. But when you look at the underlying production growth, our OpEx for barrel has gone up from 12.6 -- it is 12.6 rather, and that's $0.20 less than last year. So the absolute number is a bit higher than 2018, but the unit cost is lower and that's pretty impressive when you consider that the acquisition in Alaska are relatively high cost barrels. Of course, they're very high value barrels because it's all oil and the sales are Brent. And so the fact that we added those higher cost barrels and still see a reduction in operating cost per barrel, I mean, is a sign that we're settling up. We haven't lost the discipline on the cost front. And we can see that, that focus is going to remain in the company over the next several years, and we're going to continue to make sure that we're driving our unit cost down over time."

And then the Permian is a long way from plateau. We're running 2 rigs just now you remember last year, we took a rig out of the Permian as the differentials blew out. I suspect some time over the next year or 2 we'll put the third rig back to work again there, but the -- and that will continue to grow for several years before it reaches plateau. You're asking a good fundamental question here for the industry as a whole is how do we -- how do the industry think about where the optimum plateau is and the optimum plateau is certainly not just a year or 2. You're overbuilding infrastructure if you go there and the optimum plateau isn't 30 years because your time, value or money is hurting you, but we think of this very carefully as we consider the rig -- the pace of rig activity and the pace of infrastructure build and the pace of technology change.

Probably what we've said we're going to do in 2019 is we're going to produce 350,000 on average through 2019. So that's about 20% growth from '18, and that's going to come through over the first quarter or so and I think Ryan mentioned this in his prepared remarks, the first half is going to be relatively flat. We had really quite exceptional outperformance in 2018 as we went through the year. In particular towards the end of the year, we had -- you know how these programs work, you have -- you drilling multi-well pads so you get lumpiness within each of the individual plays. Towards the end of 2018, we had multi-well pads coming on essentially simultaneously across the Big 3. So we saw a big jump there. And so now we'll be moving towards more of a momentum and we'll be experimenting with these Vintage 5 completions, which take a little bit longer to pump. So that's why expect them to be flat through the first half of the year and then we'll jump up in the second half of the year as we increase the number of completions."

My opening comments will be brief. I'll summarize our 1Q results, then address some ConocoPhillips specific issues we're hearing from the market, which I'll take hear on. First, our 1 quarter results",1219,"Thanks, Ellen, and welcome, everyone, to today's call. My opening comments will be brief. I'll summarize our 1Q results, then address some ConocoPhillips specific issues we're hearing from the market, which I'll take hear on. First, our 1 quarter results shown on Slide 4. The punchline of the slide is essentially the same as the many quarterly slides before. We are successfully executing our plan. There's a lot of supplemental information in today's disclosures, so I won't cover every point on this slide, but I'll pick off some of the highlights across the page. 
Earnings and cash flow were strong. We generated significant free cash flow to organically funded shareholder distributions of 37% of our CFO in excess of our target. We met our exceeded operational targets, underlying production few year-on-year by 5% on an absolute basis and 13% on a per debt adjusted share basis. The business is running safely and efficiently. We received the exit ruling order in Venezuela to pay $8.7 billion for unlawful expropriation of our assets. We recently announced completion or agreements of noncore asset sales, all part of building the best portfolio for winning our cycle return strategy. 
We've summarized our first quarter results at the bottom of these columns. Expand cash flows, maintain discipline, improve returns. That's the mantra. 
Our cash flow reference point has improved at $65 WTI and current differentials, our cash flow reference point is now about $13 billion, perhaps more than $2 billion improvement over the past 2 years driven by our Brent waited pricing, our ongoing portfolio work and our focus on margin expansion. While prices have been stronger lately, our guidance items are unchanged. As we said last quarter, we expect capital to be front-end loaded this year. Production is expected to be back-end loaded as we turn off unconventional-s ramp and we come out of our usual 2Q and 3Q turnarounds. 
As for improving return on capital employed, our ROCE picked up our rolling 4 quarter basis. Underneath all the current noise and energy, we believe the way our industry will bring investors back to our sectors to perform quarter in and quarter out, no excuses. Put up the numbers, improve returns, grow cash flows and distribute a significant portion to shareholders. That's our job 1 period. 
Now to Slide 5. Our value proposition. Our priority short on the left haven't changed since we rolled them out in 2016, and we have no intention of changing them now. On the right side of the slide are just some topical issues, starting with our future capital trajectory. As you know, we're hosting an Analyst and Investor meeting in November. At a high level, here's what you can expect to see. First of all, we intend to show a decade-long plan that extends the successful new order plan we rolled out a few years ago. That plan worked and we're going to show you how it'll continue to work for many years. 
Second, our annual capital expenditures averaging under $7 billion. The plan can be achieved steady organic growth on an absolute and a per-share basis with the captured opportunities in the portfolio today. Like and we maintain this capital investment because we've numerous options of our discussion for exercising flexibility. For example, how we choose to face projects where we have control on timing. And whether or not we choose to reduce order shipping projects where we currently hold a high working interest. These are the details we expect to lay out in November. But our plan isn't about capital discipline for capital discipline sake. It's about generating free cash flow, deploying that free cash flow in a prudent shareholder-friendly manner and growing returns. 
In November, you'll see a plan that can generate free cash flow in less than $40 per barrel WTI throughout the planned period. And in a reference price of $50 per barrel, the plan continues to return at least 30% of our cash flow from operations to our shareholders. 
For almost 3 years, we've been on a mission to bring investors back to this sector, but not just for a quarter or 2. We want to bring investors back to the energy for many years to come. Our strategy gives investors a clear path to compelling value creation. It's not anchored to a production target and it does not debt on higher prices. 
So that claims up what you'll see from us in November. We'll maintain capital discipline, we'll sum the best combination of projects to maximize shareholder value and honor our priorities well into the next decade. 
Now in the meantime, 2019 continues to be volatile. An environment, which ConocoPhillips strives. That's what we're describing with the 2 lower boxes on this slide. We have significantly leverage and higher prices. Our production basis 75% for Brent weighted. Our operations are primarily in tax and royalty regimes and were unhedged. We don't chase higher prices with pro-cyclical investments and we'll build cash for inevitable price downturns. And in that part of the cycle, we offer distinctive resilience. We generate free cash flow less than $40 a barrel WTI. Our balance sheet gives us flexibility to maintain consistent programs and we have a 16 billion barrels resource base that averages less than $30 per barrel cost of supply. Just a few months ago, I'll remind you, WTI dipped into the low $40s per barrel and we didn't If you just look at our performance over the past few quarters, you can see our resilience in our torque in action. 
So in case people forgotten how well we work across prices, that's a reminder, we're actually built for price cycles. 
Finally, it's not on this slide, but I'm going to take another issue head-on and that's M&A. As you've heard from me many times, we think of an M&A in 3 buckets. First, incremental front transactions that add value such as additional working interest, royalty interest or up our acreage. We're going to do these things, under the radar day in day out. The second bucket consists of higher return bolt-on assets for acreage deals and they could be larger in size. They also make good sense. We're always on the lookout for these kinds of opportunities and we executed a few last year. But I' sure the bucket people seem focused on now is the third one, bigger, corporate transactions that require premiums. 
Of course, we pay attention to what's out there. However, we've always said the bar is very high for these large transactions and that's still the case. We're focused on returns and we want to transactions that are not in our shareholders best interest. 
So let me summarize my comments. The business is running well, execution is strong. No one needs to be worried about capital shock in November. You can expect to see a decade-long plan that honors the successful value proposition that we believe is ideally suited for our sector. Our strategy works across a range of prices and through cycles. The strong upside to higher prices the distinctive resilience to lower prices. We have the short-term covered and we have the long-term covered. And the bar is high for corporate transactions. 
Let's all understand today and we'll be quick and I'll turn it over to your questions."

And as you say, how prices go, that can move up just organically as we go through the year. Certainly we're expecting closing the U.K. transaction, so cash balances could start to approach pretty high levels. We kind of think of somewhere in the 10% of total assets. And you need to be pretty clear about your strategic rationale, and I think that we have been. We view the balance sheet in general and cash balances in particular as strategic assets in the source of competitive advantage. In our strategy, we've been clear about is to be competitive with the best capital in our industry and importantly, to be able to continue funding buybacks and maintaining our development programs, while prices are falling. So we're okay carry more cash than the average PMP company. I don't think that we'll be comfortable taking net debt down to 0, so if you want to put a limit, that's going to be above that. But we also think they'll be in position to be able to be opportunistic particularly, when prices are low and competition is weak is something that we also play strategic value on. But I think, if our cash continues to build as we approach the end of the year, of course, we've got our Analyst Day set for November and you'll see more definition around our capital allocation thoughts at that time."

I think, the design proposition is kind of easy to say, but it's difficult to do. And I think, why we're able to do it, and I think differentiate ourselves from our competitors, it starts with the portfolio and the low cost supply setting the portfolio, the base decline that the portfolio has, the type of assets we have, when you consider our long dated no decline low to sustaining capital kind of assets like LNG in all sense combined with what we believe is an unmatched, unconventional portfolio across all the basis in the Lower 48. So you put all that together, and we're running it to generate free cash flow. And we're -- we've gotten the cost structure of the company down to where we can free cash flow below $40 a barrel. And I don't think other companies can do that. May be you have to grow into that or they have to have much higher prices to go do that. So -- and we just don't believe these kinds of prices are going to persist. We think there's going to be volatility, which why we carry cash on the balance sheet and remind people in December it was $42 a barrel WTI at the low point. 
So we just think the way we've setup the company in the portfolio, the way we're managing the company, where we're allocating capital and the way we're focused on returns in the business, full cycle returns, not just forward-looking returns, but full cycle returns to our kind of cost of supply that's why it's going to be difficult for people to be able to do what we're doing. It's a kind of price takes that we've demonstrated that we can do that. 
To your second question, Doug, on strategic activities. We said -- we tried that on the larger corporate transactions, it's about cost and supply and it's not opportunities that can come in the portfolio at a competitive cost of supply, and that's a pretty bighearted with the kinds of premiums have been paid for assets today. And we don't really have a time frame that we look at, in short, meaning that long-term, we got to convince ourselves that it's in the best interest of the shareholders long-term, but it's accretive in the short term and it's competitive for capital on an all in full cycle basis relative to our $16 billion barrel portfolio that's captured in the handwrite today. So it remains really, really high hurdle. Anybody can lever up -- anybody can lever up their balance sheet and do a free cash flow yield positive kind of play today that's what you need to do. Full cycle returns are tough."

It's what metric should we think about, is that the debt adjusted cash flow? Is just per unit cash margin that you're able to grow?

We said in our last call, really after outperforming in 2018 with 37% growth. The trajectory of the victory would be relatively flat for the first half of this year and then growth ramping in the second half. So we're still on that track. First quarter production was actually very much in line with our expectations. And as we've explained previously, the primary driver for that lumpiness in the growth profile is the timing of multi-low pads coming online, and how do those sync up across the different assets. And actually, Q1 is a good example of that. So over half of our new wells were brought online towards the end of the quarter during March. And in fact, we had record rates in the last week of March, the Eagle Ford and Delaware. So we're coming to Q2 putting strong. We did have some minor production, in fact, in Q1 from the extended winter weather in Bakken and had some gas injection phases that are enhanced all recovery pilots at Eagle Ford. But the important point is Q1 was very much in line with our expectations and we do remain confident by execution of our plan and delivering our Big 3 production guidance at [ 350 ] and full year growth of 19%. 
On your second question, we're always looking it where the next best door would be. Our teams fight pretty hard over that. But the fact is, we've got good opportunities at the Bakken, Eagle Ford and Delaware. And we'll talk more about our long-term view about that in November."

Maybe first with the a bit of an explanation for why the 1/18 effective date can appear a little bit unusual. But just to remind you, we began marketing assets during 2018, and so, at the beginning of the year it was selected as the evaluation point. And then as the marketing extended into 2019, it was the various parties, counterparties that we were dealing with, it was their preference that we maintain the 1/18 effective date mainly for financing reasons because vendors typically require all these financial statements in the periods, immediately preceding the effective date and those would not have been available. And we moved the due to 1/19 until mid year and we didn't would want to hold up the transaction for that reason. 
So as you would guess, the U.K. has been net cash flow positive since that 1/18 date. And so there will be downward price adjustment at closing. Now I can give an estimate and it is kind of based on end of the year closing and kind of current prices. So if the timing changes or pricing, cash flows from this point forward changed and obviously, those estimates would change. But we think that adjustment will be a negative around $600 million. So taking that of the headline price, we would be expect cash proceeds at closing at the end of the year under current conditions. I've got enough disclaimers in there, would be something around $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion."

So when you think about the nature of that project and the development -- rapid development of the spot market, which is quite liquid today compared to where it was even a few years ago, we don't feel compelled to have to replace all of the LNG under long-term contracts. That's an option that we can choose to do and we're marketing the LNG today on that basis, we'd be happy to do it. But if we don't get the price that we expect, then we're willing to go into the project with -- without all or a majority of the LNG committed in the long-term.

With Conoco being growing there a little bit more in the back half of the year and presumably over the next few years, could you give us some color on what's your infrastructure situation is like, and what kind of contracts you have with your oil and gas in places obviously, it's pretty tight, especially in gas right now. And just curious if you signed up for some long-term takeaway agreements also of the basin for the oil?"

On the oil, currently we're selling all of our oil conventional, unconventional right into the local markets there, so we don't really have any significant takeaway capacity. We have participated in some of the open seasons that have took place last year projects under construction, this year or so. So as time goes on, probably beginning in the third of fourth quarter this year, we'll begin exporting Permian crude oil to the Gulf. And we have options to expand our capacity rights on these pipelines. So I think our situation will improve overtime, that's what we would expect.
On the gas side, it's a little bit different because I've talked about this a little bit before, but we currently produce about 100 million cubic feet a day in the Permian and we have a lot more takeaway capacity than that out of the Permian by virtue of our gas marketing arrangements. We're one of the larger gas marketers in the southwest area from Texas to California and to New Mexico. And so we have a lot of firm takeaway, long-term form takeaway capacity that allows us to move not only our equity gas but third-party gas outside of the basin. So we're not seeing the same levels of pressure. We're generally, I'd say in the first quarter, most of our gas was sold into Arizona and California markets. So we didn't see a type pricing. On the other hand, other side of that on the gas marketing side, we did benefit a good bit from pricing as in the market some days with producers paying us as much as $6 or $7 Mcf."

First, our 1 quarter results",1225,"Thanks, Ellen, and welcome, everyone, to today's call. My opening comments will be brief. I'll summarize our 1Q results, then address some ConocoPhillips' specific issues we're hearing from the market, which I'll take head-on. First, our 1 quarter results shown on Slide 4. The punchline of this slide is essentially the same as the many quarterly slides before. We're successfully executing our plan. There's a lot of supplemental information in today's disclosures, so I won't cover every dot point on this slide, but I'll pick up some of the highlights across the page.
Earnings and cash flow were strong. We generated significant free cash flow to organically funded shareholder distributions of 37% of our CFO in excess of our target. We met our exceeded operational targets. Underlying production grew year-on-year by 5% on an absolute basis and 13% on a per debt adjusted share basis. The business is running safely and efficiently. We received the ICSID ruling order in Venezuela to pay $8.7 billion for unlawful expropriation of our assets. We recently announced completion or agreements of noncore asset sales, all part of building the best portfolio for winning our through-cycle return strategy.
We've summarized our first quarter results at the bottom of these columns: expand cash flows, maintain discipline, improve returns. That's the mantra.
Our cash flow reference point has improved at $65 WTI and current differentials, our cash flow reference point is now about $13 billion, that's more than $2 billion improvement over the past 2 years driven by our Brent weighted pricing, our ongoing portfolio work and our focus on margin expansion. While prices have been stronger lately, our guidance items are unchanged. As we said last quarter, we expect capital to be front-end loaded this year. Production is expected to be back-end loaded as the turner unconventionals ramp and we come out of our usual 2Q and 3Q turnarounds.
As for improving return on capital employed, our ROCE ticked up on a rolling 4 quarter basis. Underneath all the current noise and energy, we believe the way our industry will bring investors back to our sectors to perform quarter in and quarter out, no excuses. Put up the numbers, improve returns, grow cash flows and distribute a significant portion to shareholders. That's our job 1 period.
Now to Slide 5. Our value proposition on a page. Our priorities showed on the left haven't changed since we rolled them out in 2016, and we have no intention of changing them now. On the right side of the slide are just some topical issues, starting with our future capital trajectory. As you know, we're hosting an Analyst and Investor Meeting in November. At a high level, here's what you can expect to see. First of all, we intend to show a decade-long plan that extends the successful new order plan that we rolled out a few years ago. That plan worked and we're going to show you how it'll continue to work for many years.
Second, our annual capital expenditures averaging under $7 billion. The plan can achieve steady organic growth on an absolute and a per-share basis with the captured opportunities within the portfolio today. Why can we maintain this capital discipline? Because we have numerous options at our discretion for exercising flexibility. For example, how we choose to face projects where we have control on timing. And whether or not we choose to reduce order shipping projects where we currently hold a high working interest. These are details we expect to lay out in November. But our plan isn't about capital discipline for capital discipline sake. It's about generating free cash flow, deploying that free cash flow in a prudent shareholder-friendly manner and growing returns.
In November, you'll see a plan that can generate free cash flow in less than $40 per barrel WTI throughout the plan period. And in a reference price of $50 per barrel, the plan continues to return at least 30% of our cash from operations to our shareholders.
For almost 3 years, we've been on a mission to bring investors back to this sector, but not just for a quarter or 2. We want to bring investors back to energy for many years to come. Our strategy gives investors a clear path to compelling value creation. It's not anchored to a production target and it does not debt on higher prices.
So that frames up what you'll see from us in November. We'll maintain capital discipline, we'll fund the best combination of projects to maximize shareholder value and honor our priorities well into the next decade.
Now in the meantime, 2019 continues to be volatile, an environment in which ConocoPhillips thrives. That's what we're describing with the 2 lower boxes on this slide. We have significant leverage to higher prices. Our production base is 75% Brent weighted. Our operations are primarily in tax and royalty regimes and we're unhedged. We don't chase higher prices with pro-cyclical investments and we'll build cash for inevitable price downturns. And in that part of the cycle, we offer distinctive resilience. We generate free cash flow at less than $40 a barrel WTI. Our balance sheet gives us flexibility to maintain consistent programs and we have a 16 billion barrel resource base that averages less than $30 a barrel cost of supply. Just a few months ago, I'll remind you, WTI dipped into the low $40s per barrel and we didn't [indiscernible]. If you just look at our performance over the past few quarters, you can see our resilience and our torque in action.
So in case people forgotten how well we work across prices, that's a reminder. We're actually built for price cycles.
Finally, it's not on the slide, but I'm going to take another issue head-on and that's M&A. As you've heard from me many times, we think of M&A in 3 buckets. First, incremental fence line transactions that add value such as additional working interest, royalty interest or corning up our acreage. We're going to do these things, under the radar day in day out. The second bucket consists of higher return bolt-on assets for acreage deals and they could be larger in size. They also make good sense. We're always on the lookout for these kinds of opportunities and we executed a few last year. But I'm sure the bucket people seem focused on now is the third one, bigger, corporate transactions that require premiums.
Of course, we pay attention to what's out there. However, we've always said the bar is very high for these large transactions and that's still the case. We're focused on returns and we won't do transactions that are not in our shareholder's best interest.
So let me summarize my comments. The business is running well, execution is strong. No one needs to be worried about capital sticker shock in November. You can expect to see a decade-long plan that honors the successful value proposition that we believe is ideally suited for our sector. Our strategy works across a range of prices and through cycles, the strong upside to higher prices and distinctive resilience to lower prices. We have the short-term covered and we have the long-term covered. And the bar is high for corporate transactions.
Let's all understand today and we'll be quick, and now I'll turn it over to your questions."

And as you say, depending on how prices go, that can move up just organically as we go through the year. Certainly we're expecting closing the U.K. transaction, so cash balances could start to approach pretty high levels. We kind of think of somewhere in the 10% of total assets. And you need to be pretty clear about your strategic rationale, and I think that we have been. We view the balance sheet in general and cash balances in particular as strategic assets in the source of competitive advantage. In our strategy, we've been clear about is to be competitive with the best capital returners in our industry and importantly, to be able to continue funding buybacks and maintaining our development programs, while prices are falling. So we're okay carrying more cash than the average E&P company. I don't think that we'll be comfortable taking net debt down to 0. So if you want to put a limit, it's going to be above that. But we also think they'll be in position to be able to be opportunistic, particularly, when prices are low and competition is weak is something that we also play strategic value on. But I think if our cash continues to build as we approach the end of the year, of course, we've got our Analyst Day set for November and you'll see more definition around our capital allocation thoughts at that time."

I think the design proposition is kind of easy to say, but it's difficult to do. And I think why we're able to do it and I think differentiate ourselves from our competitors, it starts with the portfolio and the low cost of supply sitting in the portfolio, the base decline that the portfolio has, the type of assets we have when you consider our long dated no decline, low-sustaining capital kind of assets like LNG in all sense combined with what we believe is an unmatched, unconventional portfolio across all the basis in the Lower 48, so you put all that together, and we're running it to generate free cash flow. And we're -- we've gotten the cost structure of the company down to where we can free cash flow below $40 a barrel. And I don't think other companies can do that. Either they have to grow into that or they have to pry out much higher prices to go do that. So -- and we just don't believe these kinds of prices are going to persist. We think there's going to be volatility, which is why we carry cash on the balance sheet and remind people in December it was $42 a barrel WTI at the low point.
So we just think the way we've setup the company in the portfolio, the way we're managing the company, we're allocating capital and the way we are focused on returns in the business, full-cycle returns, not just forward-looking returns, but full-cycle returns to our kind of cost of supply monitor that's why it's going to be difficult for people to be able to do what we're doing. It's a kind of price decks that we've demonstrated that we can do that at.
To your second question, Doug, on strategic activities, we said -- we tried that on the larger corporate transactions. It's about cost of supply and it's not opportunities that can come in the portfolio at a competitive cost to supply, and that's a pretty big hurdle with the kinds of premiums that are being paid for assets today. And we don't really have a time frame that we look at. In short, meeting them in long term, we got to convince ourself that it's in the best interest of the shareholder long term, but it's accretive in the short term and it's competitive for capital all in all in full cycle basis relative to our $16 billion barrel portfolio that's captured in handwrite today. So it remains really, really high hurdle. Anybody can lever up their balance sheet and do a free cash flow yield positive kind of play today, that's what you need to do. Full cycle returns are tough."

Yes, so we said in our last call, just to talk to the Big 3 growth trajectory, we said in our last call, really after outperforming in 2018 with 37% growth, the trajectory of the victory would be relatively flat for the first half of this year and then growth ramping in the second half. So we're still on that track. First quarter production was actually very much in line with our expectations. And as we've explained previously, the primary driver for that lumpiness in the growth profile is the timing of multi-low pads coming online, and how do those sync up across the different assets. And actually, Q1 is a good example of that. So over half of our new wells were brought online towards the end of the quarter during March. And in fact, we had record rates in the last week of March, the Eagle Ford and Delaware. So we're coming into Q2 pretty strong. We did have some minor production, in fact, in Q1 from extended winter weather in Bakken and some gas injection phases that enhanced all recovery pilots at Eagle Ford. But the important points, Q1 was very much in line with our expectations and we do remain confident by execution of our plan and delivering our Big 3 production guidance of 350,000 and full year growth of 19%.
On your second question, we're always looking at where the next best door would be. Our teams fight pretty hard over that. But the fact is, we've got good opportunities at the Bakken, Eagle Ford and Delaware. And we'll talk more about our long-term view on that in November."

Maybe first with a bit of an explanation for why the 1/18 effective date can appear a little bit unusual. But just to remind you, we began marketing those assets during 2018 and so the beginning of the year was selected as the valuation point. And then as the marketing extended into 2019, it was the various parties -- counterparties that we were dealing with, it was their preference that we maintain the 1/18 effective date mainly for financing reasons because vendors typically require audits and financial statements in the periods immediately preceding the effective date and those would not have been available. And we moved the date to 1/19 until midyear and we didn't want to hold up the transaction for that reason.
So as you would guess, the U.K. has been net cash flow positive since that 1/18 date. And so there will be a downward price adjustment at closing. Now I can give you an estimate and it's kind of based on end of the year closing and kind of current prices. So if the timing changes or pricing, cash flows from this point forward changed and obviously those estimates would change. But we think that adjustment will be negative around $600 million. So taking that off the headline price, we would be -- expect cash proceeds at closing at the end of the year under current conditions, I've got enough disclaimers in there, would be something around $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion."

The LNG market has changed a lot over recent years and Barossa, we're not constructing an LNG plant, we're back-filling the existing one. So it's really an offshore development project, not the same nature of the typical LNG. So when you think about the nature of that project and the development -- the rapid development of the spot market, which is quite liquid today compared to where it was even a few years ago, we don't feel compelled to have to place all of the LNG under long-term contracts. That's an option that we can choose to do and we are marketing the LNG today on that basis. We'd be happy to do it. But if we don't get the price that we expect, then we're willing to go into the project with -- without all or a majority of the LNG committed in the long term.

So as time goes on, probably beginning in the third or fourth quarter this year, we'll begin exporting Permian crude oil to the Gulf. And we have options to expand our capacity rights on these pipelines. So I think our situation will improve over time and so we would expect.
On the gas side, it's a little bit different because I've talked about this a little bit before, but we currently produce about 100 million cubic feet a day in the Permian and we have a lot more takeaway capacity than that out of the Permian by virtue of our gas marketing arrangements. We're one of the larger gas marketers in the southwest area from Texas to California and to Mexico. And so we have a lot of firm takeaway -- long-term firm takeaway capacity that allows us to move not only our equity gas but third-party gas outside of the basin. So we're not seeing the same levels of pressure. We're generally -- I'd say, in the first quarter, most of our gas was sold into Arizona and California markets. So we didn't see Waha-type pricing. On the other hand, other side of that on the gas marketing side, we did benefit a good bit from Waha pricing as we were in the market some days with producers paying us as much as $6 or $7 Mcf."

First, our 1 quarter results",1231,"Thanks, Ellen, and welcome, everyone, to today's call. My opening comments will be brief. I'll summarize our 1Q results, then address some ConocoPhillips' specific issues we're hearing from the market, which I'll take head-on. First, our 1 quarter results shown on Slide 4. The punchline of this slide is essentially the same as the many quarterly slides before it. We're successfully executing our plan. There's a lot of supplemental information in today's disclosures, so I won't cover every dot point on this slide, but I'll pick off some of the highlights across the page.
Earnings and cash flow were strong. We generated significant free cash flow to organically funded shareholder distributions of 37% of our CFO in excess of our target. We met or exceeded operational targets. Underlying production grew year-on-year by 5% on an absolute basis and 13% on a per debt adjusted share basis. The business is running safely and efficiently. We received the ICSID ruling, ordering Venezuela to pay $8.7 billion for unlawful expropriation of our assets. We recently announced completion or agreements of noncore asset sales, all part of building the best portfolio for winning our through-cycle return strategy.
We've summarized our first quarter results at the bottom of these columns: expand cash flows, maintain discipline, improve returns. That's the mantra.
Our cash flow reference point has improved at $65 WTI and current differentials, our cash flow reference point is now about $13 billion, that's more than $2 billion improvement over the past 2 years driven by our Brent weighted pricing, our ongoing portfolio work and our focus on margin expansion. While prices have been stronger lately, our guidance items are unchanged. As we said last quarter, we expect capital to be front-end loaded this year. Production is expected to be back-end loaded as the turner unconventionals ramp and we come out of our usual 2Q and 3Q turnarounds.
As for improving return on capital employed, our ROCE ticked up on a rolling 4 quarter basis. Underneath all the current noise and energy, we believe the way our industry will bring investors back to our sector is to perform quarter in and quarter out, no excuses. Put up the numbers, improve returns, grow cash flows and distribute a significant portion to shareholders. That's our job 1 period.
Now to Slide 5. Our value proposition on a page. Our priorities showed on the left haven't changed since we rolled them out in 2016, and we have no intention of changing them now. On the right side of the slide I'll address some topical issues, starting with our future capital trajectory. As you know, we're hosting an Analyst and Investor Meeting in November. At a high level, here's what you can expect to see. First of all, we intend to show a decade-long plan that extends the successful new order plan that we rolled out a few years ago. That plan worked and we're going to show you how it'll continue to work for many years.
Second, our annual capital expenditures averaging under $7 billion. The plan can achieve steady organic growth on an absolute and a per-share basis with the captured opportunities within the portfolio today. Why can we maintain this capital discipline? Because we have numerous options at our discretion for exercising flexibility. For example, how we choose to face projects where we have control on timing. And whether or not we choose to reduce ownership in projects where we currently hold a high working interest. These are details we expect to lay out in November. But our plan isn't about capital discipline for capital discipline sake. It's about generating free cash flow, deploying that free cash flow in a prudent shareholder-friendly manner and growing returns.
In November, you'll see a plan that can generate free cash flow in less than $40 per barrel WTI throughout the plan period. And in a reference price of $50 per barrel, the plan continues to return at least 30% of our cash from operations to our shareholders.
For almost 3 years, we've been on a mission to bring investors back to this sector, but not just for a quarter or 2. We want to bring investors back to energy for many years to come. Our strategy gives investors a clear path to compelling value creation. It's not anchored to a production target and it does not debt on higher prices.
So that frames up what you'll see from us in November. We'll maintain capital discipline, we'll fund the best combination of projects to maximize shareholder value and honor our priorities well into the next decade.
Now in the meantime, 2019 continues to be volatile, an environment in which ConocoPhillips thrives. That's what we're describing with the 2 lower boxes on this slide. We have significant leverage to higher prices. Our production base is 75% Brent weighted. Our operations are primarily in tax and royalty regimes and we're unhedged. We don't chase higher prices with pro-cyclical investments and we'll build cash for inevitable price downturns. And in that part of the cycle, we offer distinctive resilience. We generate free cash flow at less than $40 a barrel WTI. Our balance sheet gives us flexibility to maintain consistent programs and we have a 16 billion barrel resource base that averages less than $30 a barrel cost of supply. Just a few months ago, I'll remind you, WTI dipped into the low $40s per barrel and we didn't miss a beat. If you just look at our performance over the past few quarters, you can see our resilience and our torque in action.
So in case people forgotten how well we work across prices, that's a reminder. We're actually built for price cycles.
Finally, it's not on the slide, but I'm going to take another issue head-on and that's M&A. As you've heard from me many times, we think of M&A in 3 buckets. First, incremental fence line transactions that add value such as additional working interest, royalty interest or corning up our acreage. We're going to do these things, under the radar day in day out. The second bucket consists of higher return bolt-on assets for acreage deals and they could be larger in size. They also make good sense. We're always on the lookout for these kinds of opportunities and we executed a few last year. But I'm sure the bucket people seem focused on now is the third one, bigger, corporate transactions that require premiums.
Of course, we pay attention to what's out there. However, we've always said the bar is very high for these large transactions and that's still the case. We're focused on returns and we won't do transactions that are not in our shareholders' best interest.
So let me summarize my comments. The business is running well, execution is strong. No one needs to be worried about capital sticker shock in November. You can expect to see a decade-long plan that honors the successful value proposition that we believe is ideally suited for our sector. Our strategy works across a range of prices and through cycles, the strong upside to higher prices and distinctive resilience to lower prices. We have the short-term covered and we have the long-term covered. And the bar is high for corporate transactions.
Let's all I want to say today and we'll be quick, and now I'll turn it over to your questions."

And as you say, depending on how prices go, that can move up just organically as we go through the year. Certainly we're expecting closing the U.K. transaction, so cash balances could start to approach pretty high levels. We kind of think of somewhere in the 10% of total assets. And you need to be pretty clear about your strategic rationale, and I think that we have been. We view the balance sheet in general and cash balances in particular as strategic assets and a source of competitive advantage. In our strategy, we've been clear about is to be competitive with the best capital returners in our industry and importantly, to be able to continue funding buybacks and maintaining our development programs, while prices are falling. So we're okay carrying more cash than the average E&P company. I don't think that we would be comfortable taking net debt down to 0. So if you want to put a limit, it's going to be above that. But we also think to be in position to be able to be opportunistic, particularly, when prices are low and competition is weak is something that we also place strategic value on. But I think if our cash continues to build as we approach the end of the year, of course, we've got our Analyst Day set for November and you'll see more definition around our capital allocation thoughts at that time."

I think the design proposition is kind of easy to say, but it's difficult to do. And I think why we're able to do it and I think differentiate ourselves from our competitors, it starts with the portfolio and the low cost of supplies sitting in the portfolio, the base decline that the portfolio has, the type of assets we have when you consider our long dated no decline, low-sustaining capital kind of assets like LNG in oil sands combined with what we believe is an unmatched, unconventional portfolio across all the bases in the Lower 48, so you put all that together, and we're running it to generate free cash flow. And we're -- we've gotten the cost structure of the company down to where we can free cash flow below $40 a barrel. And I don't think other companies can do that. Either they have to grow into that or they have to pry out much higher prices to go do that. So -- and we just don't believe these kinds of prices are going to persist. We think there's going to be volatility, which is why we carry cash on the balance sheet and remind people in December it was $42 a barrel WTI at the low point.
So we just think the way we've set up the company in the portfolio, the way we're managing the company, we're allocating capital and the way we are focused on returns in the business, full-cycle returns, not just forward-looking returns, but full-cycle returns through our kind of cost of supply mantra that's why it's going to be difficult for people to be able to do what we're doing. It's a kind of price decks that we've demonstrated that we can do that at.
To your second question, Doug, on strategic activities, we said -- we tried to hit that on the larger corporate transactions. It's about cost of supply and it's not opportunities that can come in the portfolio at a competitive cost to supply, and that's a pretty big hurdle with the kinds of premiums that are being paid for assets today. And we don't really have a time frame that we look at. In short, meeting them in long term, we got to convince ourself that it's in the best interest of the shareholder long term, but it's accretive in the short term and it's competitive for capital on in all in full cycle basis relative to our $16 billion barrel portfolio that's captured in handwrite today. So it remains a really, really high hurdle. Anybody can lever up their balance sheet and do a free cash flow yield positive kind of play today, that's easy to do. Full cycle returns are tough."

It's an exceptional rate and I assume that's one of the reasons you can keep CapEx more modest. It's what metric should we think about, is it the debt adjusted cash flow? Is it just a per unit cash margin that you're able to grow? Maybe just a little bit of a framework of how to think about a company that CapEx is relatively stable, but ultimately, you're trying to grow returns and grow cash flow here."

Yes, so we said at our last call, just to talk to the Big 3 growth trajectory, we said at our last call, really after outperforming in 2018 with 37% growth, the trajectory of the victory would be relatively flat for the first half of this year and then growth ramping in the second half. So we're still on that track. First quarter production was actually very much in line with our expectations. And as we've explained previously, the primary driver for that lumpiness in the growth profile is the timing of multi-well pads coming online, and how those sync up across the different assets. And actually, Q1 is a good example of that. So over half of our new wells were brought online towards the end of the quarter during March. And in fact, we had record rates in the last week of March, the Eagle Ford and Delaware. So we're coming into Q2 pretty strong. We did have some minor production, in fact, in Q1 from extended winter weather in Bakken and some gas injection phases at our enhanced all recovery pilots at Eagle Ford. But the important points are Q1 was very much in line with our expectations and we do remain confident by execution of our plan and delivering our Big 3 production guidance of 350,000 and full year growth of 19%.
On your second question, we're always looking at where the next best door would be. Our teams fight pretty hard over that. But the fact is, we've got good opportunities at the Bakken, Eagle Ford and Delaware. And we'll talk more about our long-term view on that in November."

Maybe first with a bit of an explanation for why the 1/18 effective date because it can appear a little bit unusual. But just to remind you, we began marketing those assets during 2018 and so the beginning of the year was selected as the valuation point. And then as the marketing extended into 2019, it was the various parties -- counterparties that we were dealing with, it was their preference that we maintain the 1/18 effective date mainly for financing reasons because lenders typically require audits and financial statements in the periods immediately preceding the effective date and those would not have been available. And we moved the date to 1/19 until midyear and we didn't want to hold up the transaction for that reason.
So as you would guess, the U.K. has been net cash flow positive since that 1/18 date. And so there will be a downward price adjustment at closing. Now I can give you an estimate and it's kind of based on end of the year closing and kind of current prices. So if the timing changes or pricing, cash flows from this point forward changed then obviously those estimates would change. But we think that adjustment will be a negative around $600 million. So taking that off the headline price, we would be -- expect cash proceeds at closing at the end of the year under current conditions, I've got enough disclaimers in there, would be something around $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion."

We think that's the right model to be taken. What does that mean for M&A and consolidation and putting more assets under our management? Under this kind of value proposition, I think there's something to be said about that and we look at them. We look at everything that's going on. It's tough to compete inside the portfolio. When you put a premium on that we see that we've been doing -- or that the market's been putting on these assets that adds $10 to $15 cost of supply to the all-in returns. And if you're focused on all-in returns and you're sitting with a portfolio, it's got 30 years of life and there's 3 ConocoPhillips sitting inside our resource base.

So it's really an offshore development project, not the same nature of the typical LNG.

So as time goes on, probably beginning in the third or fourth quarter this year, we'll begin exporting Permian crude oil to the Gulf. And we have options to expand our capacity rights on these pipelines. So I think our situation will improve over time. That's what we would expect.
On the gas side, it's a little bit different because I've talked about this a little bit before, but we currently produce about 100 million cubic feet a day in the Permian and we have a lot more takeaway capacity than that out of the Permian by virtue of our gas marketing arrangements. We're one of the larger gas marketers in the southwest area from Texas through California into Mexico. And so we have a lot of firm takeaway -- long-term firm takeaway capacity that allows us to move not only our equity gas but third-party gas outside of the basin. So we're not seeing the same levels of pressure. We're generally -- I'd say, in the first quarter, most of our gas was sold into Arizona and California markets. So we didn't see Waha-type pricing.

First, our 1 quarter results",1231,"Thanks, Ellen, and welcome, everyone, to today's call. My opening comments will be brief. I'll summarize our 1Q results, then address some ConocoPhillips' specific issues we're hearing from the market, which I'll take head-on. First, our 1 quarter results shown on Slide 4. The punchline of this slide is essentially the same as the many quarterly slides before it. We're successfully executing our plan. There's a lot of supplemental information in today's disclosures, so I won't cover every dot point on this slide, but I'll pick off some of the highlights across the page.
Earnings and cash flow were strong. We generated significant free cash flow to organically funded shareholder distributions of 37% of our CFO in excess of our target. We met or exceeded operational targets. Underlying production grew year-on-year by 5% on an absolute basis and 13% on a per debt adjusted share basis. The business is running safely and efficiently. We received the ICSID ruling, ordering Venezuela to pay $8.7 billion for unlawful expropriation of our assets. We recently announced completion or agreements of noncore asset sales, all part of building the best portfolio for winning our through-cycle return strategy.
We've summarized our first quarter results at the bottom of these columns: expand cash flows, maintain discipline, improve returns. That's the mantra.
Our cash flow reference point has improved at $65 WTI and current differentials, our cash flow reference point is now about $13 billion, that's more than $2 billion improvement over the past 2 years driven by our Brent weighted pricing, our ongoing portfolio work and our focus on margin expansion. While prices have been stronger lately, our guidance items are unchanged. As we said last quarter, we expect capital to be front-end loaded this year. Production is expected to be back-end loaded as the turner unconventionals ramp and we come out of our usual 2Q and 3Q turnarounds.
As for improving return on capital employed, our ROCE ticked up on a rolling 4 quarter basis. Underneath all the current noise and energy, we believe the way our industry will bring investors back to our sector is to perform quarter in and quarter out, no excuses. Put up the numbers, improve returns, grow cash flows and distribute a significant portion to shareholders. That's our job 1 period.
Now to Slide 5. Our value proposition on a page. Our priorities showed on the left haven't changed since we rolled them out in 2016, and we have no intention of changing them now. On the right side of the slide I'll address some topical issues, starting with our future capital trajectory. As you know, we're hosting an Analyst and Investor Meeting in November. At a high level, here's what you can expect to see. First of all, we intend to show a decade-long plan that extends the successful new order plan that we rolled out a few years ago. That plan worked and we're going to show you how it'll continue to work for many years.
Second, our annual capital expenditures averaging under $7 billion. The plan can achieve steady organic growth on an absolute and a per-share basis with the captured opportunities within the portfolio today. Why can we maintain this capital discipline? Because we have numerous options at our discretion for exercising flexibility. For example, how we choose to face projects where we have control on timing. And whether or not we choose to reduce ownership in projects where we currently hold a high working interest. These are details we expect to lay out in November. But our plan isn't about capital discipline for capital discipline sake. It's about generating free cash flow, deploying that free cash flow in a prudent shareholder-friendly manner and growing returns.
In November, you'll see a plan that can generate free cash flow in less than $40 per barrel WTI throughout the plan period. And in a reference price of $50 per barrel, the plan continues to return at least 30% of our cash from operations to our shareholders.
For almost 3 years, we've been on a mission to bring investors back to this sector, but not just for a quarter or 2. We want to bring investors back to energy for many years to come. Our strategy gives investors a clear path to compelling value creation. It's not anchored to a production target and it does not debt on higher prices.
So that frames up what you'll see from us in November. We'll maintain capital discipline, we'll fund the best combination of projects to maximize shareholder value and honor our priorities well into the next decade.
Now in the meantime, 2019 continues to be volatile, an environment in which ConocoPhillips thrives. That's what we're describing with the 2 lower boxes on this slide. We have significant leverage to higher prices. Our production base is 75% Brent weighted. Our operations are primarily in tax and royalty regimes and we're unhedged. We don't chase higher prices with pro-cyclical investments and we'll build cash for inevitable price downturns. And in that part of the cycle, we offer distinctive resilience. We generate free cash flow at less than $40 a barrel WTI. Our balance sheet gives us flexibility to maintain consistent programs and we have a 16 billion barrel resource base that averages less than $30 a barrel cost of supply. Just a few months ago, I'll remind you, WTI dipped into the low $40s per barrel and we didn't miss a beat. If you just look at our performance over the past few quarters, you can see our resilience and our torque in action.
So in case people forgotten how well we work across prices, that's a reminder. We're actually built for price cycles.
Finally, it's not on the slide, but I'm going to take another issue head-on and that's M&A. As you've heard from me many times, we think of M&A in 3 buckets. First, incremental fence line transactions that add value such as additional working interest, royalty interest or corning up our acreage. We're going to do these things, under the radar day in day out. The second bucket consists of higher return bolt-on assets for acreage deals and they could be larger in size. They also make good sense. We're always on the lookout for these kinds of opportunities and we executed a few last year. But I'm sure the bucket people seem focused on now is the third one, bigger, corporate transactions that require premiums.
Of course, we pay attention to what's out there. However, we've always said the bar is very high for these large transactions and that's still the case. We're focused on returns and we won't do transactions that are not in our shareholders' best interest.
So let me summarize my comments. The business is running well, execution is strong. No one needs to be worried about capital sticker shock in November. You can expect to see a decade-long plan that honors the successful value proposition that we believe is ideally suited for our sector. Our strategy works across a range of prices and through cycles, the strong upside to higher prices and distinctive resilience to lower prices. We have the short-term covered and we have the long-term covered. And the bar is high for corporate transactions.
That's all I want to say today and we'll be quick, and now I'll turn it over to your questions."

And as you say, depending on how prices go, that can move up just organically as we go through the year. Certainly we're expecting closing the U.K. transaction, so cash balances could start to approach pretty high levels. We kind of think of somewhere in the 10% of total assets. And you need to be pretty clear about your strategic rationale, and I think that we have been. We view the balance sheet in general and cash balances in particular as strategic assets and a source of competitive advantage. In our strategy, we've been clear about is to be competitive with the best capital returners in our industry and importantly, to be able to continue funding buybacks and maintaining our development programs, while prices are falling. So we're okay carrying more cash than the average E&P company. I don't think that we would be comfortable taking net debt down to 0. So if you want to put a limit, it's going to be above that. But we also think to be in position to be able to be opportunistic, particularly, when prices are low and competition is weak is something that we also place strategic value on. But I think if our cash continues to build as we approach the end of the year, of course, we've got our Analyst Day set for November and you'll see more definition around our capital allocation thoughts at that time."

I think the design proposition is kind of easy to say, but it's difficult to do. And I think why we're able to do it and I think differentiate ourselves from our competitors, it starts with the portfolio and the low cost of supplies sitting in the portfolio, the base decline that the portfolio has, the type of assets we have when you consider our long dated no decline, low-sustaining capital kind of assets like LNG in oil sands combined with what we believe is an unmatched, unconventional portfolio across all the bases in the Lower 48, so you put all that together, and we're running it to generate free cash flow. And we're -- we've gotten the cost structure of the company down to where we can free cash flow below $40 a barrel. And I don't think other companies can do that. Either they have to grow into that or they have to pry out much higher prices to go do that. So -- and we just don't believe these kinds of prices are going to persist. We think there's going to be volatility, which is why we carry cash on the balance sheet and remind people in December it was $42 a barrel WTI at the low point.
So we just think the way we've set up the company in the portfolio, the way we're managing the company, we're allocating capital and the way we are focused on returns in the business, full-cycle returns, not just forward-looking returns, but full-cycle returns through our kind of cost of supply mantra that's why it's going to be difficult for people to be able to do what we're doing. It's a kind of price decks that we've demonstrated that we can do that at.
To your second question, Doug, on strategic activities, we said -- we tried to hit that on the larger corporate transactions. It's about cost of supply and it's not opportunities that can come in the portfolio at a competitive cost to supply, and that's a pretty big hurdle with the kinds of premiums that are being paid for assets today. And we don't really have a time frame that we look at. In short, meeting them in long term, we got to convince ourself that it's in the best interest of the shareholder long term, but it's accretive in the short term and it's competitive for capital on an all-in full cycle basis relative to our $16 billion barrel portfolio that's captured in handwrite today. So it remains a really, really high hurdle. Anybody can lever up their balance sheet and do a free cash flow yield positive kind of play today, that's easy to do. Full cycle returns are tough."

Yes, so we said at our last call, just to talk to the Big 3 growth trajectory, we said at our last call, really after outperforming in 2018 with 37% growth, the trajectory of the victory would be relatively flat for the first half of this year and then growth ramping in the second half. So we're still on that track. First quarter production was actually very much in line with our expectations. And as we've explained previously, the primary driver for that lumpiness in the growth profile is the timing of multi-well pads coming online, and how those sync up across the different assets. And actually, Q1 is a good example of that. So over half of our new wells were brought online towards the end of the quarter during March. And in fact, we had record rates in the last week of March, the Eagle Ford and Delaware. So we're coming into Q2 pretty strong. We did have some minor production, in fact, in Q1 from extended winter weather in Bakken and some gas injection phases at our enhanced all recovery pilots at Eagle Ford. But the important points are Q1 was very much in line with our expectations and we do remain confident by execution of our plan and delivering our Big 3 production guidance of 350,000 and full year growth of 19%.

Maybe first with a bit of an explanation for why the 1/18 effective date because it can appear a little bit unusual. But just to remind you, we began marketing those assets during 2018 and so the beginning of the year was selected as the valuation point. And then as the marketing extended into 2019, it was the various parties -- counterparties that we were dealing with, it was their preference that we maintain the 1/18 effective date mainly for financing reasons because lenders typically require audits and financial statements in the periods immediately preceding the effective date and those would not have been available. And we moved the date to 1/19 until midyear and we didn't want to hold up the transaction for that reason.
So as you would guess, the U.K. has been net cash flow positive since that 1/18 date. And so there will be a downward price adjustment at closing. Now I can give you an estimate and it's kind of based on end of the year closing and kind of current prices. So if the timing changes or pricing, cash flows from this point forward changed then obviously those estimates would change. But we think that adjustment will be a negative around $600 million. So taking that off the headline price, we would be -- expect cash proceeds at closing at the end of the year under current conditions, I've got enough disclaimers in there, would be something around $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion."

We think that's the right model to be taken. What does that mean for M&A and consolidation and putting more assets under our management? Under this kind of value proposition, I think there's something to be said about that and we look at them. We look at everything that's going on. It's tough to compete inside the portfolio. When you put a premium on that we see that we've been doing -- or that the market's been putting on these assets that adds $10 to $15 cost of supply to the all-in returns. And if you're focused on all-in returns and you're sitting with a portfolio, it's got 30 years of life and there's 3 ConocoPhillips sitting inside our resource base.

So it's really an offshore development project, not the same nature of the typical LNG.

And third, let me mull around the U.K. again, because we might not circle back to it. I did want to speak to one aspect that wasn't addressed in our original release when we notified the market about our pending sale there and that's the tax efficiency. This is an extremely tax efficient transaction. We don't expect any U.K. taxes at all.
And on the U.S. side, even though we're going to generate a very large financial gain at closing on this sale, we're also generating a very large U.S. capital loss. And we're going to be able to take that loss and apply it back to the San Juan transaction, for example, which was in 2017 and we're going to be able to offset the capital gain that we had on that transaction. We'll be able to carry forward those tax losses to any future applicable sale that we have for the next 5 years as well. So what you'll see in the second quarter is that we're going to generate earnings related to these tax benefits of about $200 million."

On the gas side, it's a little bit different because I've talked about this a little bit before, but we currently produce about 100 million cubic feet a day in the Permian and we have a lot more takeaway capacity than that out of the Permian by virtue of our gas marketing arrangements. We're one of the larger gas marketers in the southwest area from Texas through California into Mexico. And so we have a lot of firm takeaway -- long-term firm takeaway capacity that allows us to move not only our equity gas but third-party gas outside of the basin. So we're not seeing the same levels of pressure. We're generally -- I'd say, in the first quarter, most of our gas was sold into Arizona and California markets. So we didn't see Waha-type pricing.

I'll cover the second quarter highlights on Slide 4. Starting on the left with our financial performance. We realized adjusted earnings of $1.1 billion in the quarter or $1.01 per share. Our production outperformance in the quarter didn't fully translate to the bottom line as sales lagged production with inventories building by roughly 25,000 barrels a day, which represents about $0.03 a share. We generated $3.4 billion of cash from operations, resulting in free cash flow of $1.7 billion in the quarter and $3 billion year-to-date. 
This quarter represents our seventh consecutive quarter of free cash flow generation across a broad range of prices, underscoring our commitment to capital discipline. And importantly, over this 7-quarter time frame, cash from operations has more than covered all capital, dividends and share repurchases. We ended the quarter with $6.9 billion of cash and short-term investments. And our strong financial returns continued. On a trailing 12-month basis, our return on capital employed was 12.4%.
Moving to the middle column. Operationally in the quarter, we produced 1.29 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, up 6% on an underlying per net adjusted share basis compared with the year-ago quarter. Sequentially, seasonal turnaround impacts were mitigated by growth from the Lower 48 Big 3. 
Touching on the final bullet in the operational column. In the second quarter, we closed several small bolt-on transactions in the Lower 48 Big 3 for about $100 million. We consistently monitor the market for these kinds of low-cost supply additions in and around our core areas, and we were able to complete a few royalty interest and acreage deals this quarter at attractive terms.
Shifting to the far right strategic column. We've increased this year's planned share repurchase program by $500 million to a total of $3.5 billion. In the second quarter, we repurchased $1.25 billion of shares. We expect to purchase $1.5 billion of shares in the second half of the year. Combined with our second quarter dividend, we returned 47% of cash from operations to shareholders in the quarter, so returning capital to shareholders remains a priority.
In the second quarter, we realized $600 million in disposition proceeds, and the U.K. disposition continues to progress toward closing in the second half of the year. We expect to recognize a gain of approximately $2 billion before tax and after tax when the sale closes. Also, at closing, we'll see a significant balance sheet improvement with net cash proceeds expected to be about $2 billion while liabilities associated with asset retirement obligations will decrease by about $2 billion.
If you turn to Slide 5, I'll wrap up with a look at cash flows during the quarter. We began the second quarter with cash and short-term investments of $6.7 billion. Moving to the right, cash from operations was $3.4 billion, which included roughly $320 million in APLNG distributions and about $90 million collected through the ICC settlement agreement with PDVSA. To date, we've received $665 million related to the $2 billion settlement.
I'll also mention that we continued to receive contingent value payments from Cenovus during the quarter. To date, we've received or accrued a little over $180 million in contingency payments from this 2017 transaction. 
Moving on, working capital was a $600 million use of cash during the quarter. We've recognized $600 million in proceeds from dispositions, and we had $1.7 billion of capital expenditures in the quarter, which was exactly half of cash from operations excluding working capital, leaving $1.7 billion of free cash flow. For the first half, free cash flow was $3 billion, representing a 9% free cash flow yield on an annualized basis.
Looking to the last 2 bricks on the right. The roughly $350 million in dividends and $1.25 billion of share repurchases represented a return of capital to shareholders of $1.6 billion or 47% of CFO. Total shareholder yield based on planned buybacks and our current dividend is running a little over 7%. And you see the ending cash on the far right with a slight build from the first quarter despite choosing to increase buybacks in the quarter by $500 million compared to recent quarters.
So to briefly recap, this past quarter builds on our trend of consistent, strong operational and financial performance. The quarter reemphasizes our commitment to financial returns, capital discipline, free cash flow generation and returning cash from operations to shareholders. We believe this is a sustainable and compelling value proposition for our industry. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Matt."

I'll provide a brief overview of our year-to-date operational highlights and discuss our outlook for the remainder of the year. So please turn to Slide 7. Across the portfolio, we continue to make progress towards the key milestones we high",1382,"Thanks, Don. I'll provide a brief overview of our year-to-date operational highlights and discuss our outlook for the remainder of the year. So please turn to Slide 7. 
Across the portfolio, we continue to make progress towards the key milestones we highlighted at the end of last year. Starting in Alaska, we wrapped up a winter appraisal season in the Greater Willow Area and Narwhal in the second quarter. During the first half of the year, we drilled 7 successful appraisal wells and conducted a series of horizontal production well, activity and interference tests. The results have been encouraging for both Willow and the Narwhal trend. Based on these positive results, we're also taking the opportunity to drill an additional [ 1 ] budgeted horizontal well from an existing outline Drill Site and to the Narwhal trend later this year.
Also in the second quarter, we announced a high-value bolt-on to our Alaska position. We acquired discovered resource acreage called [indiscernible] directly adjacent to our Kuparuk Field and we expect that transaction to close in the third quarter. Finally in June, planned maintenance was completed at Prudhoe Bay, and turnarounds will continue in the third quarter at Prudhoe, the west and north slope in Kuparuk.
Moving to Canada. We completed the first turnaround of our Surmont 2 central processing facility, which in addition to the maintenance scope, also paved way for the alternative [indiscernible] project. This capability will not only reduce the amount of we'd acquire but provide flexibility and improve our netbacks. We expect to have it fully operational by the end of the year as planned.
In June, Surmont was brought back online but continues to be subject to mandatory curtailment, impacting planned production by about 5,000 barrels a day for the rest of the year. In Montney, we continue completion activities on the 14-well pad and construction of the associated infrastructure with start-up still on track for the fourth quarter.
In the Lower 48, Big 3 second quarter production by asset was: Eagle Ford at 221,000 barrels equivalent per day; Bakken at 98,000 and Delaware at 48,000. This represents a 41,000 barrel a day increase from the first quarter to 367,000 due to strong execution performance and improved operational efficiency. We now expect Big 3 production in 2019 to average 360,000 barrels a day, up from our initial expectation of 350,000. This represents a growth rate of about 21% from 2018 to 2019 and an increase of over 60,000 barrels a day for the year.
As Don mentioned, during the quarter, we made several royalty interest and acreage acquisitions across the Big 3. Lastly, we continue to evaluate our results in the Louisiana Austin Chalk play. So far, although we flowed oil from the first 3 wells that produced higher water cuts than we were hoping to see, so the results to date are disappointing. Although the Austin Chalk is the primary target, we're also evaluating opportunities in other formations within the acreage.
Moving over to Europe. As Don said, the U.K. disposition continues to progress towards closing. We also began a planned turnaround in the G area that was completed in July. In Norway, we completed the Greater Ekofisk Area turnaround during the second quarter and sanctioned the Tor II field redevelopment project. This is a subsea production system tied back to Ekofisk that we expect to come on at the end of 2020. In the third quarter, there'll be more turnaround activity Norway in our partner-operated assets.
In Qatar, we remain very interested in participating in the North Field expansion project. 
Moving to Malaysia. Production ramp-up at KBB continued from flow-through some [indiscernible] pipeline recommence but we don't expect full ramp-up and production to be achieved until late in the year. Also in the quarter, KBB began delivering gas to a third-party floating LNG facility. This will service the supplementary offtake to help mitigate potential production disruptions through the pipeline.
Finally, in Indonesia, the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources announced earlier this month that ConocoPhillips has been awarded a 20-year extension of our participation in the Corridor Block beyond the current contract expiring in December of 2023.
So with another quarter of strong execution as well as significant progress across the portfolio. So now let me discuss the outlook for the remainder of the year on Slide 8. As we progress through 2019, we're continuing our disciplined capital approach, and we're also making decisions to optimize the value of our high-margin assets. We're adjusting our full year operating planned capital guidance from $6.1 billion to $6.3 billion, excluding acquisitions, for 2 unbudgeted activities. 
In Alaska, we'll spend about half of the incremental capital to conduct additional scope in our appraisal program, including a long-term test of the Horizontal appraisal well and the additional Narwhal appraisal well I mentioned earlier as well as additional long-lead items for the 2020 exploration and appraisal season.
In the Eagle Ford, we've just added a rig in order to optimize rig count as we ramp towards the plateau phase of our development plans over the next few years, and we'll describe the basis of this optimization in more detail in November. Incremental rate associated with this rig won't show up until 2020.
Our 2019 operating capital guidance excludes acquisitions. To date, we've closed or announced about $300 million of transactions, including the Lower 48 and deals we've already mentioned and a low-cost entry into the [indiscernible] shale play in Argentina. These all represent opportunistic low cost of supply additions to our resource base.
On the production side, we expect the third quarter to average between 1.29 million and 1.33 million barrels equivalent per day. You'll notice on the right side of this chart that we're narrowing the range on our full year outlook because half the year is behind us now but maintaining the midpoint in our previous guidance of 1.325 million barrels a day. Now this might look conservative considering our very strong first half performance. However, at this time, we're not adjusting our full year midpoint guidance for 2 reasons: The first is because we accelerate production plan from the second half of the year into the first half of the year, especially in the second quarter and especially in the Lower 48 Big 3. as I said earlier, we expect the Big 3 overall growth rate to be higher than planned for 2019. We expect production levels for the remainder of the year to be flat to mostly growing -- to modestly growing from the increased rate we saw in the second quarter.
The second factor is lower-than-expected performance in 2 areas: Surmont due to the mandated curtailments that we now expect to continue through the year; and Alaska where 1 of the 4 production wells of the GMT1 project is performing below expectations. The increased production from the Lower 48 Big 3 in the first half of the year essentially offsets these factors through the year. That's another great example of the value of diversification in our portfolio. 
We have a busy second half of the year with several turnarounds and the ramp-up of KBB production, so we don't think it's prudent to change full year guidance at this time. But to be clear, the original $6.1 billion operating plan capital is still delivering our planned 5% underlying production growth. And with our planned buybacks, we expect to deliver 8% our debt adjusted share growth. Also bear in mind that we are carrying the U.K. in all of these numbers. We'll update production and other relevant guidance items at the close of the U.K. disposition.
Finally, we're looking forward to our analyst and investor meeting in November 19 in Houston. We'll show a decade-long disciplined capital plan that delivers free cash flow and strong shareholder returns across a range of prices, and we'll provide a deep dive into the assets across our diverse portfolio. Our strong performance in the first half of the year highlights the strength of our portfolio diversity and our ability to generate free cash flow to support distinctive returns to shareholders.
Our entire ConocoPhillips team is focused on successfully executing the second half of our 2019 plan and sharing our long-term plans with you in November. Now I'll open it up for Q&A."

We did have strong distributions from APLNG, $320 million in the quarter. And in the first quarter, I think it was $73 million. So for the first half, about $400 million. I think previously, maybe it was in the last call, maybe it was the fourth quarter call, I gave guidance of -- to expect APLNG distributions of about $550 million to $600 million for the year. I need to probably bump that up a little bit, but I wouldn't take 2x the $400 million. It won't be quite that high. But I think the new expectation on distributions for 2019, I would say, is going to be in the range of $650 million to $700 million. 
Now I've cautioned folks on this before but I'll just do it again is that these aren't ratable across the quarters. The odd quarters, the first and the third quarter are always going to be low because that's when financing payments and tax payments come up. And the even quarters, the second and fourth are going to be relatively high. So as you're thinking quarter-to-quarter, you should expect third quarter to be kind of low-ish and the fourth quarter to be high-ish. 
With respect to PDVSA, I think that's a very difficult one to give you guidance on for modeling because we don't build that into our cash forecast either. We only recognize the earnings in the cash as we receive it, and I think that's probably the appropriate way to view it considering the situation and the counterparty."

So the Alaska, the -- so we've completed the off-ice appraisals season in Alaska this winter, and the results we've seen at Willow and Narwhal are both very encouraging. So we've really taken the opportunity to extend some of the appraisal from our existing hillsides and For example, we've decided to do an extended well test on a horizontal appraisal well that we drilled into the Narwhal trend. The results of that well are very encouraging and we thought let's see if we can get a long-term test and understand the long-term deliverability. So that's part of the increase.
We also can drill and offset injection well to this from the same drill site. So we're going to take the opportunity to do that as well and that will get us further information on the Narwhal trend. But it's really driven by encouragement on what we saw in the initial well in Narwhal [indiscernible] appraisal we call that. So we're feeling good about that. We're also firming up our plans for 2020 and we're going to have another quite aggressive appraisal and exploration season in 2020. This year, we focused just on appraisal and so there's some long-lead items to do that. 
So the -- once we get to November, we'll give you some details on exactly what we've concluded from the appraisal program this year, but they are both encouraging and that's what's led to trying to accelerate some of this learning. 
Now Lower 48, we're always looking to optimize the value from our unconventional programs, and we've been working specifically this year in more detail on establishing the optimum plateau rate for the -- for our unconventionals. And that has led us to conclude that we should add [ a rig ] over time to the Eagle Ford and we're taking the opportunity to add a seventh rig this year and maybe an eighth rig next year. So that's what's behind that. Of course, we don't expect the seventh rig to contribute any production for next year, but it's all part of this sort of rational approach to establishing the great plateau rate at the unconventional plays."

And let's just say that you see maybe something around $12 billion of CFOs, something in that neighborhood, that's approaching -- that's right around 40% return of cash, return of capital to shareholders in the year. So we're trying to compete with the best capital returners in the business and certainly distinguish ourselves from the other E&P companies out there. 
Now you mentioned the variable dividends, and I'd just say that we're always thinking about the best ways to return capital to shareholders. And so we talk with the investment community to get feedback on their thoughts. We do think our current model of a meaningful common dividend and a significant level of ratable buybacks that really go on indefinitely is a very attractive capital return model.

The Eagle Ford is on what we would characterize as late-stage growth. Within the next few years, we'll reach plateau there. And this addition of the rig is in service of reaching that and optimum plateau and holding that for the optimum duration. The Permian for is us much earlier in the life cycle. So the -- that has a significant growth ahead of it, and it will be several years before we reach plateau there.

So you're asking, have we seen a change in Permian seller expectations. We're not really in that market asking sellers what their expectations are. So I would say no, we're not seeing a change from that perspective. 
The -- we still believe that there's a bit of a mismatch between what people expect for their assets and what we've compete as a use of capital for our capital and that may change over time. So that's why we're focused on the sort of really -- relatively small but very high-value additions to the portfolio through acquisition that we announced over the past few months.

That PSC is going to begin on December 20, 2023. That's immediately following the expiry of the existing PSC. We'll have a 46% working interest, that's prior to a 10% dilution for local governments that's required by the government regulations. It is a new gross split PSC, term PSC and it's got a signature bonus of $115 million net to ConocoPhillips. And we expect we'd make that payment upon completion and definitive documentation. You also see that it's got a commitment of about $100 million net firmwork commitment, but that's during the first 5 years of new PSC, so it really doesn't start until 2024. It is a robust low-cost supply extension and we're pleased that we've been granted that."

The chalk hasn't dewatered to the extent that this requires to get high enough production rates. I mean, unconventional wells a high water content in other plays, in the Delaware Basin, for example. So that by itself is not disqualifier. But here, the water cut that we've seen is being -- it's been a bit over 90%, the oil rates have been about 100 barrels a day.

At Nuna, I'll just to provide a little bit of color on that. It's a discovered resource on 21,000 acres that's in our backyard. It's immediately adjacent to Kuparuk. It's a very low cost of supply in the low 30s. It's $100 million that for 100 million barrels. It's something we're very pleased about. It will be developed from pads both that exist at Kuparuk and a pad at Nuna where there's already a gravel and a road to that pad in place. The remaining facilities at Nuna can be built in a single ice road season. So we'll have appraisal over the next couple of years and target first oil in the 2022 time frame. The development we'll be using existing drilling and completion technology and then the development itself will be incorporated as part of our Kuparuk program so it won't be incremental to that.

Good morning, all.I'll cover the second quarter highlights on Slide 4. Starting on the left with our financial performance. We realized adjusted earnings of $1.1 billion in the quarter or $1.01 per share. Our production outperformance in",757,"Thanks, Ellen. Good morning, all.
I'll cover the second quarter highlights on Slide 4. Starting on the left with our financial performance. We realized adjusted earnings of $1.1 billion in the quarter or $1.01 per share. Our production outperformance in the quarter didn't fully translate to the bottom line as sales lagged production with inventories building by roughly 25,000 barrels a day, which represents about $0.03 a share. We generated $3.4 billion of cash from operations, resulting in free cash flow of $1.7 billion in the quarter and $3 billion year-to-date. 
This quarter represents our seventh consecutive quarter of free cash flow generation across a broad range of prices, underscoring our commitment to capital discipline. And importantly, over this 7-quarter time frame, cash from operations has more than covered all capital, dividends and share repurchases. We ended the quarter with $6.9 billion of cash and short-term investments. And our strong financial returns continued. On a trailing 12-month basis, our return on capital employed was 12.4%.
Moving to the middle column. Operationally in the quarter, we produced 1.29 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, up 6% on an underlying per net adjusted share basis compared with the year-ago quarter. Sequentially, seasonal turnaround impacts were mitigated by growth from the Lower 48 Big 3. 
Touching on the final bullet in the operational column. In the second quarter, we closed several small bolt-on transactions in the Lower 48 Big 3 for about $100 million. We consistently monitor the market for these kinds of low-cost supply additions in and around our core areas, and we were able to complete a few royalty interest and acreage deals this quarter at attractive terms.
Shifting to the far right strategic column. We've increased this year's planned share repurchase program by $500 million to a total of $3.5 billion. In the second quarter, we repurchased $1.25 billion of shares. We expect to purchase $1.5 billion of shares in the second half of the year. Combined with our second quarter dividend, we returned 47% of cash from operations to shareholders in the quarter, so returning capital to shareholders remains a priority.
In the second quarter, we realized $600 million in disposition proceeds, and the U.K. disposition continues to progress toward closing in the second half of the year. We expect to recognize a gain of approximately $2 billion before tax and after tax when the sale closes. Also, at closing, we'll see a significant balance sheet improvement with net cash proceeds expected to be about $2 billion while liabilities associated with asset retirement obligations will decrease by about $2 billion.
If you turn to Slide 5, I'll wrap up with a look at cash flows during the quarter. We began the second quarter with cash and short-term investments of $6.7 billion. Moving to the right, cash from operations was $3.4 billion, which included roughly $320 million in APLNG distributions and about $90 million collected through the ICC settlement agreement with PDVSA. To date, we've received $665 million related to the $2 billion settlement.
I'll also mention that we continued to receive contingent value payments from Cenovus during the quarter. To date, we've received or accrued a little over $180 million in contingency payments from this 2017 transaction. 
Moving on, working capital was a $600 million use of cash during the quarter. We recognized $600 million in proceeds from dispositions, and we had $1.7 billion of capital expenditures in the quarter, which was exactly half of cash from operations excluding working capital, leaving $1.7 billion of free cash flow. For the first half, free cash flow was $3 billion, representing a 9% free cash flow yield on an annualized basis.
Looking to the last 2 bricks on the right. The roughly $350 million in dividends and $1.25 billion of share repurchases represented a return of capital to shareholders of $1.6 billion or 47% of CFO. Total shareholder yield based on planned buybacks and our current dividend is running a little over 7%. And you see the ending cash on the far right with a slight build from the first quarter despite choosing to increase buybacks in the quarter by $500 million compared to recent quarters.
So to briefly recap, this past quarter builds on our trend of consistent, strong operational and financial performance. The quarter reemphasizes our commitment to financial returns, capital discipline, free cash flow generation and returning cash from operations to shareholders. We believe this is a sustainable and compelling value proposition for our industry. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Matt."

I'll provide a brief overview of our year-to-date operational highlights and discuss our outlook for the remainder of the year. So please turn to Slide 7. Across the portfolio, we continue to make progress towards the key milestones we high",1394,"Thanks, Don. I'll provide a brief overview of our year-to-date operational highlights and discuss our outlook for the remainder of the year. So please turn to Slide 7. 
Across the portfolio, we continue to make progress towards the key milestones we highlighted at the end of last year. Starting in Alaska, we wrapped up a winter appraisal season in the Greater Willow Area and Narwhal in the second quarter. During the first half of the year, we drilled 7 successful appraisal wells and conducted a series of horizontal production well, injectivity and interference tests. The results have been encouraging for both Willow and the Narwhal trend. Based on these positive results, we're also taking the opportunity to drill an additional one budgeted horizontal well from an existing outline Drill Site and to the Narwhal trend later this year.
Also in the second quarter, we announced a high-value bolt-on to our Alaska position. We acquired discovered resource acreage called Nuna directly adjacent to our Kuparuk Field and we expect that transaction to close in the third quarter. Finally in June, planned maintenance was completed at Prudhoe Bay, and turnarounds will continue in the third quarter at Prudhoe, the west and north slope in Kuparuk.
Moving to Canada. We safely completed the first turnaround of our Surmont 2 central processing facility, which in addition to the maintenance scope, also paved way for the alternative diluent project. This capability will not only reduce the amount of diluent we'd acquire but provide diluent flexibility and improve our netbacks. We expect to have it fully operational by the end of the year as planned.
In June, Surmont was brought back online but continues to be subject to mandatory curtailment, impacting planned production by about 5,000 barrels a day for the rest of the year. In Montney, we continue completion activities on the 14-well pad and construction of the associated infrastructure with start-up still on track for the fourth quarter.
In the Lower 48, Big 3 second quarter production by asset was: Eagle Ford at 221,000 barrels equivalent per day; Bakken at 98,000 and Delaware at 48,000. This represents a 41,000 barrel a day increase from the first quarter to 367,000 due to strong execution performance and improved operational efficiency. We now expect Big 3 production in 2019 to average 360,000 barrels a day, up from our initial expectation of 350,000. This represents a growth rate of about 21% from 2018 to 2019 and an increase of over 60,000 barrels a day for the year.
As Don mentioned, during the quarter, we made several royalty interest and acreage acquisitions across the Big 3. Lastly, we continue to evaluate our results in the Louisiana Austin Chalk play. So far, although we flowed oil from the first 3 wells that produced higher water cuts than we were hoping to see, so the results to date are disappointing. Although the Austin Chalk is the primary target, we're also evaluating opportunities in other formations within the acreage.
Moving over to Europe. As Don said, the U.K. disposition continues to progress towards closing. We also began a planned turnaround in the G area that was completed in July. In Norway, we completed the Greater Ekofisk Area turnaround during the second quarter and sanctioned the Tor II field redevelopment project. This is a subsea production system tied back to Ekofisk that we expect to come on at the end of 2020. In the third quarter, there'll be more turnaround activity in Norway at our partner-operated assets.
In Qatar, we remain very interested in participating in the North Field expansion project.  
Moving to Malaysia. Production ramp-up at KBB continued some flow-through. The Sabah Sarwak gas pipeline recommenced but we don't expect full ramp-up and production to be achieved until late in the year. Also in the quarter, KBB began delivering gas to a third-party floating LNG facility. This will serve as a supplementary offtake to help mitigate potential production disruptions through the pipeline.
Finally, in Indonesia, the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources announced earlier this month that ConocoPhillips has been awarded a 20-year extension of our participation in the Corridor Block beyond the current contract expiring in December of 2023.
So with another quarter of strong execution as well as significant progress across the portfolio. So now let me discuss the outlook for the remainder of the year on Slide 8. As we progress through 2019, we're continuing our disciplined capital approach, and we're also making decisions to optimize the value of our high-margin assets. We're adjusting our full year operating planned capital guidance from $6.1 billion to $6.3 billion, excluding acquisitions, for 2 unbudgeted activities. 
In Alaska, we'll spend about half of the incremental capital to conduct additional scope in our appraisal program, including a long-term test of the Putu horizontal appraisal well and the additional Narwhal appraisal well I mentioned earlier as well as additional long-lead items for the 2020 exploration and appraisal season.
In the Eagle Ford, we've just added a rig in order to optimize rig count as we ramp towards the plateau phase of our development plans over the next few years, and we'll describe the basis of this optimization in more detail in November. Incremental rate associated with this rig won't show up until 2020.
Our 2019 operating capital guidance excludes acquisitions. To date, we've closed or announced about $300 million of transactions, including the Lower 48 and Nuna deals we've already mentioned and a low-cost entry into the Vaca Muerta shale play in Argentina. These all represent opportunistic low cost of supply additions to our resource base.
On the production side, we expect the third quarter to average between 1.29 million and 1.33 million barrels equivalent per day. You'll notice on the right side of this chart that we're narrowing the range on our full year outlook because half the year is behind us now but maintaining the midpoint in our previous guidance of 1.325 million barrels a day. Now this might look conservative considering our very strong first half performance. However, at this time, we're not adjusting our full year midpoint guidance for 2 reasons: the first is because we accelerate production versus our plan from the second half of the year into the first half of the year, especially in the second quarter and especially in the Lower 48 Big 3. And finally, as I said earlier, we expect the Big 3 overall growth rate to be higher than planned for 2019. We expect production levels for the remainder of the year to be flat to mostly growing -- to modestly growing from the increased rate we saw in the second quarter.
The second factor is lower-than-expected performance in 2 areas: Surmont due to the mandated curtailments that we now expect to continue through the year; and Alaska where 1 of the 4 production wells of the GMT1 project is performing below expectations. The increased production from the Lower 48 Big 3 in the first half of the year essentially offsets these factors through the year. That's another great example of the value of diversification in our portfolio. 
We have a busy second half of the year with several turnarounds and the ramp-up of KBB production, so we don't think it's prudent to change full year guidance at this time. But to be clear, the original $6.1 billion operating plan capital is still delivering our planned 5% underlying production growth. And with our planned buybacks, we expect to deliver 8% per debt adjusted share growth. Also bear in mind that we are carrying the U.K. in all of these numbers. We'll update production and other relevant guidance items at the close of the U.K. disposition.
Finally, we're looking forward to our analyst and investor meeting in November 19 in Houston. We'll show a decade-long disciplined capital plan that delivers free cash flow and strong shareholder returns across a range of prices, and we'll provide a deep dive into the assets across our diverse portfolio. Our strong performance in the first half of the year highlights the strength of our portfolio diversity and our ability to generate free cash flow to support distinctive returns to shareholders.
Our entire ConocoPhillips team is focused on successfully executing the second half of our 2019 plan and sharing our long-term plans with you in November. Now I'll open it up for Q&A."

We did have strong distributions from APLNG, $320 million in the quarter. And in the first quarter, I think it was $73 million. So for the first half, about $400 million. I think previously, maybe it was in the last call, maybe it was the fourth quarter call, I gave guidance of -- to expect APLNG distributions of about $550 million to $600 million for the year. I need to probably bump that up a little bit, but I wouldn't take 2x the $400 million. It won't be quite that high. But I think the new expectation on distributions for 2019, I would say, is going to be in the range of $650 million to $700 million. 
Now I've cautioned folks on this before but I'll just do it again is that these aren't ratable across the quarters. The odd quarters, the first and the third quarter are always going to be low because that's when financing payments and tax payments come up. And then the even quarters, the second and fourth are going to be relatively high. So as you're thinking quarter-to-quarter, you should expect third quarter to be kind of low-ish and fourth quarter to be high-ish. 
With respect to PDVSA, I think that's a very difficult one to give you guidance on for modeling because we don't build that into our cash forecast either. We only recognize the earnings in the cash as we receive it, and I think that's probably the appropriate way to view it considering the situation and the counterparty."

So the Alaska, the -- so we've completed the off-ice appraisals season in Alaska this winter, and the results we've seen at Willow and Narwhal are both very encouraging. So we've really taken the opportunity to extend some of the appraisal from our existing drill sites at Alpine. For example, we've decided to do an extended well test on a horizontal appraisal well that we drilled into the Narwhal trend. The results of that well are very encouraging and we thought let's see if we can get a long-term test and understand the long-term deliverability. So that's part of the increase.
We also can drill and offset injection well to this producer from the same drill site. So we're going to take the opportunity to do that as well and that will give us further information on the Narwhal trend. But it's really driven by encouragement on what we saw in the initial well in the Narwhal, the Putu appraisal we call that. So we're feeling good about that. We're also firming up our plans for 2020 and we're going to have another quite aggressive appraisal and exploration season in 2020. This year, we really focused just on appraisal and so there's some long-lead items to do that. 
So the -- once we get to November, we'll give you some details on exactly what we've concluded from the appraisal program this year, but they -- those are encouraging and that's what's led to trying to accelerate some of this learning. 
Now Lower 48, we're always looking to optimize the value from our unconventional programs, and we've been working specifically this year in more detail on establishing the optimum plateau rate for the -- for our unconventionals. And that has led us to conclude that we should add a rig or 2 over time to the Eagle Ford and we're taking the opportunity to add a seventh rig this year and maybe an eighth rig next year. So that's what's behind that. Of course, we don't expect the seventh rig to contribute any production until next year, but it's all part of this sort of rational approach to establishing the great plateau rate at the unconventional plays."

And let's just say that you see maybe something around $12 billion of CFOs, something in that neighborhood, that's approaching -- that's right around 40% return of cash, return of capital to shareholders in the year. So we're trying to compete with the best capital returners in the business and certainly distinguish ourselves from the other E&P companies out there. 
Now you mentioned the variable dividends, and I'd just say that we're always thinking about the best ways to return capital to shareholders. And so we talk with the investment community to get feedback on their thoughts. We do think our current model of a meaningful common dividend and a significant level of ratable buybacks that really go on indefinitely is a very attractive capital return model. But we're always testing other ideas. And so we'll talk more about this in some depth in November."

The Eagle Ford is on what we would characterize as late-stage growth. Within the next few years, we'll reach plateau there. And this addition of the rig is in service of reaching that and optimum plateau and holding that for the optimum duration. The Permian for is us much earlier in the life cycle. So the -- that has a significant growth ahead of it, and it will be several years before we reach plateau there. But we do still have what we regard as a pretty rigorous approach to this, and it's too difficult to explain on the phone call but it's something that we will elaborate on in November."

And so those get -- that's what drives down the reported ATR. 
So in the quarter, for example, we have -- we had a pretty large tax benefit associated with our U.K. sale. And of course, being a tax benefit, it has no tax on it. So that's a 0 tax rate. We had something similar on the Sunrise disposition. And then you look at the earnings that we get from our equity affiliates.

Good morning, all.I'll cover the second quarter highlights on Slide 4. Starting on the left with our financial performance. We realized adjusted earnings of $1.1 billion in the quarter or $1.01 per share. Our production outperformance in",757,"Thanks, Ellen. Good morning, all.
I'll cover the second quarter highlights on Slide 4. Starting on the left with our financial performance. We realized adjusted earnings of $1.1 billion in the quarter or $1.01 per share. Our production outperformance in the quarter didn't fully translate to the bottom line as sales lagged production with inventories building by roughly 25,000 barrels a day, which represents about $0.03 a share. We generated $3.4 billion of cash from operations, resulting in free cash flow of $1.7 billion in the quarter and $3 billion year-to-date. 
This quarter represents our seventh consecutive quarter of free cash flow generation across a broad range of prices, underscoring our commitment to capital discipline. And importantly, over this 7-quarter time frame, cash from operations has more than covered all capital, dividends and share repurchases. We ended the quarter with $6.9 billion of cash and short-term investments. And our strong financial returns continued. On a trailing 12-month basis, our return on capital employed was 12.4%.
Moving to the middle column. Operationally in the quarter, we produced 1.29 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, up 6% on an underlying per debt adjusted share basis compared with the year-ago quarter. Sequentially, seasonal turnaround impacts were mitigated by growth from the Lower 48 Big 3. 
Touching on the final bullet in the operational column. In the second quarter, we closed several small bolt-on transactions in the Lower 48 Big 3 for about $100 million. We consistently monitor the market for these kinds of low-cost supply additions in and around our core areas, and we were able to complete a few royalty interest and acreage deals this quarter at attractive terms.
Shifting to the far right strategic column. We've increased this year's planned share repurchase program by $500 million to a total of $3.5 billion. In the second quarter, we repurchased $1.25 billion of shares. We expect to purchase $1.5 billion of shares in the second half of the year. Combined with our second quarter dividend, we returned 47% of cash from operations to shareholders in the quarter, so returning capital to shareholders remains a priority.
In the second quarter, we realized $600 million in disposition proceeds, and the U.K. disposition continues to progress toward closing in the second half of the year. We expect to recognize a gain of approximately $2 billion before tax and after tax when the sale closes. Also, at closing, we'll see a significant balance sheet improvement with net cash proceeds expected to be about $2 billion while liabilities associated with asset retirement obligations will decrease by about $2 billion.
If you turn to Slide 5, I'll wrap up with a look at cash flows during the quarter. We began the second quarter with cash and short-term investments of $6.7 billion. Moving to the right, cash from operations was $3.4 billion, which included roughly $320 million in APLNG distributions and about $90 million collected through the ICC settlement agreement with PDVSA. To date, we've received $665 million related to the $2 billion settlement.
I'll also mention that we continued to receive contingent value payments from Cenovus during the quarter. To date, we've received or accrued a little over $180 million in contingency payments from this 2017 transaction. 
Moving on, working capital was a $600 million use of cash during the quarter. We recognized $600 million in proceeds from dispositions, and we had $1.7 billion of capital expenditures in the quarter, which was exactly half of cash from operations excluding working capital, leaving $1.7 billion of free cash flow. For the first half, free cash flow was $3 billion, representing a 9% free cash flow yield on an annualized basis.
Looking to the last 2 bricks on the right. The roughly $350 million in dividends and $1.25 billion of share repurchases represented a return of capital to shareholders of $1.6 billion or 47% of CFO. Total shareholder yield based on planned buybacks and our current dividend is running a little over 7%. And you see the ending cash on the far right with a slight build from the first quarter despite choosing to increase buybacks in the quarter by $500 million compared to recent quarters.
So to briefly recap, this past quarter builds on our trend of consistent, strong operational and financial performance. The quarter reemphasizes our commitment to financial returns, capital discipline, free cash flow generation and returning cash from operations to shareholders. We believe this is a sustainable and compelling value proposition for our industry. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Matt."

I'll provide a brief overview of our year-to-date operational highlights and discuss our outlook for the remainder of the year. So please turn to Slide 7. Across the portfolio, we continue to make progress towards the key milestones we high",1394,"Thanks, Don. I'll provide a brief overview of our year-to-date operational highlights and discuss our outlook for the remainder of the year. So please turn to Slide 7. 
Across the portfolio, we continue to make progress towards the key milestones we highlighted at the end of last year. Starting in Alaska, we wrapped up our winter appraisal season in the Greater Willow Area and Narwhal in the second quarter. During the first half of the year, we drilled 7 successful appraisal wells and conducted a series of horizontal production well, injectivity and interference tests. The results have been encouraging for both Willow and the Narwhal trend. Based on these positive results, we're also taking the opportunity to drill an additional one budgeted horizontal well from an existing outline Drill Site and to the Narwhal trend later this year.
Also in the second quarter, we announced a high-value bolt-on to our Alaska position. We acquired discovered resource acreage called Nuna directly adjacent to our Kuparuk Field and we expect that transaction to close in the third quarter. Finally in June, planned maintenance was completed at Prudhoe Bay, and turnarounds will continue in the third quarter at Prudhoe, the west and north slope in Kuparuk.
Moving to Canada. We safely completed the first turnaround of our Surmont 2 central processing facility, which in addition to the maintenance scope, also paved way for the alternative diluent project. This capability will not only reduce the amount of diluent we'd acquire, but provide diluent flexibility and improve our netbacks. We expect to have it fully operational by the end of the year as planned.
In June, Surmont was brought back online but continues to be subject to mandatory curtailment, impacting planned production by about 5,000 barrels a day for the rest of the year. In Montney, we continue completion activities on the 14-well pad and construction of the associated infrastructure with start-ups still on track for the fourth quarter.
In the Lower 48, Big 3 second quarter production by asset was: Eagle Ford at 221,000 barrels equivalent per day; Bakken at 98,000 and Delaware at 48,000. This represents a 41,000 barrel a day increase from the first quarter to 367,000 due to strong execution performance and improved operational efficiency. We now expect Big 3 production in 2019 to average 360,000 barrels a day, up from our initial expectation of 350,000. This represents a growth rate of about 21% from 2018 to 2019 and an increase of over 60,000 barrels a day for the year.
As Don mentioned, during the quarter, we made several royalty interest and acreage acquisitions across the Big 3. Lastly, we continue to evaluate our results in the Louisiana Austin Chalk play. So far, although we flowed oil from the first 3 wells that produced higher water cuts than we were hoping to see, so the results to date are disappointing. Although the Austin Chalk is the primary target, we're also evaluating opportunities in other formations within the acreage.
Moving over to Europe. As Don said, the U.K. disposition continues to progress towards closing. We also began a planned turnaround in the J-Area that was completed in July. In Norway, we completed the Greater Ekofisk Area turnaround during the second quarter and sanctioned the Tor II field redevelopment project. This is a subsea production system tied back to Ekofisk that we expect to come on at the end of 2020. In the third quarter, there'll be more turnaround activity in Norway at our partner-operated assets.
In Qatar, we remain very interested in participating in the North Field expansion project.  
Moving to Malaysia. Production ramp-up at KBB continued [ from flow-through ]. The Sabah-Sarawak gas pipeline recommenced, but we don't expect full ramp-up and production to be achieved until late in the year. Also in the quarter, KBB began delivering gas to a third-party floating LNG facility. This will serve as a supplementary offtake to help mitigate potential production disruptions through the pipeline.
Finally, in Indonesia, the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources announced earlier this month that ConocoPhillips has been awarded a 20-year extension of our participation in the Corridor Block beyond the current contract expiring in December of 2023.
So another quarter of strong execution as well as significant progress across the portfolio. So now let me discuss the outlook for the remainder of the year on Slide 8. As we progress through 2019, we're continuing our disciplined capital approach, and we're also making decisions to optimize the value of our high-margin assets. We're adjusting our full year operating planned capital guidance from $6.1 billion to $6.3 billion, excluding acquisitions, for 2 unbudgeted activities. 
In Alaska, we'll spend about half of the incremental capital to conduct additional scope in our appraisal program, including a long-term test of the Putu horizontal appraisal well and the additional Narwhal appraisal well I mentioned earlier as well as additional long-lead items for the 2020 exploration and appraisal season.
In the Eagle Ford, we've just added a rig in order to optimize rig count as we ramp towards the plateau phase of our development plans over the next few years, and we'll describe the basis of this optimization in more detail in November. Incremental rate associated with this rig won't show up until 2020.
Our 2019 operating capital guidance excludes acquisitions. To date, we've closed or announced about $300 million of transactions, including the Lower 48 and Nuna deals we've already mentioned and a low-cost entry into the Vaca Muerta shale play in Argentina. These all represent opportunistic low cost of supply additions to our resource base.
On the production side, we expect the third quarter to average between 1.29 million and 1.33 million barrels equivalent per day. You'll notice on the right side of this chart that we're narrowing the range on our full year outlook because half the year is behind us now, but maintaining the midpoint in our previous guidance of 1.325 million barrels a day. Now this might look conservative considering our very strong first half performance. However, at this time, we're not adjusting our full year midpoint guidance for 2 reasons: the first is because we accelerate production versus our plan from the second half of the year into the first half of the year, especially in the second quarter and especially in the Lower 48 Big 3. And finally, as I said earlier, we expect the Big 3 overall growth rate to be higher than planned for 2019. We expect production levels for the remainder of the year to be flat to mostly growing -- to modestly growing rather from the increased rate we saw in the second quarter.
The second factor is lower-than-expected performance in 2 areas: Surmont due to the mandated curtailments that we now expect to continue through the year; and Alaska where 1 of the 4 production wells of the GMT1 project is performing below expectations. The increased production from the Lower 48 Big 3 in the first half of the year essentially offsets these factors through the year. That's another great example of the value of diversification in our portfolio. 
We have a busy second half of the year with several turnarounds and the ramp-up of KBB production, so we don't think it's prudent to change full year guidance at this time. But to be clear, the original $6.1 billion operating plan capital is still delivering our planned 5% underlying production growth. And with our planned buybacks, we expect to deliver 8% per debt adjusted share growth. Also bear in mind that we are carrying the U.K. in all of these numbers. We'll update production and other relevant guidance items at the close of the U.K. disposition.
Finally, we're looking forward to our analyst and investor meeting in November 19 in Houston. We'll show a decade-long disciplined capital plan that delivers free cash flow and strong shareholder returns across a range of prices, and we'll provide a deep dive into the assets across our diverse portfolio. Our strong performance in the first half of the year highlights the strength of our portfolio diversity and our ability to generate free cash flow to support distinctive returns to shareholders.
Our entire ConocoPhillips team is focused on successfully executing the second half of our 2019 plan and sharing our long-term plans with you in November. Now I'll open it up for Q&A."

But I think the new expectation on distributions for 2019, I would say, is going to be in the range of $650 million to $700 million. 
Now I've cautioned folks on this before but I'll just do it again is that these aren't ratable across the quarters. The odd quarters, the first and the third quarter are always going to be low because that's when financing payments and tax payments come up. And then the even quarters, the second and fourth are going to be relatively high. So as you're thinking quarter-to-quarter, you should expect third quarter to be kind of low-ish and fourth quarter to be high-ish. 
With respect to PDVSA, I think that's a very difficult one to give you guidance on for modeling because we don't build that into our cash forecast either. We only recognize the earnings and the cash as we receive it, and I think that's probably the appropriate way to view it considering the situation and the counterparty."

So the Alaska, the -- so we've completed the off-ice appraisal season in Alaska this winter, and the results we've seen at Willow and Narwhal are both very encouraging. So we've really taken the opportunity to extend some of the appraisal from our existing drill sites at Alpine. For example, we've decided to do an extended well test on a horizontal appraisal well that we drilled into the Narwhal trend. The results of that well were very encouraging and we thought let's see if we can get a long-term test and understand the long-term deliverability. So that's part of the increase.
We also can drill and offset injection well to this producer from the same drill site. So we're going to take the opportunity to do that as well and that will give us further information on the Narwhal trend. But it's really driven by encouragement on what we saw in the initial well in the Narwhal, the Putu appraisal we call that. So we're feeling good about that. We're also firming up our plans for 2020 and we're going to have another quite aggressive appraisal and exploration season in 2020. This year, we really focused just on appraisal and so there's some long-lead items to do that. 
So the -- once we get to November, we'll give you some details on exactly what we've concluded from the appraisal program this year, but they -- was encouraging and that's what's led to trying to accelerate some of this learning. 
Now Lower 48, we're always looking to optimize the value from our unconventional programs, and we've been working specifically this year in more detail on establishing the optimum plateau rate for the -- for our unconventionals. And that has led us to conclude that we should add a rig or 2 over time to the Eagle Ford and we're taking the opportunity to add a seventh rig this year and maybe an eighth rig next year. So that's what's behind that. Of course, we don't expect the seventh rig to contribute any production until next year, but it's all part of this sort of rational approach to establishing the great plateau rate at the unconventional plays."

So we're trying to compete with the best capital returners in the business and certainly distinguish ourselves from the other E&P companies out there. 
Now you mentioned the variable dividends, and I'd just say that we're always thinking about the best ways to return capital to shareholders. And so we talk with the investment community to get feedback on their thoughts. We do think our current model of a meaningful common dividend and a significant level of ratable buybacks that really go on indefinitely is a very attractive capital return model.

The Eagle Ford is what we would characterize as late-stage growth. Within the next few years, we'll reach plateau there. And this addition of the rig is in service of reaching that optimum plateau and holding that for the optimum duration. The Permian for us is much earlier than the life cycle. So the -- that has a significant growth ahead of it, and it will be several years before we reach plateau there.

The chalk hasn't dewatered to the extent that this requires to get high enough production rates. I mean unconventional wells produce high water cuts in other plays. I mean the Delaware Basin, for example. So that by itself is not a disqualifier. But here, the water cut that we've seen is being -- it's been a bit over 90%. The oil rates have been about 100 barrels a day. It's just unlikely to be enough to justify a development in that part of the play.

It's around about the time that we had talked with you all about when you were up in Alaska last year. 
At Nuna, I'll just provide a little bit of color on that. It's a discovered resource on 21,000 acres that's in our backyard. It's immediately adjacent to Kuparuk. It's a very low cost of supply in the low 30s. It's $100 million that -- for 100 million barrels. It's something we're very pleased about. It will be developed from pads both that exist at Kuparuk and a pad at Nuna where there's already gravel and a road to that pad in place. The remaining facilities at Nuna can be built in a single ice road season. So we'll have appraisal over the next couple of years and target first oil in the 2022 time frame. The development will be using existing drilling and completion technology and then the development itself will be incorporated as part of our Kuparuk program so it won't be incremental to that.

We generated $3.4 billion of cash from operations, resulting in free cash flow of $1.7 billion in the quarter and $3 billion year-to-date. 
This quarter represents our seventh consecutive quarter of free cash flow generation across a broad range of prices, underscoring our commitment to capital discipline. And importantly, over this 7-quarter time frame, cash from operations has more than covered all capital, dividends and share repurchases. We ended the quarter with $6.9 billion of cash and short-term investments. And our strong financial returns continued. On a trailing 12-month basis, our return on capital employed was 12.4%.
Moving to the middle column. Operationally in the quarter, we produced 1.29 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, up 6% on an underlying per debt adjusted share basis compared with the year-ago quarter. Sequentially, seasonal turnaround impacts were mitigated by growth from the Lower 48 Big 3. 
Touching on the final bullet in the operational column. In the second quarter, we closed several small bolt-on transactions in the Lower 48 Big 3 for about $100 million. We consistently monitor the market for these kinds of low-cost supply additions in and around our core areas, and we were able to complete a few royalty interest and acreage deals this quarter at attractive terms.
Shifting to the far-right strategic column. We've increased this year's planned share repurchase program by $500 million to a total of $3.5 billion. In the second quarter, we repurchased $1.25 billion of shares. We expect to purchase $1.5 billion of shares in the second half of the year. Combined with our second quarter dividend, we returned 47% of cash from operations to shareholders in the quarter, so returning capital to shareholders remains a priority.
In the second quarter, we realized $600 million in disposition proceeds, and the U.K. disposition continues to progress toward closing in the second half of the year. We expect to recognize a gain of approximately $2 billion before tax and after tax when the sale closes. Also, at closing, we'll see a significant balance sheet improvement with net cash proceeds expected to be about $2 billion while liabilities associated with asset retirement obligations will decrease by about $2 billion.
If you turn to Slide 5, I'll wrap up with a look at cash flows during the quarter. We began the second quarter with cash and short-term investments of $6.7 billion. Moving to the right, cash from operations was $3.4 billion, which included roughly $320 million in APLNG distributions and about $90 million collected through the ICC settlement agreement with PDVSA. To date, we've received $665 million related to the $2 billion settlement.
I'll also mention that we continued to receive contingent value payments from Cenovus during the quarter. To date, we've received or accrued a little over $180 million in contingency payments from this 2017 transaction. 
Moving on, working capital was a $600 million use of cash during the quarter. We recognized $600 million in proceeds from dispositions, and we had $1.7 billion of capital expenditures in the quarter, which was exactly half of cash from operations excluding working capital, leaving $1.7 billion of free cash flow. For the first half, free cash flow was $3 billion, representing a 9% free cash flow yield on an annualized basis.
Looking to the last 2 bricks on the right. The roughly $350 million in dividends and $1.25 billion of share repurchases represented a return of capital to shareholders of $1.6 billion or 47% of CFO. Total shareholder yield based on planned buybacks and our current dividend is running a little over 7%. And you see the ending cash on the far right with a slight build from the first quarter despite choosing to increase buybacks in the quarter by $500 million compared to recent quarters.
So to briefly recap, this past quarter builds on our trend of consistent, strong operational and financial performance. The quarter reemphasizes our commitment to financial returns, capital discipline, free cash flow generation and returning cash from operations to shareholders. We believe this is a sustainable and compelling value proposition for our industry. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Matt."

I'll provide a brief overview of our year-to-date operational highlights and discuss our outlook for the remainder of the year. So please turn to Slide 7. Across the portfolio, we continue to make progress towards the key milestones we high",1394,"Thanks, Don. I'll provide a brief overview of our year-to-date operational highlights and discuss our outlook for the remainder of the year. So please turn to Slide 7. 
Across the portfolio, we continue to make progress towards the key milestones we highlighted at the end of last year. Starting in Alaska, we wrapped up our winter appraisal season in the Greater Willow Area and Narwhal in the second quarter. During the first half of the year, we drilled 7 successful appraisal wells and conducted a series of horizontal production well, injectivity and interference tests. The results have been encouraging for both Willow and the Narwhal trend. Based on these positive results, we're also taking the opportunity to drill an additional one budgeted horizontal well from an existing outline Drill Site and to the Narwhal trend later this year.
Also in the second quarter, we announced a high-value bolt-on to our Alaska position. We acquired discovered resource acreage called Nuna directly adjacent to our Kuparuk Field and we expect that transaction to close in the third quarter. Finally in June, planned maintenance was completed at Prudhoe Bay, and turnarounds will continue in the third quarter at Prudhoe, the west and north slope in Kuparuk.
Moving to Canada. We safely completed the first turnaround of our Surmont 2 central processing facility, which in addition to the maintenance scope, also paved way for the alternative diluent project. This capability will not only reduce the amount of diluent we'd acquire, but provide diluent flexibility and improve our netbacks. We expect to have it fully operational by the end of the year as planned.
In June, Surmont was brought back online but continues to be subject to mandatory curtailment, impacting planned production by about 5,000 barrels a day for the rest of the year. In Montney, we continue completion activities on the 14-well pad and construction of the associated infrastructure with start-ups still on track for the fourth quarter.
In the Lower 48, Big 3 second quarter production by asset was: Eagle Ford at 221,000 barrels equivalent per day; Bakken at 98,000 and Delaware at 48,000. This represents a 41,000 barrel a day increase from the first quarter to 367,000 due to strong execution performance and improved operational efficiency. We now expect Big 3 production in 2019 to average 360,000 barrels a day, up from our initial expectation of 350,000. This represents a growth rate of about 21% from 2018 to 2019 and an increase of over 60,000 barrels a day for the year.
As Don mentioned, during the quarter, we made several royalty interest and acreage acquisitions across the Big 3. Lastly, we continue to evaluate our results in the Louisiana Austin Chalk play. So far, although we flowed oil from the first 3 wells that produced higher water cuts than we were hoping to see, so the results to date are disappointing. Although the Austin Chalk is the primary target, we're also evaluating opportunities in other formations within the acreage.
Moving over to Europe. As Don said, the U.K. disposition continues to progress towards closing. We also began a planned turnaround in the J-Area that was completed in July. In Norway, we completed the Greater Ekofisk Area turnaround during the second quarter and sanctioned the Tor II field redevelopment project. This is a subsea production system tied back to Ekofisk that we expect to come on at the end of 2020. In the third quarter, there'll be more turnaround activity in Norway at our partner-operated assets.
In Qatar, we remain very interested in participating in the North Field expansion project.  
Moving to Malaysia. Production ramp-up at KBB continued [ from flow-through ]. The Sabah-Sarawak gas pipeline recommenced, but we don't expect full ramp-up and production to be achieved until late in the year. Also in the quarter, KBB began delivering gas to a third-party floating LNG facility. This will serve as a supplementary offtake to help mitigate potential production disruptions through the pipeline.
Finally, in Indonesia, the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources announced earlier this month that ConocoPhillips has been awarded a 20-year extension of our participation in the Corridor Block beyond the current contract expiring in December of 2023.
So another quarter of strong execution as well as significant progress across the portfolio. So now let me discuss the outlook for the remainder of the year on Slide 8. As we progress through 2019, we're continuing our disciplined capital approach, and we're also making decisions to optimize the value of our high-margin assets. We're adjusting our full year operating planned capital guidance from $6.1 billion to $6.3 billion, excluding acquisitions, for 2 unbudgeted activities. 
In Alaska, we'll spend about half of the incremental capital to conduct additional scope in our appraisal program, including a long-term test of the Putu horizontal appraisal well and the additional Narwhal appraisal well I mentioned earlier as well as additional long-lead items for the 2020 exploration and appraisal season.
In the Eagle Ford, we've just added a rig in order to optimize rig count as we ramp towards the plateau phase of our development plans over the next few years, and we'll describe the basis of this optimization in more detail in November. Incremental rate associated with this rig won't show up until 2020.
Our 2019 operating capital guidance excludes acquisitions. To date, we've closed or announced about $300 million of transactions, including the Lower 48 and Nuna deals we've already mentioned and a low-cost entry into the Vaca Muerta shale play in Argentina. These all represent opportunistic low cost of supply additions to our resource base.
On the production side, we expect the third quarter to average between 1.29 million and 1.33 million barrels equivalent per day. You'll notice on the right side of this chart that we're narrowing the range on our full year outlook because half the year is behind us now, but maintaining the midpoint in our previous guidance of 1.325 million barrels a day. Now this might look conservative considering our very strong first half performance. However, at this time, we're not adjusting our full year midpoint guidance for 2 reasons: the first is because we accelerate production versus our plan from the second half of the year into the first half of the year, especially in the second quarter and especially in the Lower 48 Big 3. And finally, as I said earlier, we expect the Big 3 overall growth rate to be higher than planned for 2019. We expect production levels for the remainder of the year to be flat to mostly growing -- to modestly growing rather from the increased rate we saw in the second quarter.
The second factor is lower-than-expected performance in 2 areas: Surmont due to the mandated curtailments that we now expect to continue through the year; and Alaska where 1 of the 4 production wells of the GMT1 project is performing below expectations. The increased production from the Lower 48 Big 3 in the first half of the year essentially offsets these factors through the year. That's another great example of the value of diversification in our portfolio. 
We have a busy second half of the year with several turnarounds and the ramp-up of KBB production, so we don't think it's prudent to change full year guidance at this time. But to be clear, the original $6.1 billion operating plan capital is still delivering our planned 5% underlying production growth. And with our planned buybacks, we expect to deliver 8% per debt adjusted share growth. Also bear in mind that we are carrying the U.K. in all of these numbers. We'll update production and other relevant guidance items at the close of the U.K. disposition.
Finally, we're looking forward to our analyst and investor meeting in November 19 in Houston. We'll show a decade-long disciplined capital plan that delivers free cash flow and strong shareholder returns across a range of prices, and we'll provide a deep dive into the assets across our diverse portfolio. Our strong performance in the first half of the year highlights the strength of our portfolio diversity and our ability to generate free cash flow to support distinctive returns to shareholders.
Our entire ConocoPhillips team is focused on successfully executing the second half of our 2019 plan and sharing our long-term plans with you in November. Now I'll open it up for Q&A."

We did have strong distributions from APLNG, $320 million in the quarter. And in the first quarter, I think it was $73 million. So for the first half, about $400 million. I think previously, maybe it was in the last call, maybe it was the fourth quarter call, I gave guidance of -- to expect APLNG distributions of about $550 million to $600 million for the year. I need to probably bump that up a little bit, but I wouldn't take 2x the $400 million. It won't be quite that high. But I think the new expectation on distributions for 2019, I would say, is going to be in the range of $650 million to $700 million. 
Now I've cautioned folks on this before but I'll just do it again is that these aren't ratable across the quarters. The odd quarters, the first and the third quarter are always going to be low because that's when financing payments and tax payments come up. And then the even quarters, the second and fourth are going to be relatively high. So as you're thinking quarter-to-quarter, you should expect third quarter to be kind of low-ish and fourth quarter to be high-ish. 
With respect to PDVSA, I think that's a very difficult one to give you guidance on for modeling because we don't build that into our cash forecast either. We only recognize the earnings and the cash as we receive it, and I think that's probably the appropriate way to view it considering the situation and the counterparty."

So the Alaska, the -- so we've completed the off-ice appraisal season in Alaska this winter, and the results we've seen at Willow and Narwhal are both very encouraging. So we've really taken the opportunity to extend some of the appraisal from our existing drill sites at Alpine. For example, we've decided to do an extended well test on a horizontal appraisal well that we drilled into the Narwhal trend. The results of that well were very encouraging and we thought let's see if we can get a long-term test and understand the long-term deliverability. So that's part of the increase.
We also can drill and offset injection well to this producer from the same drill site. So we're going to take the opportunity to do that as well and that will give us further information on the Narwhal trend. But it's really driven by encouragement on what we saw in the initial well in the Narwhal, the Putu appraisal we call that. So we're feeling good about that. We're also firming up our plans for 2020 and we're going to have another quite aggressive appraisal and exploration season in 2020. This year, we really focused just on appraisal and so there's some long-lead items to do that. 
So the -- once we get to November, we'll give you some details on exactly what we've concluded from the appraisal program this year, but they -- was encouraging and that's what's led to trying to accelerate some of this learning. 
Now Lower 48, we're always looking to optimize the value from our unconventional programs, and we've been working specifically this year in more detail on establishing the optimum plateau rate for the -- for our unconventionals. And that has led us to conclude that we should add a rig or 2 over time to the Eagle Ford and we're taking the opportunity to add a seventh rig this year and maybe an eighth rig next year. So that's what's behind that. Of course, we don't expect the seventh rig to contribute any production until next year, but it's all part of this sort of rational approach to establishing the great plateau rate at the unconventional plays."

So we're trying to compete with the best capital returners in the business and certainly distinguish ourselves from the other E&P companies out there. 
Now you mentioned the variable dividends, and I'd just say that we're always thinking about the best ways to return capital to shareholders. And so we talk with the investment community to get feedback on their thoughts. We do think our current model of a meaningful common dividend and a significant level of ratable buybacks that really go on indefinitely is a very attractive capital return model. But we're always testing other ideas. And so we'll talk more about this in some depth in November."

The Eagle Ford is what we would characterize as late-stage growth. Within the next few years, we'll reach plateau there. And this addition of the rig is in service of reaching that optimum plateau and holding that for the optimum duration. The Permian for us is much earlier than the life cycle. So the -- that has a significant growth ahead of it, and it will be several years before we reach plateau there.

As far as the bump-up in the second quarter by $500 million, well, we knew we wanted to increase the buybacks for the year to $3.5 billion and we certainly have the cash on hand to be able to do that. And of course, we noticed a pretty significant dislocation in our share price, Brent price correlation or at least the historical correlation and we felt like that was selling at a large discount to our intrinsic value. We felt that, that was a good opportunity and why not just go ahead and spend that increment during the second quarter?

It's a very low cost of supply in the low 30s. It's $100 million that -- for 100 million barrels. It's something we're very pleased about. It will be developed from pads both that exist at Kuparuk and a pad at Nuna where there's already gravel and a road to that pad in place.

So the difference between those 2 are going to be the special items where we either pay no tax on those items or we're paying very low tax. And so those get -- that's what drives down the reported ATR. 
So in the quarter, for example, we had a pretty large tax benefit associated with our U.K. sale. And of course, being a tax benefit, it has no tax on it. So that's a 0 tax rate. We had something similar on the Sunrise disposition. And then you look at the earnings that we get from our equity affiliates. Now the taxes on equity affiliates are paid at the equity affiliate level so that it won't get reported in our corporate level, so those earnings are effectively 0 from an effective tax rate standpoint.

Starting on the left, with our financial performance. We realized adjusted earnings of $0.9 billion or $0.82 a share. Higher LNG realizations and higher production",559,"Thanks, Ellen, and good morning, all.
I'll begin with third quarter highlights on Slide 4. Starting on the left, with our financial performance. We realized adjusted earnings of $0.9 billion or $0.82 a share. Higher LNG realizations and higher production volumes combined with lower overall cost to mitigate the impacts of reduced market prices. Cash from operations was $2.6 billion resulting in free cash flow of $1 billion in the quarter and $4 billion year-to-date. We ended the quarter with $8.4 billion of cash and short-term investments. And our strong financial returns continued with the return on capital employed at just under 11% on a trailing 12-month basis. 
Moving to the middle column, operationally in the quarter, we produced 1.32 million barrels of oil equivalent a day, up 7% on an underlying basis compared with the year-ago quarter and up 12% on a per share basis. Matt will cover the rest of the operations highlights in a moment. 
On the strategic side, earlier this month, we announced the 38% increase to our quarterly dividend, which reflects the company's improved underlying financial strength as well as our commitment to peer leading capital returns to shareholders. In addition, we repurchased $750 million of shares in the quarter and announced our plan to buy back $3 billion of shares in 2020.
In both the third quarter and year-to-date, we've returned over 40% of CFO to our shareholders. We closed the sale of our E&P assets in the U.K. in September, which generated $2.2 billion in proceeds. And as recently announced, we entered into definitive agreements for the sale of our Australia-West business. 
If you turn to Slide 5, I'll wrap up with a look at our cash flows for the quarter. We began the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $6.9 billion. Moving to the right, cash from operations was $2.6 billion. There were a couple of items impacting cash from operations in the quarter that are noted here. 
First, in conjunction with the U.K. sale, we made a one-time top up contribution to the pension plan such that it is now fully funded and essentially self-sufficient. That $320 million can be viewed as an acceleration of future pension contributions. 
And second, as we do each quarter, we note the cash received during the quarter associated with the PDVSA settlement. To date, we received over $750 million related to the $2 billion settlement agreement reached in the third quarter of last year.
Working capital was at $300 million use of cash. And as mentioned, we recognized $2.2 billion in proceeds from closing of the U.K. disposition. Capital spending was $1.7 billion resulting in free cash flow of $1 billion in the quarter.
And we distributed $1.1 billion or 41% of CFO to shareholders during the quarter through dividends and share buybacks, ending the quarter with a cash balance of $8.4 billion. 
So as you can see, this past quarter once again continued our trend of consistent, strong operational and financial performance. It also demonstrates our unwavering commitment to financial returns, capital discipline, free cash flow generation and returning capital to shareholders. We firmly believe that ours is a sustainable, distinctive and compelling value proposition, one that is highly competitive not only within then the energy sector but also across the broader market. With that, I'll turn the call over to Matt."

I'll provide a brief overview of our year-to-date operational highlights and discuss our outlook for the remainder of the year. Please turn to Slide 7.
Across the portfolio, we continue to advance the operational milestones we highlighted at the end of last year. Starting in Alaska. We safely completed our third quarter turnarounds of the Western North Slope and Kuparuk and closed the discovered resource acquisition. We also continued to progress appraisal of our Willow and Narwhal discoveries. Earlier this month, we spud another horizontal well from an existing drill site into the Narwhal [indiscernible]. The well was designed to provide offset injection to the horizontal producer we drilled earlier in the year and help us optimize future development planning. We're also the gearing up for the winter exploration and appraisal and project execution season.
Moving to Canada, we completed commissioning of our Montney gas plant this quarter. Due to delays in the third-party pipeline, we now expect that project to be online in early 2020.
At Surmont, our payment of project is on track for start up in the fourth quarter, as planned. In fact, we're actively transitioning to be start condensate blending for drillbit beginning on November 1.
This capability will not only reduce the amount of diluent we've acquired but also provide land flexibility and consistently improve our netbacks. 
In the Lower 48, Big 3 third quarter production by asset was: Eagle Ford at 226,000 barrels equivalent per day; Bakken at 102,000; and Delaware at 51,000, for a total of 379,000. As we indicated last quarter, we expect Big 3 production to remain relatively flat for the remainder of the year, and we're on target to achieve a full year growth rate of about 21%.
Lastly, in the Lower 48, we now have 3 vintage 5 multi-well pilot pads online in the Eagle Ford, and you'll hear more about that in a few weeks. 
Moving over to Europe. The U.K. disposition closed and we successfully transitioned operatorship. In Norway, partner operator turnarounds were safely completed in the third quarter. In Qatar, we've been invited to submit a bid for the North field expansion project.
And in Malaysia, production ramp up at KBB continued through the quarter, and we expect to reach full throughput by year-end. In addition, phase 2 came online in August. And finally, in Australia, we announced the divestiture of our Australia-West assets for $1.4 billion, which we expect to close in the first quarter of 2020. Meanwhile, we continue to progress Petrozuata and remain on schedule for FID by early next year.
So we've had another strong quarter of execution as well as significant progress across the portfolio. Now I'll discuss the outlook for the remainder of the year on Slide 8. As we enter the last quarter of 2019, we're continuing our focus on execution while maintaining capital discipline. Our full year operating planned capital guidance remains unchanged at $6.3 billion, excluding about $300 million of opportunistic, low cost of supply resource additions that we discussed last quarter. On the production side, full year guidance also remains unchanged, except for updating for the close of our U.K. asset divestiture. With that in mind, we now expect the fourth quarter to average between 1.265 million and 1.305 million barrels equivalent per day, with the full year guidance between 1.3 million and 1.31 million barrels a per day. 
So we remain on track to deliver 5% underlying full year production growth, and combined with our buyback program, that results in 10% production growth per share. 
Finally, we're looking forward to our analyst and investor meeting in November 19 in Houston. We'll show a decade-long disciplined plan that delivers free cash flow and strong returns. And of course, we'll provide a deep dive into the assets across our diverse portfolio. Our continued strong performance highlights the strength of our portfolio divest the and our ability to generate free cash flow to support distinctive returns to shareholders. Our entire ConocoPhillips team is focused on successfully executing the remainder of our 2019 plan, and we look forward to sharing our longer-term plans with you in November.
Now we will open up for questions on the quarter."

On working capital, we had a $300 million use in the quarter and there we saw an increase in accounts receivable due to some sales timings on liftings in Norway and Malaysia both, and a decrease in the accounts payable of about the same -- about $150 million and that's just normal payment timing.

In fact, in the third quarter, I think our production operation costs and SG&A were down about 6% or so from the previous quarter. I wouldn't read a whole lot of that into that. Some of it was we had a bit higher cost in the second quarter because of the turnaround activity and we had I think a settlement of litigation thing that we settled. So we see operating costs remain essentially flat for this year. And so we're not adjusting the full year product, production operating costs guidance at this time and we can talk about how we see that outlook going forward next month, but we continue to be aggressive on trying to keep very efficient operating structure."

Starting on the left, with our financial performance. We realized adjusted earnings of $0.9 billion or $0.82 a share. Higher LNG realizations and higher production",559,"Thanks, Ellen, and good morning, all.
I'll begin with third quarter highlights on Slide 4. Starting on the left, with our financial performance. We realized adjusted earnings of $0.9 billion or $0.82 a share. Higher LNG realizations and higher production volumes combined with lower overall cost to mitigate the impacts of reduced market prices. Cash from operations was $2.6 billion, resulting in free cash flow of $1 billion in the quarter and $4 billion year-to-date. We ended the quarter with $8.4 billion of cash and short-term investments. And our strong financial returns continued with the return on capital employed at just under 11% on a trailing 12-month basis. 
Moving to the middle column. Operationally in the quarter, we produced 1.32 million barrels of oil equivalent a day, up 7% on an underlying basis compared with the year-ago quarter and up 12% on a per share basis. Matt will cover the rest of the operations highlights in a moment. 
On the strategic side. Earlier this month, we announced a 38% increase to our quarterly dividend, which reflects the company's improved underlying financial strength as well as our commitment to peer leading capital returns to shareholders. In addition, we repurchased $750 million of shares in the quarter and announced our plan to buy back $3 billion of shares in 2020.
In both the third quarter and year-to-date, we've returned over 40% of CFO to our shareholders. We closed the sale of our E&P assets in the U.K. in September, which generated $2.2 billion in proceeds. And as recently announced, we entered into definitive agreements for the sale of our Australia-West business. 
If you turn to Slide 5, I'll wrap up with a look at our cash flows for the quarter. We began the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $6.9 billion. Moving to the right, cash from operations was $2.6 billion. There were a couple of items impacting cash from operations in the quarter that are noted here. 
First, in conjunction with the U.K. sale, we made a one-time top up contribution to the pension plan such that it is now fully funded and essentially self-sufficient. That $320 million can be viewed as an acceleration of future pension contributions. 
And second, as we do each quarter, we note the cash received during the quarter associated with the PDVSA settlement. To date, we received over $750 million related to the $2 billion settlement agreement reached in the third quarter of last year.
Working capital was at $300 million use of cash. And as mentioned, we recognized $2.2 billion in proceeds from closing of the U.K. disposition. Capital spending was $1.7 billion, resulting in free cash flow of $1 billion in the quarter.
And we distributed $1.1 billion or 41% of CFO to shareholders during the quarter through dividends and share buybacks, ending the quarter with a cash balance of $8.4 billion. 
So as you can see, this past quarter once again continued our trend of consistent, strong operational and financial performance. It also demonstrates our unwavering commitment to financial returns, capital discipline, free cash flow generation and returning capital to shareholders. We firmly believe that ours is a sustainable, distinctive and compelling value proposition, one that is highly competitive not only within then the energy sector but also across the broader market. With that, I'll turn the call over to Matt."

I'll provide a brief overview of our year-to-date operational highlights and discuss our outlook for the remainder of the year. Please turn to Slide 7.Across the portfolio, we continue to advance the operational milestones we highlighted at",699,"Thanks, Don. I'll provide a brief overview of our year-to-date operational highlights and discuss our outlook for the remainder of the year. Please turn to Slide 7.
Across the portfolio, we continue to advance the operational milestones we highlighted at the end of last year. Starting in Alaska. We safely completed our third quarter turnarounds of Prudhoe, the Western North Slope and Kuparuk and closed the Nuna discovered resource acquisition. We also continued to progress appraisal of our Willow and Narwhal discoveries. Earlier this month, we spud another horizontal well from an existing outline drill site into the Narwhal trend. The well was designed to provide offset injection to the horizontal producer we drilled earlier in the year and help us optimize future development planning. We're also gearing up for the winter exploration, appraisal and project execution season.
Moving to Canada. We completed commissioning of our Montney gas plant this quarter. Due to delays in the third-party pipeline, we now expect that project to be online in early 2020.
At Surmont, our alternative diluent is on track for start up in the fourth quarter, as planned. In fact, we're actively transitioning to be -- start condensate blending for drillbit sales beginning on November 1.
This capability will not only reduce the amount of diluent we've acquired but also provide blend flexibility and consistently improve our netbacks. 
In the Lower 48, Big 3 third quarter production by asset was: Eagle Ford at 226,000 barrels equivalent per day; Bakken at 102,000; and Delaware at 51,000, for a total of 379,000. As we indicated last quarter, we expect Big 3 production to remain relatively flat for the remainder of the year, and we're on target to achieve a full year growth rate of about 21%.
Lastly, in the Lower 48, we now have 3 vintage 5 multi-well pilot pads online in Eagle Ford, and you'll hear more about that in a few weeks. 
Moving over to Europe. The U.K. disposition closed and we successfully transitioned operatorship. In Norway, partner-operated turnarounds were safely completed in the third quarter. In Qatar, we've been invited to submit a bid for the North Field expansion project.
And in Malaysia, production ramp up at KBB continued through the quarter, and we expect to reach full throughput by year-end. In addition, Gumusut Phase 2 came online in August. And finally, in Australia, we announced the divestiture of our Australia-West assets for $1.4 billion, which we expect to close in the first quarter of 2020. Meanwhile, we continue to progress Barossa and remain on schedule for FID by early next year.
So we've had another strong quarter of execution as well as significant progress across the portfolio. Now I'll discuss the outlook for the remainder of the year on Slide 8. As we enter the last quarter of 2019, we're continuing our focus on execution while maintaining capital discipline. Our full year operating planned capital guidance remains unchanged at $6.3 billion, excluding about $300 million of opportunistic, low cost of supply resource additions that we discussed last quarter. On the production side, full year guidance also remains unchanged, except for updating for the close of our U.K. asset divestiture. With that in mind, we now expect the fourth quarter to average between 1.265 million and 1.305 million barrels equivalent per day, with the full year guidance between 1.3 million and 1.31 million barrels a day. 
So we remain on track to deliver 5% underlying full year production growth, and combined with our buyback program, that results in 10% production growth per share. 
Finally, we're looking forward to our analyst and investor meeting in November 19 in Houston. We'll show a decade-long disciplined plan that delivers free cash flow and strong returns. And of course, we'll provide a deep dive into the assets across our diverse portfolio. Our continued strong performance highlights the strength of our portfolio diversity and our ability to generate free cash flow to support distinctive returns to shareholders. Our entire ConocoPhillips team is focused on successfully executing the remainder of our 2019 plan, and we look forward to sharing our longer-term plans with you in November.
Now we will open up for questions on the quarter."

We had 60 million distributed in the third quarter. I would expect that number to grow to about $300 million in the fourth quarter. So still pretty consistent with what I guided to last time, which I think was $750 million for the year on APLNG. 
On working capital, we had a $300 million use in the quarter. And there, we saw an increase in accounts receivable due to some sales timings on liftings in Norway and Malaysia both, and a decrease in the accounts payable of about the same, about $150 million. And that's just normal payment timing. So there's really not a lot going on there. I wouldn't suggest that we're -- we have a trend line that we're following."

It could add significant incremental production and revenue to the state. And so we believe that continuing those investments is good for employment. It's good for the Alaskan economy, and it's good for the Alaskan citizens. And so that's for both now and over the long term.

I'll begin with third quarter highlights on Slide 4. Starting on the left, with our financial performance. We realized adjusted earnings of $0.9 billion or $0.82 a share. Higher LNG realizations and higher production volumes combined with lower overall cost to mitigate the impacts of reduced market prices. Cash from operations was $2.6 billion, resulting in free cash flow of $1 billion in the quarter and $4 billion year-to-date. We ended the quarter with $8.4 billion of cash and short-term investments. And our strong financial returns continued with the return on capital employed at just under 11% on a trailing 12-month basis. 
Moving to the middle column. Operationally in the quarter, we produced 1.32 million barrels of oil equivalent a day, up 7% on an underlying basis compared with the year-ago quarter and up 12% on a per share basis. Matt will cover the rest of the operations highlights in a moment. 
On the strategic side, earlier this month, we announced a 38% increase to our quarterly dividend, which reflects the company's improved underlying financial strength as well as our commitment to peer leading capital returns to shareholders. In addition, we repurchased $750 million of shares in the quarter and announced our plan to buy back $3 billion of shares in 2020.
In both the third quarter and year-to-date, we've returned over 40% of CFO to our shareholders. We closed the sale of our E&P assets in the U.K. in September, which generated $2.2 billion in proceeds. And, as recently announced, we entered into definitive agreements for the sale of our Australia-West business. 
If you turn to Slide 5, I'll wrap up with a look at our cash flows for the quarter. We began the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $6.9 billion. Moving to the right, cash from operations was $2.6 billion. There were a couple of items impacting cash from operations in the quarter that are noted here. 
First, in conjunction with the U.K. sale, we made a one-time top up contribution to the pension plan such that it is now fully funded and essentially self-sufficient. That $320 million can be viewed as an acceleration of future pension contributions. 
And second, as we do each quarter, we note the cash received during the quarter associated with the PDVSA settlement. To date, we received over $750 million related to the $2 billion settlement agreement reached in the third quarter of last year.
Working capital was at $300 million use of cash. And as mentioned, we recognized $2.2 billion in proceeds from closing of the U.K. disposition. Capital spending was $1.7 billion, resulting in free cash flow of $1 billion in the quarter.
And we distributed $1.1 billion or 41% of CFO to shareholders during the quarter through dividends and share buybacks, ending the quarter with a cash balance of $8.4 billion. 
So as you can see, this past quarter once again continued our trend of consistent, strong operational and financial performance. It also demonstrates our unwavering commitment to financial returns, capital discipline, free cash flow generation and returning capital to shareholders. We firmly believe that ours is a sustainable, distinctive and compelling value proposition, one that is highly competitive not only within then the energy sector but also across the broader market. With that, I'll turn the call over to Matt."

I'll provide a brief overview of our year-to-date operational highlights and discuss our outlook for the remainder of the year. Please turn to Slide 7.Across the portfolio, we continue to advance the operational milestones we highlighted at",700,"Thanks, Don. I'll provide a brief overview of our year-to-date operational highlights and discuss our outlook for the remainder of the year. Please turn to Slide 7.
Across the portfolio, we continue to advance the operational milestones we highlighted at the end of last year. Starting in Alaska, we safely completed our third quarter turnarounds of Prudhoe, the Western North Slope and Kuparuk and closed the Nuna discovered resource acquisition. We also continued to progress appraisal of our Willow and Narwhal discoveries. Earlier this month, we spud another horizontal well from an existing outline drill site into the Narwhal trend. The well was designed to provide offset injection to the horizontal producer we drilled earlier in the year and help us optimize future development planning. We're also gearing up for the winter exploration, appraisal and project execution season.
Moving to Canada. We completed commissioning of our Montney gas plant this quarter. Due to delays in the third-party pipeline, we now expect that project to be online in early 2020.
At Surmont, our alternative diluent project is on track for start up in the fourth quarter, as planned. In fact, we're actively transitioning to be -- start condensate blending for drillbit seals beginning on November 1.
This capability will not only reduce the amount of diluent we'll acquire but also provide blend flexibility and consistently improve our netbacks. 
In the Lower 48, Big 3 third quarter production by asset was: Eagle Ford at 226,000 barrels equivalent per day; Bakken at 102,000; and Delaware at 51,000, for a total of 379,000. As we indicated last quarter, we expect Big 3 production to remain relatively flat for the remainder of the year, and we're on target to achieve a full year growth rate of about 21%.
Lastly, in the Lower 48, we now have 3 vintage 5 multi-well pilot pads online in Eagle Ford, and you'll hear more about that in a few weeks. 
Moving over to Europe. The U.K. disposition closed and we successfully transitioned operatorship. In Norway, partner-operated turnarounds were safely completed in the third quarter. In Qatar, we've been invited to submit a bid for the North Field expansion project.
And in Malaysia, production ramp up at KBB continued through the quarter, and we expect to reach full throughput by year-end. In addition, Gumusut Phase 2 came online in August. And finally, in Australia, we announced the divestiture of our Australia-West assets for $1.4 billion, which we expect to close in the first quarter of 2020. Meanwhile, we continue to progress Barossa and remain on schedule for FID by early next year.
So we've had another strong quarter of execution as well as significant progress across the portfolio. Now I'll discuss the outlook for the remainder of the year on Slide 8. As we enter the last quarter of 2019, we're continuing our focus on execution while maintaining capital discipline. Our full year operating planned capital guidance remains unchanged at $6.3 billion, excluding about $300 million of opportunistic low cost of supply resource additions that we discussed last quarter. On the production side, full year guidance also remains unchanged, except for updating for the close of our U.K. asset divestiture. With that in mind, we now expect the fourth quarter to average between 1.265 million and 1.305 million barrels equivalent per day, with the full year guidance between 1.3 million and 1.31 million barrels a day. 
So we remain on track to deliver 5% underlying full year production growth, and combined with our buyback program, that results in 10% production growth per share. 
Finally, we're looking forward to our analyst and investor meeting on November 19 in Houston. We'll show a decade-long disciplined plan that delivers free cash flow and strong returns. And of course, we'll provide a deep dive into the assets across our diverse portfolio. Our continued strong performance highlights the strength of our portfolio diversity and our ability to generate free cash flow to support distinctive returns to shareholders. Our entire ConocoPhillips team is focused on successfully executing the remainder of our 2019 plan, and we look forward to sharing our longer-term plans with you in November.
Now we will open up for questions on the quarter."

We had $60 million distributed in the third quarter. I would expect that number to grow to about $300 million in the fourth quarter. So still pretty consistent with what I guided to last time, which I think was $750 million for the year on APLNG. 
On working capital, we had a $300 million use in the quarter. And there, we saw an increase in accounts receivable due to some sales timings on liftings in Norway and Malaysia both, and a decrease in the accounts payable of about the same, about $150 million. And that's just normal payment timing. So there's really not a lot going on there. I wouldn't suggest that we're -- we have a trend line that we're following."

They've reduced lifting costs, they've increased development activity and increased production in these other fields. And so we expect to see a reduction in operating costs and a renewed focus on investment. Now any capital plans for the Prudhoe Bay require the approval of Hilcorp, Exxon and ConocoPhillips. And so while we work very closely today with BP as the operator, we'll continue to work closely with Hilcorp as they come in and Exxon to maximize the value of this legacy asset. So we're excited for this transaction. We see opportunity to unlock more value at Prudhoe Bay."

We believe the Alaskan citizens will see the benefit that the North Slope exploration Renaissance has already brought to the state and to its citizens. If you look at the positive changes that have occurred since SB 21 went into effect in 2013, ConocoPhillips and others have announced several additional discoveries and projects. It could add significant incremental production and revenue to the state. And so we believe that continuing those investments is good for employment. It's good for the Alaskan economy, and it's good for the Alaskan citizens. And so that's for both now and over the long term. And so we feel like it's also worth noting that this sort of initiative has come up in the past and we've successfully informed voters of the negative consequences of jobs, production and long-term revenue, the impact of those sort of initiatives have on the benefits that the citizens would see. So we do have a long history of engagement with the public. We feel that there's a mutually beneficial relationship with the stakeholders and, in short., so it's very much on our radar and something we're monitoring quite closely.

We realized adjusted earnings of $0.9 billion or $0.82 a share. Higher LNG realizations and higher production volumes combined with lower overall cost to mitigate the impacts of reduced market prices. Cash from operations was $2.6 billion, resulting in free cash flow of $1 billion in the quarter and $4 billion year-to-date. We ended the quarter with $8.4 billion of cash and short-term investments. And our strong financial returns continued with the return on capital employed at just under 11% on a trailing 12-month basis. 
Moving to the middle column. Operationally in the quarter, we produced 1.32 million barrels of oil equivalent a day, up 7% on an underlying basis compared with the year-ago quarter and up 12% on a per share basis. Matt will cover the rest of the operations highlights in a moment. 
On the strategic side, earlier this month, we announced a 38% increase to our quarterly dividend, which reflects the company's improved underlying financial strength as well as our commitment to peer leading capital returns to shareholders. In addition, we repurchased $750 million of shares in the quarter and announced our plan to buy back $3 billion of shares in 2020.
In both the third quarter and year-to-date, we've returned over 40% of CFO to our shareholders. We closed the sale of our E&P assets in the U.K. in September, which generated $2.2 billion in proceeds. And as recently announced, we entered into definitive agreements for the sale of our Australia-West business. 
If you turn to Slide 5, I'll wrap up with a look at our cash flows for the quarter. We began the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $6.9 billion. Moving to the right, cash from operations was $2.6 billion. There were a couple of items impacting cash from operations in the quarter that are noted here. 
First, in conjunction with the U.K. sale, we made a one-time top up contribution to the pension plan such that it is now fully funded and essentially self-sufficient. That $320 million can be viewed as an acceleration of future pension contributions. 
And second, as we do each quarter, we note the cash received during the quarter associated with the PDVSA settlement. To date, we received over $750 million related to the $2 billion settlement agreement reached in the third quarter of last year.
Working capital was at $300 million use of cash. And as mentioned, we recognized $2.2 billion in proceeds from closing of the U.K. disposition. Capital spending was $1.7 billion, resulting in free cash flow of $1 billion in the quarter.
And we distributed $1.1 billion or 41% of CFO to shareholders during the quarter through dividends and share buybacks, ending the quarter with a cash balance of $8.4 billion. 
So as you can see, this past quarter once again continued our trend of consistent, strong operational and financial performance. It also demonstrates our unwavering commitment to financial returns, capital discipline, free cash flow generation and returning capital to shareholders. We firmly believe that ours is a sustainable, distinctive and compelling value proposition, one that is highly competitive not only within then the energy sector but also across the broader market. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Matt."

I'll provide a brief overview of our year-to-date operational highlights and discuss our outlook for the remainder of the year. Please turn to Slide 7.
Across the portfolio, we continue to advance the operational milestones we highlighted at the end of last year. Starting in Alaska, we safely completed our third quarter turnarounds of Prudhoe, the Western North Slope and Kuparuk and closed the Nuna discovered resource acquisition. We also continued to progress appraisal of our Willow and Narwhal discoveries. Earlier this month, we spud another horizontal well from an existing outline drill site into the Narwhal trend. The well was designed to provide offset injection to the horizontal producer we drilled earlier in the year and help us optimize future development planning. We're also gearing up for the winter exploration, appraisal and project execution season.
Moving to Canada. We completed commissioning of our Montney gas plant this quarter. Due to delays in the third-party pipeline, we now expect that project to be online in early 2020.
At Surmont, our alternative diluent project is on track for startup in the fourth quarter, as planned. In fact, we're actively transitioning to be -- start condensate blending for drillbit seals beginning on November 1.
This capability will not only reduce the amount of diluent we'll acquire but also provide blend flexibility and consistently improve our netbacks. 
In the Lower 48, Big 3 third quarter production by asset was: Eagle Ford at 226,000 barrels equivalent per day; Bakken at 102,000; and Delaware at 51,000, for a total of 379,000. As we indicated last quarter, we expect Big 3 production to remain relatively flat for the remainder of the year, and we're on target to achieve a full year growth rate of about 21%.
Lastly, in the Lower 48, we now have 3 vintage 5 multi-well pilot pads online in Eagle Ford, and you'll hear more about that in a few weeks. 
Moving over to Europe. The U.K. disposition closed and we successfully transitioned operatorship. In Norway, partner-operated turnarounds were safely completed in the third quarter. In Qatar, we've been invited to submit a bid for the North Field expansion project.
And in Malaysia, production ramp up at KBB continued through the quarter, and we expect to reach full throughput by year-end. In addition, Gumusut Phase 2 came online in August. And finally, in Australia, we announced the divestiture of our Australia-West assets for $1.4 billion, which we expect to close in the first quarter of 2020. Meanwhile, we continue to progress Barossa and remain on schedule for FID by early next year.
So we've had another strong quarter of execution as well as significant progress across the portfolio. Now I'll discuss the outlook for the remainder of the year on Slide 8. As we enter the last quarter of 2019, we're continuing our focus on execution while maintaining capital discipline. Our full year operating planned capital guidance remains unchanged at $6.3 billion, excluding about $300 million of opportunistic low cost of supply resource additions that we discussed last quarter. On the production side, full year guidance also remains unchanged, except for updating for the close of our U.K. asset divestiture. With that in mind, we now expect the fourth quarter to average between 1.265 million and 1.305 million barrels equivalent per day, with the full year guidance between 1.3 million and 1.31 million barrels a day. 
So we remain on track to deliver 5% underlying full year production growth, and combined with our buyback program, that results in 10% production growth per share. 
Finally, we're looking forward to our analyst and investor meeting on November 19 in Houston. We'll show a decade-long disciplined plan that delivers free cash flow and strong returns. And of course, we'll provide a deep dive into the assets across our diverse portfolio. Our continued strong performance highlights the strength of our portfolio diversity and our ability to generate free cash flow to support distinctive returns to shareholders. Our entire ConocoPhillips team is focused on successfully executing the remainder of our 2019 plan, and we look forward to sharing our longer-term plans with you in November.
Now we will open up for questions on the quarter."

On working capital, we had a $300 million use in the quarter. And there, we saw an increase in accounts receivable due to some sales timings on liftings in Norway and Malaysia both, and a decrease in the accounts payable of about the same, about $150 million. And that's just normal payment timing. So there's really not a lot going on there. I wouldn't suggest that we're -- we have a trend line that we're following."

Just on your cost guidance, I'm expecting this will come up next week, but the cost have been running a bit light this year. I'm just wondering if there's anything that we should read into that. Are you doing a lot better on both operating costs? And I guess DD&A is a bit low as well, but pretty much from the cash cost. But I'm guessing that's something you'll address in a couple of weeks.

Some of it was we had a bit higher cost in the second quarter because of the turnaround activity, and we had I think a settlement of litigation thing that we settled. So we see operating costs remain essentially flat for this year. And so we're not adjusting the full year production operating cost guidance at this time.
