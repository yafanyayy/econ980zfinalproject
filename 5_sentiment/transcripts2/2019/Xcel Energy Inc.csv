And I say good morning, but as you all probably know, it is brutally cold here in Minnesota and I'd like to thank men and women of Xcel who worked so hard to keep the gas flowing and the electricity on over these last few days. I'd say with just a few exceptions, our system has held up remarkably well and it's due to the dedication and commitment, so thank you. 2018 was an excellent year with a long and impressive list of accomplishments. Let me share a few of them with you. We reported ongoing EPS of $2.47 in 2018, and this was our 14th consecutive year of meeting or exceeding our earnings guidance. We increased our long-term EPS growth target rate to 5% to 7%. We raised our dividend by $0.08, which represents the 15th straight year we've increased our dividend. We completed our equity issuances for the 5-year forecast period and don't plan any additional equity beyond our dividend reinvestment and benefit programs. Our stocks hit an all-time high closing price of [ $53.68 ] in December. We secured approval for over 1,000 megawatts of new wind in Texas and New Mexico, our Colorado Energy Plan and 300 megawatts of wind in South Dakota. We completed construction of our 600-megawatt Rush Creek wind farm on time and under budget. We reached agreements to purchase the 760-megawatt Mankato natural gas combined cycle plant for $650 million. And to acquire 70 megawatts of repowered wind farms for a $135 million. We expect both acquisitions that we approve later this year. Our nuclear plants combined to achieve our capacity factor of almost 96% while reducing O&M by almost 3%. We followed an electric vehicle pilot program in Minnesota. We resolved tax reform proceeding to most jurisdictions with the final resolution in North Dakota expected later this year. I'm also very proud that our actions have been noticed by others. Resulting in numerous awards, including been recognized by Fortune magazine as one of the world's most admired companies for the fifth consecutive year. Being honored by the Military Times as Best Employer for the fifth consecutive year and being named utility of the year by utility. So 2018 was a great year, but we're now focused on 2019 and beyond. Leading to Clean Energy Transition continues to be a strategic priority for us as we carry out Xcel Energy's vision to be our customers' preferred and trusted energy provider. Also helping us to achieve 2 other strategic priorities. Keeping our customer bills low and enhancing the customer experience. We're a national leader in wind energy through our steel-for-fuel strategy, which adds renewables, while at the same time, lowering bills. As a result, we've made outstanding progress, achieving a 39% reduction in carbon emissions from 2005 levels. Well we wanted do even more, which is why we set a vision to reduce carbon emissions by 80% by 2030. Longer-term, we expect to deliver our customers a 100% of carbon-free energy by 2050. These are the most ambitious carbon goals within the electric power industry and I'm confident with supported public policy, we can achieve the 80% interim goal while keeping our bills affordable and our product reliable. Technologies come along way in the last 10 years and it gives me confidence that our 100% carbon-free goals can be met as well. We look forward to working with our regulators, legislators and stakeholders to implement our plans across the jurisdictions we serve. Also very focused on our customers. Earlier this month, we entered into agreements to provide electric service to a proposed new Google data center located on property adjacent to our plant in Minnesota. As you may remember, back in 2015, we announced our intention to close 2 of the coal units. This particular units for the new data center will create jobs, bring investment to the state and benefit all of our customers. And consistent with our goal to lead the clean energy transition, we are planning to serve the data center's energy needs with 100% renewable energy. And I believe our environmental leadership will lead to more economic development opportunities overtime. We also recently filed to expand our pilot Renewable Connect program in Minnesota. Renewable Connect allows customers to choose how much of their energy comes from renewable sources. Been extremely popular and has commission approval in Minnesota, Colorado and Wisconsin. This is yet another way for us to add renewable energy and meet the needs of our customers. And importantly, Renewable Connect is not negatively impact the bills of nonparticipants. We anticipate the future expansion at Google and Renewable Connect program will create potential renewable ownership opportunities for Xcel. So with that, let me turn the call over to Bob who will provide more detail on our financial results and outlook and the regulatory update. Bob?"

For the details of our fourth quarter results, please see our earnings release. As Ben discussed, we realized another strong year of our operational and financial performance. We recorded 2018 ongoing earnings of $2.47 per share compared with $2.30 per share in 2017. Representing the top end of our original guidance range of $2.37 to $2.47 a share. Weather was certainly a positive factor contributing $0.07 per share compared to normal in our annual results. We also incurred additional expense, which offset the weather benefit. Looking at the income statement, the most significant drivers for the year include higher electric and natural gas margins, which increased earnings by $0.44 per share, largely due to favorable weather and strong electric and natural gas sales, as well as rate increases to cover our capital investments. And higher AFUDC equity, which increased earnings by $0.07 per share reflecting growth in capital investments. Partially offsetting these positive drivers were higher O&M expenses, which decreased earnings by $0.10 per share, increased G&A expense as a result of our capital investment program, which reduced our earnings by $0.10 per share and higher interest expenses, property taxes and other items combined to reduce earnings per share by $0.14. Turning to sales. Our weather adjusted electric sales increased 1.3% in 2018, reflecting strong economies in the states we serve and favorable sale to commercial and industrial customers as well as solid residential sales growth. Our electric sales growth was strongest at our SPS business with 4.1% growth proven by the oil and natural gas sector in the Permian Basin. Weather adjusted natural gas sales increased 2.4% in 2018 as a result of continued customer growth and increasing customer use, largely in the commercial and industrial customer segment. For 2019, we're anticipating relatively flat electric sales, which reflects some specific declines in large customer usage, more modest oil and natural gas driven growth and expectations of the lower use per customer in the residential sector. The natural gas, we expect like a positive sales in 2019 reflecting continued growth in C&I and residential loads. Turning to expenses. O&M increased by $82 million or 3.6% reflecting additional spend for vegetation management and system maintenance due to the hot summer. Business systems costs, investments to improve and enhance business processes and customer service as well as damage prevention and remediation costs. We remain committed to our long-term objective of improving operating efficiencies in taking costs out of the business for the benefit of our customers. But we continue to face rising costs in certain strategic areas, including the impacts of adding incremental renewable generation, improving cybersecurity and enhancing the customer experience, we are focused on delivering 2019 O&M expenses at levels that in aggregate are consistent with 2017. Next, let me provide a quick related upgrade. We had a very busy and productive year in which we filed a result of multiple rate cases in addition to tax reform proceedings in all of our states. In 2019, we're planning to file a Colorado Electric Case in the spring. Rate cases in Texas and New Mexico in the summer and a Minnesota rate case in November and a Minnesota resource plan in summer. We anticipate that new rates from these cases will go into effect in 2020. With that, I'll wrap up. In summary, 2018 was another great year for Xcel Energy. We delivered ongoing earnings within or above our guidance range for the 14th consecutive year. We increased our dividend for the 15th straight year. We completed our equity issuance for the 5-year time period. We continue to execute on our steel-for-fuel strategy seeking regulatory approvals for new wind in Texas and New Mexico and South Dakota as well as the Colorado Energy Plan. We entered into agreement to acquire the 760-megawatt Mankato natural gas plant and buy off when PPAs in Minnesota. We are well positioned to deliver on our 2019 ongoing earnings guidance range of $2.55 to $2.65 per share. Our 5% to 7% earnings growth objective and our 5% to 7% dividend growth objective. This concludes our prepared remarks. And operator, we'll now take some questions."

So I when touched on a few that we're looking on and if I miss 1 please ask a follow-up question Julian. Starting in Texas, of course, we're interested in the AMI legislation. That would basically allow non-Arcot companies to get the same regulatory treatment that Arcot companies received concurrent recovery that's particularly important. Its important to note there that in our CapEx in the forecast period, we anticipated about $80 million spend of AMI. So wouldn't increase the capital too much there Julian, but the recovery would be great. And we're optimistic about that. Over New Mexico, of course, we're following the RPS standard to see where that goes and watching the securitization go as well. Moving up to Colorado, there is a number of different things proposed in Colorado. Securitization bill is that 1 that we're following. Our thoughts there is it could be another tool in the toolbox, if you will. That said, some of the things that we've already accomplished, leading the Clean Energy Transition while keeping those flat, taking care of our communities something I'm particularly proud of, taking care of our employees. I think we can show we can do and achieve pretty remarkable results. That was always in the details, but the securitization, it could become a valuable voluntary tool, that'll be great. Minnesota, there's just a number of things going around. Some of them addresses the community. Most of those are -- most of the legislation I would say in Minnesota is in earlier stages. So if there is something specific that you're interested in Minnesota, just follow-up. Did I catch everything you're interested in, or did I miss anything Julien?"

So the shift in capital is just a pull forward from that wind from. So you see an incremental capital in 2019 in Colorado and then probably slightly less capital in '20 for the same wind farm."

Now whether or not we can pull the transaction again, you got -- it has to work for us, it has to work for the seller and it has to work for our customers. And we've had some success with that, and we anticipate future success. But either way, Angie, when these PPAs roll off, most of them are at higher dollars than what the market prices would be now. And so that at the very least is going to help us with our very important objective of keeping those low and create headroom for investment at that leverage point that you're talking about. So it's really kind of a version of steel-for-fuel, if you will. So we don't have quite the same high-priced type I PPAs that I think PGE might have.

And I say good morning, but as you all probably know, it is brutally cold here in Minnesota, and I'd like to thank the men and women of Xcel who worked so hard to keep the gas flowing and the electricity on over these last few days. I'd say with just a few exceptions, our system has held up remarkably well and that's due to their dedication and commitment. So thank you.
So 2018 was an excellent year with a long and impressive list of accomplishments. Let me share a few of them with you. We reported ongoing EPS of $2.47 in 2018, and this was our 14th consecutive year of meeting or exceeding our earnings guidance. We increased our long-term EPS growth target rate to 5% to 7%. We raised our dividend by $0.08, which represents the 15th straight year we've increased our dividend. We completed our equity issuances for the 5-year forecast period and don't plan any additional equity beyond our dividend reinvestment and benefit programs. Our stock hit an all-time high closing price of $53.68 in December. We secured approval for over 1,000 megawatts of new wind in Texas and New Mexico, our Colorado Energy Plan and 300 megawatts of wind in South Dakota. We completed construction of our 600-megawatt Rush Creek wind farm on time and under budget. We reached agreements to purchase the 760-megawatt Mankato natural gas combined cycle plant for $650 million. And to acquire 70 megawatts of repowered wind farms for $135 million. We expect both acquisitions to be approved later this year.
Our nuclear plants combined to achieve a capacity factor of almost 96% while reducing O&M costs by almost 3%. We followed an electric vehicle pilot program in Minnesota. We resolved tax reform proceeding to most jurisdictions with a final resolution in North Dakota expected later this year.
I'm also very proud that our actions have been noticed by others, resulting in numerous awards, including being recognized by Fortune magazine as one of the world's most-admired companies for the fifth consecutive year, being honored by the Military Times as Best for Vets Employer for the fifth consecutive year and being named Utility of the Year by Utility Dive. So 2018 was a great year, but we're now focused on 2019 and beyond.
Leading the Clean Energy Transition continues to be a strategic priority for us as we carry out Xcel Energy's vision to be our customers' preferred and trusted energy provider. Also helping us to achieve 2 other strategic priorities, keeping our customer bills low and enhancing the customer experience. We're a national leader in wind energy through our steel-for-fuel strategy, which adds renewables, while at the same time lowering bills. As a result, we've made outstanding progress, achieving a 39% reduction in carbon emissions from 2005 levels. So we want to do even more, which is why we set a vision to reduce carbon emissions by 80% by 2030. Longer term, we expect to deliver our customers a 100% carbon-free energy by 2050. These are the most ambitious carbon goals within the electric power industry, and I'm confident with supportive public policy, we can achieve the 80% interim goal while keeping our bills affordable and our product reliable.
Technology has come a long way in the last 10 years and it gives me confidence that our 100% carbon-free goal can be met as well. We look forward to working with our regulators, legislators and stakeholders to implement our plans across the jurisdictions we serve. We're also very focused on our customers. Earlier this month, we entered into agreements to provide electric service to a proposed new Google data center located on property adjacent to our Sherco plant in Minnesota. As you may remember, back in 2015, we announced our intention to close 2 of the Sherco coal units. This particular location for the new data center will create jobs, bring investment to the state and benefit all of our customers. And consistent with our goal to lead the clean energy transition, we are planning to serve the data center's energy needs with a 100% renewable energy. And I believe our environmental leadership will lead to even more economic development opportunities over time.
We also recently filed to expand our pilot Renewable Connect program in Minnesota. Renewable Connect allows customers to choose how much of their energy comes from renewable sources. It's been extremely popular and has commission approval in Minnesota, Colorado and Wisconsin. This is yet another way for us to add renewable energy and meet the needs of our customers. And importantly, Renewable Connect does not negatively impact the bills of nonparticipants. We anticipate that future expansions at Google and in Renewable -- and Renewable Connect program will create potential renewable ownership opportunities for Xcel.
So with that, let me turn the call over to Bob, who'll provide more detail on our financial results and outlook and a regulatory update. Bob?"

My comments today will focus on full year 2018 results.

My comments today will focus on full year 2018 results. For details of our fourth quarter results, please see our earnings release.
As Ben discussed, we realized another strong year of operational and financial performance. We recorded 2018 ongoing earnings of $2.47 per share compared with $2.30 per share in 2017, representing the top end of our original guidance range of $2.37 to $2.47 per share. Weather was certainly a positive factor contributing $0.07 per share compared to normal in our annual results. We also incurred additional O&M expense, which offset the weather benefit.
Looking at the income statement, the most significant drivers for the year include higher electric and natural gas margins, which increased earnings by $0.44 per share, largely due to favorable weather and strong electric and natural gas sales, as well as rate increases in riders to recover our capital investments, and higher AFUDC equity, which increased earnings by $0.07 per share reflecting growth in capital investments. Partially offsetting these positive drivers were higher O&M expenses, which decreased earnings by $0.10 per share, increased G&A expense as a result of our capital investment program which reduced earnings by $0.10 per share and higher interest expenses, property taxes and other items combined to reduce earnings per share by $0.14.
Turning to sales. Our weather-adjusted electric sales increased 1.3% in 2018, reflecting strong economies in the states we serve and favorable sale to commercial and industrial customers as well as solid residential sales growth. Our electric sales growth was strongest at our SPS business with 4.1% growth, driven by the oil and natural gas sector in the Permian Basin.
Weather-adjusted natural gas sales increased 2.4% in 2018 as a result of continued customer growth and increasing customer use, largely in the commercial and industrial customer segment. For 2019, we are anticipating relatively flat electric sales, which reflects some specific declines in large customer usage, more modest oil and natural gas-driven growth and expectations of lower use per customer in the residential sector. For natural gas, we expect slightly positive sales in 2019, reflecting continued growth in C&I and residential loads.
Turning to expenses. O&M increased by $82 million or 3.6%, reflecting additional spend for vegetation management and system maintenance due to the hot summer, business systems costs, investments to improve and enhance business processes and customer service as well as damage prevention and remediation costs. We remain committed to our long-term objective of improving operating efficiencies and taking costs out of the business for the benefit of our customers. But we continue to face rising costs in certain strategic areas, including the impacts of adding incremental renewable generation, improving cybersecurity and enhancing the customer experience. We are focused on delivering 2019 O&M expenses at levels that in aggregate are consistent with 2017.
Next let me provide a quick regulatory update. We had a very busy and productive year in which we filed and resolved multiple rate cases in addition to tax reform proceedings in all of our states. In 2019, we're planning to file a Colorado electric case in the spring, rate cases in Texas and New Mexico in the summer and a Minnesota rate case in November and a Minnesota resource plan in the summer. We anticipate that new rates from these cases will go into effect in 2020.
With that, I'll wrap up. In summary, 2018 was another great year for Xcel Energy. We delivered ongoing earnings within or above our guidance range for the 14th consecutive year. We increased our dividend for the 15th straight year. We completed our equity issuance for the 5-year time period. We continue to execute on our steel-for-fuel strategy receiving regulatory approvals for new wind in Texas and New Mexico and South Dakota as well as the Colorado Energy Plan. We entered into agreement to acquire the 760-megawatt Mankato natural gas plant and buyout 70 megawatts of wind PPAs in Minnesota. We are well positioned to deliver on our 2019 ongoing earnings guidance range of $2.55 to $2.65 per share, our 5% to 7% earnings growth objective, and our 5% to 7% dividend growth objective.
This concludes our prepared remarks. And operator, we will now take some questions."

So why don't I touch on a few that we're looking at, and if I miss one, please ask a follow-up question, Julien. Starting in Texas, of course, we're interested in the AMI legislation. That would basically allow non-ERCOT companies to get the same regulatory treatment that ERCOT companies receive, concurrent recovery is particularly important. It's important to note there that in our CapEx in the forecast period, we anticipate about $80 million spend of AMI. So wouldn't increase the capital too much there, Julien, but the recovery would be great. And we're optimistic about that. Over New Mexico, of course, we're following the RPS standard to see where that goes and watching the securitization bill as well. Moving up to Colorado, there is a number of different things proposed in Colorado. Securitization bill is one that we're following. Our thoughts there is it could be another tool in the toolbox, if you will. That said, some of the things that we've already accomplished, Leading the Clean Energy Transition while keeping those flat, taking care of our communities, something I'm particularly proud of, taking care of our employees, I think we've shown we can do it and achieve pretty remarkable results. That was always in the details, but if the securitization bill can become a valuable voluntary tool, well, that'll be great. Minnesota, there's just a number of things going around. Some of it addresses the Community Solar Gardens. Most of those are -- most of the legislation, I would say, in Minnesota is in earlier stages. So if there's something specific that you're interested in, in Minnesota, just follow-up. Did I catch everything you're interested in or did I miss anything, Julien?"

And just before I let you answer, I'm just wondering if -- is it a same type of rule of thumb that we have for O&M savings that some of the utilities mentioned that, for instance, $1 of O&M allows to spend anywhere between $6 and $7 of CapEx.

So that's a good rule of thumb. We've got a large universe of power purchase agreements. There's a slide that you're probably looking at from the EEI deck, I don't have it in front of me now. But we anticipate about 4,000 megawatts of those PPAs would -- half of it in renewables and wind, I believe, and the other half in fossil fuels, might be something that we could look at. Now whether or not we can pull the transaction, again, that -- you got to -- it has to work for us, it has to work for the seller and it has to work for our customers. And we've had some success with that, and we anticipate future success. But either way, Angie, when these PPAs roll off, most of them are at higher dollars than what the market prices would be now. And so that at the very least is going to help us with our very important objective of keeping those low and create headroom for investment at that leverage point that you're talking about. So it's really kind of a version of steel-for-fuel, if you will. So we don't have quite the same high-priced type PPAs that, I think, PGE (sic) [ PG&E ] might have. But the reality is energy prices have fallen over the last 10 years. So as things we did 10 years ago roll off, it's going to create opportunities either for buying or at the very least keeping bills lower for customers, all of which is good."

And I say good morning, but as you all probably know, it is brutally cold here in Minnesota, and I'd like to thank the men and women of Xcel who worked so hard to keep the gas flowing and the electricity on over these last few days. I'd say with just a few exceptions, our system has held up remarkably well and that's due to their dedication and commitment. So thank you.
So 2018 was an excellent year with a long and impressive list of accomplishments. Let me share a few of them with you. We reported ongoing EPS of $2.47 in 2018, and this was our 14th consecutive year of meeting or exceeding our earnings guidance. We increased our long-term EPS growth target rate to 5% to 7%. We raised our dividend by $0.08, which represents the 15th straight year we've increased our dividend. We completed our equity issuances for the 5-year forecast period and don't plan any additional equity beyond our dividend reinvestment and benefit programs. Our stock hit an all-time high closing price of $53.68 in December. We secured approval for over 1,000 megawatts of new wind in Texas and New Mexico, our Colorado Energy Plan and 300 megawatts of wind in South Dakota. We completed construction of our 600-megawatt Rush Creek wind farm on time and under budget. We reached agreements to purchase the 760-megawatt Mankato natural gas combined cycle plant for $650 million. And to acquire 70 megawatts of repowered wind farms for $135 million. We expect both acquisitions to be approved later this year.
Our nuclear plants combined to achieve a capacity factor of almost 96% while reducing O&M costs by almost 3%. We followed an electric vehicle pilot program in Minnesota. We resolved tax reform proceeding to most jurisdictions with a final resolution in North Dakota expected later this year.
I'm also very proud that our actions have been noticed by others, resulting in numerous awards, including being recognized by Fortune magazine as one of the world's most-admired companies for the fifth consecutive year, being honored by the Military Times as Best for Vets Employer for the fifth consecutive year and being named Utility of the Year by Utility Dive. So 2018 was a great year, but we're now focused on 2019 and beyond.
Leading the Clean Energy Transition continues to be a strategic priority for us as we carry out Xcel Energy's vision to be our customers' preferred and trusted energy provider. Also helping us to achieve 2 other strategic priorities, keeping our customer bills low and enhancing the customer experience. We're a national leader in wind energy through our steel-for-fuel strategy, which adds renewables, while at the same time lowering bills. As a result, we've made outstanding progress, achieving a 39% reduction in carbon emissions from 2005 levels. But We want to do even more, which is why we set a vision to reduce carbon emissions by 80% by 2030. Longer term, we expect to deliver our customers a 100% carbon-free energy by 2050. These are the most ambitious carbon goals within the electric power industry, and I'm confident with supportive public policy, we can achieve the 80% interim goal while keeping our bills affordable and our product reliable.
Technology has come a long way in the last 10 years and it gives me confidence that our 100% carbon-free goal can be met as well, and we look forward to working with our regulators, legislators and stakeholders to implement our plans across the jurisdictions we serve. We're also very focused on our customers. Earlier this month, we entered into agreements to provide electric service to a proposed new Google data center located on property adjacent to our Sherco plant in Minnesota. As you may remember, back in 2015, we announced our intention to close 2 of the Sherco coal units. This particular location for the new data center will create jobs, bring investment to the state and benefit all of our customers. And consistent with our goal to lead the clean energy transition, we are planning to serve the data center's energy needs with a 100% renewable energy. And I believe our environmental leadership will lead to even more economic development opportunities over time.
We also recently filed to expand our pilot Renewable Connect program in Minnesota. Renewable Connect allows customers to choose how much of their energy comes from renewable sources. It's been extremely popular and has commission approval in Minnesota, Colorado and Wisconsin. This is yet another way for us to add renewable energy and meet the needs of our customers. And importantly, Renewable Connect does not negatively impact the bills of nonparticipants. And we anticipate that future expansions at Google and in Renewable -- and Renewable Connect program will create potential renewable ownership opportunities for Xcel.
So with that, let me turn the call over to Bob, who'll provide more detail on our financial results and outlook and a regulatory update. Bob?"
527542,595835275,1644374,"Xcel Energy Inc., Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Jan 31, 2019",2019-01-31,"Earnings Calls","Xcel Energy Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ben, and good morning, everyone.

My comments today will focus on full year 2018 results. For details of our fourth quarter results, please see our earnings release.
As Ben discussed, we realized another strong year of operational and financial performance. We recorded 2018 ongoing earnings of $2.47 per share compared with $2.30 per share in 2017, representing the top end of our original guidance range of $2.37 to $2.47 per share. Weather was certainly a positive factor contributing $0.07 per share compared to normal in our annual results. We also incurred additional O&M expense, which offset the weather benefit.
Looking at the income statement, the most significant drivers for the year include higher electric and natural gas margins, which increased earnings by $0.44 per share, largely due to favorable weather and strong electric and natural gas sales, as well as rate increases in riders to recover our capital investments, and higher AFUDC equity, which increased earnings by $0.07 per share reflecting growth in capital investments. Partially offsetting these positive drivers were higher O&M expenses, which decreased earnings by $0.10 per share, increased G&A expense as a result of our capital investment program which reduced earnings by $0.10 per share and higher interest expenses, property taxes and other items combined to reduce earnings per share by $0.14.
Turning to sales. Our weather-adjusted electric sales increased 1.3% in 2018, reflecting strong economies in the states we serve and favorable sale to commercial and industrial customers as well as solid residential sales growth. Our electric sales growth was strongest at our SPS business with 4.1% growth, driven by the oil and natural gas sector in the Permian Basin.
Weather-adjusted natural gas sales increased 2.4% in 2018 as a result of continued customer growth and increasing customer use, largely in the commercial and industrial customer segment. For 2019, we are anticipating relatively flat electric sales, which reflects some specific declines in large customer usage, more modest oil and natural gas-driven growth and expectations of lower use per customer in the residential sector. For natural gas, we expect slightly positive sales in 2019, reflecting continued growth in C&I and residential loads.
Turning to expenses. O&M increased by $82 million or 3.6%, reflecting additional spend for vegetation management and system maintenance due to the hot summer, business systems costs, investments to improve and enhance business processes and customer service as well as damage prevention and remediation costs. We remain committed to our long-term objective of improving operating efficiencies and taking costs out of the business for the benefit of our customers. But we continue to face rising costs in certain strategic areas, including the impacts of adding incremental renewable generation, improving cybersecurity and enhancing the customer experience. We are focused on delivering 2019 O&M expenses at levels that in aggregate are consistent with 2017.
Next let me provide a quick regulatory update. We had a very busy and productive year in which we filed and resolved multiple rate cases in addition to tax reform proceedings in all of our states. In 2019, we're planning to file a Colorado electric case in the spring, rate cases in Texas and New Mexico in the summer and a Minnesota rate case in November and a Minnesota resource plan in the summer. We anticipate that new rates from these cases will go into effect in 2020.
With that, I'll wrap up. In summary, 2018 was another great year for Xcel Energy. We delivered ongoing earnings within or above our guidance range for the 14th consecutive year. We increased our dividend for the 15th straight year. We completed our equity issuance for the 5-year time period. We continue to execute on our steel-for-fuel strategy receiving regulatory approvals for new wind in Texas and New Mexico and South Dakota as well as the Colorado Energy Plan. We entered into agreement to acquire the 760-megawatt Mankato natural gas plant and buyout 70 megawatts of wind PPAs in Minnesota. We are well positioned to deliver on our 2019 ongoing earnings guidance range of $2.55 to $2.65 per share, our 5% to 7% earnings growth objective, and our 5% to 7% dividend growth objective.
This concludes our prepared remarks. And operator, we will now take some questions."

So why don't I touch on a few that we're looking at, and if I miss one, please ask a follow-up question, Julien. Starting in Texas, of course, we're interested in the AMI legislation. That would basically allow non-ERCOT companies to get the same regulatory treatment that ERCOT companies receive, concurrent recovery is particularly important. It's important to note there that in our CapEx in the forecast period, we anticipate about $80 million spend of AMI. So wouldn't increase the capital too much there, Julien, but the recovery would be great. And we're optimistic about that. Over in New Mexico, of course, we're following the RPS standard to see where that goes and watching the securitization bill as well. Moving up to Colorado, there is a number of different things proposed in Colorado. Securitization bill is one that we're following. Our thoughts there is it could be another tool in the toolbox, if you will. That said, some of the things that we've already accomplished, Leading the Clean Energy Transition while keeping bills flat, taking care of our communities, something I'm particularly proud of, taking care of our employees, I think we've shown we can do it and achieve pretty remarkable results. That was always in the details, but if the securitization bills, it can become a valuable voluntary tool, well, that'll be great. Minnesota, there's just a number of things going around. Some of it addresses the Community Solar Gardens. Most of those are -- most of the legislation, I would say, in Minnesota is in earlier stages. So if there's something specific that you're interested in, in Minnesota, just follow-up. Did I catch everything you're interested in or did I miss anything, Julien?"

Now whether or not we can pull the transaction, again, that -- you got to -- it has to work for us, it has to work for the seller and it has to work for our customers. And we've had some success with that, and we anticipate future success. But either way, Angie, when these PPAs roll off, most of them are at higher dollars than what the market prices would be now. And so that at the very least is going to help us with our very important objective of keeping bills low and create headroom for investment at that leverage point that you're talking about. So it's really kind of a version of steel-for-fuel, if you will. So we don't have quite the same high-priced type PPAs that, I think, PGE (sic) [ PG&E ] might have.

And I think the -- my thought, Angie, is solar is going to continue to see significant cost reductions more than offsetting, in my opinion, the fall off of the ITC. And I think that marries up really nicely with the actual coal plant retirements that we're looking at, because, as you know, solar has far higher planning capacity than wind does. Wind's more like fuel. Solar's kind of a mixture of the 2. So I think the stars are aligning very well for us in that regard."

And I say good morning, but as you all probably know, it is brutally cold here in Minnesota, and I'd like to thank the men and women of Xcel who worked so hard to keep the gas flowing and the electricity on over these last few days. I'd say with just a few exceptions, our system has held up remarkably well and that's due to their dedication and commitment. So thank you.
So 2018 was an excellent year with a long and impressive list of accomplishments. Let me share a few of them with you. We reported ongoing EPS of $2.47 in 2018, and this was our 14th consecutive year of meeting or exceeding our earnings guidance. We increased our long-term EPS growth target rate to 5% to 7%. We raised our dividend by $0.08, which represents the 15th straight year we've increased our dividend. We completed our equity issuances for the 5-year forecast period and don't plan any additional equity beyond our dividend reinvestment and benefit programs. Our stock hit an all-time high closing price of $53.68 in December. We secured approval for over 1,000 megawatts of new wind in Texas and New Mexico, our Colorado Energy Plan and 300 megawatts of wind in South Dakota. We completed construction of our 600-megawatt Rush Creek wind farm on time and under budget. We reached agreements to purchase the 760-megawatt Mankato natural gas combined cycle plant for $650 million. And to acquire 70 megawatts of repowered wind farms for $135 million. We expect both acquisitions to be approved later this year.
Our nuclear plants combined to achieve a capacity factor of almost 96% while reducing O&M costs by almost 3%. We followed an electric vehicle pilot program in Minnesota. We resolved tax reform proceeding to most jurisdictions with a final resolution in North Dakota expected later this year.
I'm also very proud that our actions have been noticed by others, resulting in numerous awards, including being recognized by Fortune magazine as one of the world's most-admired companies for the fifth consecutive year, being honored by the Military Times as Best for Vets Employer for the fifth consecutive year and being named Utility of the Year by Utility Dive. So 2018 was a great year, but we're now focused on 2019 and beyond.
Leading the Clean Energy Transition continues to be a strategic priority for us as we carry out Xcel Energy's vision to be our customers' preferred and trusted energy provider. Also helping us to achieve 2 other strategic priorities, keeping our customer bills low and enhancing the customer experience. We're a national leader in wind energy through our steel-for-fuel strategy, which adds renewables, while at the same time lowering bills. As a result, we've made outstanding progress, achieving a 39% reduction in carbon emissions from 2005 levels. But We want to do even more, which is why we set a vision to reduce carbon emissions by 80% by 2030. Longer term, we expect to deliver our customers a 100% carbon-free energy by 2050. These are the most ambitious carbon goals within the electric power industry, and I'm confident with supportive public policy, we can achieve the 80% interim goal while keeping our bills affordable and our product reliable.
Technology has come a long way in the last 10 years and it gives me confidence that our 100% carbon-free goal can be met as well, and we look forward to working with our regulators, legislators and stakeholders to implement our plans across the jurisdictions we serve. We're also very focused on our customers. Earlier this month, we entered into agreements to provide electric service to a proposed new Google data center located on property adjacent to our Sherco plant in Minnesota. As you may remember, back in 2015, we announced our intention to close 2 of the Sherco coal units. This particular location for the new data center will create jobs, bring investment to the state and benefit all of our customers. And consistent with our goal to lead the clean energy transition, we are planning to serve the data center's energy needs with a 100% renewable energy. And I believe our environmental leadership will lead to even more economic development opportunities over time.
We also recently filed to expand our pilot Renewable Connect program in Minnesota. Renewable Connect allows customers to choose how much of their energy comes from renewable sources. It's been extremely popular and has commission approval in Minnesota, Colorado and Wisconsin. This is yet another way for us to add renewable energy and meet the needs of our customers. And importantly, Renewable Connect does not negatively impact the bills of nonparticipants. And we anticipate that future expansions at Google and in Renewable -- and Renewable Connect program will create potential renewable ownership opportunities for Xcel.
So with that, let me turn the call over to Bob, who'll provide more detail on our financial results and outlook and a regulatory update. Bob?"

My comments today will focus on full year 2018 results. For details of our fourth quarter results, please see our earnings release.
As Ben discussed, we realized another strong year of operational and financial performance. We recorded 2018 ongoing earnings of $2.47 per share compared with $2.30 per share in 2017, representing the top end of our original guidance range of $2.37 to $2.47 per share. Weather was certainly a positive factor contributing $0.07 per share compared to normal in our annual results. We also incurred additional O&M expense, which offset the weather benefit.
Looking at the income statement, the most significant drivers for the year include higher electric and natural gas margins, which increased earnings by $0.44 per share, largely due to favorable weather and strong electric and natural gas sales, as well as rate increases in riders to recover our capital investments, and higher AFUDC equity, which increased earnings by $0.07 per share reflecting growth in capital investments. Partially offsetting these positive drivers were higher O&M expenses, which decreased earnings by $0.10 per share, increased G&A expense as a result of our capital investment program which reduced earnings by $0.10 per share and higher interest expenses, property taxes and other items combined to reduce earnings per share by $0.14.
Turning to sales. Our weather-adjusted electric sales increased 1.3% in 2018, reflecting strong economies in the states we serve and favorable sale to commercial and industrial customers as well as solid residential sales growth. Our electric sales growth was strongest at our SPS business with 4.1% growth, driven by the oil and natural gas sector in the Permian Basin.
Weather-adjusted natural gas sales increased 2.4% in 2018 as a result of continued customer growth and increasing customer use, largely in the commercial and industrial customer segment. For 2019, we are anticipating relatively flat electric sales, which reflects some specific declines in large customer usage, more modest oil and natural gas-driven growth and expectations of lower use per customer in the residential sector. For natural gas, we expect slightly positive sales in 2019, reflecting continued growth in C&I and residential loads.
Turning to expenses. O&M increased by $82 million or 3.6%, reflecting additional spend for vegetation management and system maintenance due to the hot summer, business systems costs, investments to improve and enhance business processes and customer service as well as damage prevention and remediation costs. We remain committed to our long-term objective of improving operating efficiencies and taking costs out of the business for the benefit of our customers. But we continue to face rising costs in certain strategic areas, including the impacts of adding incremental renewable generation, improving cybersecurity and enhancing the customer experience. We are focused on delivering 2019 O&M expenses at levels that in aggregate are consistent with 2017.
Next let me provide a quick regulatory update. We had a very busy and productive year in which we filed and resolved multiple rate cases in addition to tax reform proceedings in all of our states. In 2019, we're planning to file a Colorado electric case in the spring, rate cases in Texas and New Mexico in the summer and a Minnesota rate case in November and a Minnesota resource plan in the summer. We anticipate that new rates from these cases will go into effect in 2020.
With that, I'll wrap up. In summary, 2018 was another great year for Xcel Energy. We delivered ongoing earnings within or above our guidance range for the 14th consecutive year. We increased our dividend for the 15th straight year. We completed our equity issuance for the 5-year time period. We continue to execute on our steel-for-fuel strategy receiving regulatory approvals for new wind in Texas and New Mexico and South Dakota as well as the Colorado Energy Plan. We entered into agreement to acquire the 760-megawatt Mankato natural gas plant and buyout 70 megawatts of wind PPAs in Minnesota. We are well positioned to deliver on our 2019 ongoing earnings guidance range of $2.55 to $2.65 per share, our 5% to 7% earnings growth objective, and our 5% to 7% dividend growth objective.
This concludes our prepared remarks. And operator, we will now take some questions."

Our thoughts there is it could be another tool in the toolbox, if you will. That said, some of the things that we've already accomplished, Leading the Clean Energy Transition while keeping bills flat, taking care of our communities, something I'm particularly proud of, taking care of our employees, I think we've shown we can do it and achieve pretty remarkable results. That was always in the details, but if the securitization bills, it can become a valuable voluntary tool, well, that'll be great. Minnesota, there's just a number of things going around. Some of it addresses the Community Solar Gardens. Most of those are -- most of the legislation, I would say, in Minnesota is in earlier stages. So if there's something specific that you're interested in, in Minnesota, just follow-up. Did I catch everything you're interested in or did I miss anything, Julien?"

So I'm looking at the slide from your EEI deck with the PPA roll off. And I heard you mentioned the potential early buyout of some of the PPAs and now given what we're witnessing in California now with this whole discussion about how expensive renewable power PPAs have inflated customer bills, I'm just wondering if you can give us a sense, for instance, if there is any kind of rule of thumb, what kind of CapEx opportunity do you see as these PPAs roll off? And just before I let you answer, I'm just wondering if, is it the same type of rule of thumb that we have for O&M savings that some of the utilities mentioned that, for instance, $1 of O&M allows to spend anywhere between $6 and $7 of CapEx. Is the same rule of thumb applicable to those expiring PPAs?"

So that's a good rule of thumb. We've got a large universe of power purchase agreements. There's a slide that you're probably looking at from the EEI deck, I don't have it in front of me now. But we anticipate about 4,000 megawatts of those PPAs would -- half of it in renewables and wind, I believe, and the other half in fossil fuels, might be something that we could look at. Now whether or not we can pull the transaction, again, that -- you got to -- it has to work for us, it has to work for the seller and it has to work for our customers. And we've had some success with that, and we anticipate future success. But either way, Angie, when these PPAs roll off, most of them are at higher dollars than what the market prices would be now. And so that at the very least is going to help us with our very important objective of keeping bills low and create headroom for investment at that leverage point that you're talking about. So it's really kind of a version of steel-for-fuel, if you will. So we don't have quite the same high-priced type PPAs that, I think, PGE (sic) [ PG&E ] might have. But the reality is energy prices have fallen over the last 10 years. So as things we did 10 years ago roll off, it's going to create opportunities either for buying or at the very least keeping bills low for customers, all of which is good."

Today reported first quarter earnings of $0.61 per share compared to $0.57 per share last year. We're pleased with the strong start to the year and we are well positioned to delivering on our 2019 guidance and our long-term financial objectives. 
So let me start with some quick highlights from the quarter. In February, we increased our quarterly dividend by $2.5 per share or 6.6%. This represents an annualized increase of $0.10 per share, which is a step up over historic levels of $0.08 per share. We are growing the dividend at an increased rate due to our strong transparent earnings per growth profile and the flexibility afforded by our low dividend payout ratio. 
We also continue to make strong progress on our Steel for Fuel strategy, with almost 3,000 megawatts of new wind that has received regulatory approval and is moving forward in the construction process. 
In Colorado, the commission approved our certificate of for our Cheyenne Ridge wind farm based on a constructive settlements, which includes a construction cost cap and a customer protection mechanism. We will recover costs upon completion through riders until the next rate case after the project goes into service. 
Our Hale project in Texas is on track with construction expected to be complete in June on time and within budget. And we are waiting for final generation interconnect studies and agreements for our Sagamore project in New Mexico and our crowned ridge 3 project in Minnesota. We expect construction to begin later this year. 
All of our other wind projects are in various stages of permitting and construction and will be completed as expected between 2019 and 2021. These projects highlight the excellent planning, construction and project management skills of our employees. 
In December, we were the first utility in the United States to announce plans who achieved an 80% carbon reduction by 2030 and a 100% carbon-free electricity by 2050. We're excited to work with stakeholders as we continue to Clean Energy Transition, while providing reliable service and keeping bills low. The legislative session is still ongoing in most of our states and we continue to work with stakeholders from various legislative initiatives that would impact the utility sector. 
In Texas, there are bills under consideration that will provide the right of first refusal or new transmission projects and rider recovery for new generation and AMI investment. The outlook for these proposals is positive and point so more constructive in Texas. 
In New Mexico, the Energy Transition Act was signed in law by the governor in March. This law targets of 50% renewable portfolio standard by 2030 and a 100% carbon-free electricity by 2045. We believe we are well positioned to meet the 2030 milestone. 
In Colorado, there's proposed legislation that quantifies our plans to achieve 100% carbon-free electricity by 2050 and 80% carbon reduction by 2030. In addition, the bill is expected to provide for voluntary securitization as an option and it targets utility ownership of 50% of all generation and provides customer protection. 
I'm proud to be leading the Clean Energy Transition and support these bills, which are consistent with our carbon reduction objectives and provide positive benefits for our customers and our shareholders. This is another example of our strong alignment with policymakers in our states. 
I also want to recognize the efforts of our employees as they work through the and the bomb cyclone that hit our various states. They did a great job working in extreme conditions to restore service in record time. 
I'll now turn the call over to Bob and he'll provide more detail on the quarterly results and our regulatory plans."

We had a strong first quarter with earnings of $0.61 per share compared with $0.57 per share in 2018. Most significant earnings drivers for the quarter, include higher electricity and natural gas margins, which increased earnings by $0.15 per share, including the impact of favorable weather and various regulatory outcomes and riders to recover our capital investments. Partially offset by wind production tax credits that flow back to our customers. 
In addition, our lower effective tax rate increased earnings by $0.06 per share. However, the majority of the lower effective tax rate is due to an increase in production tax benefit credits, which flow back to our customers through electric margin and tax reform impact of both of which are largely earnings neutral. 
Offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation interests reflecting our capital investment program, which reduced our earnings by $0.11 per share and higher O&M expenses, which decreased earnings by $0.06 per share. Please note that we've calculated the EPS deviations for both the years presented based on a blended statutory tax rate of 25% following the implementation of tax reform. 
Turning to sales. Our weather adjusted electric sales increased 0.5% of the first quarter, reflecting continued strong customer growth, partially offset by lower use per customer. Weather adjusted natural gas sales increased 2.5% for the quarter as a result of strong customer growth and higher use per customer. 
For 2019, we're still anticipating relatively flat consolidated electric sales, which reflects some discrete known declines in large customer usage and expectations of lower use per customer in the residential sector. For natural gas, we expect slightly positive sales in [ 2019 ] reflecting continued growth in C&I and residential loads. 
Turning to expenses. Our O&M expenses increased by $40 million reflecting costs from substantial winter storms, the in-servicing of the Rush Creek wind farm, higher business systems and benefit costs and the timing of planned overhaul. Over the last 5 years, we've increased our rate base by approximately 7% annually, while keeping O&M expenses relatively flat. Over the same time period, customer expectations and risk diversion have increased. As a result, we're increasing our O&M spending in strategic areas to enhance the customer experience, increase cyber security and reduce systematic risk in our operations. And we remain committed to our long-term objective of improving operating efficiencies and taking other costs out of the business for the benefit of our customers. Therefore, we've raised our 2019 O&M guidance, which reflects a decline of approximately 2% from 2018 levels. 
We expect to offset the impact to slightly higher O&M and are confident in our ability to deliver earnings in our guidance range consistent with our plan. 
Next let me provide a quick regulatory update. In March, SPS reached a settlement with the New Mexico commission resulting in a revised rate order, which eliminated the retroactive TCJA refund, increase the equity ratio to 53.97% from the previously authorized 51% and increase the ROE to 9.56% from the previously authorized 9.1%. The revised orders expected to increase annual revenue by $4.5 million effective in March of 2019. 
We believe this is a constructive settlement and the sign of progress in New Mexico. In addition, we're planning to file electric cases in Colorado later in the second quarter, Texas and New Mexico the summer to recover our investment in the Hale wind project as well as other SPS capital projects and Minnesota in November. 
With that, I'll wrap up. In summer, we had a strong first quarter. We increased our dividend for the 16th straight year. We reached constructive settlements in our rate case in New Mexico and in the CPCN proceeding for our Cheyenne Ridge wind farm. This constructive legislation that's been considered in our various states and we are well positioned to deliver on our 2019 ongoing earnings guidance range of $2.55 to $2.65 per share. Our 5% to 7% earnings growth objective and our 5% to 7% dividend growth objective. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we'll now take questions."

Today we reported first quarter earnings of $0.61 per share compared to $0.57 per share last year. We're pleased with the strong start to the year and we are well positioned to deliver on our 2019 guidance and our long-term financial objectives. 
So let me start with some quick highlights from the quarter. In February, we increased our quarterly dividend by $2.5 per share or 6.6%. This represents an annualized increase of $0.10 per share, which is a step up over historic levels of $0.08 per share. We are growing the dividend at an increased rate due to our strong transparent earnings growth profile and the flexibility afforded by our low dividend payout ratio. 
We also continue to make strong progress on our Steel for Fuel strategy, with almost 3,000 megawatts of new wind that has received regulatory approval and is moving forward in the construction process. 
In Colorado, the commission approved our certificate of need for our Cheyenne Ridge wind farm based on a constructive settlement, which includes a construction cost cap and a customer protection mechanism. We will recover costs upon completion through riders until the next rate case after the project goes into service. 
Our Hale project in Texas is on track with construction expected to be completed in June on time and within budget. And we are waiting for final generation interconnect studies and agreements for our Sagamore project in New Mexico and our Crowned Ridge 3 project in Minnesota. We expect construction to begin later this year. 
All of our other wind projects are in various stages of permitting and construction and will be completed as expected between 2019 and 2021. These projects highlight the excellent planning, construction and project management skills of our employees. 
In December, we were the first utility in the United States to announce plans to achieve an 80% carbon reduction by 2030 and a 100% carbon-free electricity by 2050. We're excited to work with stakeholders as we continue the Clean Energy Transition, while providing reliable service and keeping bills low. The legislative session is still ongoing in most of our states and we continue to work with stakeholders on various legislative initiatives that would impact the utility sector. 
In Texas, there are bills under consideration that will provide the right of first refusal on new transmission projects and rider recovery for new generation and AMI investment. The outlook for these proposals is positive and points to a more constructive regulatory environment in Texas. 
In New Mexico, the Energy Transition Act was signed into law by the governor in March. This law targets a 50% renewable portfolio standard by 2030 and a 100% carbon-free electricity by 2045. We believe we are well positioned to meet the 2030 milestone. 
In Colorado, there's proposed legislation that quantifies our plans to achieve 100% carbon-free electricity by 2050 and 80% carbon reduction by 2030. In addition, the bill is expected to provide for voluntary securitization as an option and it targets utility ownership of 50% of all generation and provides customer protections. 
I'm proud to be leading the Clean Energy Transition and support these bills, which are consistent with our carbon reduction objectives and provide positive benefits for our customers and our shareholders. This is another example of our strong alignment with policymakers in our states. 
I also want to recognize the efforts of our employees as they worked through the polar vortex and the bomb cyclone that hit our various states. They did a great job working in extreme conditions to restore service in record time. 
I'll now turn the call over to Bob and he'll provide more detail on the quarterly results and our regulatory plans."

We had a strong first quarter with earnings of $0.61 per share compared with $0.57 per share in 2018.

We had a strong first quarter with earnings of $0.61 per share compared with $0.57 per share in 2018. Most significant earnings drivers for the quarter, include high electric and natural gas margins, which increased earnings by $0.15 per share, including the impact of favorable weather and various regulatory outcomes and riders to recover our capital investments, partially offset by wind production tax credits that flow back to our customers. 
In addition, our lower effective tax rate increased earnings by $0.06 per share. However, the majority of the lower effective tax rate is due to an increase in production tax benefit credits, which flow back to our customers through electric margin and tax reform impacts both of which are largely earnings neutral. 
Offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation interests and other taxes reflecting our capital investment program, which reduced earnings by $0.11 per share and higher O&M expenses, which decreased earnings by $0.06 per share. Please note that we've calculated the EPS deviations for both years presented based on a blended statutory tax rate of 25% following the implementation of tax reform. 
Turning to sales. Our weather adjusted electric sales increased to 0.5% in the first quarter, reflecting continued strong customer growth, partially offset by lower use per customer. Weather adjusted natural gas sales increased 2.5% for the quarter as a result of strong customer growth and higher use per customer. 
For 2019, we're still anticipating relative flat consolidated electric sales, which reflects some discrete known declines in large customer usage and expectations of lower use per customer in the residential sector. For natural gas, we expect slightly positive sales in 2009 (sic ) [ 2019 ] reflecting continued growth in C&I and residential loads. 
Turning to expenses. Our O&M expenses increased by $40 million reflecting costs from substantial winter storms, the in-servicing of the Rush Creek wind farm, higher business systems and benefit costs and the timing of plant overhauls. Over the last 5 years, we've increased our rate base by approximately 7% annually, while keeping O&M expenses relatively flat. Over the same time period, customer expectations and risk eversion have increased. As a result, we're increasing our O&M spending in strategic areas to enhance the customer experience, increase cyber security and reduce systematic risk in our operations. And we remain committed to our long-term objective of improving operating efficiencies and taking other costs out of the business for the benefit of our customers. Therefore, we've raised our 2019 O&M guidance, which reflects a decline of approximately 2% from 2018 levels. 
We expect to offset the impact to slightly higher O&M and are confident in our ability to deliver earnings in our guidance range consistent with our plan. 
Next let me provide a quick regulatory update. In March, SPS reached a settlement with the New Mexico commission resulting in a revised rate order, which eliminated the retroactive TCJA refund, increase the equity ratio to 53.97% from the previously authorized 51% and increase the ROE to 9.56% from the previously authorized 9.1%. The revised order is expected to increase annual revenue by $4.5 million effective in March of 2019. 
We believe this is a constructive settlement and a sign of progress in New Mexico. In addition, we're planning to file electric cases in Colorado later in the second quarter, Texas and New Mexico this summer to recover our investment in the Hale Wind project as well as other SPS capital projects and Minnesota in November. 
With that, I'll wrap up. In summer, we had a strong first quarter. We increased our dividend for the 16th straight year. We reached constructive settlements in our rate case in New Mexico and in the CPCN proceeding for our Cheyenne Ridge wind farm. This constructive legislation that's being considered in our various states and we are well positioned to deliver on our 2019 ongoing earnings guidance range of $2.55 to $2.65 per share.

Today we reported first quarter earnings of $0.61 per share compared to $0.57 per share last year.

Today we reported first quarter earnings of $0.61 per share compared to $0.57 per share last year. We're pleased with the strong start to the year and we are well positioned to deliver on our 2019 guidance and our long-term financial objectives. 
So let me start with some quick highlights from the quarter. In February, we increased our quarterly dividend by $2.5 per share or 6.6%. This represents an annualized increase of $0.10 per share, which is a step up over historic levels of $0.08 per share. We are growing the dividend at an increased rate due to our strong transparent earnings growth profile and the flexibility afforded by our low dividend payout ratio. 
We also continue to make strong progress on our Steel for Fuel strategy, with almost 3,000 megawatts of new wind that has received regulatory approval and is moving forward in the construction process. 
In Colorado, the commission approved our certificate of need for our Cheyenne Ridge wind farm based on a constructive settlement, which includes a construction cost cap and a customer protection mechanism. We will recover costs upon completion through riders until the next rate case after the project goes into service. 
Our Hale project in Texas is on track with construction expected to be completed in June on time and within budget. And we are waiting for final generation interconnect studies and agreements for our Sagamore project in New Mexico and our Crowned Ridge 3 project in Minnesota. We expect construction to begin later this year. 
All of our other wind projects are in various stages of permitting and construction and will be completed as expected between 2019 and 2021. These projects highlight the excellent planning, construction and project management skills of our employees. 
In December, we were the first utility in the United States to announce plans to achieve an 80% carbon reduction by 2030 and a 100% carbon-free electricity by 2050. We're excited to work with stakeholders as we continue the Clean Energy Transition, while providing reliable service and keeping bills low. The legislative session is still ongoing in most of our states and we continue to work with stakeholders on various legislative initiatives that would impact the utility sector. 
In Texas, there are bills under consideration that will provide the right of first refusal on new transmission projects and rider recovery for new generation and AMI investment. The outlook for these proposals is positive and points to a more constructive regulatory environment in Texas. 
In New Mexico, the Energy Transition Act was signed into law by the governor in March. This law targets a 50% renewable portfolio standard by 2030 and a 100% carbon-free electricity by 2045. We believe we are well positioned to meet the 2030 milestone. 
In Colorado, there's proposed legislation that quantifies our plans to achieve 100% carbon-free electricity by 2050 and 80% carbon reduction by 2030. In addition, the bill is expected to provide for voluntary securitization as an option and it targets utility ownership of 50% of all generation and provides customer protections. 
I'm proud to be leading the Clean Energy Transition and support these bills, which are consistent with our carbon reduction objectives and provide positive benefits for our customers and our shareholders. This is another example of our strong alignment with policymakers in our states. 
I also want to recognize the efforts of our employees as they worked through the polar vortex and the bomb cyclone that hit our various states. They did a great job working in extreme conditions to restore service in record time. 
I'll now turn the call over to Bob and he'll provide more detail on the quarterly results and our regulatory plans."
527542,608461268,1705372,"Xcel Energy Inc., Q1 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 25, 2019",2019-04-25,"Earnings Calls","Xcel Energy Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ben, and good morning to everyone. We had a strong first quarter with earnings of $0.61 per share compared with $0.57 per share in 2018. Most significant earnings drivers for the quarter, include high electric and natural gas margins, which increa",682,"Thanks, Ben, and good morning to everyone. We had a strong first quarter with earnings of $0.61 per share compared with $0.57 per share in 2018. Most significant earnings drivers for the quarter, include high electric and natural gas margins, which increased earnings by $0.15 per share, including the impact of favorable weather and various regulatory outcomes and riders to recover our capital investments, partially offset by wind production tax credits that flow back to our customers. 
In addition, our lower effective tax rate increased earnings by $0.06 per share. However, the majority of the lower effective tax rate is due to an increase in production tax credits, which flow back to our customers through electric margin and tax reform impacts both of which are largely earnings neutral. 
Offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation interests and other taxes reflecting our capital investment program, which reduced earnings by $0.11 per share and higher O&M expenses, which decreased earnings by $0.06 per share. Please note that we've calculated the EPS deviations for both years presented based on a blended statutory tax rate of 25% following the implementation of tax reform. 
Turning to sales. Our weather adjusted electric sales increased to 0.5% in the first quarter, reflecting continued strong customer growth, partially offset by lower use per customer. Weather adjusted natural gas sales increased 2.5% for the quarter as a result of strong customer growth and higher use per customer. 
For 2019, we're still anticipating relative flat consolidated electric sales, which reflects some discrete known declines in large customer usage and expectations of lower use per customer in the residential sector. For natural gas, we expect slightly positive sales in 2009 (sic ) [ 2019 ] reflecting continued growth in C&I and residential loads. 
Turning to expenses. Our O&M expenses increased by $40 million reflecting costs from substantial winter storms, the in-servicing of the Rush Creek wind farm, higher business systems and benefit costs and the timing of plant overhauls. Over the last 5 years, we've increased our rate base by approximately 7% annually, while keeping O&M expenses relatively flat. Over the same time period, customer expectations and risk aversion have increased. As a result, we're increasing our O&M spending in strategic areas to enhance the customer experience, increase cyber security and reduce systematic risk in our operations. And we remain committed to our long-term objective of improving operating efficiencies and taking other costs out of the business for the benefit of our customers. Therefore, we've raised our 2019 O&M guidance, which reflects a decline of approximately 2% from 2018 levels. 
We expect to offset the impact of the slightly higher O&M and are confident in our ability to deliver earnings in our guidance range consistent with our plan. 
Next let me provide a quick regulatory update. In March, SPS reached a settlement with the New Mexico commission resulting in a revised rate order, which eliminated the retroactive TCJA refund, increase the equity ratio to 53.97% from the previously authorized 51% and increase the ROE to 9.56% from the previously authorized 9.1%. The revised order is expected to increase annual revenue by $4.5 million effective in March of 2019. 
We believe this is a constructive settlement and a sign of progress in New Mexico. In addition, we're planning to file electric cases in Colorado later in the second quarter, Texas and New Mexico this summer to recover our investment in the Hale Wind project as well as other SPS capital projects and Minnesota in November. 
With that, I'll wrap up. In summer, we had a strong first quarter. We increased our dividend for the 16th straight year. We reached constructive settlements in our rate case in New Mexico and in the CPCN proceeding for our Cheyenne Ridge wind farm. This constructive legislation that's being considered in our various states and we are well positioned to deliver on our 2019 ongoing earnings guidance range of $2.55 to $2.65 per share. Our 5% to 7% earnings growth objective and our 5% to 7% dividend growth objective. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we'll now take questions."

Today we reported first quarter earnings of $0.61 per share compared to $0.57 per share last year.

Today we reported first quarter earnings of $0.61 per share compared to $0.57 per share last year. We're pleased with the strong start to the year and we are well positioned to deliver on our 2019 guidance and our long-term financial objectives. 
So let me start with some quick highlights from the quarter. In February, we increased our quarterly dividend by $2.5 per share or 6.6%. This represents an annualized increase of $0.10 per share, which is a step up over historic levels of $0.08 per share. We are growing the dividend at an increased rate due to our strong transparent earnings growth profile and the flexibility afforded by our low dividend payout ratio. 
We also continue to make strong progress on our Steel for Fuel strategy, with almost 3,000 megawatts of new wind that has received regulatory approval and is moving forward in the construction process. In Colorado, the commission approved our certificate of need for our Cheyenne Ridge wind farm based on a constructive settlement, which includes a construction cost cap and a customer protection mechanism. We will recover costs upon completion through riders until the next rate case after the project goes into service. 
Our Hale project in Texas is on track with construction expected to be completed in June on time and within budget. And we are waiting for final generation interconnect studies and agreements for our Sagamore project in New Mexico and our Crowned Ridge 3 project in Minnesota. We expect construction to begin later this year. 
All of our other wind projects are in various stages of permitting and construction and will be completed as expected between 2019 and 2021. These projects highlight the excellent planning, construction and project management skills of our employees. 
In December, we were the first utility in the United States to announce plans to achieve an 80% carbon reduction by 2030 and a 100% carbon-free electricity by 2050. We're excited to work with stakeholders as we continue the Clean Energy Transition, while providing reliable service and keeping bills low. The legislative session is still ongoing in most of our states and we continue to work with stakeholders on various legislative initiatives that would impact the utility sector. 
In Texas, there are bills under consideration that will provide the right of first refusal on new transmission projects and rider recovery for new generation and AMI investment. The outlook for these proposals is positive and points to a more constructive regulatory environment in Texas. 
In New Mexico, the Energy Transition Act was signed into law by the governor in March. This law targets a 50% renewable portfolio standard by 2030 and a 100% carbon-free electricity by 2045. We believe we are well positioned to meet the 2030 milestone. 
In Colorado, there's proposed legislation that quantifies our plans to achieve 100% carbon-free electricity by 2050 and 80% carbon reduction by 2030. In addition, the bill is expected to provide for voluntary securitization as an option and it targets utility ownership of 50% of all generation and provides customer protections. 
I'm proud to be leading the Clean Energy Transition and support these bills, which are consistent with our carbon reduction objectives and provide positive benefits for our customers and our shareholders. This is another example of our strong alignment with policymakers in our states. I also want to recognize the efforts of our employees as they worked through the polar vortex and the bomb cyclone that hit our various states. They did a great job working in extreme conditions to restore service in record time. 
I'll now turn the call over to Bob and he'll provide more detail on the quarterly results and our regulatory plans."
527542,608461268,1707489,"Xcel Energy Inc., Q1 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 25, 2019",2019-04-25,"Earnings Calls","Xcel Energy Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ben, and good morning to everyone. We had a strong first quarter with earnings of $0.61 per share compared with $0.57 per share in 2018. Most significant earnings drivers for the quarter, include high electric and natural gas margins, which increa",682,"Thanks, Ben, and good morning to everyone. We had a strong first quarter with earnings of $0.61 per share compared with $0.57 per share in 2018. Most significant earnings drivers for the quarter, include high electric and natural gas margins, which increased earnings by $0.15 per share, including the impact of favorable weather and various regulatory outcomes and riders to recover our capital investments, partially offset by wind production tax credits that flow back to our customers. 
In addition, our lower effective tax rate increased earnings by $0.06 per share. However, the majority of the lower effective tax rate is due to an increase in production tax credits, which flow back to our customers through electric margin and tax reform impacts both of which are largely earnings neutral. 
Offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation interests and other taxes reflecting our capital investment program, which reduced earnings by $0.11 per share and higher O&M expenses, which decreased earnings by $0.06 per share. Please note that we've calculated the EPS deviations for both years presented based on a blended statutory tax rate of 25% following the implementation of tax reform. 
Turning to sales. Our weather adjusted electric sales increased to 0.5% in the first quarter, reflecting continued strong customer growth, partially offset by lower use per customer. Weather adjusted natural gas sales increased 2.5% for the quarter as a result of strong customer growth and higher use per customer. 
For 2019, we're still anticipating relative flat consolidated electric sales, which reflects some discrete known declines in large customer usage and expectations of lower use per customer in the residential sector. For natural gas, we expect slightly positive sales in 2009 (sic ) [ 2019 ] reflecting continued growth in C&I and residential loads. 
Turning to expenses. Our O&M expenses increased by $40 million reflecting costs from substantial winter storms, the in-servicing of the Rush Creek wind farm, higher business systems and benefit costs and the timing of plant overhauls. Over the last 5 years, we've increased our rate base by approximately 7% annually, while keeping O&M expenses relatively flat. Over the same time period, customer expectations and risk aversion have increased. As a result, we're increasing our O&M spending in strategic areas to enhance the customer experience, increase cyber security and reduce systematic risk in our operations. 
And we remain committed to our long-term objective of improving operating efficiencies and taking other costs out of the business for the benefit of our customers. Therefore, we've raised our 2019 O&M guidance, which reflects a decline of approximately 2% from 2018 levels. We expect to offset the impact of the slightly higher O&M and are confident in our ability to deliver earnings in our guidance range consistent with our plan. 
Next let me provide a quick regulatory update. In March, SPS reached a settlement with the New Mexico commission resulting in a revised rate order, which eliminated the retroactive TCJA refund, increase the equity ratio to 53.97% from the previously authorized 51% and increase the ROE to 9.56% from the previously authorized 9.1%. The revised order is expected to increase annual revenue by $4.5 million effective in March of 2019. 
We believe this is a constructive settlement and a sign of progress in New Mexico. In addition, we're planning to file electric cases in Colorado later in the second quarter, Texas and New Mexico this summer to recover our investment in the Hale Wind project as well as other SPS capital projects and Minnesota in November. 
With that, I'll wrap up. In summer, we had a strong first quarter. We increased our dividend for the 16th straight year. We reached constructive settlements in our rate case in New Mexico and in the CPCN proceeding for our Cheyenne Ridge wind farm. This constructive legislation that's being considered in our various states and we are well positioned to deliver on our 2019 ongoing earnings guidance range of $2.55 to $2.65 per share. Our 5% to 7% earnings growth objective and our 5% to 7% dividend growth objective. This concludes our prepared remarks.

Today, we reported second quarter earnings of $0.46 per share compared to $0.52 per share last year. Our year-to-date earnings are on track, and we are well positioned to deliver earnings at or above the midpoint of our 2019 guidance range. Bob will walk you through the favorable timing differences in the second half of the year in a few minutes, but we are very confident that we will deliver on our financial objectives as we have in the past.
So let me start with some quick highlights from the quarter. In July, we filed our Upper Midwest resource plan, which runs through 2034. Our preferred plan, which is supported by a partial settlement with various environmental and labor groups, includes the following key points: the early retirement of coal plants, starting with King in 2028, followed by Sherco 3 in 2030. By the end of 2030, we will have completely exited coal in the Upper Midwest.
The plan also calls for an extension of the life of the Monticello nuclear plant from 2030 to 2040. It includes the acquisition of Mankato combined cycle natural gas facility and the construction of a combined cycle natural gas plant at Sherco site. The plant adds an additional 4,000 megawatts of solar and 1,200 megawatts of wind to replacement.
Finally, we will also add 1,700 megawatts of firm peaking capacity post the 2030 time frame. Our preferred plan would result in an 80% carbon reduction by 2030 and puts NSP on a path to be 100% carbon-free by 2050. We are excited by the opportunity to create a cleaner sustainable energy future for our customers.
We also continue to make strong progress on our steel-for-fuel strategy. In June, our 478-megawatt Hale Wind farm went into service in Texas. The project was completed on time and under budget. Our customers will see substantial savings over its life. All of our other wind projects are in various stages of permitting and construction, and we expect they will be completed between 2019 and 2021. These projects highlight the excellent planning, construction and project management skills of our employees.
The legislative sessions are now completed in our states, and there were some important laws that were passed. In Texas, 3 bills passed: a bill that provides the right of first refusal on new transmission projects; a bill that provides right of recovery for new generation; and a bill that provides right of recovery for AMI investment. These bills point to a more constructive regulatory environment in Texas.
In Colorado, legislation passed that classified our plans to achieve 100% carbon-free electricity by 2050 and an 80% carbon reduction by 2030. In addition, the bill provides for voluntary securitization as an option and targets utility ownership of 50% of all generation. Also in Colorado, a bill passed that allows us to own EV infrastructure.
Finally, in New Mexico, the Energy Transition Act was passed. This rule targets a 50% renewable portfolio standard by 2030 and 100% carbon-free electricity by 2045. We are well positioned to meet the 2030 milestone.
We are proud to be leading the clean energy transition, and the bills I discussed are consistent with our carbon-reduction objectives and reflect our strong alignment with policymakers in our states.
Finally, I'm proud to announce that Xcel Energy has been named to the 2019 Military Times Best for Vest Employers ranking. This is the 6th straight year we've received this honor. In 2013, we set a goal to have 10% of new hires to be veterans, and the company has reached that goal every year. Xcel Energy currently employs more than 1,000 veterans, nearly 10% of our workforce. It's an honor to have these men and women in our workforce. Our veterans bring strong leadership, teamwork and experience to their job; their dedication and passion for service deliver value for our customers every day.
So now I'll turn it over to Bob Frenzel, who's a Navy vet, to provide you more detail on the quarterly results and regulatory plans. Bob?"
527542,626526131,1787509,"Xcel Energy Inc., Q2 2019 Earnings Call, Aug 01, 2019",2019-08-01,"Earnings Calls","Xcel Energy Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ben, and good morning, everyone. We recorded second quarter earnings or $0.46 per share compared with $0.52 per share in 2018. The 2019 results reflect $0.05 of adverse weather impact on the quarterly comparison.The most significant earnings dri",1074,"Thanks, Ben, and good morning, everyone. We recorded second quarter earnings or $0.46 per share compared with $0.52 per share in 2018. The 2019 results reflect $0.05 of adverse weather impact on the quarterly comparison.
The most significant earnings driver for the quarter include higher electric and natural gas margins, which increased earnings by $0.09 per share, including various regulatory outcomes and writers to recover our capital investments, which was partially offset by $0.05 per share of unfavorable weather.
In addition, our lower effective tax rate increased earnings by $0.03 per share. However, the majority of the lower ETR is due to an increase in production tax credits, which flow back to customers through electric margin, and tax reform impacts, both of which are largely earnings neutral. Offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation, interest and other taxes, reflecting our capital investment program, which reduced earnings by $0.12 per share. And higher O&M expenses decreased earnings by $0.01 per share.
Turning to sales. Our year-to-date weather-adjusted electric sales increased by 0.4%, reflecting continued strong customer growth, partially offset by lower use per customer. Year-to-date weather-adjusted natural gas sales increased 3% as a result of strong customer growth and higher use per customer. For 2019, we anticipate slightly favorable consolidated electric sales, which reflects some of the favorable year-to-date sales and some discrete known declines in large customer usage and expectations of lower use per customer in the residential sector. For natural gas, we've increased our 2019 sales guidance to 2% to 3% growth to reflect strong year-to-date performance.
Turning to O&M. Our quarterly expenses increased by $8 million, reflecting storm costs, natural gas pipeline maintenance and increased IT spend to modernize our business systems that support our strategy to enhance the customer experience. Our year-to-date O&M expenses are above last year largely due to expense timing but also due to higher-than-expected storm costs in 2019. We expect lower plant outage in nuclear operation cost in the second half of 2019. And as a reminder, we increased our O&M spending in the second half of 2018 due to the impact of hot weather as well as incurring costs for environmental remediation and business efficiency improvements.
Accordingly, we reiterate our guidance that full year 2019 O&M expenses will be approximately 2% lower than 2018's levels.
Next, let me provide a quick regulatory update. In May of 2019, PSCo filed an unopposed settlement agreement in its Colorado steam rate case. The settlement reflects a rate increase of $6.6 million, an equity ratio of 56%, an ROE of 9.67% for AFUDC purposes and utilization of TCJA benefits. New tax rates would occur in 2 steps: in 2019 and October of 2020. The administrative law judge has recommended approval of the settlement, which is pending at Colorado commission decision.
In May of 2019, PSCo also filed an electric rate case in Colorado, seeking an increase of $158 million or 5.7% based on historic test year with a capital reach forward for 2019 capital expenditures, an equity ratio of 56.46% and an ROE of 10.35%. The request reflects capital investment for our advanced group initiative and changes in depreciation rates, both of which were previously approved by the commission. PSCo's requested rate is effective in January of 2020.
We also reached a settlement in Wisconsin, which will maintain current electric rates through 2021 and result in a modest natural gas rate decrease. The settlement is pending a commission decision.
In July 2019, SPS filed an electric rate case in New Mexico, seeking an increase of $51 million based on historic test year with a capital reach forward, an ROE of 10.35% and an equity ratio of 54.8%. The request largely reflects capital investment for the Hale Wind project as well as other capital invested to support strong growth in the region. We anticipate rates going into effect in the second half of 2020.
In addition, we are planning to file an electric rate case in Texas in August to recover our investment in the Hale Wind project as well as other SPS capital projects. Both the Texas and New Mexico commissions previously granted a Certificate of Need and recovery mechanisms for the Hale Wind farm.
Next, I want to give a quick update on our PPA buyout efforts. During the quarter, we reached a partial settlement with various environmental and labor groups that support the Mankato combined cycle acquisition. Last week, the Department of Commerce and the Office of the Attorney General filed comments recommending against the acquisition, however, their recommendations included alternate customer protection mechanisms if the commission approves the acquisition. We believe we've demonstrated the economics of ownership were still compelling despite the disagreements on modeling highlighted by the comments. We anticipate hearings and a commission decision in September. We are cautiously optimistic the commission will approve the acquisition based on the anticipated customer savings and the long-term value to the state that our ownership of the facility would create.
Additionally, we are actively working across our 4 operating companies to identify other customer beneficial asset acquisition opportunities and will work proactively with our stakeholders to identify the cost, the environmental and the labor benefits of these transactions, and we will share these developments as they progress.
With that, I'll wrap up. We had a solid second quarter and are right on our budget for first half earnings. Weather and O&M were slightly unfavorable to our budget, but sales and margin were slightly favorable to offset. In the second half of the year, we expect year-over-year favorability in O&M, margin and sales. In addition, depreciation and amortization expense will moderate due to the timing of lower levels of prepaid pension amortization in Colorado. As a result, we're very confident in our ability to deliver earnings at or above the midpoint of our guidance range.
In summary, we've filed our preferred plan in the Minnesota resource planning proceeding, which will continue our clean energy transition and if approved, will allow us to reduce carbon emissions by more than 80% by 2030. We completed the Hale Wind farm on time and under budget. We reached constructive rate settlements in Wisconsin and our steam case in Colorado. Constructive legislation was passed in Colorado, Texas and New Mexico, and we are well positioned to deliver on our 2019 earnings guidance and our long-term objectives of 5% to 7% earnings and dividend growth.

And congratulations on the results and being able to maintain the year-end guidance and maybe on the upper end of the range. I had a few quick questions. And the first one, I was wondering if you could provide any more regulatory environment color specifically around New Mexico and Colorado. In New Mexico, I know that PNM, for example, is potentially struggling around whether securitization will apply to its future plans. I was wondering if we should interpret that as the commission looking at different rate cases with a fine-tooth comb. And then in Colorado as well, I was just hoping for a little more color over there."

So I think it continues to be very constructive, and it helps when you're keeping your bills -- total bills very flat. In fact, in Colorado, they're less today than they were 4, 5 years ago. So I think we're in very good position in Colorado.
Moving to New Mexico. First of all, SPS, with the overall growth in both Texas and New Mexico, is just really stunning, and it's creating a lot of opportunities for us. And as I mentioned, really pleased with some of the bills that were passed in Texas that support a better regulatory environment. We are aligned in New Mexico. Now securitization for us in New Mexico is not a very big deal. So I can't give you much more color on that. But I do like the -- I actually think the new administration and some of the changes in the commission are very positive for New Mexico and positive for SPS overall."

That's associated with the solar asset, and it's associated with the solar asset, Paul, because you want -- because that allows for the 30% ITC to be recognized. And I did put it on parity with peakers. I think batteries will continue to fall on price just like I think renewables will continue to fall on price and over time overcome the roll-off of the tax benefits. And yes, storage can be the new peakers but only to a certain degree of penetration and saturation. I mean because, as you know, we need to plan for much more than a 4-hour, even an 8-hour event. So I think the initial tranches of batteries are very viable and you planning basis, you give them equal weight as you would with a traditional CT peaker. But the more penetration you have in batteries, the more you shave off of that very peak load, you start to lose some of the planning value of batteries. And not to get too technical on you, but we're aware of that. Of course, batteries will have other roles on the grid, including supporting the grid reliability, and we're looking at those alternatives. And all of that will be baked into our plans as we move forward. But you cannot replace all peaking needs with batteries. That's very clear."

Today, we reported second quarter earnings of $0.46 per share compared to $0.52 per share last year. Our year-to-date earnings are on track, and we are well positioned to deliver earnings at our above the midpoint of our 2019 guidance range. Bob will walk you through the favorable timing differences in the second half of the year in a few minutes, but we are very confident that we will deliver on our financial objectives as we have in the past.
So let me start with some quick highlights from the quarter. In July, we filed our Upper Midwest Resource Plan, which runs through 2034. Our preferred plan, which is supported by a partial settlement with various environmental and labor groups, includes the following key points: the early retirement of coal plants, starting with King in 2028, followed by Sherco 3 in 2030. By the end of 2030, we will have completely exited pole in the Upper Midwest. 
The plan also calls for an extension of the life of the Monticello nuclear plant from 2020 to 2040. It includes the acquisition of Mankato combined cycle natural gas facility and the construction of the combined cycle natural gas plant at Sherco site. The plant adds an additional 4,000 megawatts of solar and 1,200 megawatts of wind to replacement. 
Finally, we will also add 1,700 megawatts of firm peaking capacity post the 20130 time frame. Our preferred plan would result in an 80% carbon reduction by 2030 and puts NSP on a path to be 100% carbon free by 2050. We are excited by the opportunity to create a cleaner sustainable energy future for our customers.
We also continue to make strong progress on our steal for a fuel strategy. In June, our 478-megawatt Hale Wind farm went into service in Texas. The project was completed on time and under budget. Our customers will see substantial savings over its life. All of our other wind projects are in various stages of permitting and construction, and we expect they will be completed between 2019 and 2021. These projects highlight the excellent planning, construction and project management skills of our employees.
While legislative sessions are now completed in our states and there were some important laws that were passed. In Texas, 3 bills passed, a bill that provides the right of first refusal on new transmission projects; a bill that provides right of recovery for a new generation; and a bill that provides right of recovery for AMI investment. 
These bills point to a more constructive regulatory environment in Texas. In Colorado, legislation passed the classified our plans to achieve 100% carbon-free electricity by 2050 and an 80% carbon reduction by 2030. In addition, the bill provides for voluntary securitization as an option and targets utility ownership of 50% of all generation. 
Also in Colorado, a bill passed that allows us to own EV infrastructure. Finally, in New Mexico, the Energy Transition Act was passed. This will all target a 50% renewable portfolio standard by 2030 and 100% carbon-free electricity by 2045. We are well positioned to meet the 2030 milestone.
We are proud to be leading the clean energy transition, and the bills I discussed are consistent with our carbon reduction objectives and reflect our strong alignment with policymakers in our states.
Finally, I'm proud to announce that Xcel Energy has been named to the 2019 Military Times Best-for-Best Employers Ranking. This is the 6th straight year we've received this honor. In 2013, we set a goal to have 10% of new hires to be veterans and the company has reached that goal every year. Xcel Energy currently employs more than 1,000 veterans, nearly 10% of our workforce. It's an honor to have these men and women in our workforce. Our veterans bring strong leadership, teamwork and experience to their job, their dedication and passion for service deliver value for our customers every day. So now I'll turn it over to Bob Frenzel, who's a Navy vet to provide you more detail on the current results and regulatory plans. Bob?"

We recorded second quarter earnings or $0.46 per share, compared with $0.52 per share in 2018. The 2019 results reflect $0.05 of adverse weather impact on the quarterly comparison.The most significant earnings dr",1069,"Thanks, Ben, and good morning, everyone. We recorded second quarter earnings or $0.46 per share, compared with $0.52 per share in 2018. The 2019 results reflect $0.05 of adverse weather impact on the quarterly comparison.
The most significant earnings driver for the quarter include higher electric and natural gas margins, which increased earnings by $0.09 per share, including various regulatory outcomes and writers to recover our capital investments, which was partially offset by $0.05 per share of unfavorable weather. 
In addition, our lower effective tax rate increased earnings by $0.03 per share. However, the majority of the lower EPR is due to an increase in production tax credits, which flow back to customers through electric margin and tax reform impact, both of which are largely earnings neutral. Ofsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation, interest and other taxes reflecting our capital investment program, which reduced earnings by $0.12 per share. And higher O&M expenses decreased earnings by $0.01 per share.
Turning to sales. Our year-to-date weather adjusted electric sales increased by 0.4%, reflecting continued strong customer growth, partially offset by lower use for customer. Year-to-date, weather-adjusted natural gas sales increased 3% as a result of strong customer growth and higher use per customer. For 2019, we anticipate slightly favorable consolidated electric sales, which reflect some of the favorable year-to-date sales and some discrete known declines in large customer usage and expectations of lower use per customer in the residential sector. For natural gas, we've increased our 2019 sales guidance to 2% to 3% growth to reflect strong year-to-date performance.
Turning to O&M. Our quarterly expenses increased by $8 million, reflecting storm costs, natural gas pipeline maintenance and increased IT spend to modernize our business systems that support our strategy to enhance the customer experience. Our year-to-date O&M expenses are above last year, largely due to expense timing but also due to higher-than-expected storm cost in 2019. We expect lower plant outage in nuclear operation cost in the second half of 2019. And as a reminder, we increased our O&M spending in the second half of 2018 due to the impact of hot weather as well as incurring costs for environmental remediation and business efficiency improvements.
Accordingly, we reiterate our guidance at full year 2019 O&M expenses will be approximately 2% lower than 2018's levels.
Next, we will provide a quick regulatory update. In May of 2019, PSCo filed an unopposed settlement agreement in its Colorado steam rate case. The settlement rate increase of $6.6 million and equity ratio of 56% and ROE of 9.67% for AFUDC purposes and utilization of TCJA benefits. New tax rates would occur 2 steps in 2019 in October 2020. The administrative law judge has recommended approval of the settlement, which is pending at Colorado Commission Decision.
In May of 2019, PSCo also filed an electric rate case in Colorado, seeking an increase of $158 million or 5.7%. Based on historic test year with a capital reach forward for 2019 capital expenditures, and equity ratio of 56.46% and an ROE of 10.35%. The request reflects capital investment for our advanced good initiative and changes in depreciation rates, both of which were previously approved by the commission. PSCo's requested rates is effective in January of 2020.
We also reached settlement at Wisconsin, which will maintain current electric rates through 2021 and result in modest natural gas rate decrease. The settlement is pending a commission decision.
In July 2019, SPS filed an electric rate case in New Mexico, seeking an increase of $51 million based on historic test year with a capital reach forward, an ROE of 10.35% and an equity ratio of 54.8%. The request largely reflects capital investment for the Hale Wind project, as well as other capital invested to support strong growth in the region. We anticipate rates going into effect in the second half of 2020.
In addition, we're planning to file an electric rate case in Texas in August to recover our investment in the Hale Wind project as well as other SPS capital projects. Both the Texas and New Mexico commissions previously granted a certificate of need and recovery mechanisms for the Hale Wind farm.
Next, I want to give a quick update on our PPA buyout efforts. During the quarter we reached a partial settlement with various environmental and labor groups that support the Mankato combined cycle acquisition. Last week, the Department of Commerce and the office of the Attorney General filed comments recommending against the acquisition, however, their recommendations included ultimate customer protection mechanisms if the commission approves the acquisition. We believe we've demonstrated the economics of ownership were still compelling despite the disagreements on modeling highlighted by the comments. We anticipate hearings and a commission decision in September. We are cautiously optimistic the commission will approve the acquisition based on the anticipated customer savings and the long-term value to the state that are owners of the facility would create.
Additionally, we are actively working across our 4 operating companies to identify other customer beneficial asset acquisition opportunities and will work proactively with our stakeholders to identify the cost, the environmental and the labor benefits of these transactions, and we will share these developments as they progress.
With that, I'll wrap up. We had a solid second quarter and are right on our budget for first half, earnings. Weather and O&M were slightly unfavorable to our budget, but sales and margin were slightly favorable to offset. In the second half of the year, we expect year-over-year favorability in O&M, margin and sales. In addition, depreciation and amortization expense will moderate due to the timing of lower levels of prepaid pension amortization in Colorado. As a result, we're very confident in our ability to deliver earnings at or above the midpoint of our guidance range.
In summary, we've filed our preferred plan in the Minnesota Resource Planning Proceeding, which will continue our clean energy transition, and if approved, will allow us to reduce carbon emissions by more than 80% by 2030. We completed the Hale Wind farm on time and under budget. We reached constructive rate settlements in Wisconsin and our steam case in Colorado. Constructive legislation was passed in Colorado, Texas and New Mexico, and we are well positioned to deliver on our 2019 earnings guidance in our long-term objectives of 5% to 7% earnings and dividend growth.
This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we'll will now take questions."

So I think we're in very good position in Colorado. 
Moving to New Mexico. First of all, SPS, with the overall growth in both Texas and New Mexico, is just really stunning and it's creating a lot of opportunities for us. And as I mentioned, really pleased with some of the bills that were passed in Texas that's supported by the regulatory environment. We are aligned in New Mexico. Now securitization for us in New Mexico is not a very big deal. So I can't give you much more color on that.

That's associated with the solar asset, and it's associated with the solar asset, Paul, because that allows for the 30% ITC to be recognized. And I did put it on parity with peakers. I think batteries will continue to fall on price just like I think renewables will continue to fall in price and over time overcome the rolloff of the tax benefits. And yes, storage can be the new P curse but only to a certain degree of penetration and saturation. I mean, because as you know, we need to plan for much more than a 4-hour, even an 8-hour event. So I think the initial tranches of batteries are very viable and planning basis, you give them equal weight as you would with a traditional CT picker. But the more penetration you have in batteries, the more you shave off of that very peak load. You start to lose some of the planning value of batteries and not to get too technical on you but we're aware of that. Of course, batteries will have other roles on the grid, including supporting the grid reliability and we're looking at those alternatives. And all of that will be baked into our plans as we move forward. But you cannot replace all PT needs with batteries. That's very clear."

Today, we reported second quarter earnings of $0.46 per share compared to $0.52 per share last year. Our year-to-date earnings are on track, and we are well positioned to deliver earnings at or above the midpoint of our 2019 guidance range. Bob will walk you through the favorable timing differences in the second half of the year in a few minutes, but we are very confident that we will deliver on our financial objectives as we have in the past.
So let me start with some quick highlights from the quarter. In July, we filed our Upper Midwest Resource Plan, which runs through 2034. Our preferred plan, which is supported by a partial settlement with various environmental and labor groups, includes the following key points: the early retirement of coal plants, starting with King in 2028, followed by Sherco 3 in 2030. By the end of 2030, we will have completely exited coal in the Upper Midwest.
The plan also calls for an extension of the life of the Monticello nuclear plant from 2030 to 2040. It includes the acquisition of Mankato combined cycle natural gas facility and the construction of a combined cycle natural gas plant at the Sherco site. The plant adds an additional 4,000 megawatts of solar and 1,200 megawatts of wind replacement.
Finally, we will also add 1,700 megawatts of firm peaking capacity post the 2030 time frame. Our preferred plan would result in an 80% carbon reduction by 2030 and puts NSP on a path to be 100% carbon-free by 2050. We are excited by the opportunity to create a cleaner, sustainable energy future for our customers.
We also continue to make strong progress on our steel for fuel strategy. In June, our 478-megawatt Hale Wind farm went into service in Texas. The project was completed on time and under budget. Our customers will see substantial savings over its life. All of our other wind projects are in various stages of permitting and construction, and we expect they will be completed between 2019 and 2021. These projects highlight the excellent planning, construction and project management skills of our employees.
The legislative sessions are now completed in our states, and there were some important laws that were passed. In Texas, 3 bills passed: a bill that provides the right of first refusal on new transmission projects; a bill that provides right of recovery for new generation; and a bill that provides right of recovery for AMI investment. These bills point to a more constructive regulatory environment in Texas.
In Colorado, legislation passed that codified our plans to achieve 100% carbon-free electricity by 2050 and an 80% carbon reduction by 2030. In addition, the bill provides for voluntary securitization as an option and targets utility ownership of 50% of all generation. Also in Colorado, a bill passed that allows us to own EV infrastructure.
Finally, in New Mexico, the Energy Transition Act was passed. This rule targets a 50% renewable portfolio standard by 2030 and 100% carbon-free electricity by 2045. We are well positioned to meet the 2030 milestone.
We are proud to be leading the clean energy transition, and the bills I discussed are consistent with our carbon-reduction objectives and reflect our strong alignment with policymakers in our states.
Finally, I'm proud to announce that Xcel Energy has been named to the 2019 Military Times Best for Vets Employers ranking. This is the sixth straight year we've received this honor. In 2013, we set a goal to have 10% of new hires to be veterans, and the company has reached that goal every year. Xcel Energy currently employs more than 1,000 veterans, nearly 10% of our workforce. It's an honor to have these men and women in our workforce. Our veterans bring strong leadership, teamwork and experience to their job; their dedication and passion for service deliver value for our customers every day.
So now I'll turn it over to Bob Frenzel, who's a Navy vet, to provide you more detail on the quarterly results and regulatory plans. Bob?"

We recorded second quarter earnings of $0.46 per share compared with $0.52 per share in 2018. The 2019 results reflect $0.05 of adverse weather impact on the quarterly comparison.The most significant earnings dri",1073,"Thanks, Ben, and good morning, everyone. We recorded second quarter earnings of $0.46 per share compared with $0.52 per share in 2018. The 2019 results reflect $0.05 of adverse weather impact on the quarterly comparison.
The most significant earnings driver for the quarter include higher electric and natural gas margins, which increased earnings by $0.09 per share, including various regulatory outcomes and riders to recover our capital investments, which was partially offset by $0.05 per share of unfavorable weather.
In addition, our lower effective tax rate increased earnings by $0.03 per share. However, the majority of the lower ETR is due to an increase in production tax credits, which flow back to customers through electric margin, and tax reform impacts, both of which are largely earnings neutral. Offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation, interest and other taxes, reflecting our capital investment program, which reduced earnings by $0.12 per share. And higher O&M expenses decreased earnings by $0.01 per share.
Turning to sales. Our year-to-date weather-adjusted electric sales increased by 0.4%, reflecting continued strong customer growth, partially offset by lower use per customer. Year-to-date weather-adjusted natural gas sales increased 3% as a result of strong customer growth and higher use per customer. For 2019, we anticipate slightly favorable consolidated electric sales, which reflects some of the favorable year-to-date sales and some discrete known declines in large customer usage and expectations of lower use per customer in the residential sector. For natural gas, we've increased our 2019 sales guidance 2% to 3% growth to reflect strong year-to-date performance.
Turning to O&M. Our quarterly expenses increased by $8 million, reflecting storm costs, natural gas pipeline maintenance and increased IT spend to modernize our business systems that support our strategy to enhance the customer experience. Our year-to-date O&M expenses are above last year largely due to expense timing but also due to higher-than-expected storm costs in 2019. We expect lower plant outage in nuclear operation cost in the second half of 2019. And as a reminder, we increased our O&M spending in the second half of 2018 due to the impact of hot weather as well as incurring costs for environmental remediation and business efficiency improvements.
Accordingly, we reiterate our guidance that full year 2019 O&M expenses will be approximately 2% lower than 2018's levels.
Next, let me provide a quick regulatory update. In May of 2019, PSCo filed an unopposed settlement agreement in its Colorado steam rate case. The settlement reflects a rate increase of $6.6 million, an equity ratio of 56%, an ROE of 9.67% for AFUDC purposes and utilization of TCJA benefits. New tax rates would occur in 2 steps: in 2019 and October of 2020. The administrative law judge has recommended approval of the settlement, which is pending at Colorado Commission decision.
In May of 2019, PSCo also filed an electric rate case in Colorado, seeking an increase of $158 million or 5.7% based on historic test year with a capital reach forward for 2019 capital expenditures, an equity ratio of 56.46% and an ROE of 10.35%. The request reflects capital investment for our Advanced Grid initiative and changes in depreciation rates, both of which were previously approved by the commission. PSCo's requested rate is effective in January of 2020.
We also reached a settlement in Wisconsin, which will maintain current electric rates through 2021 and result in a modest natural gas rate decrease. The settlement is pending a commission decision.
In July 2019, SPS filed an electric rate case in New Mexico, seeking an increase of $51 million based on historic test year with a capital reach forward, an ROE of 10.35% and an equity ratio of 54.8%. The request largely reflects capital investment for the Hale Wind project as well as other capital invested to support strong growth in the region. We anticipate rates going into effect in the second half of 2020.
In addition, we are planning to file an electric rate case in Texas in August to recover our investment in the Hale Wind project as well as other SPS capital projects. Both the Texas and New Mexico commissions previously granted a Certificate of Need and recovery mechanisms for the Hale Wind farm.
Next, I want to give a quick update on our PPA buyout efforts. During the quarter, we reached a partial settlement with various environmental and labor groups that support the Mankato combined cycle acquisition. Last week, the Department of Commerce and the Office of the Attorney General filed comments recommending against the acquisition, however, their recommendations included alternate customer protection mechanisms if the commission approves the acquisition. We believe we've demonstrated the economics of ownership are still compelling despite the disagreements on modeling highlighted by the comments. We anticipate hearings and a commission decision in September. We are cautiously optimistic the commission will approve the acquisition based on the anticipated customer savings and the long-term value to the state that our ownership of the facility would create.
Additionally, we are actively working across our 4 operating companies to identify other customer beneficial asset acquisition opportunities and will work proactively with our stakeholders to identify the cost, the environmental and the labor benefits of these transactions, and we will share these developments as they progress.
With that, I'll wrap up. We had a solid second quarter and are right on our budget for first half earnings. Weather and O&M were slightly unfavorable to our budget, but sales and margin were slightly favorable to offset. In the second half of the year, we expect year-over-year favorability in O&M margin and sales. In addition, depreciation and amortization expense will moderate due to the timing of lower levels of prepaid pension amortization in Colorado. As a result, we're very confident in our ability to deliver earnings at or above the midpoint of our guidance range.
In summary, we've filed our preferred plan in the Minnesota resource planning proceeding, which will continue our clean energy transition and if approved, would allow us to reduce carbon emissions by more than 80% by 2030. We completed the Hale Wind farm on time and under budget. We reached constructive rate settlements in Wisconsin and our steam case in Colorado. Constructive legislation was passed in Colorado, Texas and New Mexico, and we are well positioned to deliver on our 2019 earnings guidance and our long-term objectives of 5% to 7% earnings and dividend growth.
This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we'll now take questions."

So I think it continues to be very constructive, and it helps when you're keeping your bills -- total bills very flat. In fact, in Colorado, they're less today than they were 4, 5 years ago. So I think we're in very good position in Colorado.
Moving to New Mexico. First of all, SPS, with the overall growth in both Texas and New Mexico is just really stunning, and it's creating a lot of opportunities for us. And as I mentioned, really pleased with some of the bills that were passed in Texas that support a better regulatory environment. We are aligned in New Mexico.

They're going to -- they'll support each other at that point. Of course, we'll also be looking at the role batteries can play on our grid, the role batteries can play with storage.

That's associated with the solar asset, and it's associated with the solar asset, Paul, because you want -- because that allows for the 30% ITC to be recognized. And I did put it on parity with peakers. I think batteries will continue to fall on price just like I think renewables will continue to fall on price and over time overcome the roll-off of the tax benefits. And yes, storage can be the new peakers but only to a certain degree of penetration and saturation. I mean because, as you know, we need to plan for much more than a 4-hour, even an 8-hour event. So I think the initial tranches of batteries are very valuable and you -- on a planning basis, you give them equal weight as you would with a traditional CT peaker. But the more penetration you have in batteries, the more you shave off that very peak load, you start to lose some of the planning value of batteries. And not to get too technical on you, but we're aware of that. Of course, batteries will have other roles on the grid, including supporting the grid reliability, and we're looking at those alternatives. And all of that will be baked into our plans as we move forward. But you cannot replace all peaking needs with batteries. That's very clear."

Today, we reported second quarter earnings of $0.46 per share compared to $0.52 per share last year. Our year-to-date earnings are on track, and we are well positioned to deliver earnings at or above the midpoint of our 2019 guidance range. Bob will walk you through the favorable timing differences in the second half of the year in a few minutes, but we are very confident that we will deliver on our financial objectives as we have in the past.
So let me start with some quick highlights from the quarter. In July, we filed our Upper Midwest Resource Plan, which runs through 2034. Our preferred plan, which is supported by a partial settlement with various environmental and labor groups, includes the following key points: the early retirement of coal plants, starting with King in 2028, followed by Sherco 3 in 2030. By the end of 2030, we will have completely exited coal in the Upper Midwest.
The plan also calls for an extension of the life of the Monticello nuclear plant from 2030 to 2040. It includes the acquisition of Mankato combined cycle natural gas facility and the construction of a combined cycle natural gas plant at the Sherco site. The plant adds an additional 4,000 megawatts of solar and 1,200 megawatts of wind replacement.
Finally, we will also add 1,700 megawatts of firm peaking capacity post the 2030 time frame. Our preferred plan would result in an 80% carbon reduction by 2030 and puts NSP on a path to be 100% carbon-free by 2050. We are excited by the opportunity to create a cleaner, sustainable energy future for our customers.
We also continue to make strong progress on our steel for fuel strategy. In June, our 478-megawatt Hale Wind farm went into service in Texas. The project was completed on time and under budget. Our customers will see substantial savings over its life. All of our other wind projects are in various stages of permitting and construction, and we expect they will be completed between 2019 and 2021. These projects highlight the excellent planning, construction and project management skills of our employees.
The legislative sessions are now completed in our states, and there were some important laws that were passed. In Texas, 3 bills passed: a bill that provides the right of first refusal on new transmission projects; a bill that provides right of recovery for new generation; and a bill that provides right of recovery for AMI investment. These bills point to a more constructive regulatory environment in Texas.
In Colorado, legislation passed that codified our plans to achieve 100% carbon-free electricity by 2050 and an 80% carbon reduction by 2030. In addition, the bill provides for voluntary securitization as an option and targets utility ownership of 50% of all generation. Also in Colorado, a bill passed that allows us to own EV infrastructure.
Finally, in New Mexico, the Energy Transition Act was passed. This rule targets a 50% renewable portfolio standard by 2030 and 100% carbon-free electricity by 2045. We are well positioned to meet the 2030 milestone.
We are proud to be leading the clean energy transition, and the bills I discussed are consistent with our carbon-reduction objectives and reflect our strong alignment with policymakers in our states.
Finally, I'm proud to announce that Xcel Energy has been named to the 2019 Military Times Best for Vets Employers ranking. This is the sixth straight year we've received this honor. In 2013, we set a goal to have 10% of new hires to be veterans, and the company has reached that goal every year. Xcel Energy currently employs more than 1,000 veterans, nearly 10% of our workforce. It's an honor to have these men and women in our workforce. Our veterans bring strong leadership, teamwork and experience to their job; their dedication and passion for service deliver value for our customers every day.
So now I'll turn it over to Bob Frenzel, who's a Navy vet, to provide you more detail on the quarterly results and regulatory plans. Bob?"
527542,626526131,1810132,"Xcel Energy Inc., Q2 2019 Earnings Call, Aug 01, 2019",2019-08-01,"Earnings Calls","Xcel Energy Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ben, and good morning, everyone. We recorded second quarter earnings of $0.46 per share compared with $0.52 per share in 2018. The 2019 results reflect $0.05 of adverse weather impact on the quarterly comparison.The most significant earnings dri",1073,"Thanks, Ben, and good morning, everyone. We recorded second quarter earnings of $0.46 per share compared with $0.52 per share in 2018. The 2019 results reflect $0.05 of adverse weather impact on the quarterly comparison.
The most significant earnings driver for the quarter include higher electric and natural gas margins, which increased earnings by $0.09 per share, including various regulatory outcomes and riders to recover our capital investments, which was partially offset by $0.05 per share of unfavorable weather.
In addition, our lower effective tax rate increased earnings by $0.03 per share. However, the majority of the lower ETR is due to an increase in production tax credits, which flow back to customers through electric margin, and tax reform impacts, both of which are largely earnings neutral. Offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation, interest and other taxes, reflecting our capital investment program, which reduced earnings by $0.12 per share. And higher O&M expenses decreased earnings by $0.01 per share.
Turning to sales. Our year-to-date weather-adjusted electric sales increased by 0.4%, reflecting continued strong customer growth partially offset by lower use per customer. Year-to-date weather-adjusted natural gas sales increased 3% as a result of strong customer growth and higher use per customer. For 2019, we anticipate slightly favorable consolidated electric sales, which reflects some of the favorable year-to-date sales and some discrete known declines in large customer usage and expectations of lower use per customer in the residential sector. For natural gas, we've increased our 2019 sales guidance 2% to 3% growth to reflect strong year-to-date performance.
Turning to O&M. Our quarterly expenses increased by $8 million, reflecting storm costs, natural gas pipeline maintenance and increased IT spend to modernize our business systems that support our strategy to enhance the customer experience. Our year-to-date O&M expenses are above last year largely due to expense timing but also due to higher-than-expected storm costs in 2019. We expect lower plant outage in nuclear operation cost in the second half of 2019. And as a reminder, we increased our O&M spending in the second half of 2018 due to the impact of hot weather as well as incurring costs for environmental remediation and business efficiency improvements.
Accordingly, we reiterate our guidance that full year 2019 O&M expenses will be approximately 2% lower than 2018's levels.
Next, let me provide a quick regulatory update. In May of 2019, PSCo filed an unopposed settlement agreement in its Colorado steam rate case. The settlement reflects a rate increase of $6.6 million, an equity ratio of 56%, an ROE of 9.67% for AFUDC purposes and utilization of TCJA benefits. New tax rates would occur in 2 steps: in 2019 and October of 2020. The administrative law judge has recommended approval of the settlement, which is pending at Colorado Commission decision.
In May of 2019, PSCo also filed an electric rate case in Colorado, seeking an increase of $158 million or 5.7% based on historic test year with a capital reach forward for 2019 capital expenditures, an equity ratio of 56.46% and an ROE of 10.35%. The request reflects capital investment for our Advanced Grid initiative and changes in depreciation rates, both of which were previously approved by the commission. PSCo's requested rate is effective in January of 2020.
We also reached a settlement in Wisconsin, which will maintain current electric rates through 2021 and result in a modest natural gas rate decrease. The settlement is pending a commission decision.
In July 2019, SPS filed an electric rate case in New Mexico, seeking an increase of $51 million based on historic test year with a capital reach forward, an ROE of 10.35% and an equity ratio of 54.8%. The request largely reflects capital investment for the Hale Wind project as well as other capital invested to support strong growth in the region. We anticipate rates going into effect in the second half of 2020.
In addition, we are planning to file an electric rate case in Texas in August to recover our investment in the Hale Wind project as well as other SPS capital projects. Both the Texas and New Mexico commissions previously granted a Certificate of Need and recovery mechanisms for the Hale Wind farm.
Next, I want to give a quick update on our PPA buyout efforts. During the quarter, we reached a partial settlement with various environmental and labor groups that support the Mankato combined cycle acquisition. Last week, the Department of Commerce and the Office of the Attorney General filed comments recommending against the acquisition, however, their recommendations included alternate customer protection mechanisms if the commission approves the acquisition. We believe we've demonstrated the economics of ownership are still compelling despite the disagreements on modeling highlighted by the comments. We anticipate hearings and a commission decision in September. We are cautiously optimistic the commission will approve the acquisition based on the anticipated customer savings and the long-term value to the state that our ownership of the facility would create.
Additionally, we are actively working across our 4 operating companies to identify other customer beneficial asset acquisition opportunities and will work proactively with our stakeholders to identify the cost, the environmental and the labor benefits of these transactions, and we will share these developments as they progress.
With that, I'll wrap up. We had a solid second quarter and are right on our budget for first half earnings. Weather and O&M were slightly unfavorable to our budget, but sales and margin were slightly favorable to offset. In the second half of the year, we expect year-over-year favorability in O&M margin and sales. In addition, depreciation and amortization expense will moderate due to the timing of lower levels of prepaid pension amortization in Colorado. As a result, we're very confident in our ability to deliver earnings at or above the midpoint of our guidance range.
In summary, we've filed our preferred plan in the Minnesota resource planning proceeding, which will continue our clean energy transition and if approved, would allow us to reduce carbon emissions by more than 80% by 2030. We completed the Hale Wind farm on time and under budget. We reached constructive rate settlements in Wisconsin and our steam case in Colorado.

And congratulations on the results and being able to maintain the year-end guidance and maybe on the upper end of the range. I had a few quick questions. And the first one, I was wondering if you could provide any more regulatory environment color specifically around New Mexico and Colorado. In New Mexico, I know that PNM, for example, is potentially struggling around whether securitization will apply to its future plans. I was wondering if we should interpret that as a commission looking at different rate cases with a fine toothcomb. And then in Colorado as well, I was just hoping for a little more color over there."

So I think it continues to be very constructive, and it helps when you're keeping your bills -- total bills very flat. In fact, in Colorado, they're less today than they were 4, 5 years ago. So I think we're in very good position in Colorado.
Moving to New Mexico. First of all, SPS, with the overall growth in both Texas and New Mexico is just really stunning, and it's creating a lot of opportunities for us. And as I mentioned, really pleased with some of the bills that were passed in Texas that support a better regulatory environment. We are aligned in New Mexico. Now securitization for us in New Mexico is not a very big deal. So I can't give you a much more color on that.

That's associated with the solar asset, and it's associated with the solar asset, Paul, because you want -- because that allows for the 30% ITC to be recognized. And I did put it on parity with peakers. I think batteries will continue to fall on price just like I think renewables will continue to fall on price and over time overcome the roll-off of the tax benefits. And yes, storage can be the new peakers but only to a certain degree of penetration and saturation. I mean because, as you know, we need to plan for much more than a 4-hour, even an 8-hour event. So I think the initial tranches of batteries are very valuable and you -- on a planning basis, you give them equal weight as you would with a traditional CT peaker. But the more penetration you have in batteries, the more you shave off that very peak load, you start to lose some of the planning value of batteries. And not to get too technical on you, but we're aware of that. Of course, batteries will have other roles on the grid, including supporting the grid reliability, and we're looking at those alternatives. And all of that will be baked into our plans as we move forward. But you cannot replace all peaking needs with batteries. That's very clear."

Let's start with earnings. Today, we reported third quarter earnings of $1.01 per share compared to $0.96 per share last year. Three quarters of the year behind us, we are on track to deliver earnings in th",700,"Well, thank you, Paul. Good morning, everyone. Let's start with earnings. 
Today, we reported third quarter earnings of $1.01 per share compared to $0.96 per share last year. Three quarters of the year behind us, we are on track to deliver earnings in the upper half of our guidance range. Consistent with our third quarter tradition, we've updated our investment plan, which now reflects $22 billion of capital expenditures over the next 5 years. This represents rate base growth of 6.7% off a 2019 base year. 
Our updated capital forecast is, of course, driven by our investment in renewables as we continue the clean energy transition. The forecast also includes investment in our advanced grid initiative, expenditures to improve the customer experience, additional investment in the transmission system to maintain asset health and reliability and a natural gas combined cycle plant at our Sherco facility to ensure reliability as we retire coal plants. 
This represents a base capital forecast, and we are also confident that there are likely additional upside investment opportunities not included in this base plan. We're also initiating 2020 guidance of $2.73 to $2.83 per share, which is consistent with our 5% to 7% long-term EPS growth objective. We're very excited about our plan, which provides customer value, delivers attractive returns for investors and keep customer bills low. 
Next, let me update you on our PPA buyouts and wind projects. In September, the Minnesota Commission denied our proposal to acquire the Mankato combined cycle plant as a rate base asset. Over its life, we believe the Mankato asset brings tremendous value and reliability to the system, especially as we retire coal plants. 
As a result, we have filed to acquire Mankato as a nonregulated asset and assume the existing PPAs with NSP Minnesota, which run through 2026 and 2039. We anticipate the acquisition will generate utility-like returns over the life of the asset. However, we expect the nonregulated returns will be lower in the near-term as the benefits are back-end loaded. We've made wholesale generation filings at FERC and affiliate interest filings with the Minnesota Commission, and we expect approval in December or January. 
We believe that our PPA buyout strategy can provide significant customer benefits. As a result, we'll continue to evaluate customer beneficial acquisition opportunities and we'll proactively work with our stakeholders to identify the costs and benefits of the transactions. 
Please note, our capital forecast does not include any incremental PPA acquisitions. Our 2 proposed wind PPA acquisitions, long road and mower, produced significant savings for our customers, and these benefits are front-end loaded as the PTCs would flow back to customers in the first 10 years. We expect the Minnesota Commission decision on long road by the end of the year and mower in the first half of 2020. 
We continue to achieve important milestones in our nation leading wind expansion. We have completed the development phase of our 522-megawatt Sagamore wind project in New Mexico, with construction slated to begin later this year and commercial operations expected by the end of 2020. 
In the Upper Midwest, a developer scaled back the crown Ridge Wind project by 200 megawatts due to increased MISO transmission and interconnection costs. We had planned to own 100 megawatts of Crown bridge as a build owned transfer project. While this has an immaterial impact on our capital forecast, it does highlight the need to expand transmission investment to address congestion and ensure the viability of future renewable projects. 
As a result, we, like the Blue Brothers, are on a mission to put the band back together again. And we are working with the original CapEx 2020 utilities, which built over $2 billion of transmission projects in the Upper Midwest over the last 10 years. 
We expect similar constraints and investment opportunities in SPP and Colorado as well. It's not -- while it's not in our 5-year forecast, and it will take some time to develop and implement plans, the need for additional transmission highlights the long runway for capital investment for Xcel Energy. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Bob, who'll provide more detail on our financial results and outlook and a regulatory update. Bob?"
527542,638433754,1838264,"Xcel Energy Inc., Q3 2019 Earnings Call, Oct 24, 2019",2019-10-24,"Earnings Calls","Xcel Energy Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ben, and good morning, everyone.

We recorded third quarter earnings of $1.01 per share compared with $0.96 per share in 2018. The most significant earnings drivers for the quarter include higher electric and natural gas margins, which increased earnings by $0.08 per share, including varied regulatory outcomes and riders to recover our capital investments. Lower O&M expenses increased earnings by $0.02 per share. 
In addition, our lower effective tax rate increased earnings by $0.03 per share. However, the majority of the lower effective tax rate is due to an increase in production tax credits, which flow back to customers through electric margin and [indiscernible] impacts both of which are largely earnings neutral. 
Offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation, interest and other taxes, reflecting our capital investment program, which reduced earnings by $0.04 per share. And lower AFUDC due to projects going into service decreased earnings by $0.04 per share. 
Turning to sales, our year-to-date weather-adjusted electric sales declined by 0.3%, reflecting continued strong customer growth, offset by lower use per customer and expected this discrete declines in certain large customer usage due to cogeneration. 
Year-to-date, weather-adjusted natural gas sales increased 3.2%, as a result of strong customer growth and higher use per customer. For 2019, we anticipate relatively flat electric sales and natural gas sales growth of 2% to 3% growth reflecting year-to-date performance. 
Turning to O&M. And consistent with our expectations, our quarterly expenses decreased by $13 million, reflecting lower costs in our nuclear and fossil plant operations. Our year-to-date O&M expenses are above last year, largely due to expense timing, but also due to higher-than-expected storm costs. 
We expect lower costs for nuclear operations and fossil plant outages in the fourth quarter. And as a reminder, we increased O&M spending in the second half of 2018 due to the impact of hot weather as well as environmental remediation and business efficiency improvements. 
Accordingly, we expect our full year 2019 O&M expenses will decline by 1% to 2% from 2018 levels. 
So let me provide a quick regulatory update. Earlier this month, we filed rebuttal testimony in our Colorado electric rate case and revised our request. We are now seeking an increase of $108 million based on a current test year with a capital reach forward through June '19, and and an equity ratio of 55.7% and an ROE of 10.2%. 
Interveners filed testimony and the commission staff recommended an ROE of 9% and an equity ratio of 55.6%, and a current test year with a capital reach forward through June 2019 with an average rate base. Hearing start in November, and we expect to commission decision in December, with new rates effective January of 2020. 
We also have electric rate cases in New Mexico and Texas, SPS is seeking an increase of $51 million in New Mexico based on a historic test year with a capital reach forward and an equity ratio of 54.8% and an ROE of 10.35%. 
While in Texas, SPS is seeking an increase of $136 million based on the historic test year and equity ratio of 54.7% and an ROE of 10.35%. The request largely reflects investment for the hail wind project as well as other capital to support strong growth in the region. Both cases are in the discovery phase with not much to report. 
As a reminder, both the Texas and New Mexico Commissions previously granted a certificate of need and current recovery mechanisms for Hale. We anticipate final rates going into effect in 2020. 
Turning to earnings guidance. In the fourth quarter, we expect favorability in O&M, margin and sales. In addition, depreciation and amortization expense will moderate due to the timing of lower levels of prepaid pension amortization in Colorado. As a result, we are narrowing our 2019 earnings guidance range to $2.60 to $2.65 per share, which represents the upper half of the original guidance range of $2.55 to $2.65 per share. 
As Ben noted, we are initiating our 2020 earnings guidance range of $2.73 to $2.83 per share, which is consistent with our long-term EPS growth objective of 5% to 7%. Please note that the 2020 EPS guidance is based on several assumptions, which are detailed in our earnings release. I wanted to highlight a couple of items. 
We assume constructive regulatory outcomes in all proceedings. We expect electric and natural gas sales growth of approximately 1%, which includes the impact of leap year. We anticipate an effective tax rate of approximately 0%, largely driven by wind production tax credits, which are credit to customers and have no impact on earnings. Finally, we expect O&M expenses to increase 2%, which reflects increased cost for new wind projects coming online. 
Please note, wind O&M is recovered in riders and most jurisdictions is offset by fuel savings. In our earnings release, you'll find more details about our updated $22 billion 5-year capital forecast, which reflects investments to support continued customer growth, improvements in safety and reliability, the enablement of renewable generation and automated metering for our customers. 
Our capital plan results in annual rate base growth of approximately 6.7% using 2019 as a base. Importantly, the rate base growth rate would be 7.3% if we'd maintain 2018 as the base year. Our updated capital investment plan is supportive of our 5% to 7% long-term earnings growth objective and our goal is to deliver EPS and growth in the upper half of the range. 
We've also updated our financing plan, which reflects the combination of internal cash generation and operating company and holding company debt to finance the majority of our capital expenditures. In addition, we expect to issue $1 billion of incremental market equity over the next 3 years and $400 million of DRIP and benefits equity to fund our capital plan and support our credit ratings. 
The financial plan reflects incremental capital investment of approximately $2.5 billion for the period of 2020 to 2023 as compared with our previous capital forecast. This incremental equity will allow us to fund accretive capital investment opportunities, which benefit our customers while maintaining our solid credit metrics and favorable access to the capital markets. 
With that, I'll wrap up. We're continuing to make progress on our wind development efforts in our PPA buyout strategy with the recently announced Mower project. We're going forward with the Mankato acquisition due to the strong value the asset provides over the long term. We are well positioned to deliver earnings in the upper half of our 2019 earnings guidance range, and we've announced a robust updated capital investment program, which provides strong, transparent rate base growth and customer value. 
We've initiated 2020 EPS guidance of $2.73 to $2.83, which is consistent with our long-term objective. Finally, we're very confident that we can deliver long-term EPS growth in the upper half of our 5% to 7% objective range. This concludes our prepared remarks. And operator, we'll take a few questions."

So we went forward with a nonregulated-based approach. But Angie, that's -- this isn't a change in strategy or anything else. We always want to see this. We wouldn't bring something to our commissions that we didn't think had a customer benefit. If there's disputes along the way, then we have to adjust to that, depending on the situation. But that's always going to be plan B, not plan A."

On the wind projects, our preference is to own them in rate base, I think they're really beneficial for the customers. But if they don't, we've made a preemptive filing at FERC to move those 2 wholesales well. But again, as Ben said, I don't think this is a strategic shift.

As Bob mentioned, we have 2 other wind proposals in front of the commission. The difference there is these benefits are very much front-end loaded.

You're right. Those -- I think the wind industry will take a little time to adjust, quite frankly, Travis, when the PPCs roll off. Of course, there's a chance they won't. Our approach to the solar piece of this is that I think the cost curve on solar continues to decline pretty quickly. And so we think that even the absence of the roll-off of ITC or the most of it anyway will be more than offset by just gains in the solar itself. And we think that times up very, very nicely to the retirement of our coal plants in the mid-20s. So we don't see a need to go out and lock anything in because we think the cost curve will more than offset the ITC reduction. And again, we'll clearly wait to see if there's legislation, et cetera.

So can you still find the land when you have a wind project on there. Solar, not so much. I mean, you basically are -- the land is being repurposed.

It was done with CapEx 2020, as I mentioned, and that was utilities of all sizes and municipalities and coops coming together to form a plan that works with an idea of how costs would be allocated. Because the real barriers to getting transmission build is who pays for it and then, of course, the permitting and everything else that goes with that. 
So I think my personal opinion, Paul, is that FERC 1,000 and that whole process really clouds it. And it's not necessary, and we'll see where that goes. But as I mentioned, as you know, we've got a right of first refusal in Minnesota. We have it in other jurisdictions. We're not in an RTO in Colorado. I think there are some real advantages to that.

Good morning, everyone. Let's start with earnings. 
Today, we reported third quarter earnings of $1.01 per share compared to $0.96 per share last year. 3 quarters of the year behind us, we are on track to deliver earnings in the upper half of our guidance range. Consistent with our third quarter tradition, we've updated our investment plan, which now reflects $22 billion of capital expenditures over the next 5 years. This represents rate base growth of 6.7% off a 2019 base year. 
Our updated capital forecast is, of course, driven by our investment in renewables as we continue the clean energy transition. The forecast also includes investment in our advanced grid initiative, expenditures to improve the customer experience, additional investment in the transmission system to maintain asset health and reliability and a natural gas combined cycle plant at our Sherco facility to ensure reliability as we retire coal plants. 
This represents a base capital forecast, and we are also confident that there are likely additional upside investment opportunities not included in this base plan. We're also initiating 2020 guidance of $2.73 to $2.83 per share, which is consistent with our 5% to 7% long-term EPS growth objective. We're very excited about our plan, which provides customer value, delivers attractive returns for investors and keep customer bills low. 
Next, let me update you on our PPA buyouts and wind projects. In September, the Minnesota Commission denied our proposal to acquire the Mankato combined cycle plant as a rate base asset. Over its life, we believe the Mankato asset brings tremendous value and reliability to the system, especially as we retire coal plants. 
As a result, we have filed to acquire Mankato as a nonregulated asset and assume the existing PPAs with NSP-Minnesota, which run through 2026 and 2039. We anticipate the acquisition will generate utility-like returns over the life of the asset. However, we expect the nonregulated returns will be lower in the near-term as the benefits are back-end loaded. We've made wholesale generation filings at FERC and affiliate interest filings with the Minnesota Commission, and we expect approval in December or January. 
We believe that our PPA buyout strategy can provide significant customer benefits. As a result, we'll continue to evaluate customer beneficial acquisition opportunities, and we'll proactively work with our stakeholders to identify the costs and benefits of the transactions. 
Please note, our capital forecast does not include any incremental PPA acquisitions. Our 2 proposed wind PPA acquisitions, Longroad and Mower, produce significant savings for our customers, and these benefits are front-end loaded as the PTCs would flow back to customers in the first 10 years. We expect the Minnesota Commission decision on Longroad by the end of the year and Mower in the first half of 2020. 
We continue to achieve important milestones in our nation-leading wind expansion. We have completed the development phase of our 522-megawatt Sagamore wind project in New Mexico, with construction slated to begin later this year and commercial operations expected by the end of 2020. 
In the Upper Midwest, a developer scaled back the Crowned Ridge wind project by 200 megawatts due to increased MISO transmission and interconnection costs. We had planned to own 100 megawatts of Crown Ridge as a build-owned transfer project. While this has an immaterial impact on our capital forecast, it does highlight the need to expand transmission investment to address congestion and ensure the viability of future renewable projects. As a result, we, like The Blues Brothers, are on a mission to put the band back together again. And we are working with the original CapEx 2020 utilities, which built over $2 billion of transmission projects in the Upper Midwest over the last 10 years. 
We expect similar constraints and investment opportunities in SPP and Colorado as well. It's not -- while it's not in our 5-year forecast, and it will take some time to develop and implement plans, the need for additional transmission highlights the long runway for capital investment for Xcel Energy. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Bob, who'll provide more detail on our financial results and outlook and a regulatory update. Bob?"
527542,638433754,1838502,"Xcel Energy Inc., Q3 2019 Earnings Call, Oct 24, 2019",2019-10-24,"Earnings Calls","Xcel Energy Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ben, and good morning, everyone. We recorded third quarter earnings of $1.01 per share compared with $0.96 per share in 2018.

We recorded third quarter earnings of $1.01 per share compared with $0.96 per share in 2018. The most significant earnings drivers for the quarter include higher electric and natural gas margins, which increased earnings by $0.08 per share, including varied regulatory outcomes and riders to recover our capital investments. Lower O&M expenses increased earnings by $0.02 per share. In addition, our lower effective tax rate increased earnings by $0.03 per share. However, the majority of the lower effective tax rate is due to an increase in production tax credits, which flow back to customers through electric margin and [ tax reform ] impacts both of which are largely earnings neutral. 
Offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation, interest and other taxes reflecting our capital investment program, which reduced earnings by $0.04 per share, and lower AFUDC due to projects going into service decreased earnings by $0.04 per share. 
Turning to sales, our year-to-date weather-adjusted electric sales declined by 0.3%, reflecting continued strong customer growth, offset by lower use per customer and expected this discrete declines in certain large customer usage due to cogeneration. 
Year-to-date, weather-adjusted natural gas sales increased 3.2% as a result of strong customer growth and higher use per customer. For 2019, we anticipate relatively flat electric sales and natural gas sales growth of 2% to 3% growth, reflecting year-to-date performance. 
Turning to O&M, and consistent with our expectations, our quarterly expenses decreased by $13 million, reflecting lower costs in our nuclear and fossil plant operations. Our year-to-date O&M expenses are above last year, largely due to expense timing, but also due to higher-than-expected storm costs. 
We expect lower costs for nuclear operations and fossil plant outages in the fourth quarter. And as a reminder, we increased O&M spending in the second half of 2018 due to the impact of hot weather as well as environmental remediation and business efficiency improvements. 
Accordingly, we expect our full year 2019 O&M expenses will decline by 1% to 2% from 2018 levels. 
So let me provide a quick regulatory update. Earlier this month, we filed rebuttal testimony in our Colorado electric rate case and revised our request. We are now seeking an increase of $108 million based on a current test year, with a capital reach forward through June '19 and an equity ratio of 55.7% and an ROE of 10.2%. 
Interveners filed testimony, and the commission staff recommended an ROE of 9% and an equity ratio of 55.6%, and a current test year with a capital reach forward through June 2019 with an average rate base. Hearing start in November, and we expect to commission decision in December, with new rates effective January of 2020. 
We also have electric rate cases in New Mexico and Texas. SPS is seeking an increase of $51 million in New Mexico based on a historic test year with a capital reach forward and an equity ratio of 54.8% and an ROE of 10.35%. While in Texas, SPS is seeking an increase of $136 million based on the historic test year, an equity ratio of 54.7% and an ROE of 10.35%. 
The request largely reflects investment for the Hale Wind Project as well as other capital to support strong growth in the region. Both cases are in the discovery phase with not much to report. As a reminder, both the Texas and New Mexico Commissions previously granted a certificate of need and current recovery mechanisms for Hale. We anticipate final rates going into effect in 2020. 
Turning to earnings guidance. In the fourth quarter, we expect favorability in O&M, margin and sales. In addition, depreciation and amortization expense will moderate due to the timing of lower levels of prepaid pension amortization in Colorado. As a result, we are narrowing our 2019 earnings guidance range to $2.60 to $2.65 per share, which represents the upper half of the original guidance range of $2.55 to $2.65 per share. 
As Ben noted, we are initiating our 2020 earnings guidance range of $2.73 to $2.83 per share, which is consistent with our long-term EPS growth objective of 5% to 7%. Please note that the 2020 EPS guidance is based on several assumptions, which are detailed in our earnings release. I wanted to highlight a couple of items. 
We assume constructive regulatory outcomes in all proceedings. We expect electric and natural gas sales growth of approximately 1%, which includes the impact of leap year. We anticipate an effective tax rate of approximately 0%, largely driven by wind production tax credits, which are credited to customers and have no impact on earnings. Finally, we expect O&M expenses to increase 2%, which reflects increased cost for new wind projects coming online. Please note, wind O&M is recovered in riders and most jurisdiction is offset by fuel savings. 
In our earnings release, you'll find more details about our updated $22 billion 5-year capital forecast, which reflects investments to support continued customer growth, improvements in safety and reliability, the enablement of renewable generation and automated metering for our customers. 
Our capital plan results in annual rate base growth of approximately 6.7% using 2019 as a base. Importantly, the rate base growth rate would be 7.3% if we'd maintain 2018 as the base year. Our updated capital investment plan is supportive of our 5% to 7% long-term earnings growth objective and our goal is to deliver EPS and [ dividend ] growth in the upper half of the range. 
We've also updated our financing plan, which reflects the combination of internal cash generation and operating company and holding company debt to finance the majority of our capital expenditures. In addition, we expect to issue $1 billion of incremental market equity over the next 3 years and $400 million of DRIP and benefits equity to fund our capital plan and support our credit ratings. 
The financial plan reflects incremental capital investment of approximately $2.5 billion for the period of 2020 to 2023 as compared with our previous capital forecast. This incremental equity will allow us to fund accretive capital investment opportunities, which benefit our customers while maintaining our solid credit metrics and favorable access to the capital markets. 
With that, I'll wrap up. We're continuing to make progress on our wind development efforts in our PPA buyout strategy with the recently announced Mower project. We're going forward with the Mankato acquisition due to the strong value the asset provides over the long term. We are well positioned to deliver earnings in the upper half of our 2019 earnings guidance range. And we've announced a robust updated capital investment program, which provides strong, transparent rate base growth and customer value. We've initiated 2020 EPS guidance of $2.73 to $2.83, which is consistent with our long-term objective. Finally, we're very confident that we can deliver long-term EPS growth in the upper half of our 5% to 7% objective range. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. And operator, we'll take a few questions."

I think second of all, if you think about it, we certainly don't have above-market ROEs today. And then finally, if you look at some data points on some of the cases that we have decided recently, they kind of point to reasonable ROEs.

But let me just step back. The IRRs of Mankato are good for shareholders. We think we would have preferred to have Mankato owned by our customers because that's always our first preference and that's our core strategy. But we didn't want to walk away from this asset. We want it in the portfolio. And so I think shareholders will benefit and we'll see what the -- I'm not going to speculate on what the commission does with our wind projects, but I will tell you that we're comfortable with ownership -- prefer ownership on the regulated side, but it's not bad in a portfolio either. So -- and remember, when Bob talks about 10,000 megawatts, they're across all 8 states. And so we're just -- not just -- it just so happens, these initial PPA buyouts came in Minnesota.

You're right. Those -- I think the wind industry will take a little time to adjust, quite frankly, Travis, when the PTCs roll off. Of course, there's a chance they won't. 
Our approach to the solar piece of this is that I think the cost curve on solar continues to decline pretty quickly. And so we think that even the absence of the roll-off of ITC, or the most of it anyway, will be more than offset by just gains in the solar itself. And we think that times up very, very nicely to the retirement of our coal plants in the mid-20s. So we don't see a need to go out and lock anything in because we think the cost curve will more than offset the ITC reduction. And again, we'll clearly wait to see if there's legislation, et cetera.

And I think wind will always compete very nicely against solar on an energy basis. And as you -- I think you'll find as more and more solar comes on the system, the planning capacity might fall off a little bit. So I think wind is always going to be there. We just so happen to want to focus on solar as we're retiring our coal plants. Solar has some advantages from a -- just think about it, a lot of -- I've had farmers come up to me and say, ""Gosh, if we didn't have a wind farm on our land, we might have gone under."" So you can still farm the land when you have a wind project on there. Solar, not so much. I mean you basically are -- the land is being repurposed. So -- and then, of course, there are different characteristics with when the wind blows versus when the sun shines. And so I think the 2 will complement each other in our clean energy transition very nicely. And I think there is going to be wind indefinitely. 
Just one comment on that, too. You got to remember, we are in the wind belt of the United States. So it's one of the reasons why our steel-for-fuel strategies work so well. And so we're always going to have that inherent advantage."

And that was utilities of all sizes and municipalities and coops coming together to form a plan that works with an idea of how costs would be allocated. Because the real barriers to getting transmission build is who pays for it, and then of course, the permitting and everything else that goes with that. 
So I think my personal opinion, Paul, is that FERC 1000 and that whole process really clouds it. And it's not necessary, and we'll see where that goes.

Good morning, everyone. Let's start with earnings. 
Today, we reported third quarter earnings of $1.01 per share compared to $0.96 per share last year. 3 quarters of the year behind us, we are on track to deliver earnings in the upper half of our guidance range. Consistent with our third quarter tradition, we've updated our investment plan, which now reflects $22 billion of capital expenditures over the next 5 years. This represents rate base growth of 6.7% off a 2019 base year. 
Our updated capital forecast is, of course, driven by our investment in renewables as we continue the clean energy transition. The forecast also includes investment in our advanced grid initiative, expenditures to improve the customer experience, additional investment in the transmission system to maintain asset health and reliability and a natural gas combined cycle plant at our Sherco facility to ensure reliability as we retire coal plants. 
This represents a base capital forecast, and we are also confident that there are likely additional upside investment opportunities not included in this base plan. We're also initiating 2020 guidance of $2.73 to $2.83 per share, which is consistent with our 5% to 7% long-term EPS growth objective. We're very excited about our plan, which provides customer value, delivers attractive returns for investors and keep customer bills low. 
Next, let me update you on our PPA buyouts and wind projects. In September, the Minnesota Commission denied our proposal to acquire the Mankato combined cycle plant as a rate base asset. Over its life, we believe the Mankato asset brings tremendous value and reliability to the system, especially as we retire coal plants. 
As a result, we have filed to acquire Mankato as a nonregulated asset and assume the existing PPAs with NSP-Minnesota, which run through 2026 and 2039. We anticipate the acquisition will generate utility-like returns over the life of the asset. However, we expect the nonregulated returns will be lower in the near-term as the benefits are back-end loaded. We've made wholesale generation filings at FERC and affiliate interest filings with the Minnesota Commission, and we expect approval in December or January. 
We believe that our PPA buyout strategy can provide significant customer benefits. As a result, we'll continue to evaluate customer beneficial acquisition opportunities, and we'll proactively work with our stakeholders to identify the costs and benefits of the transactions. 
Please note, our capital forecast does not include any incremental PPA acquisitions. Our 2 proposed wind PPA acquisitions, Longroad and Mower, produce significant savings for our customers, and these benefits are front-end loaded as the PTCs would flow back to customers in the first 10 years. We expect the Minnesota Commission decision on Longroad by the end of the year and Mower in the first half of 2020. 
We continue to achieve important milestones in our nation-leading wind expansion. We have completed the development phase of our 522-megawatt Sagamore wind project in New Mexico, with construction slated to begin later this year and commercial operations expected by the end of 2020. 
In the Upper Midwest, a developer scaled back the Crowned Ridge wind project by 200 megawatts due to increased MISO transmission and interconnection costs. We had planned to own 100 megawatts of Crown Ridge as a build-owned transfer project. While this has an immaterial impact on our capital forecast, it does highlight the need to expand transmission investment to address congestion and ensure the viability of future renewable projects. As a result, we, like The Blues Brothers, are on a mission to put the band back together again. And we are working with the original CapEx 2020 utilities, which built over $2 billion of transmission projects in the Upper Midwest over the last 10 years. 
We expect similar constraints and investment opportunities in SPP and Colorado as well. It's not -- while it's not in our 5-year forecast, and it will take some time to develop and implement plans, the need for additional transmission highlights the long runway for capital investment for Xcel Energy. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Bob, who'll provide more detail on our financial results and outlook and a regulatory update. Bob?"
527542,638433754,1841769,"Xcel Energy Inc., Q3 2019 Earnings Call, Oct 24, 2019",2019-10-24,"Earnings Calls","Xcel Energy Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ben, and good morning, everyone. We recorded third quarter earnings of $1.01 per share compared with $0.96 per share in 2018.

We recorded third quarter earnings of $1.01 per share compared with $0.96 per share in 2018. The most significant earnings drivers for the quarter include higher electric and natural gas margins, which increased earnings by $0.08 per share, including varied regulatory outcomes and riders to recover our capital investments. Lower O&M expenses increased earnings by $0.02 per share. In addition, our lower effective tax rate increased earnings by $0.03 per share. However, the majority of the lower effective tax rate is due to an increase in production tax credits, which flow back to customers through electric margin and [ tax reform ] impacts both of which are largely earnings neutral. 
Offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation, interest and other taxes reflecting our capital investment program, which reduced earnings by $0.04 per share, and lower AFUDC due to projects going into service decreased earnings by $0.04 per share. 
Turning to sales, our year-to-date weather-adjusted electric sales declined by 0.3%, reflecting continued strong customer growth, offset by lower use per customer and expected this discrete declines in certain large customer usage due to cogeneration. 
Year-to-date, weather-adjusted natural gas sales increased 3.2% as a result of strong customer growth and higher use per customer. For 2019, we anticipate relatively flat electric sales and natural gas sales growth of 2% to 3% growth, reflecting year-to-date performance. 
Turning to O&M, and consistent with our expectations, our quarterly expenses decreased by $13 million, reflecting lower costs in our nuclear and fossil plant operations. Our year-to-date O&M expenses are above last year, largely due to expense timing, but also due to higher-than-expected storm costs. 
We expect lower costs for nuclear operations and fossil plant outages in the fourth quarter. And as a reminder, we increased O&M spending in the second half of 2018 due to the impact of hot weather as well as environmental remediation and business efficiency improvements. 
Accordingly, we expect our full year 2019 O&M expenses will decline by 1% to 2% from 2018 levels. 
So let me provide a quick regulatory update. Earlier this month, we filed rebuttal testimony in our Colorado electric rate case and revised our request. We are now seeking an increase of $108 million based on a current test year, with a capital reach forward through June '19 and an equity ratio of 55.7% and an ROE of 10.2%. 
Interveners filed testimony, and the commission staff recommended an ROE of 9% and an equity ratio of 55.6%, and a current test year with a capital reach forward through June 2019 with an average rate base. Hearing start in November, and we expect to commission decision in December, with new rates effective January of 2020. 
We also have electric rate cases in New Mexico and Texas. SPS is seeking an increase of $51 million in New Mexico based on a historic test year with a capital reach forward and an equity ratio of 54.8% and an ROE of 10.35%. While in Texas, SPS is seeking an increase of $136 million based on the historic test year, an equity ratio of 54.7% and an ROE of 10.35%. 
The request largely reflects investment for the Hale Wind Project as well as other capital to support strong growth in the region. Both cases are in the discovery phase with not much to report. As a reminder, both the Texas and New Mexico Commissions previously granted a certificate of need and current recovery mechanisms for Hale. We anticipate final rates going into effect in 2020. 
Turning to earnings guidance. In the fourth quarter, we expect favorability in O&M, margin and sales. In addition, depreciation and amortization expense will moderate due to the timing of lower levels of prepaid pension amortization in Colorado. As a result, we are narrowing our 2019 earnings guidance range to $2.60 to $2.65 per share, which represents the upper half of the original guidance range of $2.55 to $2.65 per share. 
As Ben noted, we are initiating our 2020 earnings guidance range of $2.73 to $2.83 per share, which is consistent with our long-term EPS growth objective of 5% to 7%. Please note that the 2020 EPS guidance is based on several assumptions, which are detailed in our earnings release. I wanted to highlight a couple of items. 
We assume constructive regulatory outcomes in all proceedings. We expect electric and natural gas sales growth of approximately 1%, which includes the impact of leap year. We anticipate an effective tax rate of approximately 0%, largely driven by wind production tax credits, which are credited to customers and have no impact on earnings. Finally, we expect O&M expenses to increase 2%, which reflects increased cost for new wind projects coming online. Please note, wind O&M is recovered in riders and most jurisdiction is offset by fuel savings. 
In our earnings release, you'll find more details about our updated $22 billion 5-year capital forecast, which reflects investments to support continued customer growth, improvements in safety and reliability, the enablement of renewable generation and automated metering for our customers. 
Our capital plan results in annual rate base growth of approximately 6.7% using 2019 as a base. Importantly, the rate base growth rate would be 7.3% if we'd maintain 2018 as the base year. Our updated capital investment plan is supportive of our 5% to 7% long-term earnings growth objective and our goal is to deliver EPS and dividend growth in the upper half of the range. 
We've also updated our financing plan, which reflects the combination of internal cash generation and operating company and holding company debt to finance the majority of our capital expenditures. In addition, we expect to issue $1 billion of incremental market equity over the next 3 years and $400 million of DRIP and benefits equity to fund our capital plan and support our credit ratings. 
The financial plan reflects incremental capital investment of approximately $2.5 billion for the period of 2020 to 2023 as compared with our previous capital forecast. This incremental equity will allow us to fund accretive capital investment opportunities, which benefit our customers while maintaining our solid credit metrics and favorable access to the capital markets. 
With that, I'll wrap up. We're continuing to make progress on our wind development efforts in our PPA buyout strategy with the recently announced Mower project. We're going forward with the Mankato acquisition due to the strong value the asset provides over the long term. We are well positioned to deliver earnings in the upper half of our 2019 earnings guidance range. And we've announced a robust updated capital investment program, which provides strong, transparent rate base growth and customer value. We've initiated 2020 EPS guidance of $2.73 to $2.83, which is consistent with our long-term objective. Finally, we're very confident that we can deliver long-term EPS growth in the upper half of our 5% to 7% objective range. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. And operator, we'll take a few questions."

You're right. Those -- I think the wind industry will take a little time to adjust, quite frankly, Travis, when the PTCs roll off. Of course, there's a chance they won't. 
Our approach to the solar piece of this is that I think the cost curve on solar continues to decline pretty quickly. And so we think that even the absence of the roll-off of ITC, or the most of it anyway, will be more than offset by just gains in the solar itself. And we think that times up very, very nicely to the retirement of our coal plants in the mid-20s.

And I think wind will always compete very nicely against solar on an energy basis. And as you -- I think you'll find as more and more solar comes on the system, the planning capacity might fall off a little bit. So I think wind is always going to be there. We just so happen to want to focus on solar as we're retiring our coal plants. Solar has some advantages from a -- just think about it, a lot of -- I've had farmers come up to me and say, ""Gosh, if we didn't have a wind farm on our land, we might have gone under."" So you can still farm the land when you have a wind project on there. Solar, not so much. I mean you basically are -- the land is being repurposed. So -- and then, of course, there are different characteristics with when the wind blows versus when the sun shines. And so I think the 2 will complement each other in our clean energy transition very nicely. And I think there is going to be wind indefinitely. 
Just one comment on that, too. You got to remember, we are in the wind belt of the United States. So it's one of the reasons why our steel-for-fuel strategies work so well. And so we're always going to have that inherent advantage."

And that was utilities of all sizes and municipalities and co-ops coming together to form a plan that works with an idea of how costs would be allocated. Because the real barriers to getting transmission build is who pays for it, and then of course, the permitting and everything else that goes with that. 
So I think my personal opinion, Paul, is that FERC 1000 and that whole process really clouds it. And it's not necessary, and we'll see where that goes. But as I mentioned, as you know, we've got a right of first refusal in Minnesota. We have it in other jurisdictions. We're not in an RTO in Colorado. I think there are some real advantages to that.

Let's start with earnings. Today, we reported third quarter earnings of $1.01 per share compared to $0.96 per share last year. 3 quarters of the year behind us, we are on track to deliver earnings in the up",695,"Well, thank you, Paul. Good morning, everyone. Let's start with earnings. 
Today, we reported third quarter earnings of $1.01 per share compared to $0.96 per share last year. 3 quarters of the year behind us, we are on track to deliver earnings in the upper half of our guidance range. Consistent with our third quarter tradition, we've updated our investment plan, which now reflects $22 billion of capital expenditures over the next 5 years. This represents rate base growth of 6.7% off a 2019 base year. 
Our updated capital forecast is, of course, driven by our investment in renewables as we continue the clean energy transition. The forecast also includes investment in our advanced grid initiative, expenditures to improve the customer experience, additional investment in the transmission system to maintain asset health and reliability and a natural gas combined cycle plant at our Sherco facility to ensure reliability as we retire coal plants. 
This represents a base capital forecast, and we are also confident that there are likely additional upside investment opportunities not included in this base plan. We're also initiating 2020 guidance of $2.73 to $2.83 per share, which is consistent with our 5% to 7% long-term EPS growth objective. We're very excited about our plan, which provides customer value, delivers attractive returns for investors and keep customer bills low. 
Next, let me update you on our PPA buyouts and wind projects. In September, the Minnesota Commission denied our proposal to acquire the Mankato combined cycle plant as a rate base asset. Over its life, we believe the Mankato asset brings tremendous value and reliability to the system, especially as we retire coal plants. 
As a result, we have filed to acquire Mankato as a nonregulated asset and assume the existing PPAs with NSP-Minnesota, which run through 2026 and 2039. We anticipate the acquisition will generate utility-like returns over the life of the asset. However, we expect the nonregulated returns will be lower in the near-term as the benefits are back-end loaded. We've made wholesale generation filings at FERC and affiliate interest filings with the Minnesota Commission, and we expect approval in December or January. 
We believe that our PPA buyout strategy can provide significant customer benefits. As a result, we'll continue to evaluate customer beneficial acquisition opportunities, and we'll proactively work with our stakeholders to identify the costs and benefits of the transactions. 
Please note, our capital forecast does not include any incremental PPA acquisitions. Our 2 proposed wind PPA acquisitions, Longroad and Mower, produce significant savings for our customers, and these benefits are front-end loaded as the PTCs would flow back to customers in the first 10 years. We expect the Minnesota Commission decision on Longroad by the end of the year and Mower in the first half of 2020. 
We continue to achieve important milestones in our nation-leading wind expansion. We have completed the development phase of our 522-megawatt Sagamore wind project in New Mexico, with construction slated to begin later this year and commercial operations expected by the end of 2020. 
In the Upper Midwest, a developer scaled back the Crowned Ridge wind project by 200 megawatts due to increased MISO transmission and interconnection costs. We had planned to own 100 megawatts of Crown Ridge as a build-owned transfer project. While this has an immaterial impact on our capital forecast, it does highlight the need to expand transmission investment to address congestion and ensure the viability of future renewable projects. As a result, we, like The Blues Brothers, are on a mission to put the band back together again. And we are working with the original CapEx 2020 utilities, which built over $2 billion of transmission projects in the Upper Midwest over the last 10 years. 
We expect similar constraints and investment opportunities in SPP and Colorado as well. It's not -- while it's not in our 5-year forecast, and it will take some time to develop and implement plans, the need for additional transmission highlights the long runway for capital investment for Xcel Energy. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Bob, who'll provide more detail on our financial results and outlook and a regulatory update. Bob?"
527542,638433754,1843321,"Xcel Energy Inc., Q3 2019 Earnings Call, Oct 24, 2019",2019-10-24,"Earnings Calls","Xcel Energy Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ben, and good morning, everyone.

We recorded third quarter earnings of $1.01 per share compared with $0.96 per share in 2018. The most significant earnings drivers for the quarter include higher electric and natural gas margins, which increased earnings by $0.08 per share, including varied regulatory outcomes and riders to recover our capital investments. Lower O&M expenses increased earnings by $0.02 per share. In addition, our lower effective tax rate increased earnings by $0.03 per share. However, the majority of the lower effective tax rate is due to an increase in production tax credits, which flow back to customers through electric margin and [ tax reform ] impacts both of which are largely earnings neutral. 
Offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation, interest and other taxes reflecting our capital investment program, which reduced earnings by $0.04 per share, and lower AFUDC due to projects going into service decreased earnings by $0.04 per share. 
Turning to sales, our year-to-date weather-adjusted electric sales declined by 0.3%, reflecting continued strong customer growth, offset by lower use per customer and expected this discrete declines in certain large customer usage due to cogeneration. 
Year-to-date, weather-adjusted natural gas sales increased 3.2% as a result of strong customer growth and higher use per customer. For 2019, we anticipate relatively flat electric sales and natural gas sales growth of 2% to 3% growth, reflecting year-to-date performance. 
Turning to O&M, and consistent with our expectations, our quarterly expenses decreased by $13 million, reflecting lower costs in our nuclear and fossil plant operations. Our year-to-date O&M expenses are above last year, largely due to expense timing, but also due to higher-than-expected storm costs. 
We expect lower costs for nuclear operations and fossil plant outages in the fourth quarter. And as a reminder, we increased O&M spending in the second half of 2018 due to the impact of hot weather as well as environmental remediation and business efficiency improvements. 
Accordingly, we expect our full year 2019 O&M expenses will decline by 1% to 2% from 2018 levels. 
So let me provide a quick regulatory update. Earlier this month, we filed rebuttal testimony in our Colorado electric rate case and revised our request. We are now seeking an increase of $108 million based on a current test year, with a capital reach forward through June '19 and an equity ratio of 55.7% and an ROE of 10.2%. 
Interveners filed testimony, and the commission staff recommended an ROE of 9% and an equity ratio of 55.6%, and a current test year with a capital reach forward through June 2019 with an average rate base. Hearing start in November, and we expect to commission decision in December, with new rates effective January of 2020. 
We also have electric rate cases in New Mexico and Texas. SPS is seeking an increase of $51 million in New Mexico based on a historic test year with a capital reach forward and an equity ratio of 54.8% and an ROE of 10.35%. While in Texas, SPS is seeking an increase of $136 million based on the historic test year, an equity ratio of 54.7% and an ROE of 10.35%. 
The request largely reflects investment for the Hale Wind Project as well as other capital to support strong growth in the region. Both cases are in the discovery phase with not much to report. As a reminder, both the Texas and New Mexico Commissions previously granted a certificate of need and current recovery mechanisms for Hale. We anticipate final rates going into effect in 2020. 
Turning to earnings guidance. In the fourth quarter, we expect favorability in O&M, margin and sales. In addition, depreciation and amortization expense will moderate due to the timing of lower levels of prepaid pension amortization in Colorado. As a result, we are narrowing our 2019 earnings guidance range to $2.60 to $2.65 per share, which represents the upper half of the original guidance range of $2.55 to $2.65 per share. 
As Ben noted, we are initiating our 2020 earnings guidance range of $2.73 to $2.83 per share, which is consistent with our long-term EPS growth objective of 5% to 7%. Please note that the 2020 EPS guidance is based on several assumptions, which are detailed in our earnings release. I wanted to highlight a couple of items. 
We assume constructive regulatory outcomes in all proceedings. We expect electric and natural gas sales growth of approximately 1%, which includes the impact of leap year. We anticipate an effective tax rate of approximately 0% largely driven by wind production tax credits, which are credited to customers and have no impact on earnings. Finally, we expect O&M expenses to increase 2%, which reflects increased cost for new wind projects coming online. Please note, wind O&M is recovered in riders and most jurisdiction is offset by fuel savings. 
In our earnings release, you'll find more details about our updated $22 billion 5-year capital forecast, which reflects investments to support continued customer growth, improvements in safety and reliability, the enablement of renewable generation and automated metering for our customers. 
Our capital plan results in annual rate base growth of approximately 6.7% using 2019 as a base. Importantly, the rate base growth rate would be 7.3% if we'd maintain 2018 as the base year. Our updated capital investment plan is supportive of our 5% to 7% long-term earnings growth objective and our goal is to deliver EPS and dividend growth in the upper half of the range. 
We've also updated our financing plan, which reflects the combination of internal cash generation and operating company and holding company debt to finance the majority of our capital expenditures. In addition, we expect to issue $1 billion of incremental market equity over the next 3 years and $400 million of DRIP and benefits equity to fund our capital plan and support our credit ratings. 
The financial plan reflects incremental capital investment of approximately $2.5 billion for the period of 2020 to 2023 as compared with our previous capital forecast. This incremental equity will allow us to fund accretive capital investment opportunities, which benefit our customers while maintaining our solid credit metrics and favorable access to the capital markets. 
With that, I'll wrap up. We're continuing to make progress on our wind development efforts in our PPA buyout strategy with the recently announced Mower project. We're going forward with the Mankato acquisition due to the strong value the asset provides over the long term. We are well positioned to deliver earnings in the upper half of our 2019 earnings guidance range. And we've announced a robust updated capital investment program, which provides strong, transparent rate base growth and customer value. We've initiated 2020 EPS guidance of $2.73 to $2.83, which is consistent with our long-term objective. Finally, we're very confident that we can deliver long-term EPS growth in the upper half of our 5% to 7% objective range. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. And operator, we'll take a few questions."

I do think, though -- and I think Ben was going to comment on upside. And I think there are items that aren't embedded in this plan. I think Ben mentioned, one, which is a continuation of our PPA buyout strategy.

That said, Steve, I think we have some opportunities in the interim to squeeze out, if you will, the transmission capacity that is available. And we're looking at those opportunities. And of course, some of the transmission that we are building in the next few years will help with that as well."

You're right. Those -- I think the wind industry will take a little time to adjust, quite frankly, Travis, when the PTCs roll off. Of course, there's a chance they won't. 
Our approach to the solar piece of this is that I think the cost curve on solar continues to decline pretty quickly. And so we think that even the absence of the roll-off of ITC, or the most of it anyway, will be more than offset by just gains in the solar itself. And we think that times up very, very nicely to the retirement of our coal plants in the mid-20s. So we don't see a need to go out and lock anything in because we think the cost curve will more than offset the ITC reduction. And again, we'll clearly wait to see if there's legislation, et cetera.

And I think wind will always compete very nicely against solar on an energy basis. And as you -- I think you'll find as more and more solar comes on the system, the planning capacity might fall off a little bit. So I think wind is always going to be there. We just so happen to want to focus on solar as we're retiring our coal plants. Solar has some advantages from a -- just think about it, a lot of -- I've had farmers come up to me and say, ""Gosh, if we didn't have a wind farm on our land, we might have gone under."" So you can still farm the land when you have a wind project on there. Solar, not so much. I mean you basically are -- the land is being repurposed. So -- and then, of course, there are different characteristics with when the wind blows versus when the sun shines. And so I think the 2 will complement each other in our clean energy transition very nicely. And I think there is going to be wind indefinitely.

I don't think the barrier to getting transmission done, which is really what we're trying to get accomplished, is not about the competitive process. I mean in fact, if you look at the biggest transmission build, it was done with CapEx 2020, as I mentioned. And that was utilities of all sizes and municipalities and co-ops coming together to form a plan that works with an idea of how costs would be allocated. Because the real barriers to getting transmission build is who pays for it, and then of course, the permitting and everything else that goes with that. 
So I think my personal opinion, Paul, is that FERC 1000 and that whole process really clouds it. And it's not necessary, and we'll see where that goes. But as I mentioned, as you know, we've got a right of first refusal in Minnesota. We have it in other jurisdictions. We're not in an RTO in Colorado. I think there are some real advantages to that.

Good morning, everyone. Let's start with earnings. 
Today, we reported third quarter earnings of $1.01 per share compared to $0.96 per share last year. 3 quarters of the year behind us, we are on track to deliver earnings in the upper half of our guidance range. Consistent with our third quarter tradition, we've updated our investment plan, which now reflects $22 billion of capital expenditures over the next 5 years. This represents rate base growth of 6.7% off a 2019 base year. 
Our updated capital forecast is, of course, driven by our investment in renewables as we continue the clean energy transition. The forecast also includes investment in our advanced grid initiative, expenditures to improve the customer experience, additional investment in the transmission system to maintain asset health and reliability and a natural gas combined cycle plant at our Sherco facility to ensure reliability as we retire coal plants. 
This represents a base capital forecast, and we are also confident that there are likely additional upside investment opportunities not included in this base plan. We're also initiating 2020 guidance of $2.73 to $2.83 per share, which is consistent with our 5% to 7% long-term EPS growth objective. We're very excited about our plan, which provides customer value, delivers attractive returns for investors and keep customer bills low. 
Next, let me update you on our PPA buyouts and wind projects. In September, the Minnesota Commission denied our proposal to acquire the Mankato combined cycle plant as a rate base asset. Over its life, we believe the Mankato asset brings tremendous value and reliability to the system, especially as we retire coal plants. 
As a result, we have filed to acquire Mankato as a nonregulated asset and assume the existing PPAs with NSP-Minnesota, which run through 2026 and 2039. We anticipate the acquisition will generate utility-like returns over the life of the asset. However, we expect the nonregulated returns will be lower in the near-term as the benefits are back-end loaded. We've made wholesale generation filings at FERC and affiliate interest filings with the Minnesota Commission, and we expect approval in December or January. 
We believe that our PPA buyout strategy can provide significant customer benefits. As a result, we'll continue to evaluate customer beneficial acquisition opportunities, and we'll proactively work with our stakeholders to identify the costs and benefits of the transactions. 
Please note, our capital forecast does not include any incremental PPA acquisitions. Our 2 proposed wind PPA acquisitions, Longroad and Mower, produce significant savings for our customers, and these benefits are front-end loaded as the PTCs would flow back to customers in the first 10 years. We expect the Minnesota Commission decision on Longroad by the end of the year and Mower in the first half of 2020. 
We continue to achieve important milestones in our nation-leading wind expansion. We have completed the development phase of our 522-megawatt Sagamore wind project in New Mexico, with construction slated to begin later this year and commercial operations expected by the end of 2020. 
In the Upper Midwest, a developer scaled back the Crowned Ridge wind project by 200 megawatts due to increased MISO transmission and interconnection costs. We had planned to own 100 megawatts of Crown Ridge as a build-owned transfer project. While this has an immaterial impact on our capital forecast, it does highlight the need to expand transmission investment to address congestion and ensure the viability of future renewable projects. As a result, we, like The Blues Brothers, are on a mission to put the band back together again. And we are working with the original CapEx 2020 utilities, which built over $2 billion of transmission projects in the Upper Midwest over the last 10 years. 
We expect similar constraints and investment opportunities in SPP and Colorado as well. It's not -- while it's not in our 5-year forecast, and it will take some time to develop and implement plans, the need for additional transmission highlights the long runway for capital investment for Xcel Energy. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Bob, who'll provide more detail on our financial results and outlook and a regulatory update. Bob?"
527542,638433754,1848422,"Xcel Energy Inc., Q3 2019 Earnings Call, Oct 24, 2019",2019-10-24,"Earnings Calls","Xcel Energy Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ben, and good morning, everyone. We recorded third quarter earnings of $1.01 per share compared with $0.96 per share in 2018.

We recorded third quarter earnings of $1.01 per share compared with $0.96 per share in 2018. The most significant earnings drivers for the quarter include higher electric and natural gas margins, which increased earnings by $0.08 per share, including varied regulatory outcomes and riders to recover our capital investments. Lower O&M expenses increased earnings by $0.02 per share. In addition, our lower effective tax rate increased earnings by $0.03 per share. However, the majority of the lower effective tax rate is due to an increase in production tax credits, which flow back to customers through electric margin and [ tax reform ] impacts both of which are largely earnings neutral. 
Offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation, interest and other taxes reflecting our capital investment program, which reduced earnings by $0.04 per share, and lower AFUDC due to projects going into service decreased earnings by $0.04 per share. 
Turning to sales, our year-to-date weather-adjusted electric sales declined by 0.3%, reflecting continued strong customer growth, offset by lower use per customer and expected this discrete declines in certain large customer usage due to cogeneration. 
Year-to-date, weather-adjusted natural gas sales increased 3.2% as a result of strong customer growth and higher use per customer. For 2019, we anticipate relatively flat electric sales and natural gas sales growth of 2% to 3% growth, reflecting year-to-date performance. 
Turning to O&M, and consistent with our expectations, our quarterly expenses decreased by $13 million, reflecting lower costs in our nuclear and fossil plant operations. Our year-to-date O&M expenses are above last year, largely due to expense timing, but also due to higher-than-expected storm costs. 
We expect lower costs for nuclear operations and fossil plant outages in the fourth quarter. And as a reminder, we increased O&M spending in the second half of 2018 due to the impact of hot weather as well as environmental remediation and business efficiency improvements. 
Accordingly, we expect our full year 2019 O&M expenses will decline by 1% to 2% from 2018 levels. 
So let me provide a quick regulatory update. Earlier this month, we filed rebuttal testimony in our Colorado electric rate case and revised our request. We are now seeking an increase of $108 million based on a current test year, with a capital reach forward through June '19 and an equity ratio of 55.7% and an ROE of 10.2%. 
Interveners filed testimony, and the commission staff recommended an ROE of 9% and an equity ratio of 55.6%, and a current test year with a capital reach forward through June 2019 with an average rate base. Hearing start in November, and we expect to commission decision in December, with new rates effective January of 2020. 
We also have electric rate cases in New Mexico and Texas. SPS is seeking an increase of $51 million in New Mexico based on a historic test year with a capital reach forward and an equity ratio of 54.8% and an ROE of 10.35%. While in Texas, SPS is seeking an increase of $136 million based on the historic test year, an equity ratio of 54.7% and an ROE of 10.35%. 
The request largely reflects investment for the Hale Wind Project as well as other capital to support strong growth in the region. Both cases are in the discovery phase with not much to report. As a reminder, both the Texas and New Mexico Commissions previously granted a certificate of need and current recovery mechanisms for Hale. We anticipate final rates going into effect in 2020. 
Turning to earnings guidance. In the fourth quarter, we expect favorability in O&M, margin and sales. In addition, depreciation and amortization expense will moderate due to the timing of lower levels of prepaid pension amortization in Colorado. As a result, we are narrowing our 2019 earnings guidance range to $2.60 to $2.65 per share, which represents the upper half of the original guidance range of $2.55 to $2.65 per share. 
As Ben noted, we are initiating our 2020 earnings guidance range of $2.73 to $2.83 per share, which is consistent with our long-term EPS growth objective of 5% to 7%. Please note that the 2020 EPS guidance is based on several assumptions, which are detailed in our earnings release. I wanted to highlight a couple of items. 
We assume constructive regulatory outcomes in all proceedings. We expect electric and natural gas sales growth of approximately 1%, which includes the impact of leap year. We anticipate an effective tax rate of approximately 0% largely driven by wind production tax credits, which are credited to customers and have no impact on earnings. Finally, we expect O&M expenses to increase 2%, which reflects increased cost for new wind projects coming online. Please note, wind O&M is recovered in riders and most jurisdiction is offset by fuel savings. 
In our earnings release, you'll find more details about our updated $22 billion 5-year capital forecast, which reflects investments to support continued customer growth, improvements in safety and reliability, the enablement of renewable generation and automated metering for our customers. 
Our capital plan results in annual rate base growth of approximately 6.7% using 2019 as a base. Importantly, the rate base growth rate would be 7.3% if we'd maintain 2018 as the base year. Our updated capital investment plan is supportive of our 5% to 7% long-term earnings growth objective and our goal is to deliver EPS and dividend growth in the upper half of the range. 
We've also updated our financing plan, which reflects the combination of internal cash generation and operating company and holding company debt to finance the majority of our capital expenditures. In addition, we expect to issue $1 billion of incremental market equity over the next 3 years and $400 million of DRIP and benefits equity to fund our capital plan and support our credit ratings. 
The financial plan reflects incremental capital investment of approximately $2.5 billion for the period of 2020 to 2023 as compared with our previous capital forecast. This incremental equity will allow us to fund accretive capital investment opportunities, which benefit our customers while maintaining our solid credit metrics and favorable access to the capital markets. 
With that, I'll wrap up. We're continuing to make progress on our wind development efforts in our PPA buyout strategy with the recently announced Mower project. We're going forward with the Mankato acquisition due to the strong value the asset provides over the long term. We are well positioned to deliver earnings in the upper half of our 2019 earnings guidance range. And we've announced a robust updated capital investment program, which provides strong, transparent rate base growth and customer value. We've initiated 2020 EPS guidance of $2.73 to $2.83, which is consistent with our long-term objective. Finally, we're very confident that we can deliver long-term EPS growth in the upper half of our 5% to 7% objective range. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. And operator, we'll take a few questions."

So I think we've melded base and, what we may have historically called, upside or unidentified. 
I do think, though -- and I think Ben was going to comment on upside. And I think there are items that aren't embedded in this plan. I think Ben mentioned, one, which is a continuation of our PPA buyout strategy. We think we've got 10,000, 11,000 megawatts of PPAs that the company procures today from third-party owners, and we still think that there's opportunities out there to find customer beneficial acquisitions.

It's one of the reasons why we accelerate it and really put the pedal down on our steel for fuel program and the biggest wind expansion in the country that we've had now because we did want to lock in those PTC credits before they expire at the 100% level and even at the 80% level. You're right. Those -- I think the wind industry will take a little time to adjust, quite frankly, Travis, when the PTCs roll off. Of course, there's a chance they won't. 
Our approach to the solar piece of this is that I think the cost curve on solar continues to decline pretty quickly. And so we think that even the absence of the roll-off of ITC, or the most of it anyway, will be more than offset by just gains in the solar itself. And we think that times up very, very nicely to the retirement of our coal plants in the mid-20s. So we don't see a need to go out and lock anything in because we think the cost curve will more than offset the ITC reduction. And again, we'll clearly wait to see if there's legislation, et cetera. It might change that."

And I think wind will always compete very nicely against solar on an energy basis. And as you -- I think you'll find as more and more solar comes on the system, the planning capacity might fall off a little bit. So I think wind is always going to be there. We just so happen to want to focus on solar as we're retiring our coal plants. Solar has some advantages from a -- just think about it, a lot of -- I've had farmers come up to me and say, ""Gosh, if we didn't have a wind farm on our land, we might have gone under."" So you can still farm the land when you have a wind project on there. Solar, not so much. I mean you basically are -- the land is being repurposed. So -- and then, of course, there are different characteristics with when the wind blows versus when the sun shines. And so I think the 2 will complement each other in our clean energy transition very nicely. And I think there is going to be wind indefinitely. 
Just one comment on that, too. You got to remember, we are in the wind belt of the United States. So it's one of the reasons why our steel-for-fuel strategies work so well. And so we're always going to have that inherent advantage."

And that was utilities of all sizes and municipalities and co-ops coming together to form a plan that works with an idea of how costs would be allocated. Because the real barriers to getting transmission build is who pays for it, and then of course, the permitting and everything else that goes with that. 
So I think my personal opinion, Paul, is that FERC 1000 and that whole process really clouds it. And it's not necessary, and we'll see where that goes. But as I mentioned, as you know, we've got a right of first refusal in Minnesota. We have it in other jurisdictions. We're not in an RTO in Colorado. I think there are some real advantages to that.
