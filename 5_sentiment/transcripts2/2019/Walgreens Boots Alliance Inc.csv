There is nothing entirely new in what we have seen impact our business during the quarter. That said, a number of the trends that we had been expecting and preparing for impacted us significantly more quickly than we had anticipated. 
We found ourselves facing a combination of increased reimbursement pressure in the quarter, lower generic deflation, lower brand inflation and lower-than-anticipated benefits from our work to refresh and renew our retail offerings, primarily in the U.S. Of course, the pharmacy trends are not only impacting our business. They are impacting the overall market and will likely continue to do so over the coming months. 
Let me be clear, however. I am convinced that our existing strategic priorities are the right ones and will help us deliver sustainable growth into the future. Let me remind you of our 4 priorities: accelerating the digitalization of our company, transforming and restructuring our retail offering, creating neighborhood health destination around a more modern pharmacy and rolling out our Transformational Cost Management Program. 
We are making strong progress against these transformation priorities across multiple fronts. However, we now need to respond appropriately to the tougher environment that we find ourselves in. We will be our existing transformation of priorities and will reinforce and accelerate our actions. We are acting quickly to address select areas of operational weakness with a number of senior appointments, 2 senior talent with new ideas and new approaches to drive more rapid change in a number of areas of our business. 
We are also strengthening and refocusing our operational management to ensure increased focus on driving operational excellence. In recent months, we have brought in a new Chief Digital Officer, a new Global Chief Marketing Officer, a new Global Chief Supply Chain Officer. We have restructured entirely the organization of our brands business. And since the quarter end, we have brought in a new Global Controller and Chief Accounting Officer. We have reviewed our priorities and business initiatives underway and have reworked our management plans in light of the more adverse environment.
First and foremost, we are acknowledging that the short-term headwinds that we are facing and the limited time we have available to compensate for the impacts in the remainder of the year. As a result, we are reducing our guidance for fiscal 2019. James will talk to you about that in a moment.
We believe the actions that we are taking will result in improved performance in 2020. Looking beyond that, we are convinced that our business model can deliver sustainable adjusted earnings per share growth of mid- to high single digits. 
I will now ask James to take you through the results and our updated guidance for the year. James?"

On a constant currency basis, adjusted earnings per share declined 4.3% in the quarter, bringing our first half EPS growth to 3.6%. The results were much weaker than we had expected due to 3 key factors. As",1026,"Thank you, Stefano, and good morning, everyone. On a constant currency basis, adjusted earnings per share declined 4.3% in the quarter, bringing our first half EPS growth to 3.6%. The results were much weaker than we had expected due to 3 key factors. As with our competitors, we are seeing continued reimbursement pressure, and the opportunities to mitigate have reduced due to lower levels of generic deflation and lower brand inflation. 
The second key factor is volume. Our same-store growth in the U.S. is trending below plan in both pharmacy and front of store. And lastly, consumer conditions in the U.K. remain challenging. We are also lapping a particularly strong second quarter last year when constant currency adjusted EPS increased 25.7%. We are clearly not pleased with this quarter's performance, and we are taking immediate actions to improve operational performance and to reinforce and accelerate our existing transformation plans.
Let's now look in more detail at the numbers. In the second quarter, sales increased 4.6%, including a currency headwind of 2.1%. On a constant currency basis, sales were up 6.7%, reflecting the acquisition of the Rite Aid stores. Organic sales growth was 2.5%. 
Adjusted operating income declined 10.4% or 9.3% on a constant currency basis. The decline was mainly due to our weak quarter in Retail Pharmacy USA, which declined 11.9% year-on-year due to lower pharmacy margins and the decline in front-end comparable sales. 
Adjusted diluted earnings per share declined 5.4% to $1.64, a decrease of 4.3% on a constant currency basis. This includes a 4.5 percentage point contribution from our share repurchase program. 
GAAP operating income declined 23% in the quarter, including restructuring charges of $150 million as we ramp up the Transformational Cost Management Program and the prior year adjustment of $113 million relating to AmerisourceBergen tax law changes. GAAP EPS declined 8.3% to $1.24 per share.
Before I move on to our divisional performance, let me briefly cover first our financial highlights. Sales increased 7.2%, including a currency headwind of 1.8%. On a constant currency basis, sales were up 9%, reflecting the acquisition of the Rite Aid stores. Organic sales growth was 3.3%.
Adjusted operating income declined 7.5% or 6.6% on a constant currency basis, reflecting the negative impact of reimbursement pressure on U.S. pharmacy gross margins, comp sales declines in U.S. retail and weak market conditions in the U.K. Adjusted EPS increased 3.6% on a constant currency basis. 
GAAP earnings per share were up 12% as the absence of prior year items related to U.S. tax law changes and impairment were partly offset by $179 million of pretax restructuring costs related to the Transformational Cost Management Program.
Now let's look at the performance of our divisions, starting with Retail Pharmacy USA. Sales advanced 7.3% in the quarter, reflecting the acquired Rite Aid stores and organic sales growth of 1.6%. Adjusted gross profit declined 3.5% in the quarter, reflecting declines in both pharmacy and retail. Gross margin declined 260 basis points, mostly due to pharmacy. Adjusted SG&A spend declined 0.6% versus prior year. And excluding Rite Aid, adjusted SG&A spend was 6.8% lower than the prior period. Continued cost-saving initiatives and the impact of a lower bonus accrual more than offset inflation and store labor investments. Adjusted SG&A was 17.7% of sales, an improvement of 140 basis points compared to the year-ago quarter.
Adjusted operating income declined 11.9% in the quarter. Continued SG&A savings, procurement savings and pharmacy volume growth were not sufficient to offset the unusually high year-on-year impact from reimbursement and underperformance in the front of store. This result included store and labor investments of $40 million in the quarter, equivalent to approximately 240 basis points of adjusted operating income. 
Now let's look in more detail at pharmacy. Total pharmacy sales increased 9.8%, reflecting the acquisition of the Rite Aid stores and organic growth of 4%. Second quarter market share was 22.3%, up approximately 90 basis points compared to last year, reflecting the acquired Rite Aid stores. Comp pharmacy sales increased 1.9%, and our central specialty business grew 28.7% year-on-year. The number of retail prescriptions filled on a 30-day adjusted basis, including immunizations, increased 6.4%. Comp prescriptions grew 1.8%, slightly behind the first quarter growth of 2%.
Pharmacy gross profit declined versus prior year as volume growth was more than offset by lower gross margin. The pharmacy market is very challenging right now, and we are seeing similar trends to our competitors. 
Reimbursement pressure has continued, and opportunities for mitigation are lower than we expected. The combination of this reimbursement pressure, lower levels of generic deflation and lower brand inflation resulted in pharmacy margins that were worse than planned and 280 basis points below the same period last year. Also included here is a 110 basis point impact due to the faster growth of the lower-margin specialty business. And as we looked at the quarter, the year-on-year reimbursement impact was exceptionally high. And we estimate an adverse timing impact of approximately 60 basis points.
Turning next to our retail business. Retail sales increased 1.3%, reflecting the sales contribution from the acquired Rite Aid stores. Comp retail sales declined 3.8% as we faced some headwinds during the quarter. We are lapping an exceptionally strong prior year cough/cold flu season, and this accounted for 150 basis points of the year-on-year sales decline.
Secondly, we continued to de-emphasize tobacco, with an impact of around 125 basis points. And finally, we had a weak quarter in seasonal and gifting, with a 70 basis points impact. And here, we clearly need to improve our range and execution.
Retail gross profit declined in the quarter, with retail gross margin 90 basis points lower than prior year, predominantly due to short-term changes in promotional activity. But let me remind you that excluding Rite Aid, our retail gross margin has improved by approximately 290 basis points since 2015. That being said, while we are pleased with our long-term margin performance, we are clearly not satisfied with our recent front-of-store sales performance.
Now let me pass it to Alex, who will update you on our transformation priorities and explain the actions we are taking to address our current business challenges."

While external factors, including reimbursement pressure and a weaker cough/cold and flu season impacted us in the quarter, we clearly need to improve our execution and speed of delivery. We have not moved quickly enough to address the changes in the market and as a result, did not deliver the growth required to help mitigate the continued reimbursement pressure. 
With that context, let me share some of the actions we are focused on. Our overall transformation priorities are unchanged, but we're seeking to reinforce and accelerate our actions. As Stefano mentioned, we are accelerating the digitalization of our company, transforming and restructuring our retail offering, creating neighborhood health destinations based on a more modern pharmacy and rolling out our Transformational Cost Management Program. On cost management, we are continuing to make major strides and see more opportunities, which James will cover in more detail later.
Overall, we recognize the importance of accelerating the transformation of our business more significantly to the customer. So let's look for a moment at some of the specific actions we are taking.
Firstly, it's crystal clear that all walks only if we have the right talent, capabilities and operational focus. To that end, we have recently executed a comprehensive reorganization of my senior leadership team. We have announced a new leadership structure, which clearly delineates between development and delivery. This is allowing my senior executives to focus on driving operational excellence and delivering results in their specific area. 
We have also made changes to how we manage our strategic partnerships, increasing the focus on accountability for developing our health care and retail services, ensuring financial discipline, pace, accountability and maximization of new profit streams. As Stefano mentioned, we have brought in a number of new senior executives to Walgreens Boots Alliance with specific skills and expertise. And they will work closely with my team to drive performance improvements.
We are on track on digitalization. The Microsoft teams are on-boarded. They are physically present in our offices, and we have moved quickly to consolidate our internal digital teams to create a single team under an experienced Chief Digital Officer. 
We have put in place new action plans for both pharmacy and retail. In pharmacy, we have created a dedicated accountable team to drive volume through our partnerships with payers in the marketplace. This will allow the rest of the team to focus on operational effectiveness in our core pharmacy business, delivering our vision of a modern pharmacy, driving efficiency and maximizing opportunities through outcomes-based reimbursement. These new approaches will help us counteract reimbursement pressure. 
In retail, we recognized the need to concentrate our efforts where we know we can win. Right now, our execution is lagging where it needs to be. We will continue to accept revenue declines in low-margin cash streams, where we do not see a winning future path. We invested some margin this quarter in cash streams we know drive footfall, and we're already starting to see the benefit of this investment in improved revenue and gross profit. 
We will concentrate our efforts, shifting resources, people and dollars to our flagship brands, including Walgreens health care brands and No7 and our priority categories. A great example is health and wellness. It's a significant cash stream with very attractive margins. We will step up the level of innovation and marketing support. 
We continue to be pleased with the progress we're making on our partnerships. In particular, we're working closely with the Kroger executive team to determine how best to unlock future growth and synergies. 
And the work we are doing on digitalization of our business will deliver an enhanced customer experience and the tools and analytics to drive customer loyalty. This builds on our existing highly successful customer-facing platforms, including our 5-star rated 55 million downloaded app and our 85 million active Balance Rewards members. 
We previously highlighted the very high customer retention rates we have delivered on the Rite Aid store optimization. These very favorable retention rates, which allow us to focus volume locally on fewer stores without reducing our geographic coverage, delivered greatly improved returns and have led to a decision to boost our store optimization program from 600 stores to approximately 750 stores. 
Parallel to this, we're undertaking a comprehensive review of Walgreens store networks to address specific underperforming stores. And as you know, we are testing a small store format, and pending positive results, we anticipate building out this format over the coming years. More information will follow in the coming months. 
I'll hand you back to James now to update you on Retail Pharmacy International."

Firstly, we have taken decisive action to reduce our U.K. cost base. In February, we announced our intention to reduce our Nottingham head office personnel cost by around 20% to create a smaller and more agile support team. 
Our smart spending, smart organization is advancing well. And a store portfolio review is underway, focusing on low-performing stores and opportunities for consolidation. 
In addition, we are looking closely at our pharmacy business to further improve efficiency and effectiveness. We continue also to strengthen the Boots leadership team, with the appointment of a new Chief Operating Officer. And as mentioned on last quarter's earnings call, we have multiple initiatives underway to improve our revenue performance. 
We are refitting 24 beauty halls across the U.K. between now and the end of May, introducing Boots beauty specialists with an in-depth knowledge spanning all and brands. And we're significantly expanding our beauty offering by introducing more than 20 new on-trend brands nationwide over the next 6 months. 
Finally, a brief update on our international investments in China. Since the quarter end, in collaboration with our partner, GuoDa, we opened our first pilot pharmacy in Shanghai, combining traditional Chinese medicine and skin care with well-known international brands.

The division delivered another solid quarter, with sales up 9.1%, mainly due to growth in emerging markets but also aided by a customer contract change in the U.K., which contributed 2.1% of revenue growth. 
Adjusted operating income increased 3%, with sales growth and an improvement in SG&A as a percentage of sales more than offsetting gross margin pressure. 
Turning next to cash flow. Operating cash flow was $1.2 billion in the first half. Free cash flow was $401 million. This was impacted by headwinds of $1 billion, including increased cash tax payments of $465 million, mainly as a result of U.S. tax reform; legal settlements of $276 million; and a once-off working capital benefit of $233 million in the prior year. 
Working capital days improved year-on-year, but the first half free cash flow reflects approximately $750 million of working capital increases, primarily due to higher sales and the timing of receipts. Cash capital investment was $793 million in the first half, $128 million higher than prior year due to the impact of Rite Aid store conversions. 
Turning now to our guidance for the year. In light of the first half performance and our expectations for a challenging second half, we are revising our full year guidance for fiscal year 2019. 
We now expect adjusted EPS to be roughly flat on a constant currency basis. However, given the new level of volatility in a business of this size, realistically, you should expect a range of plus or minus 2%. 
The downward revision considers the following key changes. We anticipate gross margins to remain under pressure in the U.S. in the second half. Reimbursement pressure is unlikely to improve in the short term, and it will take time for our complete mitigation plans to kick in. 
In terms of volume, our U.S. pharmacy and U.S. retail performance has been below plan in the first half of the year. And while we are taking decisive actions in the U.K., market conditions remain weak, and we have reflected this in our revised guidance. 
Given the revised full year EPS outlook, the estimated bonus payout for the year has been substantially reduced. And while our Transformational Cost Management Program is very much on track, the contribution to fiscal year '19 results was assumed when we provided guidance in December of 2018. 
Finally, let me provide you with some supporting guidance assumptions. As you look forward to the second half, please remember that we have now lapped Rite Aid. And we will continue to see adverse reimbursement pressure impacting the revenue line. 
Currencies have an adverse EPS impact of approximately $0.04 versus prior year, unchanged versus our guidance at the beginning of the year. We now project a full year tax rate of 16% to 17%. The more favorable outlook reflects nonrecurring discrete benefits and changes in our geographical mix of earnings. 
And we project full year share repurchases of $3.8 billion compared to $3 billion guidance at the beginning of the year. This contributes 4.5% to EPS growth. 
Turning to our long-term business model. Firstly, we believe the business model is well positioned to deliver sustainable constant currency adjusted EPS growth well into the future. We have good line of sight to levers to counteract reimbursement pressure. Predictable volume growth and excellence in cost management will be key, and this requires us to execute strongly against our existing transformation priorities. 
Volume growth will be underpinned by delivering improved value for both payers and consumers. We absolutely must drive a renewed focus on operational excellence, whether it be adherence, patient satisfaction or management of our offering in the front of store. And we will see the benefits of our digitalization program with more frequent enhancements to our customer offer over the course of the coming months and years. 
Finally, in the U.K., we expect our store and brand investments to begin to bear fruit as we exit 2019. Importantly, by 2022, we anticipate annual savings in excess of $1.5 billion from our Transformational Cost Management Program. And while a program of this magnitude is never easy, we do have good visibility on what needs to be done and strong commitment from the leadership team to get it done. 
Beyond 2022, we expect a rising contribution from partnerships. However, until then, our EPS growth model is not dependent on the material ramp-up of any of the existing partnerships. In fact, we are making significant investments in the short and medium term to drive long-term earnings upside. And long term, we do believe that health care and retail services will provide us with attractive returns and substantial new sources of income. 
Let me focus now on the Transformational Cost Management Program. Last quarter, we launched a program targeting annual savings in excess of $1 billion. We also told you that we needed to complete a 16-week assessment phase. We are now 3 months in. And while we are not fully complete, we do have a much deeper understanding of the areas of potential savings. 
Given what we have seen to date, we are increasing our annual cost-saving target to at least $1.5 billion. Smart spending is progressing well. We have completed our benchmarking for select spend categories. For example, our benchmarks indicate that our consultant and supply costs are second quartile while our contractor, events, technology and travel spend are all above the median of the peer set. This shows the granularity we're operating at and the potential we see to reduce costs. 
Moving on to smart organization. As a reminder, in the first quarter, we announced and implemented reorganizations and store closure initiatives to rightsize operations in Chile and Mexico. And we launched an optimization initiative in our Pharmaceutical Wholesale division. 
We continue to move quickly, and we took further decisive steps in the second quarter. As mentioned earlier, we announced a 20% reduction of the Boots UK central workforce, and the reduction should be largely complete by the end of the fiscal year. 
On the 21st of March, we announced the new field management structure in the U.S. The new organization combines the previously separate Walgreens and Rite Aid store management teams, and we expect the implementation to be completed by the beginning of June. 
The final bucket is digitalization. We just completed a detailed review of our global IT spend, and we are very encouraged by the findings. We see opportunities to reduce our annual IT cash spend by $500 million to $600 million, almost equally split between OpEx and CapEx. This represents a reduction of approximately 25% to 30% versus the baseline costs. So it is a significant opportunity. 
In the short term, we plan to selectively invest part of the savings to build out new customer digital propositions. However, we will expect each project to drive incremental value and benefits, thus, creating a virtuous cycle. 
As we look forward to 2020 and beyond, we see improved operational EPS performance. Over the long term, we are comfortable that our growth model can deliver mid- to high single-digit adjusted EPS growth in constant currencies. 
One callout on fiscal 2020. We do anticipate growth from operations. However, adjusted EPS in constant currency is expected to be broadly flat due to the reduction in bonus payments in 2019. 
As we built out our long-term business model, we made the following assumptions, which you may find helpful. We assume share repurchases of $1.7 billion per year, contributing approximately 2.5% to EPS growth. However, this is partly offset by tax rate, which is expected to increase from 16% to 17% in 2019 to over 18% by 2022 and creating a headwind of 50 to 100 basis points depending on the year. 
In summary, we have reworked our business plans to accelerate and boost our existing transformation priorities. And while there may be quarterly fluctuations along the way, these plans should allow us to return to long-term adjusted EPS growth. 
I will now hand you back to Stefano."

As I said at the start, this has been a disappointing quarter, and I am equally disappointed that we had to reduce our full year guidance. However, we need to acknowledge the short-term headwinds that we are facing. And while we are not the only company that has been impacted by the marked change in the environment, that's not an excuse. 
What is important now is that we respond quickly to ensure we'll return to growth as soon as possible. This quarter has focused the minds of the entire team on the need to allocate resources to where they will have the greatest impact, both today and in the future. 
Importantly, I am convinced that our existing strategic priorities are the right ones, and our multiyear transformation program will allow us to deliver sustained and even profitable growth. However, we have and will continue to reinforce and accelerate our actions to respond appropriately to the tougher environment we find ourselves in. 
Of course, in addition, from time to time, we have the opportunity for specific initiatives to rebase our costs, often prompted by new technologies, practices or structure. You have heard many examples from Alex and James, and we have significantly increased the goal for our Transformational Cost Management Program. 
We remain a global business, delivering billions of dollars in earnings and billions of dollars in cash flow and generating real value for our shareholders while being a huge force of good in the communities we serve and society as a whole. Day in and day out, we continue, directly or indirectly, to be a core and vital part of the lives of a significant percentage of the world's population through presence and reach into the very heart of communities across the world. 
We are not complacent. We must continue to evolve and innovate to drive. And as a management team, we are more focused than ever on delivering operational and financial growth and value for our owners. I can assure you there is innovation throughout our business internally and outward facing, within our own teams and in a wide range of partnerships. There are innovations in how we work, in our products and services, in how we interact with and serve our customers, both retail and commercial. 
So despite the disappointment of the quarter under review and the impact that it will have on the year as a whole, I remain confident that in future, we can return to reliable, mid- to high single-digit earnings per share growth from our businesses. And I remain committed to and confident of delivering real value for our customers, the communities we serve, my colleagues and most importantly, my fellow shareholders looking forward.

And secondly, to look at future profit streams in areas like health care services, the health care hub project and also the front end in terms of really finding new models to drive the front end of partnerships with Kroger, Birchbox and Sprint. These are really focus areas. In terms of protecting the customer, we continue to move our money and our focus from the old model to the new model. That's been a trend for the last 3, 4, 5 years. And that we continue to do. So along with the savings, there will be reinvestment into these new areas of growth, and then James will cover the reinvestment in a second just to finish up the question. So we are very, very focused on the customer. We're very focused on end-to-end improvement of our operational execution.

And the way we measure success in the program is we want to take the cost down and be the latest operator in the industry. That's number one. But certainly, as we exit and execute against the program, we want to see top line. And if it's coming from this. So there's one number I'm going to give you, and I think it'll concentrate your attention on the -- both the achievability of the targets and our determination to drive a successful business longer term. We will invest approximately $1 billion over the next 3 years in a combination of operating expense and capital. Approximately 80% is operating expense. So think about it for a minute. In 1 year, we'll be putting in $300 million to boost the partnerships and to boost our capabilities and digitalization of the company. So we're not going to starve the business for the sake of hitting a cost goal. That's point number 1. Point number 2 is more important is each digital investment and each partnership has to stand on its own merits. We expect an attractive return, and we expect long-term significant pools of income. And if you like, the plan is on one side, conservative because we put in the money to drive the partnerships and digitalization, and we haven't fully built in benefits of the partnerships flowing through. So if you like, the plan represents an option on the partnerships."

So I'll give you where we're as we look forward with the reimbursement pressure. I think as James said in his prepared remarks, this is a very heavy quarter for reimbursement pressure. And we expect that to be not the normal going forward. And I think he also said that the SAP, for example, in specialty, which is 110 basis points of the reduction, clearly that's an investment out as well. So the timing and then there's SAP, and there's underlying reimbursement pressure. So I think that the third number is the one that is the real underlying trend going forward. Again, there's always contracts that start and end in January 1, particularly Med D. And again, we didn't see really much difference to the trends we spoke about before in Med D. They are really as we saw before. Going to the second question on the safe harbor and the changes in the government is really -- we truly believe in transparency, and we really believe in reducing out-of-pocket costs for drugs for patients across the Medicare. That -- we support that really are from day 1. And therefore, we are working hard with other partners in the marketplace to understand how we can bring that forward with the government. And clearly, we don't know yet what that means for any players in the marketplace, and we are working hard to innovate and to work with other partners. And we'll give you not update as soon as we understand better the rules as they emerge from the government."

So what Alex says is correct. If you like, if you think about your modeling, Q3 had approximately 37 of the -- 37% of the entire year's reimbursement -- Q2, sorry, have the entire 37% versus the 25% expected run rate. So it was exceptionally high. I think as you look forward to the second half, the reimbursement pressure will subside because there's a skew to the first half. The impact of the SAP contract is material as well because year-to-date, it's around 140, 150 basis points. Specialty business will still grow very quickly, but the negative impact will tail off down to 30 basis points. So there will be quite a material change in the trajectory of the gross margin change year-on-year. And then secondly, as you look into next year, we believe we've planned our reimbursement levels roughly similar to what we've seen over the past couple of years. And I think individual quarters will always be extremely volatile and rocky. But over a longer term, while reimbursement is a bit over the trend rate this year, we have planned similar levels going forward. But as I said, we won't have this SAP contract next year. And one big thing that did hit us this year and is still hitting us, and it's one of the reasons for the guidance is to have a lower level of generic utilization than we projected at the start of the year. And that can have quite a material impact on both the revenue and on the cost line. So it does -- if your generic utilization goes down, it does negatively impact your profitability. That will be one potential tailwind that we will have, I would say, 6 months from now to 12 months from now because of contract changes in Med D. We would expect the generic utilization rates to increase, thus, giving us some comfort on -- around the gross margin outlook. I hope that's given you enough perspective."

And then, I guess, the follow-up question to that would be are we at a point with the PBMs where you need to take a tougher stance? I mean, obviously, there's precedent for playing a little harder when it comes to declining reimbursement rates and just not offering the Walgreens network in certain PBM offerings. Is that on the table? Is that kind of where the industry's at given this persistent reimbursement rate pressure?"

I think there was a combination of headwinds that hit us in Q3 and hit us -- sorry, Q2, apologies, through the quarter. And I think James covered them all in -- and they were as such, there was definitely generic deflation was reducing. That has an impact, and it happened through the quarter. Branded inflation was reducing perhaps during the quarter. And, of course, the volume, to be honest, as well was less than we had expected, particularly we had a pretty big, a very big flu and cough and cold season last year, and it was early. And this year it has been more normal and a little bit later. So these are all factors that hit us coming into that period. And I think also the end of the year, we true-up with our PBM partners, adding contracts for the year. And we don't really see the effect of that true-up really until middle of February, and that was another factor that happened as well. So it was a combination of headwinds that gave us this unusually high, the highest quarter this fiscal year that created this reimbursement pressure. I think in terms of our attitude towards our partners in the supply chain, including the PBMs, we have a partnership approach. We are working with our partners to deliver better service, better products, including, for example, improving the ability for us to reduce costs elsewhere in the health care system. I'll give you one example of that. There's more money than ever before coming on the table for our service-based payments, particularly in Medicare D area. And we again are working with partners towards the government to create a more common framework of KPIs that pharmacists could aim for in terms of getting repayments, for example, in Med D. I mean, what are very well, in my view, with Optimum and UnitedHealth and are very successful Medicare Advantage book of business, where again we got more payments than ever for performance-based pharmacy. So I think there's a recognition by our partners that pharmacy is under pressure. I think there's a recognition by our partners who want better joined-up care within health care system. And they're encouraging us through incentives to invest more, as James has said, in these models, and that's what we intend to do."

We're also very pleased with our partnership with Verily. We're really working pretty hard to bring real innovation quickly to the marketplace. They've developed a number of market-ready tools, for example, on dual diabetes platform, which we have already active in our own population or health care beneficiaries here in Walgreens in the U.S.A., and the adoption rate of that tool is really satisfactory so far.

It's a senior model, and it's been well put together to create a complete offer for the senior, including the pharmacist has been part of the morning hurdle, for example, with the primary care doctors and the nurse practitioners.

So as you look to the next 3 years, about 2.5 percentage points of growth comes from buybacks, with some offset coming from a tax rate that's turning negative. So as we look to mid-single-digit, if you call that kind of like a 6% to 8%, we see the core business growing at 3.5% to 5.5%, excluding the use of cash for capital allocation.

And we've got a lot of surprises, but we've got a couple of headwinds that we'll face this year. So if you step back from this and look back over the last couple of years, this is a business that can deliver pretty comfortably, somewhere in the region of $5 billion, $5.5 billion to $6 billion of cash flow depending on the year. Now as you compare 1 year to another, you always have -- you're always lapping something of some sorts. This year, we have about $2.3 billion of headwinds. So I think as you think through a normal level of cash flow, which is somewhere north of $5 billion, we have to manage through cash taxes this year, which are $900 million higher than in the previous year. We're cycling through legal payouts of $300 million, and then we have large movements as a result of Rite Aid, almost $1 billion. So the cash flow this year will be well below the trend rates, but we have developed a trigger plan and some support of our guidance. And we're quite comfortable on the long-term cash flow generating part of the company. And actually, quite I'll even go so far as saying is that when you look at some of our payment terms with suppliers and some of the way we manage inventory, we probably have large doses of opportunity. And then the final comment on cash flow, as you look at this year, our cash capital expenditures are exceptionally high. They're about $300 million or $400 million higher than the run rate, and that's essentially the conversion of the Rite Aid stores. So it's quite a huge exercise because we took on 1,900 stores. As you saw for Alex, we are raising the store closures to 750. But that still leaves the conversion of 1,200 stores. And, by the way, the Rite Aid acquisition has gone extremely well. The return on investment is exactly where we wanted it to be. We're getting there in a different way, and actually, we're very encouraged by the retention we're getting as we optimize the stores. So cash flow this year will be somewhat problematic, but we're quite confident on the future outlook."

But how do you think about sort of the state of pharmacy and the competitive landscape because as we think about what's driving possibly some of the reimbursement pressure outside of lower brands, some of it is still the fact that we're overboxed across the U.S. maybe by a substantial amount. And so how do you think about that in the context of kind of what you can control and what you can't control and how you expect some of the smaller peers, I guess, to sort of play out over the next couple of years?"

We're partnering with others to take care of other categories. And lastly but not least, we have 80 million, 85 million loyalty cash holders, and we believe data analytics are really important on how you personalize the offer pharmacy-led and Health & Beauty specialties and how you work with others to create real personalization in the marketing.

As you look through the back half, we did say the peak in the issue on gross margins and pharmacy is in Q2. We do expect some continuation in Q3 and then an improvement in Q4. So",620,"Yes, let me cover first the back half, and then I'll move on to the 3 year. As you look through the back half, we did say the peak in the issue on gross margins and pharmacy is in Q2. We do expect some continuation in Q3 and then an improvement in Q4. So as you plot out your quarters, I would assume a fairly even split in the EPS between the 2 quarters maybe 49, 51. So Q3 will be worse, and Q4 will be improving. We actually -- we set ourselves a different goal when we pulled together. It's not really guidance. It's a growth model, and we stepped back, and we went through a very, very detailed reviews with each of the business leaders. And here is the goal we set ourselves. We wanted to set a realistic goal, mid- to high single-digit. We spent a lot of time on the levers to offset reimbursement, particularly on the assumptions around generic deflation and the ability of our generic purchasing organization to deliver significant offset. We're comfortable that the generic team can offset approximately 50% to 60% of the reimbursement. And then we went through each single volume assumption, particularly pharmacy but also in the retail business, and I really don't want to be lost on the audience the changes we're making in retail. And one is this business went from a loss-making business 3 years ago to quite a profitable retail business now. So we are -- from a starting point, it's a position of strength but with a weak top line delivery. And the big change will be we will distort and refocus our resources on health and wellness and beauty. And that's where we can win, and we know we can win, and they're very attractive businesses. And then we will build partnerships with companies like Kroger to address the other parts of retail, and we're very convinced that we have line of sight to improving top line. The second part is we said can we -- let's put in what we can control, and you can control your cost journey. And we built in $1.5 billion. We've got a strong governance around it, and we'll be delivering. And I emphasize at least $1.5 billion of cost reduction, so that has a high degree of probability. And then the final thing, which we said at the beginning was you can't cut yourself to glory. So we've built in the investments required to drive the top line. So we have the right investments, $300 million a year, which it adds up to $1 billion of investments behind partnerships and digital. So we're investing to make sure, especially that the U.S. business has the ammunition required to create that omnichannel experience in both pharmacy and in retail, so that we do get the volume delivery that creates the virtuous cycle. And that's the reason why we are actually quite confident that the growth model for the 3 years is founded in a lot of fact. And actually, it's quite a detailed plan we've developed internally. And the question we got earlier, does it translate to cash, and the answer is yes. We see a line of sight consistently delivering that $5 billion type of range that we've done in the past. We see no reason why the business can't do something similar into the future. And I said while Stefano said at the past we're very disappointed with the quarter and the requirement to take down guidance and to me, that's resolute that we put in place very tangible plans to make sure we don't have to do that again, and that's the commitment from management team."

There is nothing entirely new in what we have seen impact our business during the quarter. That said, a number of the trends that we had been expecting and preparing for impacted us significantly more quickly than we had anticipated. 
We found ourselves facing a combination of increased reimbursement pressure in the quarter, lower generic deflation, lower brand inflation and lower-than-anticipated benefits from our work to refresh and renew our retail offerings, primarily in the U.S. Of course, the pharmacy trends are not only impacting our business. They are impacting the overall market and will likely continue to do so over the coming months. 
Let me be clear, however. I am convinced that our existing strategic priorities are the right ones and will help us to deliver sustainable growth into the future. Let me remind you of our 4 priorities: accelerating the digitalization of our company; transforming and restructuring our retail offering; creating neighborhood health destination around a more modern pharmacy; and rolling out our Transformational Cost Management Program. 
We are making strong progress against these transformation priorities across multiple fronts. However, we now need to respond appropriately to the tougher environment that we find ourselves in. We will build off of our existing transformation priorities and we will reinforce and accelerate our actions. We are acting quickly to address select areas of operational weakness with a number of senior appointments, choosing new talent with new ideas and new approaches to drive more rapid change in a number of areas of our business.  
We are also strengthening and refocusing our operational management to ensure increased focus on driving operational excellence. In recent months, we have brought in a new Chief Digital Officer, a new Global Chief Marketing Officer, a new Global Chief Supply Chain Officer. We have restructured entirely the organization of our brands business. And since the quarter end, we have brought in a new Global Controller and Chief Accounting Officer. We have reviewed our priorities and business initiatives underway and have reworked our management plans in light of the more adverse environment.
First and foremost, we are acknowledging the short-term headwinds that we are facing and the limited time we have available to compensate for the impacts in the remainder of the year. As a result, we are reducing our guidance for fiscal 2019. James will talk to you about that in a moment. We believe the actions that we are taking will result in improved performance in 2020. Looking beyond that, we are convinced that our business model can deliver sustainable adjusted earnings per share growth of mid- to high single digits. 
I will now ask James to take you through the results and our updated guidance for the year. James?"

On a constant currency basis, adjusted earnings per share declined 4.3% in the quarter, bringing our first half EPS growth to 3.6%.

On a constant currency basis, adjusted earnings per share declined 4.3% in the quarter, bringing our first half EPS growth to 3.6%. The results were much weaker than we had expected due to 3 key factors. 
As with our competitors, we are seeing continued reimbursement pressure. And the opportunities to mitigate have reduced due to lower levels of generic deflation and lower brand inflation. The second key factor is volume. Our same-store growth in the U.S. is trending below plan in both pharmacy and front of store. And lastly, consumer conditions in the U.K. remain challenging. 
We are also lapping a particularly strong second quarter last year, when constant currency adjusted EPS increased 25.7%. We are clearly not pleased with this quarter's performance, and we are taking immediate actions to improve operational performance and to reinforce and accelerate our existing transformation plans.
Let's now look in more detail at the numbers. In the second quarter, sales increased 4.6%, including a currency headwind of 2.1%. On a constant currency basis, sales were up 6.7%, reflecting the acquisition of the Rite Aid stores. Organic sales growth was 2.5%. Adjusted operating income declined 10.4% or 9.3% on a constant currency basis. The decline was mainly due to our weak quarter in Retail Pharmacy USA, which declined 11.9% year-on-year due to lower pharmacy margins and a decline in front-end comparable sales. 
Adjusted diluted earnings per share declined 5.4% to $1.64, a decrease of 4.3% on a constant currency basis. This includes a 4.5 percentage point contribution from our share repurchase program. GAAP operating income declined 23% in the quarter, including restructuring charges of $150 million as we ramp up the Transformational Cost Management Program and the prior year adjustment of $113 million relating to AmerisourceBergen tax law changes. GAAP EPS declined 8.3% to $1.24 per share.
Before I move on to our divisional performance, let me briefly cover first our financial highlights. Sales increased 7.2%, including a currency headwind of 1.8%. On a constant currency basis, sales were up 9%, reflecting the acquisition of the Rite Aid stores. Organic sales growth was 3.3%. 
Adjusted operating income declined 7.5% or 6.6% on a constant currency basis, reflecting the negative impact of reimbursement pressure on U.S. pharmacy gross margins, comp sales declines in U.S. retail and weak market conditions in the U.K. Adjusted EPS increased 3.6% on a constant currency basis. GAAP earnings per share were up 12% as the absence of prior year items related to U.S. tax law changes and impairment were partly offset by $179 million of pretax restructuring costs related to the Transformational Cost Management Program.
Now let's look at the performance of our divisions, starting with Retail Pharmacy USA. Sales advanced 7.3% in the quarter, reflecting the acquired Rite Aid stores and organic sales growth of 1.6%. Adjusted gross profit declined 3.5% in the quarter, reflecting declines in both pharmacy and retail. Gross margin declined 260 basis points, mostly due to pharmacy. 
Adjusted SG&A spend declined 0.6% versus prior year. And excluding Rite Aid, adjusted SG&A spend was 6.8% lower than the prior period. Continued cost-saving initiatives and the impact of a lower bonus accrual more than offset inflation and store labor investments. Adjusted SG&A was 17.7% of sales, an improvement of 140 basis points compared to the year-ago quarter.
Adjusted operating income declined 11.9% in the quarter. Continued SG&A savings, procurement savings and pharmacy volume growth were not sufficient to offset the unusually high year-on-year impact from reimbursement and underperformance in the front of store. This result included store and labor investments of $40 million in the quarter, equivalent to approximately 240 basis points of adjusted operating income.
Now let's look in more detail at pharmacy. Total pharmacy sales increased 9.8%, reflecting the acquisition of the Rite Aid stores and organic growth of 4%. Second quarter market share was 22.3%, up approximately 90 basis points compared to last year, reflecting the acquired Rite Aid stores. Comp pharmacy sales increased 1.9% and our central specialty business grew 28.7% year-on-year. The number of retail prescriptions filled on a 30-day adjusted basis, including immunizations, increased 6.4%. Comp prescriptions grew 1.8%, slightly behind the first quarter growth of 2%. Pharmacy gross profit declined versus prior year as volume growth was more than offset by lower gross margin. 
The pharmacy market is very challenging right now, and we are seeing similar trends to our competitors. Reimbursement pressure has continued and opportunities for mitigation are lower than we expected. The combination of this reimbursement pressure, lower levels of generic deflation and lower brand inflation resulted in pharmacy margins that were worse than planned and 280 basis points below the same period last year. Also included here is a 110 basis point impact due to the faster growth of the lower-margin specialty business. And as we looked at the quarter, the year-on-year reimbursement impact was exceptionally high. And we estimate an adverse timing impact of approximately 60 basis points.
Turning next to our retail business. Retail sales increased 1.3%, reflecting the sales contribution from the acquired Rite Aid stores. Comp retail sales declined 3.8% as we faced some headwinds during the quarter. We are lapping an exceptionally strong prior year cough, cold, flu season. And this accounted for 150 basis points of the year-on-year sales decline. Secondly, we continued to de-emphasize tobacco with an impact of around 125 basis points. And finally, we had a weak quarter in seasonal and gifting with a 70 basis points impact. And here, we clearly need to improve our range and execution.
Retail gross profit declined in the quarter with retail gross margin 90 basis points lower than prior year, predominantly due to short-term changes in promotional activity. But let me remind you that excluding Rite Aid, our retail gross margin has improved by approximately 290 basis points since 2015. That being said, while we are pleased with our long-term margin performance, we are clearly not satisfied with our recent front-of-store sales performance.
Now let me pass it to Alex, who will update you on our transformation priorities and explain the actions we are taking to address our current business challenges."

While external factors, including reimbursement pressure and a weaker cough, cold and flu season impacted us in the quarter, we clearly need to improve our execution and speed of delivery. We have not moved quickly enough to address the changes in the market and as a result, did not deliver the growth required to help mitigate the continued reimbursement pressure. 
With that context, let me share some of the actions we are focused on. Our overall transformation priorities are unchanged, but we're seeking to reinforce and accelerate our actions. As Stefano mentioned, we are accelerating the digitalization of our company; transforming and restructuring our retail offering; creating neighborhood health destinations based on a more modern pharmacy; and rolling out our Transformational Cost Management Program. 
On cost management, we are continuing to make major strides and see more opportunities, which James will cover in more detail later. Overall, we recognize the importance of accelerating the transformation of our business more significantly to the customer. So let's look for a moment at some of the specific actions we are taking.
Firstly, it's crystal clear that it all works only if we have the right talent, capabilities and operational focus. To that end, we have recently executed a comprehensive reorganization of my senior leadership team. We have announced a new leadership structure, which clearly delineates between development and delivery. This is allowing my senior executives to focus on driving operational excellence and delivering results in their specific area. 
We have also made changes to how we manage our strategic partnerships, increasing the focus on accountability for developing our health care and retail services, ensuring financial discipline, pace, accountability and maximization of new profit streams. As Stefano mentioned, we have brought in a number of new senior executives to Walgreens Boots Alliance with specific skills and expertise. And they will work closely with my team to drive performance improvements.
We are on track on digitalization. The Microsoft teams are onboarded. They are physically present in our offices and we have moved quickly to consolidate our internal digital teams to create a single team under an experienced Chief Digital Officer. 
We have put in place new action plans for both pharmacy and retail. In pharmacy, we have created a dedicated, accountable team to drive volume through our partnerships with payers in the marketplace. This will allow the rest of the team to focus on operational effectiveness in our core pharmacy business, delivering our vision of a modern pharmacy, driving efficiency and maximizing opportunities through outcomes-based reimbursement. These new approaches will help us counteract reimbursement pressure. 
In retail, we recognized the need to concentrate our efforts where we know we can win. Right now, our execution is lagging where it needs to be. We will continue to accept revenue declines in low-margin categories, where we do not see a winning future path. We've invested some margin this quarter in categories we know drive footfall. And we're already starting to see the benefit of this investment in improved revenue and gross profit. 
We will concentrate our efforts, shifting resources, people and dollars to our flagship brands, including Walgreens health care brands and No7 and our priority categories. A great example is health and wellness. It's a significant cash stream with very attractive margins. We will step up the level of innovation and marketing support. We continue to be pleased with the progress we're making on our partnerships. In particular, we're working closely with the Kroger executive team to determine how best to unlock future growth and synergies. 
And the work we are doing on digitalization of our business will deliver an enhanced customer experience and the tools and analytics to drive customer loyalty. This builds on our existing highly successful customer-facing platforms, including our 5-star-rated 55 million downloaded app and our 85 million active Balance Rewards members. 
We previously highlighted the very high customer retention rates we have delivered on the Rite Aid store optimization. These very favorable retention rates, which allow us to focus volume locally on fewer stores without reducing our geographic coverage, delivered greatly improved returns and have led to a decision to boost our store optimization program from 600 stores to approximately 750 stores. 
Parallel to this, we're undertaking a comprehensive review of Walgreens store networks to address specific underperforming stores. And as you know, we are testing a small store format. And pending positive results, we anticipate building out this format over the coming years. More information will follow in the coming months. 
I'll hand you back to James now to update you on Retail Pharmacy International."

Our smart spending/smart organization is advancing well. And a store portfolio review is underway, focusing on low-performing stores and opportunities for consolidation. 
In addition, we are looking closely at our pharmacy business to further improve efficiency and effectiveness. We continue also to strengthen the Boots leadership team with the appointment of a new Chief Operating Officer. And as mentioned on last quarter's earnings call, we have multiple initiatives underway to improve our revenue performance. 
We are refitting 24 beauty halls across the U.K. between now and the end of May, introducing Boots beauty specialists with an in-depth knowledge spanning all categories and brands. And we're significantly expanding our beauty offering by introducing more than 20 new on-trend brands nationwide over the next 6 months.

The division delivered another solid quarter with sales up 9.1%, mainly due to growth in emerging markets but also aided by a customer contract change in the U.K., which contributed 2.1% of revenue growth. Adjusted operating income increased 3% with sales growth and an improvement in SG&A as a percentage of sales more than offsetting gross margin pressure. 
Turning next to cash flow. Operating cash flow was $1.2 billion in the first half. Free cash flow was $401 million. This was impacted by headwinds of $1 billion, including increased cash tax payments of $465 million, mainly as a result of U.S. tax reform; legal settlements of $276 million; and a once-off working capital benefit of $233 million in the prior year. 
Working capital days improved year-on-year. But the first half free cash flow reflects approximately $750 million of working capital increases, primarily due to higher sales and the timing of receipts. Cash capital investment was $793 million in the first half, $128 million higher than prior year due to the impact of Rite Aid store conversions. 
Turning now to our guidance for the year. In light of the first half performance and our expectations for a challenging second half, we are revising our full year guidance for fiscal year 2019. We now expect adjusted EPS to be roughly flat on a constant currency basis. However, given the normal level of volatility in a business of this size, realistically, you should expect a range of plus or minus 2%. 
The downward revision considers the following key changes. We anticipate gross margins to remain under pressure in the U.S. in the second half. Reimbursement pressure is unlikely to improve in the short term. And it will take time for our complete mitigation plans to kick in. In terms of volume, our U.S. pharmacy and U.S. retail performance has been below plan in the first half of the year. And while we are taking decisive actions in the U.K., market conditions remain weak. And we have reflected this in our revised guidance. 
Given the revised full year EPS outlook, the estimated bonus payout for the year has been substantially reduced. And while our Transformational Cost Management Program is very much on track, the contribution to fiscal year '19 results was assumed when we provided guidance in December of 2018. 
Finally, let me provide you with some supporting guidance assumptions. As you look forward for the second half, please remember that we have now lapped Rite Aid. And we will continue to see adverse reimbursement pressure impacting the revenue line. Currencies have an adverse EPS impact of approximately $0.04 versus prior year, unchanged versus our guidance at the beginning of the year. 
We now project a full year tax rate of 16% to 17%. The more favorable outlook reflects nonrecurring discrete benefits and changes in our geographical mix of earnings. And we project full year share repurchases of $3.8 billion compared to $3 billion guidance at the beginning of the year. This contributes 4.5% to EPS growth. 
Turning to our long-term business model. Firstly, we believe the business model is well positioned to deliver sustainable constant currency adjusted EPS growth well into the future. We have good line of sight to levers to counteract reimbursement pressure. Predictable volume growth and excellence in cost management will be key. And this requires us to execute strongly against our existing transformation priorities. 
Volume growth will be underpinned by delivering improved value for both payers and consumers. We absolutely must drive a renewed focus on operational excellence, whether it be adherence, patient satisfaction or a management of our offering in the front of store. And we will see the benefits of our digitalization program with more frequent enhancements to our customer offer over the course of the coming months and years. 
Finally, in the U.K., we expect our store and brand investments to begin to bear fruit as we exit 2019. Importantly, by 2022, we anticipate annual savings in excess of $1.5 billion from our Transformational Cost Management Program. And while a program of this magnitude is never easy, we do have good visibility on what needs to be done and strong commitment from the leadership team to get it done. 
Beyond 2022, we expect a rising contribution from partnerships. However, until then, our EPS growth model is not dependent on a material ramp-up of any of the existing partnerships. In fact, we are making significant investments in the short and medium term to drive long-term earnings upside. And long term, we do believe that health care and retail services will provide us with attractive returns and substantial new sources of income. 
Let me focus now on the Transformational Cost Management Program. Last quarter, we launched a program targeting annual savings in excess of $1 billion. We also told you that we needed to complete a 16-week assessment phase. We are now 3 months in. And while we are not fully complete, we do have a much deeper understanding of the areas of potential savings. 
Given what we have seen to date, we are increasing our annual cost-saving target to at least $1.5 billion. Smart spending is progressing well. We have completed our benchmarking for select spend categories. For example, our benchmarks indicate that our consultant and supply costs are second quartile while our contractor, events, technology and travel spend are all above the median of the peer set. This shows the granularity we're operating at and the potential we see to reduce costs. 
Moving on to smart organization. As a reminder, in the first quarter, we announced and implemented reorganizations and store closure initiatives to rightsize operations in Chile and Mexico. And we launched an optimization initiative in our Pharmaceutical Wholesale division. We continued to move quickly and we took further decisive steps in the second quarter. 
As mentioned earlier, we announced a 20% reduction of the Boots UK central workforce. And the reduction should be largely complete by the end of the fiscal year. On the 21st of March, we announced a new field management structure in the U.S. The new organization combines the previously separate Walgreens and Rite Aid store management teams. And we expect the implementation to be completed by the beginning of June. 
The final bucket is digitalization. We just completed a detailed review of our global IT spend, and we are very encouraged by the findings. We see opportunities to reduce our annual IT cash spend by $500 million to $600 million, almost equally split between OpEx and CapEx. This represents a reduction of approximately 25% to 30% versus the baseline cost. So it is a significant opportunity. In the short term, we plan to selectively invest part of the savings to build out new customer digital propositions. However, we will expect each project to drive incremental value and benefits, thus creating a virtuous cycle. 
As we look forward to 2020 and beyond, we see improved operational EPS performance. Over the long term, we are comfortable that our growth model can deliver mid- to high single-digit adjusted EPS growth in constant currencies. One call-out on fiscal 2020, we do anticipate growth from operations. However, adjusted EPS in constant currency is expected to be broadly flat due to the reduction in bonus payments in 2019. 
As we built out our long-term business model, we made the following assumptions, which you may find helpful. We assume share repurchases of $1.7 billion per year, contributing approximately 2.5% to EPS growth. However, this is partly offset by tax rate, which is expected to increase from 16% to 17% in 2019 to over 18% by 2022 and creating a headwind of 50 to 100 basis points, depending on the year. 
In summary, we have reworked our business plans to accelerate and boost our existing transformation priorities. And while there may be quarterly fluctuations along the way, these plans should allow us to return to long-term adjusted EPS growth. 
I will now hand you back to Stefano."

And I am equally disappointed that we had to reduce our full year guidance. However, we need to acknowledge the short-term headwinds that we are facing. And while we are not the only company that has been impacted by the marked change in the environment, that's not an excuse. 
What is important now is that we respond quickly to ensure we return to growth as soon as possible. This quarter has focused the minds of the entire team on the need to allocate resources to where they will have the greatest impact, both today and in the future. Importantly, I am convinced that our existing strategic priorities are the right ones. And our multiyear transformation program will allow us to deliver sustainable, profitable growth. 
However, we have and will continue to reinforce and accelerate our actions to respond appropriately to the tougher environment we find ourselves in. Of course, in addition, from time to time, we have the opportunity for specific initiatives to rebase our cost, often prompted by new technologies, practices or structure. You have heard many examples from Alex and James. And we have significantly increased the goal for our Transformational Cost Management Program. 
We remain a global business, delivering billions of dollars in earnings and billions of dollars in cash flow and generating real value for our shareholders while being a huge force of good in the communities we serve and society as a whole. Day in and day out, we continue, directly or indirectly, to be a core and vital part of the lives of a significant percentage of the world's population through a presence and reach into the very heart of communities across the world. 
We are not complacent. We must continue to evolve and innovate to drive. And as a management team, we are more focused than ever on delivering operational and financial growth and value for our owners. I can assure you there is innovation throughout our business internally and outward-facing, within our own teams and in a wide range of partnerships. There are innovations in how we work, in our products and services, in how we interact with and serve our customers, both retail and commercial. 
So despite the disappointment of the quarter under review and the impact that it will have on the year as a whole, I remain confident that in future, we can return to reliable, mid- to high single-digit earnings per share growth from our businesses. And I remain committed to and confident of delivering real value for our customers, the communities we serve, my colleagues and most importantly, my fellow shareholders looking forward. 
Thank you. Now we will take your questions."

And secondly, to look at future profit streams in areas like health care services, the health care hub project and also the front end in terms of really finding new models to drive the front end of partnerships with Kroger, Birchbox and Sprint. These are really focus areas. 
In terms of protecting the customer, we continue to move our money and our focus from the old model to the new model. That's been the trend for the last 3, 4, 5 years. And that's what we continue to do. So along with the savings, there will be reinvestment into these new areas of growth. And then James will cover the reinvestment in a second just. to finish up the question. So we are very, very focused on the customer. We're very focused on end-to-end improvement of our operational execution. And that's why we reorganized, along with the opening of opportunity to invest more in the future models.

So as you look forward, and we're quite clear on where we're targeting in excess of $1.5 billion of savings, bear in mind, you have inflation that offset some of that. But the key one here is are we investing for the future? And the way we've defined in the program in general is we want to save to invest to grow. And the way we measure success in the program is we want to take the cost down and be the leanest operator in the industry. That's number one. But secondly is, as we exit and execute against the program, we want to see top line benefits coming from this. So there's one number I'm going to give you, and I think it will concentrate your attention on the -- both the achievability of the targets and our determination to drive a successful business longer term. We will invest approximately $1 billion over the next 3 years in a combination of operating expense and capital. Approximately 80% is operating expense. 
So think about it for a minute. In 1 year, we'll be putting in $300 million to boost the partnerships and to boost our capabilities and digitalization of the company. So we're not going to starve the business for the sake of hitting a cost goal. That's point number one. Point number two is more important is each digital investment and each partnership has to stand on its own merits. We expect an attractive return and we expect long-term significant pools of income. And if you like, the plan is on one side, conservative because we've put in the money to drive the partnerships and digitalization and we haven't fully built in benefits of the partnerships flowing through. So if you like, the plan represents an option on the partnerships."

Or is the run rate that we're seeing for the quarter what we should model for the rest of the year? And then the follow-up question to that is when we think about all the changes that are coming up in U.S. health care, the proposed rebate rule on Part D is a pretty significant one.

Clearly, that's an [indiscernible] out as well. So there's timing and then there's SAP and there's underlying reimbursement pressure. So I think that the third number is the one that is the real underlying trend going forward. Again, there's always contracts that start and end on Jan 1, particularly Med D. And again, we didn't see really much difference to the trends we spoke about before on Med D. They are really as we saw before. 
Going to the second question on the safe harbor and the changes in the government, it's really early. We truly believe in transparency. And we really believe in reducing out-of-pocket costs for drugs for patients across the Medicare. We support that really from day 1. And therefore, we are working hard with other partners in the marketplace to understand how we can bring that forward with the government. And clearly, we don't know yet what that really means for any players in the marketplace. But we are working hard to innovate and to work with other partners. And we'll give you an update as soon as we understand better the rules as they emerge from the government."

And maybe, Ricky, if I could add a couple of just facts for that. So what Alex says is correct. If you like, if you're thinking about your modeling, Q3 had approximately 37% of the entire year's reimbursement impact -- Q2, sorry, have the entire 37%",345,"Yes. And maybe, Ricky, if I could add a couple of just facts for that. So what Alex says is correct. If you like, if you're thinking about your modeling, Q3 had approximately 37% of the entire year's reimbursement impact -- Q2, sorry, have the entire 37% versus the 25% expected run rate. So it was exceptionally high. So I think as you look forward to the second half, the reimbursement pressure will subside because there's a skew to the first half. The impact of the SAP contract is material as well. Because year-to-date, it's around 140, 150 basis points. The specialty business will still grow very quickly. But the negative impact will tail off down to 30 basis points. So there will be quite a material change in the trajectory of the gross margin change year-on-year. And then secondly, as you look into next year, we believe we've planned our reimbursement levels roughly similar to what we've seen over the past couple of years. 
And I think individual quarters will always be extremely volatile and rocky. But over a longer term, while reimbursement is a bit over the trend rate this year, we have planned similar levels going forward. But as I said, we won't have this SAP contract next year. And one big thing that did hit us this year and is still hitting us, and it's one of the reasons for the guidance, is we do have a lower level of generic utilization than we projected at the start of the year. And that can have quite a material impact on both the revenue and on the cost line. So it does -- if your generic utilization goes down, it does negatively impact your profitability. That will be one potential tailwind that we will have, I would say, 6 months from now to 12 months from now. Because of contract changes in Med D, we would expect our generic utilization rates to increase, thus giving us some comfort on -- around the gross margin outlook. I hope that's given you enough perspective."

And so could you maybe just explain the dynamic there that has the rates coming in so much worse than what you anticipated? And then I guess, the follow-up question to that would be are we at a point with the PBMs where you need to take a tougher stance? I mean, obviously, there's precedent for playing a little harder when it comes to declining reimbursement rates and just not offering the Walgreens network in certain PBM offerings. Is that on the table? Is that kind of where the industry is at, given this persistent reimbursement rate pressure?"

And I think James covered them off in -- and they were as such. It was definitely generic deflation was reducing. That has had an impact, and that happened through the quarter. Branded inflation was reducing that happened during the quarter. And of course, the volume, to be honest with it as well, was less than we had expected. Particularly, we had a pretty big, a very big flu and cough and cold season last year and it was early. And this year, it's been more normal and a little bit later. So these are all factors that hit us coming into that period. And I think also at the end of the year, we true-up with our PBM partners the contracts for the year. And we don't really see the effect of that true-up really until middle of February. And that was another factor that happened as well. So it was a combination of headwinds that gave us this unusually high, the highest quarter [indiscernible] this fiscal year that created this reimbursement pressure. 
I think in terms of our attitude towards our partners in the supply chain, including the PBMs, we have a partnership approach. We are working with our partners to deliver better service, better products, including, for example, improving the ability for us to reduce costs elsewhere in the health care system. I'll give you one example of that. There's more money than ever before coming on the table for our service-based payments, particularly in the Medicare D area. And we again are working with partners towards the government to create a more common framework of KPIs that pharmacists could aim for in terms of getting repayments, for example, in Med D and DIRs. I mean it worked out very well, in my view, with Optum and UnitedHealth in a very successful Medicare Advantage book of business, where again we got more payments than ever for performance-based pharmacy. So I think there's a recognition by our partners that pharmacy is under pressure. I think there's a recognition by our partners who want better joined-up care within the health care system. And they're encouraging us through our learning incentives to invest more, as James has said, in these models. And that's what we intend to do."

So that, by some way, is the most important piece of work we're doing. It's where we're investing the most of our money going forward to really create better tools for engagement for customers across both front end and pharmacy and better ways for our business partners to engage with our health care platform. We're also very pleased with our partnership with Verily. We're really working pretty hard to bring real innovation quickly to the marketplace. They've developed a number of market-ready tools, for example, on their Onduo diabetes platform, which we have already active in our own population of health care beneficiaries here in Walgreens in the U.S.A. And the adoption rate of that tool is very satisfactory so far. And we believe that's another example of bringing new tools to market very quickly with new partnerships. 
On the retail side, I think we mentioned in our prepared remarks that we're very pleased with the rapid progress from a customer point of view and engagement in the Kroger trials in Northern Kentucky and Cincinnati. We're really very pleased with that. And we expect to be able to move that test and trial further forward going forward. And of course, that is more focused on creating 2 things: first of all, convenience in retail between fantastic grocer and food brand in Kroger and obviously our pharmacy and health care and beauty brands here in Walgreens; and secondly, working to share data appropriately, so we can personalize the offer for many Americans who rely on these categories every single week and every single day. They're the most sticky categories because they're the ones that are most frequently used. Beyond that, Birchbox is in early stages but going well. And Sprint again we announced in the expansion to 80 stores of Sprint. And last but not least, on the health care side, as I said, LabCorp, where we continue to advance our LabCorp partnership with the ambition -- or the intention, should I say, to drive to 600 locations within the next 3.5 years."

Secondly, I would say that the partnership with Microsoft, as I mentioned already, is a clear acceleration of the digitalization of our company, along with recruiting internally a lot of -- particularly our Chief Digital Officer. 
And there's more people coming in to really drive the modernization of our platform and processes to become a new retail and health care company. That's a very important acceleration and investment. And thirdly, I would say that we're encouraged by Kroger. Again, I go back to the importance of food, the importance of footfall in our stores. And we recognize that we have a very low market share in food. And we recognize that Kroger is a food expert and a national food expert here in the U.S. And we are encouraged with the money we spent in the early testing trials.

And we've got, not surprises, but we have a couple of headwinds that we will face this year. So if you step back from this and look back over the last couple of years, this is a business that can deliver pretty comfortably somewhere in the region of $5 billion, $5.5 billion to $6 billion of cash flow, depending on the year. Now as you compare 1 year to another, you always have -- you're always lapping something of some sorts. This year, we have about $2.3 billion of headwinds. So I think as you think through a normal level of cash flow, which is somewhere north of $5 billion, we have to manage through cash taxes this year, which are $900 million higher than in the previous year. We're cycling through legal payouts of $300 million. And then we have large movements as a result of Rite Aid, almost $1 billion. So the cash flow this year will be well below the trend rate. But we have developed a 3-year plan and some support of our guidance. And we're quite comfortable on the long-term cash flow generating part of the company. 
And actually, quite -- I would even go so far as saying that I think when you look at some of our payment terms with suppliers and some of the way we manage inventory, we probably have large doses of opportunity. And then the final comment on cash flow, as you look at this year, our cash capital expenditures are exceptionally high. They're about $300 million or $400 million higher than the run rate. And that's essentially the conversion of the Rite Aid stores. So it's quite a huge exercise because we took on 1,900 stores. As you saw from Alex, we are raising the store closures to 750. But that still leaves the conversion of 1,200 stores. And by the way, the Rite Aid acquisition has gone extremely well. The return on investment is exactly where we wanted it to be. We're getting there in a different way. And actually, we're very encouraged by the retention we're getting as we optimize the stores. So cash flow this year will be somewhat problematic. But we're quite confident on the future outlook."

And then what we call Rx renewal, which is a renewal of all of the pharmacy systems. And that's a longer program. That's much more integrated with the digital journey we're on. And that will take a number of years. These are fully funded in any guidance we're giving. And they are quite transformational in terms of the way the company will operate. And we will obviously leverage them to reduce cost to fill across the company, back office, but equally so to engage more deeply with the consumer on the front of store and with patients as they come in through the pharmacy.

That's the one thing that's sort of lacking here. 
Obviously, you guys are closing more stores than what we saw in the past. But how do you think about sort of the state of pharmacy and the competitive landscape? Because if we think about what's driving possibly some of the reimbursement pressure outside of lower brands, some of it is still the fact that we're overboxed across the U.S. maybe by a substantial amount. And so how do you think about that in the context of kind of what you can control and what you can't control and how you expect some of the smaller peers, I guess, to sort of play out over the next couple of years?"

As you look through the back half, we did say that the peak in the issue on gross margins in pharmacy is in Q2. We do expect some continuation into Q3 and then an improvement in Q4. So as you plot out your quarters, I would assume a fairly even split in the EPS between the 2 quarters, maybe 49-51. So Q3 will be worse and Q4 will be improving. We actually -- we set ourselves a different goal when we pulled together, and it's not really guidance, it's a growth model. And we stepped back and we went through very, very detailed reviews with each of the business leaders. And here is the goal we set ourselves. We wanted to set a realistic goal, mid- to high single-digit. We spent a lot of time on the levers to offset reimbursement, particularly on the assumptions around generic deflation and the ability of our generic purchasing organization to deliver a significant offset. And we're comfortable that the generic team can offset approximately 50% to 60% of the reimbursement impact. Then we went through each single volume assumption, particularly pharmacy but also in the retail business. And I really don't want it to be lost on the audience the changes we're making in retail. And one is this business went from a loss-making business 3 years ago to quite a profitable retail business now. So we are -- from a starting point, it's a position of strength but with a weak top line delivery. And the big change will be we will distort and refocus our resources on health and wellness and beauty. And that's where we can win and we know we can win. And they're very attractive businesses. And then we will build partnerships with companies like Kroger to address the other parts of retail. And we're very convinced that we have line of sight to improving top line. 
The second part is we said can we -- let's put in what we can control. And you can control your cost journey. And we built in $1.5 billion. We've put a strong governance around it. And we'll be resolute in delivering. And I emphasize at least $1.5 billion of cost reduction. So that has a high degree of probability. And then the final thing, which we said at the beginning, was you can't cut yourself to glory. So we've built in the investments required to drive the top line. So we have the right investments, $300 million a year average. It adds up to $1 billion of investments behind partnerships and digital. So we're investing to make sure especially that the U.S. business has the ammunition required to create that omni-channel experience in both pharmacy and in retail so that we do get the volume delivery that creates the virtuous cycle. And that's the reason why we are actually quite confident that the growth model for the 3 years is founded in a lot of fact. And actually, it's quite a detailed plan we've developed internally. And the question we got earlier, does it translate to cash? And the answer is yes. We see a line of sight in consistently delivering that $5 billion type of range that we've done in the past. We see no reason why the business can't do something similar into the future. And I said what Stefano said at the past, we're very disappointed with the quarter and the requirement to take down guidance. And to me, that's resolute that we put in place very tangible plans to make sure we don't have to do that again. And that's the commitment from management team."

There is nothing entirely new in what we have seen impact our business during the quarter. That said, a number of the trends that we had been expecting and preparing for impacted us significantly more quickly than we had anticipated. 
We found ourselves facing a combination of increased reimbursement pressure in the quarter, lower generic deflation, lower brand inflation and lower-than-anticipated benefits from our work to refresh and renew our retail offering, primarily in the U.S. Of course, the pharmacy trends are not only impacting our business, they are impacting the overall market and will likely continue to do so over the coming months. 
Let me be clear, however. I am convinced that our existing strategic priorities are the right ones and will help us to deliver sustainable growth into the future. Let me remind you of our 4 priorities: accelerating the digitalization of our company; transforming and restructuring our retail offering; creating neighborhood health destination around a more modern pharmacy; and rolling out our Transformational Cost Management Program. 
We are making strong progress against these transformation priorities across multiple fronts. However, we now need to respond appropriately to the tougher environment that we find ourselves in. We will build off our existing transformation priorities and we will reinforce and accelerate our action. We are acting quickly to address select areas of operational weakness with a number of senior appointments, choosing new talent with new ideas and new approaches to drive more rapid change in a number of areas of our business. 
We are also strengthening and refocusing our operational management to ensure increased focus on driving operational excellence. In recent months, we have brought in a new Chief Digital Officer, a new Global Chief Marketing Officer, a new Global Chief Supply Chain Officer. We have restructured entirely the organization of our brands business. And since the quarter end, we have brought in a new Global Controller and Chief Accounting Officer. We have reviewed our priorities and business initiatives underway and have reworked our management plans in light of the more adverse environment.
First and foremost, we are acknowledging the short-term headwinds that we are facing and the limited time we have available to compensate for the impacts in the remainder of the year. As a result, we are reducing our guidance for fiscal 2019. James will talk to you about that in a moment. We believe the actions that we are taking will result in improved performance in 2020. Looking beyond that, we are convinced that our business model can deliver sustainable adjusted earnings per share growth of mid- to high single digits. 
I will now ask James to take you through the results and our updated guidance for the year. James?"

On a constant currency basis, adjusted earnings per share declined 4.3% in the quarter, bringing our first half EPS growth to 3.6%. The results were much weaker than we had expected due to 3 key factors. A",1027,"Thank you, Stefano, and good morning, everyone. On a constant currency basis, adjusted earnings per share declined 4.3% in the quarter, bringing our first half EPS growth to 3.6%. The results were much weaker than we had expected due to 3 key factors. 
As with our competitors, we are seeing continued reimbursement pressure. And the opportunities to mitigate have reduced due to lower levels of generic deflation and lower brand inflation. The second key factor is volume. Our same-store growth in the U.S. is trending below plan in both pharmacy and front of store. And lastly, consumer conditions in the U.K. remain challenging. 
We are also lapping a particularly strong second quarter last year, when constant currency adjusted EPS increased 25.7%. We are clearly not pleased with this quarter's performance, and we are taking immediate actions to improve operational performance and to reinforce and accelerate our existing transformation plans.
Let's now look in more detail at the numbers. In the second quarter, sales increased 4.6%, including a currency headwind of 2.1%. On a constant currency basis, sales were up 6.7%, reflecting the acquisition of the Rite Aid stores. Organic sales growth was 2.5%. Adjusted operating income declined 10.4% or 9.3% on a constant currency basis. The decline was mainly due to a weak quarter in Retail Pharmacy USA, which declined 11.9% year-on-year due to lower pharmacy margins and a decline in front-end comparable sales. 
Adjusted diluted earnings per share declined 5.4% to $1.64, a decrease of 4.3% on a constant currency basis. This includes a 4.5 percentage point contribution from our share repurchase program. 
GAAP operating income declined 23% in the quarter, including restructuring charges of $150 million as we ramp up the Transformational Cost Management Program and the prior year adjustment of $113 million relating to AmerisourceBergen tax law changes. GAAP EPS declined 8.3% to $1.24 per share.
Before I move on to our divisional performance, let me briefly cover first our financial highlights. Sales increased 7.2%, including a currency headwind of 1.8%. On a constant currency basis, sales were up 9%, reflecting the acquisition of the Rite Aid stores. Organic sales growth was 3.3%. 
Adjusted operating income declined 7.5% or 6.6% on a constant currency basis, reflecting the negative impact of reimbursement pressure on U.S. pharmacy gross margins, comp sales declines in U.S. retail, and weak market conditions in the U.K. Adjusted EPS increased 3.6% on a constant currency basis. GAAP earnings per share were up 12% as the absence of prior year items related to U.S. tax law changes and impairment were partly offset by $179 million of pretax restructuring costs related to the Transformational Cost Management Program.
Now let's look at the performance of our divisions, starting with Retail Pharmacy USA. Sales advanced 7.3% in the quarter, reflecting the acquired Rite Aid stores and organic sales growth of 1.6%. Adjusted gross profit declined 3.5% in the quarter, reflecting declines in both pharmacy and retail. Gross margin declined 260 basis points, mostly due to pharmacy. 
Adjusted SG&A spend declined 0.6% versus prior year. And excluding Rite Aid, adjusted SG&A spend was 6.8% lower than the prior period. Continued cost-saving initiatives and the impact of a lower bonus accrual more than offset inflation and store labor investments. Adjusted SG&A was 17.7% of sales, an improvement of 140 basis points compared to the year-ago quarter.
Adjusted operating income declined 11.9% in the quarter. Continued SG&A savings, procurement savings and pharmacy volume growth were not sufficient to offset the unusually high year-on-year impact from reimbursement and underperformance in the front of store. This result included store and labor investments of $40 million in the quarter, equivalent to approximately 240 basis points of adjusted operating income.
Now let's look in more detail at pharmacy. Total pharmacy sales increased 9.8%, reflecting the acquisition of the Rite Aid stores and organic growth of 4%. Second quarter market share was 22.3%, up approximately 90 basis points compared to last year, reflecting the acquired Rite Aid stores. Comp pharmacy sales increased 1.9% and our central specialty business grew 28.7% year-on-year. The number of retail prescriptions filled on a 30-day adjusted basis, including immunizations, increased 6.4%. Comp prescriptions grew 1.8%, slightly behind the first quarter growth of 2%. Pharmacy gross profit declined versus prior year as volume growth was more than offset by lower gross margin. 
The pharmacy market is very challenging right now, and we are seeing similar trends to our competitors. Reimbursement pressure has continued and opportunities for mitigation are lower than we expected. The combination of this reimbursement pressure, lower levels of generic deflation and lower brand inflation resulted in pharmacy margins that were worse than planned and 280 basis points below the same period last year. Also included here is a 110 basis point impact due to the faster growth of the lower-margin specialty business. And as we looked at the quarter, the year-on-year reimbursement impact was exceptionally high. And we estimate an adverse timing impact of approximately 60 basis points.
Turning next to our retail business. Retail sales increased 1.3%, reflecting the sales contribution from the acquired Rite Aid stores. Comp retail sales declined 3.8% as we faced some headwinds during the quarter. We are lapping an exceptionally strong prior year cough, cold, flu season and this accounted for 150 basis points of the year-on-year sales decline. Secondly, we continued to deemphasize tobacco with an impact of around 125 basis points. And finally, we had a weak quarter in seasonal and gifting with a 70 basis points impact. And here, we clearly need to improve our range and execution.
Retail gross profit declined in the quarter with retail gross margin 90 basis points lower than prior year, predominantly due to short-term changes in promotional activity. But let me remind you that excluding Rite Aid, our retail gross margin has improved by approximately 290 basis points since 2015. That being said, while we are pleased with our long-term margin performance, we are clearly not satisfied with our recent front-of-store sales performance.
Now let me pass it to Alex, who will update you on our transformation priorities and explain the actions we are taking to address our current business challenges."

While external factors, including reimbursement pressure and a weaker cough, cold and flu season, impacted us in the quarter, we clearly need to improve our execution and speed of delivery. We have not moved quickly enough to address the changes in the market and as a result did not deliver the growth required to help mitigate the continued reimbursement pressure. 
With that context, let me share some of the actions we are focused on. Our overall transformation priorities are unchanged, but we're seeking to reinforce and accelerate our actions. As Stefano mentioned, we are accelerating the digitalization of our company; transforming and restructuring our retail offering; creating neighborhood health destinations based around a more modern pharmacy; and rolling out our Transformational Cost Management Program. 
On cost management, we are continuing to make major strides and see more opportunities, which James will cover in more detail later. Overall, we recognize the importance of accelerating the transformation of our business more significantly to the customer. So let's look for a moment at some of the specific actions we are taking.
Firstly, it's crystal clear that it all works only if we have the right talent, capabilities and operational focus. To that end, we have recently executed a comprehensive reorganization of my senior leadership team. We have announced a new leadership structure, which clearly delineates between development and delivery. This is allowing my senior executives to focus on driving operational excellence and delivering results in their specific area. 
We have also made changes to how we manage our strategic partnerships, increasing the focus on accountability for developing our health care and retail services, ensuring financial discipline, pace, accountability and maximization of new profit streams. As Stefano mentioned, we have brought in a number of new senior executives to Walgreens Boots Alliance with specific skills and expertise. And they will work closely with my team to drive performance improvements.
We are on track on digitalization. The Microsoft teams are onboarded. They are physically present in our offices and we have moved quickly to consolidate our internal digital teams to create a single team under an experienced Chief Digital Officer. 
We have put in place new action plans for both pharmacy and retail. In pharmacy, we have created a dedicated, accountable team to drive volume through our partnerships with payers in the marketplace. This will allow the rest of the team to focus on operational effectiveness in our core pharmacy business, delivering our vision of a modern pharmacy, driving efficiency and maximizing opportunities through outcomes-based reimbursement. These new approaches will help us counteract reimbursement pressure. 
In retail, we recognized the need to concentrate our efforts where we know we can win. Right now, our execution is lagging where it needs to be. We will continue to accept revenue declines in low-margin categories, where we do not see a winning future path. We've invested some margin this quarter in categories we know drive footfall. And we're already starting to see the benefit of this investment in improved revenue and gross profit. 
We will concentrate our efforts, shifting resources, people and dollars to our flagship brands, including Walgreens health care brands and No7 and our priority categories. A great example is health and wellness. It's a significant cash stream with very attractive margins. We will step up the level of innovation and marketing support. 
We continue to be pleased with the progress we're making on our partnerships. In particular, we're working closely with the Kroger executive team to determine how best to unlock future growth and synergies. 
And the work we are doing on digitalization of our business will deliver an enhanced customer experience and the tools and analytics to drive customer loyalty. This builds on our existing highly successful customer-facing platforms, including our 5-star-rated 55 million downloaded app and our 85 million active Balance Rewards members. 
We previously highlighted the very high customer retention rates we have delivered on the Rite Aid store optimization. These very favorable retention rates, which allow us to focus volume locally on fewer stores without reducing our geographic coverage, delivered greatly improved returns and have led to a decision to boost our store optimization program from 600 stores to approximately 750 stores. 
Parallel to this, we're undertaking a comprehensive review of Walgreens store networks to address specific underperforming stores. And as you know, we are testing a small store format. And pending positive results, we anticipate building out this format over the coming years. More information will follow in the coming months.

While the quarter was helped by the positive impact of phasing in the U.K., the trend has improved versus the first quarter and the U.K. team are taking actions to further improve performance. U.K. comp pharmacy sales declined 1.5%, mainly due to lower hospital revenues and revenue per item. Boots UK comp retail sales declined 2.3%. The U.K. retail market remains challenging.

Firstly, we have taken decisive action to reduce our U.K. cost base. In February, we announced our intention to reduce our Nottingham head office personnel costs by around 20% to create a smaller and more agile support team. Our smart spending/smart organization is advancing well. And a store portfolio review is underway, focusing on low-performing stores and opportunities for consolidation. 
In addition, we are looking closely at our pharmacy business to further improve efficiency and effectiveness. We continue also to strengthen the Boots leadership team with the appointment of a new Chief Operating Officer. And as mentioned on last quarter's earnings call, we have multiple initiatives underway to improve our revenue performance. 
We are refitting 24 beauty halls across the U.K. between now and the end of May, introducing Boots beauty specialists with an in-depth knowledge spanning all categories and brands. And we're significantly expanding our beauty offering by introducing more than 20 new on-trend brands nationwide over the next 6 months. 
Finally, a brief update on our international investments in China. Since the quarter end, in collaboration with our partner, GuoDa, we opened our first pilot pharmacy in Shanghai, combining traditional Chinese medicine and skin care with well-known international brands.

The division delivered another solid quarter with sales up 9.1%, mainly due to growth in emerging markets but also aided by a customer contract change in the U.K., which contributed 2.1% of revenue growth. Adjusted operating income increased 3% with sales growth and an improvement in SG&A as a percentage of sales more than offsetting gross margin pressure. 
Turning next to cash flow. Operating cash flow was $1.2 billion in the first half. Free cash flow was $401 million. This was impacted by headwinds of $1 billion, including increased cash tax payments of $465 million, mainly as a result of U.S. tax reform; legal settlements of $276 million; and a once-off working capital benefit of $233 million in the prior year. 
Working capital days improved year-on-year. But the first half free cash flow reflects approximately $750 million of working capital increases, primarily due to higher sales and the timing of receipts. Cash capital investment was $793 million in the first half, $128 million higher than prior year due to the impact of Rite Aid store conversions. 
Turning now to our guidance for the year. In light of the first half performance and our expectations for a challenging second half, we are revising our full year guidance for fiscal year 2019. We now expect adjusted EPS to be roughly flat on a constant currency basis. However, given the normal level of volatility in a business of this size, realistically, you should expect a range of plus or minus 2%. 
The downward revision considers the following key changes. We anticipate gross margins to remain under pressure in the U.S. in the second half. Reimbursement pressure is unlikely to improve in the short term and it will take time for our complete mitigation plans to kick in. In terms of volume, our U.S. pharmacy and U.S. retail performance has been below plan in the first half of the year. And while we are taking decisive actions in the U.K., market conditions remain weak. And we have reflected this in our revised guidance. 
Given the revised full year EPS outlook, the estimated bonus payout for the year has been substantially reduced. And while our Transformational Cost Management Program is very much on track, the contribution to fiscal year '19 results was assumed when we provided guidance in December 2018. 
Finally, let me provide you with some supporting guidance assumptions. As you look forward for the second half, please remember that we have now lapped Rite Aid. And we will continue to see adverse reimbursement pressure impacting the revenue line. Currencies have an adverse EPS impact of approximately $0.04 versus prior year, unchanged versus our guidance at the beginning of the year. 
We now project a full year tax rate of 16% to 17%. The more favorable outlook reflects nonrecurring discrete benefits and changes in our geographical mix of earnings. And we project full year share repurchases of $3.8 billion compared to $3 billion guidance at the beginning of the year. This contributes 4.5% to EPS growth. 
Turning to our long-term business model. Firstly, we believe the business model is well positioned to deliver sustainable constant currency adjusted EPS growth well into the future. We have good line of sight for levers to counteract reimbursement pressure. Predictable volume growth and excellence in cost management will be key. And this requires us to execute strongly against our existing transformation priorities. 
Volume growth will be underpinned by delivering improved value for both payers and consumers. We absolutely must drive a renewed focus on operational excellence, whether it be adherence, patient satisfaction or a management of our offering in the front of store. And we will see the benefits of our digitalization program with more frequent enhancements to our customer offer over the course of the coming months and years. 
Finally, in the U.K., we expect our store and brand investments to begin to bear fruit as we exit 2019. Importantly, by 2022, we anticipate annual savings in excess of $1.5 billion from our Transformational Cost Management Program. And while a program of this magnitude is never easy, we do have good visibility on what needs to be done and strong commitment from the leadership team to get it done. 
Beyond 2022, we expect a rising contribution from partnerships. However, until then, our EPS growth model is not dependent on a material ramp-up of any of the existing partnerships. In fact, we are making significant investments in the short and medium term to drive long-term earnings upside. And long term, we do believe that health care and retail services will provide us with attractive returns and substantial new sources of income. 
Let me focus now on the Transformational Cost Management Program. Last quarter, we launched a program targeting annual savings in excess of $1 billion. We also told you that we needed to complete a 16-week assessment phase. We are now 3 months in. And while we are not fully complete, we do have a much deeper understanding of the areas of potential savings. 
Given what we have seen to date, we are increasing our annual cost-saving targets to at least $1.5 billion. Smart spending is progressing well. We have completed our benchmarking for select spend categories. For example, our benchmarks indicate that our consultant and supply costs are second quartile while our contractor, events, technology and travel spend are all above the median of the peer set. This shows the granularity we're operating at and the potential we see to reduce costs. 
Moving on to smart organization. As a reminder, in the first quarter, we announced and implemented reorganizations and store closure initiatives to rightsize operations in Chile and Mexico. And we launched an optimization initiative in our Pharmaceutical Wholesale division. We continued to move quickly and we took further decisive steps in the second quarter. 
As mentioned earlier, we announced a 20% reduction of the Boots UK central workforce. And the reduction should be largely complete by the end of the fiscal year. On the 21st of March, we announced a new field management structure in the U.S. The new organization combines the previously separate Walgreens and Rite Aid store management teams. And we expect the implementation to be completed by the beginning of June. 
The final bucket is digitalization. We just completed a detailed review of our global IT spend, and we are very encouraged by the findings. We see opportunity to reduce our annual IT cash spend by $500 million to $600 million, almost equally split between OpEx and CapEx. This represents a reduction of approximately 25% to 30% versus the baseline cost. So it is a significant opportunity. In the short term, we plan to selectively invest part of the savings to build out new customer digital propositions. However, we will expect each project to drive incremental value and benefits, thus creating a virtuous cycle. 
As we look forward to 2020 and beyond, we see improved operational EPS performance. Over the long term, we are comfortable that our growth model can deliver mid- to high single-digit adjusted EPS growth in constant currencies. One call-out on fiscal 2020, we do anticipate growth from operations. However, adjusted EPS in constant currency is expected to be broadly flat due to the reduction in bonus payments in 2019. 
As we built out our long-term business model, we made the following assumptions which you may find helpful. We assume share repurchases of $1.7 billion per year, contributing approximately 2.5% to EPS growth. However, this is partly offset by tax rate, which is expected to increase from 16% to 17% in 2019 to over 18% by 2022 and creating a headwind of 50 to 100 basis points, depending on the year. 
In summary, we have reworked our business plans to accelerate and boost our existing transformation priorities. And while there may be quarterly fluctuations along the way, these plans should allow us to return to long-term adjusted EPS growth. 
I will now hand you back to Stefano."

And I am equally disappointed that we had to reduce our full year guidance. However, we need to acknowledge the short-term headwinds we are facing. And while we are not the only company that has been impacted by the marked change in the environment, that's not an excuse. 
What is important now is that we respond quickly to ensure we return to growth as soon as possible. This quarter has focused the minds of the entire team on the need to allocate resources to where they will have the greatest impact, both today and in the future. Importantly, I am convinced that our existing strategic priorities are the right ones. And our multiyear transformation program will allow us to deliver sustainable, profitable growth. 
However, we have and will continue to reinforce and accelerate our actions to respond appropriately to the tougher environment we find ourselves in. Of course, in addition, from time to time, we have the opportunity for specific initiatives to rebase our cost, often prompted by new technologies, practices or structure. You have heard many examples from Alex and James. And we have significantly increased the goal for our Transformational Cost Management Program. 
We remain a global business, delivering billions of dollars in earnings and billions of dollars in cash flow and generating real value for our shareholders while being a huge force of good in the communities we serve and society as a whole. Day in and day out, we continue, directly or indirectly, to be a core and vital part of the lives of a significant percentage of the world's population through a presence and reach into the very heart of communities across the world. 
We are not complacent. We must continue to evolve and innovate to drive. And as a management team, we are more focused than ever on delivering operational and financial growth and value for our owners. I can assure you there is innovation throughout our business internally and outward-facing, within our own teams and in a wide range of partnerships. There are innovations in how we work, in our products and services, in how we interact with and serve our customers, both retail and commercial. 
So despite the disappointment of the quarter under review and the impact that it will have on the year as a whole, I remain confident that in future, we can return to reliable, mid- to high single-digit earnings per share growth from our businesses. And I remain committed to and confident of delivering real value for our customers, the communities we serve, my colleagues and most importantly, my fellow shareholders looking forward.

And secondly, to look at future profit streams in areas like health care services, the health care hub project and also the front end in terms of really finding new models to drive the front end of partnerships with Kroger, Birchbox and Sprint. These are really focus areas. In terms of protecting the customer, we continue to move our money and our focus from the old model to the new model. That's been the trend for the last 3, 4, 5 years. And that's what we continue to do. So along with the savings, there will be reinvestment into these new areas of growth. And then James will cover the reinvestment in a second just to finish off the question. So we are very, very focused on the customer.

So as you look forward, and we're quite clear on where we're targeting in excess of $1.5 billion of savings, bear in mind, you have inflation that offset some of that.

But the key one here is, are we investing for the future? And the way we've defined the program in general is we want to save to invest to grow. And the way we measure success in the program is we want to take the cost down and be the leanest operator in the industry. That's number one. But secondly is, as we exit and execute against the program, we want to see top line benefits coming from this. So there's one number I'm going to give you, and I think it will concentrate your attention on the -- both the achievability of the targets and our determination to drive a successful business longer term. We will invest approximately $1 billion over the next 3 years in a combination of operating expense and capital. Approximately 80% is operating expense. So think about it for a minute. In 1 year, we'll be putting in $300 million to boost the partnerships and to boost our capabilities on digitalization of the company. So we're not going to starve the business for the sake of hitting a cost goal. That's point number one. Point number two is more important is, each digital investment and each partnership has to stand on its own merits. We expect an attractive return and we expect long-term significant pools of income. And if you like, the plan is on one side, conservative because we've put in the money to drive the partnerships and digitalization and we haven't fully built in benefits of the partnerships flowing through. So if you like, the plan represents an option on the partnerships."

And we expect that to be not the normal going forward. And I think he also said that the SAP, for example, in specialty, which was 110 basis points of the reduction, clearly, that's anniversaried out as well. So there's timing and then there was the SAP and there's the underlying reimbursement pressure. So I think that the third number is the one that is the real underlying trend going forward. Again, there's always contracts that start and end on Jan 1, particularly Med D. And again, we didn't see really much difference to the trends we spoke about before on Med D. They are really as we saw before. Going to the second question on the safe harbor and the changes in the government, it's really early on. We truly believe in transparency and we really believe in reducing out-of-pocket costs for drugs for patients across the Medicare. We support that really from day 1. And therefore, we are working hard with other partners in the marketplace to understand how we can bring that forward with the government. And clearly, we don't know yet what that really means for any players in the marketplace. But we are working hard to innovate and to work with other partners. And we'll give you an update as soon as we understand better the rules as they emerge from the government."

And maybe, Ricky, if I could add a couple of -- just facts for that. So what Alex says is correct. If you like, if you're thinking about your modeling, Q3 had approximately 37% of the entire year's reimbursement impact -- Q2, sorry, have the entire 3",346,"Yes. And maybe, Ricky, if I could add a couple of -- just facts for that. So what Alex says is correct. If you like, if you're thinking about your modeling, Q3 had approximately 37% of the entire year's reimbursement impact -- Q2, sorry, have the entire 37% versus the 25% expected run rate. So it was exceptionally high. So I think as you look forward to the second half, the reimbursement pressure will subside because there's the skew to the first half. The impact of the SAP contract is material as well because year-to-date, it's around 140, 150 basis points. The specialty business will still grow very quickly. But the negative impact will tail off down to 30 basis points. So there will be quite a material change in the trajectory of the gross margin change year-on-year. And then secondly, as you look into next year, we believe we've planned our reimbursement levels roughly similar to what we've seen over the past couple of years. And I think individual quarters will always be extremely volatile and rocky. But over a longer term, while reimbursement is a bit over the trend rate this year, we have planned similar levels going forward. But as I said, we won't have this SAP contract next year. And one big thing that did hit us this year and is still hitting us, and it's one of the reasons for the guidance, is we do have a lower level of generic utilization than we projected at the start of the year. And that can have quite a material impact on both the revenue and on the cost line. So it does -- if your generic utilization goes down, it does negatively impact your profitability. That will be one potential tailwind that we will have, I would say, 6 months from now to 12 months from now. Because of contract changes in Med D, we would expect our generic utilization rates to increase, thus giving us some comfort on -- around the gross margin outlook. I hope that's given you enough perspective."

If we can react so quickly and now is because we were thinking of all the remedies and all the counteractions even before, we have not been probably quick enough in putting those counteractions in place.

And so could you maybe just explain the dynamic there that has the rates coming in so much worse than what you anticipated? And then I guess, the follow-up question to that would be, are we at a point with the PBMs where you need to take a tougher stance? I mean, obviously, there's precedent for playing a little harder when it comes to declining reimbursement rates and just not offering the Walgreens network in certain PBM offerings. Is that on the table? Is that kind of where the industry is at, given this persistent reimbursement rate pressure?"

And I think James covered them off in -- and they were as such. There was definitely -- generic deflation was reducing. That has an impact, and that happened through the quarter. Branded inflation was reducing, that happened during the quarter. And of course, the volume, to be honest with it as well, was less than we had expected. Particularly, we had a pretty big -- a very big flu and cough and cold season last year and it was early. And this year, it's been more normal and a little bit later. So these are all factors that hit us coming into that period. And I think also at the end of the year, we true-up with our PBM partners, the contracts for the year. And we don't really see the effect of that true-up really until middle of February. And that was another factor that happened as well. So it was a combination of headwinds that gave us this unusually high -- the highest quarter we've had, as James said, this fiscal year that created this reimbursement pressure. I think in terms of our attitude towards our partners in the supply chain, including the PBMs, we have a partnership approach. We are working with our partners to deliver better service, better products, including, for example, improving the ability for us to reduce costs elsewhere in the health care system. I'll give you one example of that. There's more money than ever before coming on the table for our service-based payments, particularly in the Medicare D area. And we again are working with partners towards the government to create a more common framework of KPIs that pharmacists could aim for in terms of getting repayments, for example, in Med D and DIRs. I mean it worked out very well, in my view, with Optum and UnitedHealth in a very successful Medicare Advantage book of business, where again we got more payments than ever for performance-based pharmacy. So I think there's a recognition by our partners that pharmacy is under pressure. I think there's a recognition by our partners who want better joined-up care within the health care system. And they're encouraging us through our learning incentives to invest more, as James has said, in these models. And that's what we intend to do."

There's no doubt that the economics of the specialty business is under pressure as the government is asking questions about how do we get these very important drugs to patients and consumers at lower costs. And we continue to work again with our partners, particularly Prime in this case and the Blues who own Prime, to really improve that model both for the owners of Prime and ourselves but also really important to more quickly provide a more local service for specialty. In particular, we're opening up more local community specialty pharmacies. We believe more and more that the mixed model of central fill and community pharmacy. based where the local specialty doctors, are is the right winning model than just a pure central fill model.

I mean I think the one that we should speak to the most this morning is definitely Microsoft and the digitalization of our company. That's a really a significant contract from our point of view but also from Microsoft's point of view. And it's also one that lasts over a number of years as we not just digitalize Walgreens, but we digitalize our partnership infrastructure both in the retail product side and also importantly create new opportunity of partnerships in health care. So that, by some way, is the most important piece of work we're doing. It's where we're investing the most of our money going forward to really create better tools for engagement for customers across both front end and pharmacy and better ways for our business partners to engage with our health care platform. We're also very pleased with our partnership with Verily. We're really working pretty hard to bring real innovation quickly to the marketplace. They've developed a number of market-ready tools, for example, on their Onduo diabetes platform, which we have already active in our own population or health care beneficiaries here in Walgreens in the U.S.A. And the adoption rate of that tool is very satisfactory so far. And we believe that's another example of bringing new tools to market very quickly with new partnerships. On the retail side, I think we mentioned in our prepared remarks that we're very pleased with the rapid progress from a customer point of view and engagement in the Kroger trials in Northern Kentucky and Cincinnati. We're really very pleased with that. And we expect to be able to move that test and trial further forward, going forward. And of course, that is more focused on creating 2 things. First of all, convenience in retail between a fantastic grocer and food brand in Kroger and obviously our pharmacy and health care and beauty brands here in Walgreens; and secondly, working to share data appropriately, so we can personalize the offer for many Americans who rely on these categories every single week and every single day. It's the most sticky categories because they're the ones that are most frequently used. Beyond that, Birchbox is in early stages but going well. And Sprint again we announced the expansion to 80 stores of Sprint. And last but not least, on the health care services side, LabCorp, where we continue to advance our LabCorp partnership with the ambition -- or the intention, should I say, to drive to 600 locations within the next 3.5 years."

And there's more people coming in to really drive the modernization of our platform and processes to become a new retail and health care company. That's a very important acceleration and investment.

And we've got, not surprises, but we have a couple of headwinds that we will face this year. So if you step back from this and look back over the last couple of years, this is a business that can deliver pretty comfortably somewhere in the region of $5 billion, $5.5 billion to $6 billion of cash flow, depending on the year. Now as you compare 1 year to another, you always have -- you're always lapping something of some sorts. This year, we have about $2.3 billion of headwinds. So I think as you think through a normal level of cash flow, which is somewhere north of $5 billion, we have to manage through cash taxes this year, which are $900 million higher than in the previous year. We're cycling through legal payouts of $300 million. And then we have large movements as a result of Rite Aid, almost $1 billion. So the cash flow this year will be well below the trend rate. But we have developed a 3-year plan and some support of our guidance. And we're quite comfortable on the long-term cash flow generating part of the company. And actually, quite -- I would even go so far as saying as, I think when you look at some of our payment terms with suppliers and some of the way we manage inventory, we probably have large doses of opportunity. And then the final comment on cash flow, as you look at this year, our cash capital expenditures are exceptionally high. They're about $300 million or $400 million higher than the run rate. And that's essentially the conversion of the Rite Aid stores. So it's quite a huge exercise because we took on 1,900 stores. As you saw from Alex, we are raising the store closures to 750. But that still leaves the conversion of 1,200 stores. And by the way, the Rite Aid acquisition has gone extremely well. The return on investment is exactly where we wanted it to be. We're getting there in a different way. And actually, we're very encouraged by the retention we're getting as we optimize the stores. So cash flow this year will be somewhat problematic. But we're quite confident on the future outlook."

So one, as we think about sort of in the rest of retail, a lot of the sort of fears that existed and what companies ultimately have done, and I'm thinking about Walmart and Home Depot and some of the more traditional guys, they've basically pursued: one, a sort of omnichannel approach, and I think you guys have talked a lot about technology and investment today; but two, there's just been, in general, a big downsizing of boxes in a lot of different areas and sort of a consolidation of the industry. That's the one thing that's sort of lacking here. Obviously, you guys are closing more stores than what we saw in the past. But how do you think about sort of the state of pharmacy and the competitive landscape because if we think about what's driving possibly some of the reimbursement pressure outside of lower brands, some of it is still the fact that we're over-boxed across the U.S. maybe by a substantial amount. And so how do you think about that in the context of kind of what you can control and what you can't control and how you expect some of the smaller peers, I guess, to sort of play out over the next couple of years?"

We're partnering with others to take care of other categories. And lastly but not least, we have 80 million, 85 million loyalty cardholders. And we believe that data analytics are really important to understand how you personalize the offer as a pharmacy-led and health and beauty specialists and how you work with others to create real personalization in marketing. So that's our strategy. We think our stores are our strength. We have to reorganize them and reshape them over the next 5 to 10 years. And we're on a journey to do that."

So let me cover first the back half and then I'll move on to the 3-year. As you look through the back half, we did say that the peak in the issue on gross margins in pharmacy is in Q2.

As you look through the back half, we did say that the peak in the issue on gross margins in pharmacy is in Q2. We do expect some continuation into Q3 and then an improvement in Q4. So as you plot out your quarters, I would assume a fairly even split in the EPS between the 2 quarters, maybe 49-51. So Q3 will be worse and Q4 will be improving. We actually -- we set ourselves a different goal when we pulled together, and it's not really guidance, it's a growth model. And we stepped back and we went through very, very detailed reviews with each of the business leaders. And here is the goal we set ourselves. We wanted to set a realistic goal, mid- to high single-digit. We spent a lot of time on the levers to offset reimbursement, particularly on the assumptions around generic deflation and the ability of our generic purchasing organization to deliver a significant offset. And we're comfortable that the generic team can offset approximately 50% to 60% of the reimbursement impact. Then we went through each single volume assumption, particularly pharmacy but also in the retail business. And I really don't want it to be lost on the audience, the changes we're making in retail. And one is this business went from a loss-making business 3 years ago to quite a profitable retail business now. So we are -- from a starting point, it's a position of strength but with a weak top line delivery. And the big change will be we will distort and refocus our resources on health and wellness and beauty. And that's where we can win and we know we can win. And they're very attractive businesses. And then we will build partnerships with companies like Kroger to address the other parts of retail. And we're very convinced that we have line of sight to improving top line. The second part is we said can we -- let's put in what we can control. And you can control your cost journey. And we've built in $1.5 billion. We've put a strong governance around it. And we'll be resolute in delivering. And I emphasize, at least $1.5 billion of cost reduction. So that has a high degree of probability. And then the final thing, which we said at the beginning, was it's not -- you can't cut yourself the glory. So we've built in the investments required to drive the top line. So we have the right investments, $300 million a year which -- it adds up to $1 billion of investments behind partnerships and digital. So we're investing to make sure especially that the U.S. business has the ammunition required to create that omnichannel experience in both pharmacy and in retail so that we do get the volume delivery that creates the virtuous cycle. And that's the reason why we are actually quite confident that the growth model for the 3 years is founded in a lot of fact. And actually, it's quite a detailed plan we've developed internally. And the question we got earlier, does it translate to cash? And the answer is, yes. We see a line of sight in consistently delivering that $5 billion-type range that we've done in the past. We see no reason why the business can't do something similar into the future. And I said what Stefano said at the past, we're very disappointed with the quarter and the requirement to take down guidance. And that's made us resolute that we've put in place very tangible plans to make sure we don't have to do that again. And that's the commitment from the management team."

We found ourselves facing a combination of increased reimbursement pressure in the quarter, lower generic deflation, lower brand inflation and lower-than-anticipated benefits from our work to refresh and renew our retail offering, primarily in the U.S. Of course, the pharmacy trends are not only impacting our business, they are impacting the overall market and will likely continue to do so over the coming months. 
Let me be clear, however. I am convinced that our existing strategic priorities are the right ones and will help us to deliver sustainable growth into the future. Let me remind you of our 4 priorities: accelerating the digitalization of our company; transforming and restructuring our retail offering; creating neighborhood health destination around a more modern pharmacy; and rolling out our Transformational Cost Management Program. 
We are making strong progress against these transformation priorities across multiple fronts. However, we now need to respond appropriately to the tougher environment that we find ourselves in. We will build off our existing transformation priorities and we will reinforce and accelerate our action. We are acting quickly to address select areas of operational weakness with a number of senior appointments, choosing new talent with new ideas and new approaches to drive more rapid change in a number of areas of our business. 
We are also strengthening and refocusing our operational management to ensure increased focus on driving operational excellence. In recent months, we have brought in a new Chief Digital Officer, a new Global Chief Marketing Officer, a new Global Chief Supply Chain Officer. We have restructured entirely the organization of our brands business. And since the quarter end, we have brought in a new Global Controller and Chief Accounting Officer. We have reviewed our priorities and business initiatives underway and have reworked our management plans in light of the more adverse environment.
First and foremost, we are acknowledging the short-term headwinds that we are facing and the limited time we have available to compensate for the impacts in the remainder of the year. As a result, we are reducing our guidance for fiscal 2019. James will talk to you about that in a moment. We believe the actions that we are taking will result in improved performance in 2020. Looking beyond that, we are convinced that our business model can deliver sustainable adjusted earnings per share growth of mid- to high single digits. 
I will now ask James to take you through the results and our updated guidance for the year. James?"

On a constant currency basis, adjusted earnings per share declined 4.3% in the quarter, bringing our first half EPS growth to 3.6%. The results were much weaker than we had expected due to 3 key factors. 
As with our competitors, we are seeing continued reimbursement pressure. And the opportunities to mitigate have reduced due to lower levels of generic deflation and lower brand inflation. The second key factor is volume. Our same-store growth in the U.S. is trending below plan in both pharmacy and front of store. And lastly, consumer conditions in the U.K. remain challenging. 
We are also lapping a particularly strong second quarter last year, when constant currency adjusted EPS increased 25.7%. We are clearly not pleased with this quarter's performance, and we are taking immediate actions to improve operational performance and to reinforce and accelerate our existing transformation plans.
Let's now look in more detail at the numbers. In the second quarter, sales increased 4.6%, including a currency headwind of 2.1%. On a constant currency basis, sales were up 6.7%, reflecting the acquisition of the Rite Aid stores. Organic sales growth was 2.5%. Adjusted operating income declined 10.4% or 9.3% on a constant currency basis. The decline was mainly due to a weak quarter in Retail Pharmacy USA, which declined 11.9% year-on-year due to lower pharmacy margins and a decline in front-end comparable sales. 
Adjusted diluted earnings per share declined 5.4% to $1.64, a decrease of 4.3% on a constant currency basis. This includes a 4.5 percentage point contribution from our share repurchase program. 
GAAP operating income declined 23% in the quarter, including restructuring charges of $150 million as we ramp up the Transformational Cost Management Program and the prior year adjustment of $113 million relating to AmerisourceBergen tax law changes. GAAP EPS declined 8.3% to $1.24 per share.
Before I move on to our divisional performance, let me briefly cover first our financial highlights. Sales increased 7.2%, including a currency headwind of 1.8%. On a constant currency basis, sales were up 9%, reflecting the acquisition of the Rite Aid stores. Organic sales growth was 3.3%. 
Adjusted operating income declined 7.5% or 6.6% on a constant currency basis, reflecting the negative impact of reimbursement pressure on U.S. pharmacy gross margins, comp sales declines in U.S. retail, and weak market conditions in the U.K. Adjusted EPS increased 3.6% on a constant currency basis. GAAP earnings per share were up 12% as the absence of prior year items related to U.S. tax law changes and impairment were partly offset by $179 million of pretax restructuring costs related to the Transformational Cost Management Program.
Now let's look at the performance of our divisions, starting with Retail Pharmacy USA. Sales advanced 7.3% in the quarter, reflecting the acquired Rite Aid stores and organic sales growth of 1.6%. Adjusted gross profit declined 3.5% in the quarter, reflecting declines in both pharmacy and retail. Gross margin declined 260 basis points, mostly due to pharmacy. 
Adjusted SG&A spend declined 0.6% versus prior year. And excluding Rite Aid, adjusted SG&A spend was 6.8% lower than the prior period. Continued cost-saving initiatives and the impact of a lower bonus accrual more than offset inflation and store labor investments. Adjusted SG&A was 17.7% of sales, an improvement of 140 basis points compared to the year-ago quarter.
Adjusted operating income declined 11.9% in the quarter. Continued SG&A savings, procurement savings and pharmacy volume growth were not sufficient to offset the unusually high year-on-year impact from reimbursement and underperformance in the front of store. This result included store and labor investments of $40 million in the quarter, equivalent to approximately 240 basis points of adjusted operating income.
Now let's look in more detail at pharmacy. Total pharmacy sales increased 9.8%, reflecting the acquisition of the Rite Aid stores and organic growth of 4%. Second quarter market share was 22.3%, up approximately 90 basis points compared to last year, reflecting the acquired Rite Aid stores. Comp pharmacy sales increased 1.9% and our central specialty business grew 28.7% year-on-year. The number of retail prescriptions filled on a 30-day adjusted basis, including immunizations, increased 6.4%. Comp prescriptions grew 1.8%, slightly behind the first quarter growth of 2%. Pharmacy gross profit declined versus prior year as volume growth was more than offset by lower gross margin. 
The pharmacy market is very challenging right now, and we are seeing similar trends to our competitors. Reimbursement pressure has continued and opportunities for mitigation are lower than we expected. The combination of this reimbursement pressure, lower levels of generic deflation and lower brand inflation resulted in pharmacy margins that were worse than planned and 280 basis points below the same period last year. Also included here is a 110 basis point impact due to the faster growth of the lower-margin specialty business. And as we looked at the quarter, the year-on-year reimbursement impact was exceptionally high. And we estimate an adverse timing impact of approximately 60 basis points.
Turning next to our retail business. Retail sales increased 1.3%, reflecting the sales contribution from the acquired Rite Aid stores. Comp retail sales declined 3.8% as we faced some headwinds during the quarter. We are lapping an exceptionally strong prior year cough, cold, flu season and this accounted for 150 basis points of the year-on-year sales decline. Secondly, we continued to deemphasize tobacco with an impact of around 125 basis points. And finally, we had a weak quarter in seasonal and gifting with a 70 basis points impact. And here, we clearly need to improve our range and execution.
Retail gross profit declined in the quarter with retail gross margin 90 basis points lower than prior year, predominantly due to short-term changes in promotional activity. But let me remind you that excluding Rite Aid, our retail gross margin has improved by approximately 290 basis points since 2015. That being said, while we are pleased with our long-term margin performance, we are clearly not satisfied with our recent front-of-store sales performance.
Now let me pass it to Alex, who will update you on our transformation priorities and explain the actions we are taking to address our current business challenges."

While external factors, including reimbursement pressure and a weaker cough, cold and flu season, impacted us in the quarter, we clearly need to improve our execution and speed of delivery. We have not moved quickly enough to address the changes in the market and as a result did not deliver the growth required to help mitigate the continued reimbursement pressure. 
With that context, let me share some of the actions we are focused on. Our overall transformation priorities are unchanged, but we're seeking to reinforce and accelerate our actions. As Stefano mentioned, we are accelerating the digitalization of our company; transforming and restructuring our retail offering; creating neighborhood health destinations based around a more modern pharmacy; and rolling out our Transformational Cost Management Program. 
On cost management, we are continuing to make major strides and see more opportunities, which James will cover in more detail later. Overall, we recognize the importance of accelerating the transformation of our business more significantly to the customer. So let's look for a moment at some of the specific actions we are taking.
Firstly, it's crystal clear that it all works only if we have the right talent, capabilities and operational focus. To that end, we have recently executed a comprehensive reorganization of my senior leadership team. We have announced a new leadership structure, which clearly delineates between development and delivery. This is allowing my senior executives to focus on driving operational excellence and delivering results in their specific area. 
We have also made changes to how we manage our strategic partnerships, increasing the focus on accountability for developing our health care and retail services, ensuring financial discipline, pace, accountability and maximization of new profit streams. As Stefano mentioned, we have brought in a number of new senior executives to Walgreens Boots Alliance with specific skills and expertise. And they will work closely with my team to drive performance improvements.
We are on track on digitalization. The Microsoft teams are onboarded. They are physically present in our offices and we have moved quickly to consolidate our internal digital teams to create a single team under an experienced Chief Digital Officer. 
We have put in place new action plans for both pharmacy and retail. In pharmacy, we have created a dedicated, accountable team to drive volume through our partnerships with payers in the marketplace. This will allow the rest of the team to focus on operational effectiveness in our core pharmacy business, delivering our vision of a modern pharmacy, driving efficiency and maximizing opportunities through outcomes-based reimbursement. These new approaches will help us counteract reimbursement pressure. 
In retail, we recognized the need to concentrate our efforts where we know we can win. Right now, our execution is lagging where it needs to be. We will continue to accept revenue declines in low-margin categories, where we do not see a winning future path. We've invested some margin this quarter in categories we know drive footfall. And we're already starting to see the benefit of this investment in improved revenue and gross profit. 
We will concentrate our efforts, shifting resources, people and dollars to our flagship brands, including Walgreens health care brands and No7 and our priority categories. A great example is health and wellness. It's a significant cash stream with very attractive margins. We will step up the level of innovation and marketing support. 
We continue to be pleased with the progress we're making on our partnerships. In particular, we're working closely with the Kroger executive team to determine how best to unlock future growth and synergies. 
And the work we are doing on digitalization of our business will deliver an enhanced customer experience and the tools and analytics to drive customer loyalty. This builds on our existing highly successful customer-facing platforms, including our 5-star-rated 55 million downloaded app and our 85 million active Balance Rewards members. 
We previously highlighted the very high customer retention rates we have delivered on the Rite Aid store optimization. These very favorable retention rates, which allow us to focus volume locally on fewer stores without reducing our geographic coverage, delivered greatly improved returns and have led to a decision to boost our store optimization program from 600 stores to approximately 750 stores. 
Parallel to this, we're undertaking a comprehensive review of Walgreens store networks to address specific underperforming stores. And as you know, we are testing a small store format. And pending positive results, we anticipate building out this format over the coming years. More information will follow in the coming months. 
I'll hand you back to James now to update you on Retail Pharmacy International."

While the quarter was helped by the positive impact of phasing in the U.K., the trend has improved versus the first quarter and the U.K. team are taking actions to further improve performance. U.K. comp pharmacy sales declined 1.5%, mainly due to lower hospital revenues and revenue per item. Boots UK comp retail sales declined 2.3%. The U.K. retail market remains challenging.

Firstly, we have taken decisive action to reduce our U.K. cost base. In February, we announced our intention to reduce our Nottingham head office personnel costs by around 20% to create a smaller and more agile support team. Our smart spending/smart organization is advancing well. And a store portfolio review is underway, focusing on low-performing stores and opportunities for consolidation. 
In addition, we are looking closely at our pharmacy business to further improve efficiency and effectiveness. We continue also to strengthen the Boots leadership team with the appointment of a new Chief Operating Officer. And as mentioned on last quarter's earnings call, we have multiple initiatives underway to improve our revenue performance. 
We are refitting 24 beauty halls across the U.K. between now and the end of May, introducing Boots beauty specialists with an in-depth knowledge spanning all categories and brands. And we're significantly expanding our beauty offering by introducing more than 20 new on-trend brands nationwide over the next 6 months. 
Finally, a brief update on our international investments in China. Since the quarter end, in collaboration with our partner, GuoDa, we opened our first pilot pharmacy in Shanghai, combining traditional Chinese medicine and skin care with well-known international brands.

The division delivered another solid quarter with sales up 9.1%, mainly due to growth in emerging markets but also aided by a customer contract change in the U.K., which contributed 2.1% of revenue growth. Adjusted operating income increased 3% with sales growth and an improvement in SG&A as a percentage of sales more than offsetting gross margin pressure. 
Turning next to cash flow. Operating cash flow was $1.2 billion in the first half. Free cash flow was $401 million. This was impacted by headwinds of $1 billion, including increased cash tax payments of $465 million, mainly as a result of U.S. tax reform; legal settlements of $276 million; and a once-off working capital benefit of $233 million in the prior year. 
Working capital days improved year-on-year. But the first half free cash flow reflects approximately $750 million of working capital increases, primarily due to higher sales and the timing of receipts. Cash capital investment was $793 million in the first half, $128 million higher than prior year due to the impact of Rite Aid store conversions. 
Turning now to our guidance for the year. In light of the first half performance and our expectations for a challenging second half, we are revising our full year guidance for fiscal year 2019. We now expect adjusted EPS to be roughly flat on a constant currency basis. However, given the normal level of volatility in a business of this size, realistically, you should expect a range of plus or minus 2%. 
The downward revision considers the following key changes. We anticipate gross margins to remain under pressure in the U.S. in the second half. Reimbursement pressure is unlikely to improve in the short term and it will take time for our complete mitigation plans to kick in. In terms of volume, our U.S. pharmacy and U.S. retail performance has been below plan in the first half of the year. And while we are taking decisive actions in the U.K., market conditions remain weak. And we have reflected this in our revised guidance. 
Given the revised full year EPS outlook, the estimated bonus payout for the year has been substantially reduced. And while our Transformational Cost Management Program is very much on track, the contribution to fiscal year '19 results was assumed when we provided guidance in December 2018. 
Finally, let me provide you with some supporting guidance assumptions. As you look forward for the second half, please remember that we have now lapped Rite Aid. And we will continue to see adverse reimbursement pressure impacting the revenue line. Currencies have an adverse EPS impact of approximately $0.04 versus prior year, unchanged versus our guidance at the beginning of the year. 
We now project a full year tax rate of 16% to 17%. The more favorable outlook reflects nonrecurring discrete benefits and changes in our geographical mix of earnings. And we project full year share repurchases of $3.8 billion compared to $3 billion guidance at the beginning of the year. This contributes 4.5% to EPS growth. 
Turning to our long-term business model. Firstly, we believe the business model is well positioned to deliver sustainable constant currency adjusted EPS growth well into the future. We have good line of sight for levers to counteract reimbursement pressure. Predictable volume growth and excellence in cost management will be key. And this requires us to execute strongly against our existing transformation priorities. 
Volume growth will be underpinned by delivering improved value for both payers and consumers. We absolutely must drive a renewed focus on operational excellence, whether it be adherence, patient satisfaction or a management of our offering in the front of store. And we will see the benefits of our digitalization program with more frequent enhancements to our customer offer over the course of the coming months and years. 
Finally, in the U.K., we expect our store and brand investments to begin to bear fruit as we exit 2019. Importantly, by 2022, we anticipate annual savings in excess of $1.5 billion from our Transformational Cost Management Program. And while a program of this magnitude is never easy, we do have good visibility on what needs to be done and strong commitment from the leadership team to get it done. 
Beyond 2022, we expect a rising contribution from partnerships. However, until then, our EPS growth model is not dependent on a material ramp-up of any of the existing partnerships. In fact, we are making significant investments in the short and medium term to drive long-term earnings upside. And long term, we do believe that health care and retail services will provide us with attractive returns and substantial new sources of income. 
Let me focus now on the Transformational Cost Management Program. Last quarter, we launched a program targeting annual savings in excess of $1 billion. We also told you that we needed to complete a 16-week assessment phase. We are now 3 months in. And while we are not fully complete, we do have a much deeper understanding of the areas of potential savings. 
Given what we have seen to date, we are increasing our annual cost-saving targets to at least $1.5 billion. Smart spending is progressing well. We have completed our benchmarking for select spend categories. For example, our benchmarks indicate that our consultant and supply costs are second quartile while our contractor, events, technology and travel spend are all above the median of the peer set. This shows the granularity we're operating at and the potential we see to reduce costs. 
Moving on to smart organization. As a reminder, in the first quarter, we announced and implemented reorganizations and store closure initiatives to rightsize operations in Chile and Mexico. And we launched an optimization initiative in our Pharmaceutical Wholesale division. We continued to move quickly and we took further decisive steps in the second quarter. 
As mentioned earlier, we announced a 20% reduction of the Boots UK central workforce. And the reduction should be largely complete by the end of the fiscal year. On the 21st of March, we announced a new field management structure in the U.S. The new organization combines the previously separate Walgreens and Rite Aid store management teams. And we expect the implementation to be completed by the beginning of June. 
The final bucket is digitalization. We just completed a detailed review of our global IT spend, and we are very encouraged by the findings. We see opportunity to reduce our annual IT cash spend by $500 million to $600 million, almost equally split between OpEx and CapEx. This represents a reduction of approximately 25% to 30% versus the baseline cost. So it is a significant opportunity. In the short term, we plan to selectively invest part of the savings to build out new customer digital propositions. However, we will expect each project to drive incremental value and benefits, thus creating a virtuous cycle. 
As we look forward to 2020 and beyond, we see improved operational EPS performance. Over the long term, we are comfortable that our growth model can deliver mid- to high single-digit adjusted EPS growth in constant currencies. One call-out on fiscal 2020, we do anticipate growth from operations. However, adjusted EPS in constant currency is expected to be broadly flat due to the reduction in bonus payments in 2019. 
As we built out our long-term business model, we made the following assumptions which you may find helpful. We assume share repurchases of $1.7 billion per year, contributing approximately 2.5% to EPS growth. However, this is partly offset by tax rate, which is expected to increase from 16% to 17% in 2019 to over 18% by 2022 and creating a headwind of 50 to 100 basis points, depending on the year. 
In summary, we have reworked our business plans to accelerate and boost our existing transformation priorities. And while there may be quarterly fluctuations along the way, these plans should allow us to return to long-term adjusted EPS growth. 
I will now hand you back to Stefano."

And I am equally disappointed that we had to reduce our full year guidance. However, we need to acknowledge the short-term headwinds we are facing. And while we are not the only company that has been impacted by the marked change in the environment, that's not an excuse. 
What is important now is that we respond quickly to ensure we return to growth as soon as possible. This quarter has focused the minds of the entire team on the need to allocate resources to where they will have the greatest impact, both today and in the future. Importantly, I am convinced that our existing strategic priorities are the right ones. And our multiyear transformation program will allow us to deliver sustainable, profitable growth. 
However, we have and will continue to reinforce and accelerate our actions to respond appropriately to the tougher environment we find ourselves in. Of course, in addition, from time to time, we have the opportunity for specific initiatives to rebase our cost, often prompted by new technologies, practices or structure. You have heard many examples from Alex and James. And we have significantly increased the goal for our Transformational Cost Management Program. 
We remain a global business, delivering billions of dollars in earnings and billions of dollars in cash flow and generating real value for our shareholders while being a huge force of good in the communities we serve and society as a whole. Day in and day out, we continue, directly or indirectly, to be a core and vital part of the lives of a significant percentage of the world's population through a presence and reach into the very heart of communities across the world. 
We are not complacent. We must continue to evolve and innovate to drive. And as a management team, we are more focused than ever on delivering operational and financial growth and value for our owners. I can assure you there is innovation throughout our business internally and outward-facing, within our own teams and in a wide range of partnerships. There are innovations in how we work, in our products and services, in how we interact with and serve our customers, both retail and commercial. 
So despite the disappointment of the quarter under review and the impact that it will have on the year as a whole, I remain confident that in future, we can return to reliable, mid- to high single-digit earnings per share growth from our businesses. And I remain committed to and confident of delivering real value for our customers, the communities we serve, my colleagues and most importantly, my fellow shareholders looking forward.

And the way we measure success in the program is we want to take the cost down and be the leanest operator in the industry. That's number one. But secondly is, as we exit and execute against the program, we want to see top line benefits coming from this. So there's one number I'm going to give you, and I think it will concentrate your attention on the -- both the achievability of the targets and our determination to drive a successful business longer term. We will invest approximately $1 billion over the next 3 years in a combination of operating expense and capital. Approximately 80% is operating expense. So think about it for a minute. In 1 year, we'll be putting in $300 million to boost the partnerships and to boost our capabilities on digitalization of the company. So we're not going to starve the business for the sake of hitting a cost goal. That's point number one. Point number two is more important is, each digital investment and each partnership has to stand on its own merits. We expect an attractive return and we expect long-term significant pools of income.

And this is possible because we have saved but also invested in the past. And the reason why you don't see really the contribution of all the joint ventures that we have done is that -- is because from one side, we have some benefits; on the other side, we continue to invest in these joint ventures and so you don't see the benefit for the time being. But these investments will mature. And we will have, at a certain time, a substantial contribution from these partnerships.

Can you give us some sense of whether the rate cuts are coming from specific payers or PBMs? Or are you seeing them across the board? And really kind of like the questioning aims at should we expect an acceleration in pressure for the remaining of fiscal year '19? Or is the run rate that we're seeing for the quarter what we should model for the rest of the year? And then the follow-up question to that is, when we think about all the changes that are coming up in U.S. health care, the proposed rebate rule on Part D is a pretty significant one. So how did you factor that one in when you think about 2020 and your comments around operating income growth in 2020?"

So I'll give you where we're as we look forward with reimbursement pressure. I think as James said in his prepared remarks, this is a very heavy quarter for reimbursement pressure. And we expect that to be not the normal going forward. And I think he also said that the SAP, for example, in specialty, which was 110 basis points of the reduction, clearly, that's anniversaried out as well. So there's timing and then there was the SAP and there's the underlying reimbursement pressure. So I think that the third number is the one that is the real underlying trend going forward. Again, there's always contracts that start and end on Jan 1, particularly Med D. And again, we didn't see really much difference to the trends we spoke about before on Med D. They are really as we saw before. Going to the second question on the safe harbor and the changes in the government, it's really early on. We truly believe in transparency and we really believe in reducing out-of-pocket costs for drugs for patients across the Medicare. We support that really from day 1. And therefore, we are working hard with other partners in the marketplace to understand how we can bring that forward with the government. And clearly, we don't know yet what that really means for any players in the marketplace. But we are working hard to innovate and to work with other partners. And we'll give you an update as soon as we understand better the rules as they emerge from the government."

And maybe, Ricky, if I could add a couple of -- just facts for that. So what Alex says is correct.

And maybe, Ricky, if I could add a couple of -- just facts for that. So what Alex says is correct. If you like, if you're thinking about your modeling, Q3 had approximately 37% of the entire year's reimbursement impact -- Q2, sorry, have the entire 37% versus the 25% expected run rate. So it was exceptionally high. So I think as you look forward to the second half, the reimbursement pressure will subside because there's the skew to the first half. The impact of the SAP contract is material as well because year-to-date, it's around 140, 150 basis points. The specialty business will still grow very quickly. But the negative impact will tail off down to 30 basis points. So there will be quite a material change in the trajectory of the gross margin change year-on-year. And then secondly, as you look into next year, we believe we've planned our reimbursement levels roughly similar to what we've seen over the past couple of years. And I think individual quarters will always be extremely volatile and rocky. But over a longer term, while reimbursement is a bit over the trend rate this year, we have planned similar levels going forward. But as I said, we won't have this SAP contract next year. And one big thing that did hit us this year and is still hitting us, and it's one of the reasons for the guidance, is we do have a lower level of generic utilization than we projected at the start of the year. And that can have quite a material impact on both the revenue and on the cost line. So it does -- if your generic utilization goes down, it does negatively impact your profitability. That will be one potential tailwind that we will have, I would say, 6 months from now to 12 months from now. Because of contract changes in Med D, we would expect our generic utilization rates to increase, thus giving us some comfort on -- around the gross margin outlook. I hope that's given you enough perspective."

If we can react so quickly and now is because we were thinking of all the remedies and all the counteractions even before, we have not been probably quick enough in putting those counteractions in place.

And so could you maybe just explain the dynamic there that has the rates coming in so much worse than what you anticipated? And then I guess, the follow-up question to that would be, are we at a point with the PBMs where you need to take a tougher stance? I mean, obviously, there's precedent for playing a little harder when it comes to declining reimbursement rates and just not offering the Walgreens network in certain PBM offerings. Is that on the table? Is that kind of where the industry is at, given this persistent reimbursement rate pressure?"

And I think James covered them off in -- and they were as such. There was definitely -- generic deflation was reducing. That has an impact, and that happened through the quarter. Branded inflation was reducing, that happened during the quarter. And of course, the volume, to be honest with it as well, was less than we had expected. Particularly, we had a pretty big -- a very big flu and cough and cold season last year and it was early. And this year, it's been more normal and a little bit later. So these are all factors that hit us coming into that period. And I think also at the end of the year, we true-up with our PBM partners, the contracts for the year. And we don't really see the effect of that true-up really until middle of February. And that was another factor that happened as well. So it was a combination of headwinds that gave us this unusually high -- the highest quarter we've had, as James said, this fiscal year that created this reimbursement pressure. I think in terms of our attitude towards our partners in the supply chain, including the PBMs, we have a partnership approach. We are working with our partners to deliver better service, better products, including, for example, improving the ability for us to reduce costs elsewhere in the health care system. I'll give you one example of that. There's more money than ever before coming on the table for our service-based payments, particularly in the Medicare D area. And we again are working with partners towards the government to create a more common framework of KPIs that pharmacists could aim for in terms of getting repayments, for example, in Med D and DIRs. I mean it worked out very well, in my view, with Optum and UnitedHealth in a very successful Medicare Advantage book of business, where again we got more payments than ever for performance-based pharmacy. So I think there's a recognition by our partners that pharmacy is under pressure. I think there's a recognition by our partners who want better joined-up care within the health care system. And they're encouraging us through our learning incentives to invest more, as James has said, in these models. And that's what we intend to do."

So that, by some way, is the most important piece of work we're doing. It's where we're investing the most of our money going forward to really create better tools for engagement for customers across both front end and pharmacy and better ways for our business partners to engage with our health care platform. We're also very pleased with our partnership with Verily. We're really working pretty hard to bring real innovation quickly to the marketplace. They've developed a number of market-ready tools, for example, on their Onduo diabetes platform, which we have already active in our own population or health care beneficiaries here in Walgreens in the U.S.A. And the adoption rate of that tool is very satisfactory so far. And we believe that's another example of bringing new tools to market very quickly with new partnerships. On the retail side, I think we mentioned in our prepared remarks that we're very pleased with the rapid progress from a customer point of view and engagement in the Kroger trials in Northern Kentucky and Cincinnati. We're really very pleased with that. And we expect to be able to move that test and trial further forward, going forward. And of course, that is more focused on creating 2 things. First of all, convenience in retail between a fantastic grocer and food brand in Kroger and obviously our pharmacy and health care and beauty brands here in Walgreens; and secondly, working to share data appropriately, so we can personalize the offer for many Americans who rely on these categories every single week and every single day. It's the most sticky categories, because they're the ones that are most frequently used. Beyond that, Birchbox is in early stages but going well. And Sprint again we announced the expansion to 80 stores of Sprint. And last but not least, on the health care services side, LabCorp, where we continue to advance our LabCorp partnership with the ambition -- or the intention, should I say, to drive to 600 locations within the next 3.5 years."

And therefore, we are happy that we're now back to good, solid market-based market growth with Med D and seniors. Because seniors are usually on more medication and usually more generic medication, we've seen generic utilization start to rise. And that's what we've planned going forward, as James said in his answer to another question. So I think that's the reason for it. And again, I think we're satisfied we're now back to our normal growth, market growth in Med D."

And just as a planning expense for the next 3 years, we didn't want our guidance to be over-reliant on share repurchases. So we've built in $1.7 billion each year. So as you look to the next 3 years, around 2.5 percentage points of growth comes from buybacks with some offset coming from a tax rate that's turning negative. So as we look to mid-single-digit, if you call that kind of like a 6% to 8%, we see the core business growing at 3.5% to 5.5%, excluding the use of cash for capital allocation. So the remainder of this year is just to get back, be in the market on a particularly constant basis. I hope that covers your question."

And we've got, not surprises, but we have a couple of headwinds that we will face this year. So if you step back from this and look back over the last couple of years, this is a business that can deliver pretty comfortably somewhere in the region of $5 billion, $5.5 billion to $6 billion of cash flow, depending on the year. Now as you compare 1 year to another, you always have -- you're always lapping something of some sorts. This year, we have about $2.3 billion of headwinds. So I think as you think through a normal level of cash flow, which is somewhere north of $5 billion, we have to manage through cash taxes this year, which are $900 million higher than in the previous year. We're cycling through legal payouts of $300 million. And then we have large movements as a result of Rite Aid, almost $1 billion. So the cash flow this year will be well below the trend rate. But we have developed a 3-year plan and some support of our guidance. And we're quite comfortable on the long-term cash flow generating part of the company. And actually, quite -- I would even go so far as saying as, I think when you look at some of our payment terms with suppliers and some of the way we manage inventory, we probably have large doses of opportunity. And then the final comment on cash flow, as you look at this year, our cash capital expenditures are exceptionally high. They're about $300 million or $400 million higher than the run rate. And that's essentially the conversion of the Rite Aid stores. So it's quite a huge exercise because we took on 1,900 stores. As you saw from Alex, we are raising the store closures to 750. But that still leaves the conversion of 1,200 stores. And by the way, the Rite Aid acquisition has gone extremely well. The return on investment is exactly where we wanted it to be. We're getting there in a different way. And actually, we're very encouraged by the retention we're getting as we optimize the stores. So cash flow this year will be somewhat problematic. But we're quite confident on the future outlook."

As you look through the back half, we did say that the peak in the issue on gross margins in pharmacy is in Q2. We do expect some continuation into Q3 and then an improvement in Q4. So as you plot out your quarters, I would assume a fairly even split in the EPS between the 2 quarters, maybe 49-51. So Q3 will be worse and Q4 will be improving. We actually -- we set ourselves a different goal when we pulled together, and it's not really guidance, it's a growth model. And we stepped back and we went through very, very detailed reviews with each of the business leaders. And here is the goal we set ourselves. We wanted to set a realistic goal, mid- to high single-digit. We spent a lot of time on the levers to offset reimbursement, particularly on the assumptions around generic deflation and the ability of our generic purchasing organization to deliver a significant offset. And we're comfortable that the generic team can offset approximately 50% to 60% of the reimbursement impact. Then we went through each single volume assumption, particularly pharmacy but also in the retail business. And I really don't want it to be lost on the audience, the changes we're making in retail. And one is this business went from a loss-making business 3 years ago to quite a profitable retail business now. So we are -- from a starting point, it's a position of strength but with a weak top line delivery. And the big change will be we will distort and refocus our resources on health and wellness and beauty. And that's where we can win and we know we can win. And they're very attractive businesses. And then we will build partnerships with companies like Kroger to address the other parts of retail. And we're very convinced that we have line of sight to improving top line. The second part is we said can we -- let's put in what we can control. And you can control your cost journey. And we've built in $1.5 billion. We've put a strong governance around it. And we'll be resolute in delivering. And I emphasize, at least $1.5 billion of cost reduction. So that has a high degree of probability. And then the final thing, which we said at the beginning, was it's not -- you can't cut yourself the glory. So we've built in the investments required to drive the top line. So we have the right investments, $300 million a year which -- it adds up to $1 billion of investments behind partnerships and digital. So we're investing to make sure, especially that the U.S. business has the ammunition required to create that omnichannel experience in both pharmacy and in retail, so that we do get the volume delivery that creates the virtuous cycle. And that's the reason why we are actually quite confident that the growth model for the 3 years is founded in a lot of fact. And actually, it's quite a detailed plan we've developed internally. And the question we got earlier, does it translate to cash? And the answer is, yes. We see a line of sight in consistently delivering that $5 billion-type range that we've done in the past. We see no reason why the business can't do something similar into the future. And I said what Stefano said at the past, we're very disappointed with the quarter and the requirement to take down guidance. And that's made us resolute that we've put in place very tangible plans to make sure we don't have to do that again. And that's the commitment from the management team."

The transformational cost management programs that we began early this year is oone of the underlying foundations of the changes that we need to make. 
Most importantly, these programs will help drive a structural change in the company making us a more efficient, a more agile, a more responsible organization. It is expected to provide a significant portion of the funding required for our major technology upgrades and development investment. And of course, an element of it will help to give us a bridge in our financial performance as we restructure our businesses to better meet the needs of an ever more rapidly changing market.

93624,618080564,1767138,"Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc., Q3 2019 Earnings Call, Jun 27, 2019",2019-06-27,"Earnings Calls","Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Stefano, and good morning, everyone. Third quarter adjusted EPS was $1.47, a constant currency decline of 2.4% versus prior year. The results were slightly ahead of our expectations and included some timing benefits from the fourth quarter. Ove",1654,"Thank you, Stefano, and good morning, everyone. Third quarter adjusted EPS was $1.47, a constant currency decline of 2.4% versus prior year. The results were slightly ahead of our expectations and included some timing benefits from the fourth quarter. Overall, we are tracking well against our strategic goals. We are quite encouraged by U.S. comp sales, which were exactly what we needed to deliver to stay on track to meet our full year expectations. And while it is still early days, our Transformational Cost Management Program is very much on track and accelerating. 
Based on our performance in the quarter, we are reaffirming our full year adjusted EPS guidance. We continue to expect the year to be roughly flat on a constant currency basis. 
Let's now look in more detail at the numbers. In the third quarter, sales increased 0.7%. On a constant currency basis, sales were up 2.9% mainly due to growth in Retail Pharmacy USA and the strong performance from our Pharmaceutical Wholesale division. 
Adjusted operating income declined 11.7% or 10.4% on a constant currency basis. This was mainly due to lower pharmacy margins and a decline in front of store sales in U.S. and lower results in Boots U.K. 
Adjusted EPS declined 4% to $1.47, a decrease of 2.4% on a constant currency basis. This includes a 5.8 percentage point contribution from our share repurchase program. 
GAAP operating income declined 24.7%, including $86 million of expenses related to the implementation of our Transformational Cost Management Program and $115 million related to our share of AmerisourceBergen's impairment of [indiscernible]. 
In total, these adjustments account for more than 50% of the year-on-year decline. GAAP EPS declined 16.5% to $1.13 per share. 
Year-to-date sales increased 4.9%, including the currency headwind of 1.9%. On a constant currency basis, year-to-date sales were up 6.8%, reflecting 7.7% growth in Retail Pharmacy USA and 8% growth in Pharmaceutical Wholesale. 
Adjusted operating income declined 8.9% or 7.8% on a constant currency basis. This was more than offset by a 4.8 percentage point contribution from share repurchases and 3.2% from tax. Contributing to an increase in adjusted EPS, which was up 1.6% on a constant currency basis. 
Now let's look at the performance of our divisions, starting with Retail Pharmacy USA. Sales increased 2.3% in the quarter, mainly due to pharmacy brand inflation and pharmacy script growth. 
Organic sales increased 2.9%. 
Adjusted gross profit declined 3.9% and gross margin declined 140 basis points mostly due to pharmacy. Adjusted SG&A spend decreased 0.7%. And adjusted SG&A was 17.3% of sales, an improvement of 0.5 percentage point compared to the year-ago quarter. Adjusted operating income declined 13.8% in the quarter, procurement savings, pharmacy script growth and continued SG&A savings were not enough to offset reimbursement pressure and the lower front of store sales. These results also included store and labor investments of $40 million in the quarter, equivalent to approximately 270 basis points of adjusted operating income. 
Now let's look in more detail at pharmacy. Total pharmacy sales increased 4.3%, reflecting higher brand inflation, prescription volume growth and a strong growth in central specialty, which grew 8.6% year-on-year. 
Comp pharmacy sales increased 6% and comp prescriptions grew 4.7% in the quarter, a strong improvement on the first half growth of 1.9%. Market share was 21.2% in the quarter, down 50 basis points versus prior year due entirely to our store optimization program. 
Pharmacy gross profit declined versus prior year as script growth was more than offset by lower gross margin. Gross margin was around 150 basis points lower than last year due to continued reimbursement pressure, adverse mix associated with brand inflation and a 50 basis point impact due to the faster growing specialty business. These impacts were partially offset by procurement savings. The key to offsetting long-term reimbursement pressure is building scale, driving efficiency and creating a sizable healthcare services business. 
Turning next to our U.S. retail business. Total retail sales decreased 2.9% and were negatively impacted by our store optimization program. Comp retail sales declined 1.1%, an improvement on the first half comp decline of 3.5%. 
Tobacco accounted for 150 basis points of the comp sales decline, but we did benefit from a 65 basis point tailwind as a result of the cough, cold and flu season. 
Retail gross profit declined mostly due to lower sales, which as I mentioned earlier, were negatively impacted by our store optimization program. Gross margin was down slightly by 20 basis points, an improving trend versus the second quarter as we rebalanced our promotional mix. We expect to see a continued improvement in gross margin trends in the fourth quarter. 
Turning next to Retail Pharmacy International. As usual, I'll talk to constant currency numbers. Total sales declined 1.6% mainly due to a 1% decline in Boots U.K. in a challenging market. Boots U.K. comp pharmacy sales increased 0.8%, reflecting prescription growth in the quarter. Whereas comp retail sales declined 2.6% as we continued to gain share in a weak market. 
Our beauty reinvention is now in place in 26 stores and we remain on track to introduce 25 new brands in 2019. Adjusted operating income was down 10.5% due to weak retail sales and lower pharmacy margins in the U.K. Our U.K. pharmacy business was impacted by temporary industry wide NHS underfunding and higher generic pricing. These impacts were only partially offset by prescription volume growth. We are taking actions to address our U.K. cost base and I will cover these a little later. 
Turning now to the Pharmaceutical Wholesale division, which I'll also discuss in constant currency. The division delivered another strong quarter with sales up 8.3%, led by emerging markets. Our U.K. performance was aided in part by a customer contract change mentioned last quarter, which contributed 2.3% to revenue growth. 
Adjusted operating income increased 9.4%, reflecting strong gains in Turkey and solid results from our European business. 
Turning next to cash flow. Operating cash flow was $3.2 billion for the first 9 months of the year. Free cash flow was $2 billion. Operating cash flow was impacted by headwinds of around $1.4 billion. We are lapping a onetime prior year of working capital benefit of $502 million, cash tax payments of $395 million higher mainly as a result of U.S. tax reform. This year includes legal settlements of $276 million. And we have $200 million of cash costs relating to the ongoing Rite Aid store optimization and integration and the transformational cost management program. 
Underlying working capital increased approximately $500 million, primarily due to higher sales. Cash capital investment was $1.2 billion for the first 9 months, $264 million higher than the prior year. This was due mostly for the impact of the Rite Aid store conversions. 
Turning now to our Transformational Cost Management Program. We remain on target to deliver $1.5 billion in annual cost savings by fiscal 2022. Our smart spending benchmarking is complete, target and execution plans are set up and we're accelerating a wide range in program to reduce pharmacy cost to fill. The 20% headcount reduction of our Boots U.K. headquarters and the reorganization of our U.S. fuel supervision structure are now complete. 
On digitalization, a Microsoft cloud migration is moving apace. And we've now started working on optimizing our many IT vendors. Work has also began on building out compelling consumer propositions. Given the difficult market conditions in the U.K., we have completed the review of our store portfolio and have started a store optimization program that will impact around 200 locations over the course of the next 18 months. 
Many of these 200 stores are loss making and approximately 2/3 of them are within walking distance of another Boots store. While the stores we plan to close represent around 8% of our store base, we expect the revenue impact will be around 1%. We do not expect a significant impact on colleagues as we plan to redeploy to nearby stores. We are also reviewing our real estate footprint in the U.S. and accelerating the pace of change, especially in our U.S. supply chain. More to follow in the coming months as we work through these key opportunities. 
Turning to guidance. As I mentioned earlier, the third quarter was slightly ahead of our expectations aided by some timing benefits. As a result, we are reaffirming our full year guidance and we expect adjusted EPS to be roughly flat on a constant currency basis. As a reminder, last quarter we told you to expect a range of plus or minus 2%. Given the normal level of volatility in a business of this size, we feel this range is still appropriate. 
Let me just give you a couple of assumptions. As you update your models, you should now be building in $0.06 of negative currency impacts. And this is $0.02 worse than our prior guidance. We continue to project full year share repurchases of $3.8 billion, contributing 4.8 percentage points to adjusted EPS growth. And we now project a full year adjusted effective tax rate of around 15.5% compared to our earlier guidance of 16% to 17%. The lower rate reflects nonrecurring discrete benefits and changes to our geographic mix. When we provided our original fiscal '19 guidance, we highlighted incremental store and labor investments of around $150 million. As we accelerate the pace of our digital investments, we now expect total incremental spend of approximately $175 million with a significant portion of the additional spend coming in the fourth quarter. 
Let me finish by highlighting the change in revenue trends coming from Rite Aid. We saw a positive revenue contributions from the Rite Aid acquisition in the first 2 quarters of the year. From this quarter on, Rite Aid is actually a headwind to reported revenue due to the ongoing store optimization program. 
I'll hand you over to Alex and he will update you on some of the business initiatives we have underway in the U.S."

During the quarter, we continue to make progress in our 4 strategic priorities; accelerating digitalization, transforming and restructuring our retail offering, creating a neighborhood health destination around a more modern pharmacy; and rolling out our Transformational Cost Management program. We'll also continue to develop our omnichannel offering. 
Our Walgreens app has now been downloaded 57.3 million times, up 10.5% since last year. Around 26% of Walgreens Retail Resource Scripts were initiated through digital channels in the quarter, up 18.4% since last year. And also increased our active Balance Rewards members to 90.2 million. 
In Retail, our [indiscernible] living beauty brands No7 performed exceptionally well in the quarter and Walgreens sales of No7 were up by over 50%, help by the launch and advertising of the No7 laboratories when correcting [indiscernible] And our other retail partners saw significant growth. 
Addition to beauty, we're working refreshing our own brand portfolio in Walgreens to drive sales and improve the customer value proposition. 
During the past 2 years, over 60% of the Walgreens own brand product portfolio has been relaunched or rebranded enhancing the customer offer through better value and quality to deliver improvements in sales and margin. This work is ongoing. Rite Aid is very much on track. Against our store optimization program, we have completed 631 of the planned 750 stores closures and we continue to see good customer retention. 
As to the many Walgreens all in ready stores, 394 have been successfully converted to Walgreens. And we expect to complete the Rite Aid integration by the end of fiscal year 2020. 
We've taken further steps to develop our neighborhood health destinations, working with our partners including LabCorp and Humana. And as we announced during the quarter, Village ND. With Village ND, we will be opening 5 state-of-the-art primary care clinics in the eastern area by the end of the year, branded village medical at Walgreens. We also remain on track to open 125 LabCorp outlets evolving stores this year. And finally, the teams are working well together and so far the initial customer response has been positive. 
I'll now hand you back to Stefano."

So as you have heard, we have hardly delivered what we expected. But we have a lot of work ahead to get the business frowing again.

But we have a lot of work ahead to get the business frowing again. We have been working hard to initiate or accelerate the changes we need to keep us in line with or leading the market. We are investing heavily in updating our systems and infrastructure creating efficiencies and capabilities, which will give us coup of development for many years to come. We are developing new ways to engage via our customers, introducing new services and products through new channels. We are working with partners who bring us skills, resources, scale and expertise that complement our own to accelerate our development, give us access to new thinking in market and allow us to create significant new income streams. 
At the same time, we are continuing our focus on transforming our traditional areas of business but there are challenges in our core markets. Economic and reimbursement pressures have long been and remain a fact of life for us over the years. We have developed values at different levels to mitigate the impact of this pressure. 
In recent years, a major element of this mitigation has been improvement in generic procurement, made possible by changes in the global generics manufacturing sector, ongoing patent expires and significant development in the actual procurement process, all of which have led to continued improvement in buying terms. These buying benefits have enabled us to compensate for the significant demand made to us by payers. As we have made clear, the levels to which we can mitigate current and future reimbursement pressure towards generic procurement has renewed. Also, it will continue to be an important lever for many years to come. Recognizing this, we are accelerating our other levers to mitigate the pressure. We have more to do to call saving and efficiency and we expect consistent savings well into the future. There is no doubt that over time we also have to build the range of services and service level that drives benefits for our peer outcome. We believe that the future of pharmacy is aligned to divide that range of healthcare services provided to efficiently and conveniently in the community setting. This is why we are exploring partnerships with a wide range of invaluable experts and value fields, allowing us to offer a better service more effectively and at a lower cost to offset than we would be able to do if we have set these services up on our own or pay the significant premium for them. Of course, many of the services are still being tested or are still in development. 
Let me clear, however, while a number of partnerships we are piloting if the potential to have a meaningful impact on our business, no single one of these will define our frame of future. In total, it would be a combination of products and services working together in the convenience of a community pharmacy that will forward the basis of our future customer proposition. The mixture of products and services will inevitably bring together a range of complex and differentiated business model. The economics will be least impact based on changes to individuals as condition management and over all well-being over many years. 
The consequence of getting these services right has a huge potential benefit for us, for our partners and for our customers. But if we rush into them without truly understanding the operational or financial model, we are on the risk of wasting an extraordinary amount of time resources and more. We might be sure of what we're doing before we enter into these businesses in scale. Today, many people are looking at our company indeed at all sectors, focus on the immediate risk that we have to face. And I understand this, we're far from complacent about the pressures we face. However, we can see the inherent strength of our business. There is an ever increasing demand for effective, efficient and convenient support for people to manage their health conditions, while leading productive and fulfilling lives in their local communities. The unique positioning of community pharmacy and our place in the sector gives us practical and financial scale, reach and strength. It gives us a robust platform on which to evolve and transform our company to meet the ever-changing needs of the markets we serve, and it gives us a fantastic foundation from which to deliver innovation, growth and value for our customers and shareholders for many years to come.

One was timing, and I would say, that's around $0.03 or $35 million is our best estimate. And the other one is we also highlighted in the comments, we're ramping up the amount of spending and store labor and now digital and development expense. So we've increased to the spending on the full year by -- from $150 million to $175 million. There is about a $0.01 of that in the fourth quarter. So think about roughly around $50 million. Around $0.40, was it. And when you get to the 2 timing items, one was $0.02 of the $0.03. But essentially the timing of payer contracts when you do the compliance and true-up as part of you and his outcomes and where you had volumes in certain tiers. And that's the normal course of business but we'd expect that in Q4. And then a $0.01 is coming from expense timing. We accelerated some real estate savings from Q4 into Q3. So it was actually one of the quieter in terms of volatility and very few supplies. What's interesting here maybe I'll take the opportunity. As you start looking out into Q4 because this takes some income out of Q4. Our Q4 targets is actually quite -- when you start working through it, you start working out your estimates. Bear in mind, we had 2 large one-time items last year. And on the EPS basis, we're slightly into these. The first one is you'll recall there was a large true-up curtailment benefit relating to retiring medical. That was $110 million. And then in the prior quarter of last year, we made an adjustment for legal cost, which was onetime and that was approximately $60 million. So that's another $0.05. So if you think about it, we have a 10 percentage point headwind on EPS in Q4. So we actually -- if you -- when you guys see Q4, we're looking forward to pretty good improving margin trends on the gross margin. And the headwind is all on the overheads and it's all due to onetime items in the prior years. So I think as you shift through it, this is -- the volatility in Q3 was actually quite low. When you get into Q4, think more that we have 2 large items last year. So actually when you analyze the results, the core performance is actually quite -- is improving quite a bit. Hope that helps."

No, I think the way we cycle through the FLP contract, specialty business growing at 8.6%. We would expect all this to grow it faster than the core business. So we'll always be somewhat dilutive to the margins. One other thing, there's other dynamics in the quarter. So in the quarter we sold more of branded, and the margin on branded is lower than it is on generic and that creates a mix impact as well. And that's significant as any other impact. And the problem is we can't project with accuracy, the individual mix in any single quarter. But if you take out a lot of these mix items, the core reimbursement net of procurement and other mitigations was actually a pretty solid quarter. We do expect some improvement in both retail and gross margin -- sorry, retail and pharmacy gross margins in Q4. That's as far as we're willing to go. So this is not something you should take and extrapolate out as 150 basis points on pharmacy. We do expect some improvements ion the trend in Q4. But mix and everything else plays into it.

And as the name suggests that, we are seeing the build to compensate more Q4 than Q3 as the trends compare. I think in particular, a couple of areas which I'm just interested in going forward. First of all, we are getting paid more for, I would say, value-based contracts, particularly, in Medicare D. So we're starting to hit some performance targets, which is encouraging. And I think also we continue to have the opportunity to work differently in some networks. For example, again, I would point to the prime contract we did some time ago where we had a different approach the market place where we were much more transparent. And again that process we believe is going to become more I would say available to the market going forward that has been in the past. So reimbursement doesn't go away. The margin and the pressure as we often sat about we continue to innovate it if you create fully and we work hard on new levers versus relative old levers as we've spoken about a lot."

We are making good progress in terms of reinvigorating the base model in the U.K. and very difficult times. I don't have to tell you how difficult the marketplace is there. For example, this morning we opened our fantastic new start, new concept stores in corporate gardens that was skewed into the corner. And this was a health wellness and beauty concept store which are not only feed the future of goods but could also of course gives us some great ideas for U.S. market as well. And top of that, we're doing a lot of digitalization. We visualized the advantage card which is still the most popular part in the U.K. by somebody in terms of beauty and treat cards and a lot of customers -- all that is well under 17 million holders today. We've also created digital pharmacy, we once start that for the first time in the U.K. in terms of managing prescriptions copies, some of the great ideas that we could pass across moving as part of the merger.

I think I'll say it already and Stefano said it very clearly, we still already have a very efficient and innovative model out [indiscernible] and we continue to work. In the dimension, which we think is slightly different, we prefer to have contracts with manufacturers to give them certainty of supply so that we get certainty of supply back in the marketplace. That's really important to customers and allow us to plan together in a different way. And that's how we work. Having said that, we all know that the level of opportunities as Stefano is said is changing going forward. It's not -- the mix -- savings, make savings is changing. So we set up some innovative partnerships already with the partnership we set on Express Scripts, for example. One, we are combining the volume from the PDN, with the volume from the Retail Pharmacy. And we continue to look at other ways of making sure that we got the right scale and mix of partners going into reboot going forward. I think secondly, the manufacturers are thinking differently as well. And again we can talk on their behalf about you probably have some of the things they have been saying. And we think that our approach to buying in partnership with them in the way that we organize how we work with them will continue to give us advantage into the future going forward. Of course, any futures other markets may open up. We don't know that in reality and we're not banking in that particularly on how we see the plan going forward. Clearly, things will change in 1 direction and keep changing again. Having a global perspective and global volumes we think will give us global opportunities in the future as well."

All connected with other healthcare professionals. All connected to bringing forward new solutions are going forward.

And I'm going to show you the list to go on in terms of the people who are talking to us and we are talking to them. So we're really confident about the future of pharmacy.

I think it's a little bit of everything you said actually because you have to go back on a journey. Q2 was reimbursement pressure, which we said I think it was exceeded 30% of the full year reimbursement pressure. So we would have set an unprecedented level. We saw it go back to a more normalized level in Q3. But we saw some slowness on the procurement savings in Q3. We're going to see those both of the variables equalize in Q4. So it gets back to -- you can't really look at it reimbursement, it's reimbursement net of the mitigation. The biggest true up and one is procurement savings. And there has bee some tuning between in Q3 and Q4 there. When you get to volume, I want to highlight, we had a great quarter in Q3. We set some fairly challenging goals internally. Bear in mind, we have script volume for the first half on the comp basis below 2%. So to come in the high 4s was something we need to do it and we need those kind of numbers. That's number one. We're also very pleased with the way retail came in. If you strip it back a little bit, it's down 1.1. We were tracking in the first half of a pretty disappointing 3.5% comp store decline. But the change on change is quite impressive. We want to leverage the exactly same numbers but we will continue to hold onto some of these citrine improvements. I think what will happen in Q4 is you will see a little bit of stabilization of the top line outlook together with some improvement in both businesses on the margin side. So it's a confluence of trends. And I will highlight again then you got it is too big onetime items and overheads. So it's too early to call weeks were in Q4 obviously, part that's where our current expectation is improve the gross margins and continued stabilization of scripts in same-store sales and retail. Hope that helps you as you think through it."

After what was a very disappointing second quarter for us, it is pleasing to be able to report that this quarter has been brought in line with our expectations. That said, the pressures we have seen for sometimes continue to impact our businesses, and we still have a lot to do to deliver the transformation that will allow us to get ahead of the market trends again and return our company to strong and consistent growth. We were clear that the action we were undertaking to address the market changes take time, and the impact will, therefore, not fully be reflected in our financial performance until future financial years. But we have been working hard to accelerate our plans and programs. 
I have repeatedly said that we have within our company the skills and the assets we need. But rest, the challenges that we face as our markets evolve and transform. Last quarter, we told you that we would focus on accelerating the work we are doing to transform our company. We are doing that. The Transformational Cost Management Programs that we began early this year is one of the underlying foundations of the changes that we need to make. Most importantly, this program will help drive a structural change in the company, making us a more efficient, a more agile, a more responsible organization. It is expected to provide a significant portion of the funding required for our major technology upgrade and development investments. And of course, an element of it will help to give us a bridge in our financial performance as we restructure our businesses to better meet the needs of an ever more rapidly changing market. 
James and Alex will address some of these points as they talk you through the quarter, which I will ask them to do now. James?"

Third quarter adjusted EPS was $1.47, a constant currency decline of 2.4% versus prior year. The results were slightly ahead of our expectations and included some timing benefits from the fourth quarter. Ove",1653,"Thank you, Stefano, and good morning, everyone. Third quarter adjusted EPS was $1.47, a constant currency decline of 2.4% versus prior year. The results were slightly ahead of our expectations and included some timing benefits from the fourth quarter. Overall, we are tracking well against our strategic goals. We are quite encouraged by U.S. comp sales, which were exactly what we needed to deliver to stay on track to meet our full year expectations. And while it is still early days, our Transformational Cost Management Program is very much on track and accelerating. 
Based on our performance in the quarter, we are reaffirming our full year adjusted EPS guidance. We continue to expect the year to be roughly flat on a constant currency basis. 
Let's now look in more detail at the numbers. In the third quarter, sales increased 0.7%. On a constant currency basis, sales were up 2.9% mainly due to growth in Retail Pharmacy USA and the strong performance from our Pharmaceutical Wholesale division. 
Adjusted operating income declined 11.7% or 10.4% on a constant currency basis. This was mainly due to lower pharmacy margins and a decline in front-of-store sales in the U.S. and lower results in Boots UK.
Adjusted EPS declined 4% to $1.47, a decrease of 2.4% on a constant currency basis. This includes a 5.8 percentage point contribution from our share repurchase program. 
GAAP operating income declined 24.7%, including $86 million of expenses related to the implementation of our Transformational Cost Management Program and $115 million related to our share of AmerisourceBergen's impairment of PharMEDium. In total, these adjustments account for more than 50% of the year-on-year decline. GAAP EPS declined 16.5% to $1.13 per share. 
Year-to-date sales increased 4.9%, including a currency headwind of 1.9%. On a constant currency basis, year-to-date sales were up 6.8%, reflecting 7.7% growth in Retail Pharmacy USA and 8% growth in Pharmaceutical Wholesale. 
Adjusted operating income declined 8.9% or 7.8% on a constant currency basis. This was more than offset by a 4.8 percentage point contribution from share repurchases and 3.2% from tax, contributing to an increase in adjusted EPS, which was up 1.6% on a constant currency basis. 
Now let's look at the performance of our divisions, starting with Retail Pharmacy USA. Sales increased 2.3% in the quarter mainly due to pharmacy brand inflation and pharmacy script growth. Organic sales increased 2.9%. 
Adjusted gross profit declined 3.9% and gross margin declined 140 basis points mostly due to pharmacy. Adjusted SG&A spend decreased 0.7%. And adjusted SG&A was 17.3% of sales, an improvement of 0.5 percentage point compared to the year ago quarter. Adjusted operating income declined 13.8% in the quarter, procurement savings, pharmacy script growth and continued SG&A savings were not enough to offset reimbursement pressure and the lower front of store sales. These results also included store and labor investments of $40 million in the quarter, equivalent to approximately 270 basis points of adjusted operating income. 
Now let's look in more detail at pharmacy. Total pharmacy sales increased 4.3%, reflecting higher brand inflation, prescription volume growth and a strong growth in central specialty, which grew 8.6% year-on-year. 
Comp pharmacy sales increased 6%, and comp prescriptions grew 4.7% in the quarter, a strong improvement on the first half growth of 1.9%. Market share was 21.2% in the quarter, down 50 basis points versus prior year due entirely to our store optimization program. 
Pharmacy gross profit declined versus prior year as script growth was more than offset by lower gross margin. Gross margin was around 150 basis points lower than last year due to continued reimbursement pressure, adverse mix associated with brand inflation and a 50 basis point impact due to the faster growing specialty business. These impacts were partially offset by procurement savings. The key to offsetting long-term reimbursement pressure is building scale, driving efficiency and creating a sizable health care services business. 
Turning next to our U.S. Retail business. Total retail sales decreased 2.9% and were negatively impacted by our store optimization program. Comp retail sales declined 1.1%, an improvement on the first half comp decline of 3.5%. Tobacco accounted for 150 basis points of the comp sales decline, but we did benefit from a 65 basis point tailwind as a result of the cough, cold and flu season. 
Retail gross profit declined mostly due to lower sales, which as I mentioned earlier were negatively impacted by our store optimization program. Gross margin was down slightly by 20 basis points, an improving trend versus the second quarter as we rebalanced our promotional mix. We expect to see a continued improvement in gross margin trends in the fourth quarter. 
Turning next to Retail Pharmacy International. As usual, I'll talk to constant currency numbers. Total sales declined 1.6% mainly due to a 1% decline in Boots UK in a challenging market. Boots UK comp pharmacy sales increased 0.8%, reflecting prescription growth in the quarter. Whereas comp retail sales declined 2.6% as we continued to gain share in a weak market. 
Our beauty reinvention is now in place in 26 stores, and we remain on track to introduce 25 new brands in 2019. Adjusted operating income was down 10.5% due to weak retail sales and lower pharmacy margins in the U.K. Our U.K. pharmacy business was impacted by temporary industry-wide NHS underfunding and higher generic pricing. These impacts were only partially offset by prescription volume growth. We are taking actions to address our U.K. cost base, and I will cover these a little later. 
Turning now to the Pharmaceutical Wholesale division, which I'll also discuss in constant currency. The division delivered another strong quarter with sales up 8.3%, led by emerging markets. Our U.K. performance was aided in part by a customer contract change mentioned last quarter, which contributed 2.3% to revenue growth. Adjusted operating income increased 9.4%, reflecting strong gains in Turkey and solid results from our European business. 
Turning next to cash flow. Operating cash flow was $3.2 billion for the first 9 months of the year. Free cash flow was $2 billion. Operating cash flow was impacted by headwinds of around $1.4 billion. We are lapping a onetime prior year of working capital benefit of $502 million, cash tax payments are $395 million higher mainly as a result of U.S. tax reform. This year includes legal settlements of $276 million. And we have $200 million of cash costs relating to the ongoing Rite Aid store optimization and integration and the transformational cost management program. 
Underlying working capital increased approximately $500 million primarily due to higher sales. Cash capital investment was $1.2 billion for the first 9 months, $264 million higher than the prior year. This was due mostly for the impact of the Rite Aid store conversions. 
Turning now to our Transformational Cost Management Program. We remain on target to deliver $1.5 billion in annual cost savings by fiscal 2022. Our smart spending benchmarking is complete, targets and execution plans are setup, and we're accelerating a wide-ranging program to reduce pharmacy cost to fill. The 20% headcount reduction at our Boots UK headquarters and the reorganization of our U.S. fuel supervision structure are now complete. 
On digitalization, our Microsoft cloud migration is moving at pace. And we have now started working on optimizing our many IT vendors. Work has also began on building out compelling consumer-value propositions. Given the difficult market conditions in the U.K., we have completed the review of our store portfolio and have started a store optimization program that will impact around 200 locations over the course of the next 18 months. Many of these 200 stores are loss making, and approximately 2/3 of them are within walking distance of another Boots store. While the stores we plan to close represent around 8% of our store base, we expect the revenue impact will be around 1%. We do not expect a significant impact on colleagues as we plan to redeploy to nearby stores. We are also reviewing our real estate footprint in the U.S. and accelerating the pace of change, especially in our U.S. supply chain. More to follow in the coming months as we work through these key opportunities. 
Turning to guidance. As I mentioned earlier, the third quarter was slightly ahead of our expectations aided by some timing benefits. As a result, we are reaffirming our full year guidance, and we expect adjusted EPS to be roughly flat on a constant currency basis. 
As a reminder, last quarter we told you to expect a range of plus or minus 2%. Given the normal level of volatility in a business of this size, we feel this range is still appropriate. Let me just give you a couple of assumptions. As you update your models, you should now be building in $0.06 of negative currency impacts. And this is $0.02 worse than our prior guidance. We continue to project full year share repurchases of $3.8 billion, contributing 4.8 percentage points to adjusted EPS growth. And we now project a full year adjusted effective tax rate of around 15.5% compared to our earlier guidance of 16% to 17%. The lower rate reflects nonrecurring discrete benefits and changes to our geographic mix. When we provided our original fiscal '19 guidance, we highlighted incremental store and labor investments of around $150 million. As we accelerate the pace of our digital investments, we now expect total incremental spend of approximately $175 million with a significant portion of the additional spend coming in the fourth quarter. 
Let me finish by highlighting the change in revenue trends coming from Rite Aid. We saw positive revenue contributions from the Rite Aid acquisition in the first 2 quarters of the year. From this quarter on, Rite Aid is actually a headwind to reported revenue due to the ongoing store optimization program. 
I'll noW hand you over to Alex, and he will update you on some of the business initiatives we have underway in the U.S."

During the quarter, we continue to make progress in our 4 strategic priorities. Accelerating digitalization, transforming and restructuring our retail offering, creating a neighborhood health destination around a more modern pharmacy, and rolling out our Transformational Cost Management program. 
We'll also continuing to develop our omnichannel offering. Our Walgreens app has now been downloaded 57.3 million times, up 10.5% since last year. Around 26% of Walgreens retail refill scripts were initiated through digital channels in the quarter, up 18.4% since last year. And have also increased our active Balance Rewards members to 90.2 million. 
In Retail, our leading beauty brands No7 performed exceptionally well in the quarter. In Walgreens sales of No7 were up by over 50%, helped by the launch and advertising of the No7 Laboratories Line Correcting Booster Serum, and our other retail partners saw significant growth. 
In addition to beauty, we're working on refreshing our own brand portfolio in Walgreens to drive sales and improve the customer value proposition. 
During the past 2 years, over 60% of the Walgreens own brand product portfolio has been relaunched or rebranded enhancing the customer offer through better value and quality to deliver improvements in sales and margin. This work is ongoing. Rite Aid is very much on track. Against our store optimization program, we have completed 631 of the planned 750 stores closures and we continue to see good customer retention. 
As to the many Walgreens own ready stores, 394 have been successfully converted to Walgreens, and we expect to complete the Rite Aid integration by the end of fiscal year 2020. 
We've taken further steps to develop our neighborhood health destinations, working with our partners including LabCorp and Humana, and as we announced during the quarter, VillageMD. With VillageMD, we will be opening 5 state-of-the-art primary care clinics in the eastern area by the end of the year, branded Village Medical at Walgreens. We also remain on track to open 125 LabCorp outlets Walgreens stores this year.

So as you have heard, we have already delivered what we expected. But we have a lot of work ahead to get the business growing again. We have been working hard to initiate or accelerate the changes we need to keep us in line with or leadin",764,"Thank you, Alex. So as you have heard, we have already delivered what we expected. But we have a lot of work ahead to get the business growing again. We have been working hard to initiate or accelerate the changes we need to keep us in line with or leading the market. We are investing heavily in updating our systems and infrastructure, creating efficiencies and capabilities, which will give us scope of development for many years to come. We are developing new ways to engage with our customers, introducing new services and products through new channels. We are working with partners who bring us the skills, resources, scale and expertise that complement our own to accelerate our development, give us access to new thinking market and allow us to create significant new income streams. 
At the same time, we are continuing our focus on transforming our traditional areas of business, but rest, the challenges of our core markets. Economic and reimbursement pressures have long been and remain a fact of life for us. Over the years, we have developed values at different levels to mitigate the impact of this pressure. 
In recent years, a major element of this mitigation has been improvement in generic procurement, made possible by changes in the global generics manufacturing sector, ongoing patent expires and significant development in the actual procurement process, all of which have led to continued improvement in buying terms. These buying benefits have enabled us to compensate for the significant demand made on us by payers. As we have made clear, the level to which we can mitigate current and future reimbursement pressure toward generic procurement has reduced. Although, it will continue to be an important lever for many years to come. Recognizing this, we are accelerating other levers to mitigate the pressures. We have more to do to cost saving and efficiency, and we expect consistent savings well into the future. There is no doubt that over time we also have to build a range of services and service level that drive benefits for our payer partners.
We believe that the future of pharmacy is aligned to a wider of health care services provided efficiently and conveniently in a community setting. This is why we are exploring partnerships with a wide range of innovative expert in various fields, allowing us to offer a better service more effectively and at a lower cost to offset than we would be able to do if we had set these services up on our own or paid a significant premium for them. Of course, many of the services are still being tested or are still in development. 
Let me clear, however, while the number of partnership we are piloting has the potential to have a meaningful impact on our business, no single one of these will define or frame of future. In truth, it would be a combination of products and services working together in the convenience of a community pharmacy that will forward the basis of our future customer proposition. The mixture of products and services will inevitably bring together a range of complex and differentiated business models. Their economics will be least impact based on changes to individuals' health condition management and over all wellbeing over many years. 
The consequence of getting these services right has a huge potential benefit for us, for our partners and for our customers. But if we rush into them without truly understanding the operational or financial model, we have the risk of wasting an extraordinary amount of time, resources and more. We might be sure of what we are doing before we enter into these businesses in scale. 
Today, many people are looking at our company, indeed at our sector, focused on the immediate risk they perceive us to face. And I understand this, we're far from complacent about the pressures we face. However, we can see the inherent strength of our business. There is an ever increasing demand for effective, efficient and convenient support for people to manage their health conditions, while leading productive and fulfilling lives in their local communities. The unique positioning of community pharmacy and our place in the sector gives us practical and financial scale, reach and strength. It gives us a robust platform on which to evolve and transform our company to meet the ever-changing needs of the markets we serve. And it gives us a fantastic foundation from which to deliver innovation, growth and value for our customers and our shareholders for many years to come. 
Thank you. Now we will take your questions."

And I would say that's around $0.03 or $35 million is our best estimate. And the other one is, whereas we also highlighted in the comments, we're ramping up the amount of spending in store labor and now digital and development expense. So we've increased the spending on the full year by -- from $150 million to $175 million. There is about a $0.01 of that in the fourth quarter. So think about roughly around $50 million. Around $0.04-ish was it. And when you get to the 2 timing items, one was $0.02 of the $0.03, but essentially the timing of payer contracts when you do the compliance and true-up part of you or his outcomes or whether you hit volumes in certain tiers. And that's the normal course of business, but we had expected that in Q4. And then a $0.01 is coming from expense timing. We accelerated some real estate savings from Q4 into Q3. So it was actually one of the quieter quarters in terms of volatility, very few surprises. 
What's interesting here -- maybe I'll take the opportunity. As you start looking out into Q4 because this takes some income out of Q4. Our Q4 targets is actually quite -- when you start working through it, you start working out your estimates. Bear in mind, we had 2 large onetime items last year. And on an EPS basis, we're cycling through these. The first one is, you'll recall there was a large true-up, a curtailment benefit relating to retiree medical. That was $110 million. And then in the prior quarter of last year, we made an adjustment for legal cost, which was onetime and that was approximately $60 million. So that's another $0.05. So if you think about it, we have a 10 percentage point headwind on EPS in Q4. So we actually -- if you -- when you dissect Q4, we're looking forward to pretty good improving margin trends on the gross margin. And the headwind is all on the overheads and it's all due to onetime items in the prior year. So I think as you shift through it -- this -- the volatility in Q3 was actually quite low. When you get into Q4, think more that we have 2 large items last year. So actually when you analyze the result, the core performance is actually quite -- it's improving quite a bit. I hope that's helped a little bit."

Where there is -- think of it as a fly by. So we closed 2 stores close to each other in the U.K. And sometimes they were a 5-minute walking distance, and they're transferring over to scripts but you're taking out fixed cost structure. So the calculations are quite complex. It's -- you have to assess are you leaving a trading area, which we generally don't like to do. We want to preserve our presence both in the U.K. and in the U.S. And I would highlight that in the U.K., we highlighted in the comments we're reducing the store count by 8%. The impact on revenue is around 1%. So I don't want to call that rounding. But it has no strategic impact on our ability to maintain our strength of our position in the U.K. I would actually argue on the contrary.

I think the -- we cycle through the FEP contracts, the specialty business growing at 8.6%, we would expect that always to grow at faster than the core business. So we'll always be somewhat dilutive to margins. One other thing, there is other dynamics in the quarter. So in the quarter we sold more branded, and the margin on branded is lower than it is on generic and that creates a mix impact as well. And that's as significant as any other impact. And the problem is, we can't project with accuracy, the individual mix in any single quarter. But if you take out a lot of these mix items, the core reimbursement net of procurement and other mitigations was actually a pretty solid quarter. We do expect some improvement in both retail and gross margin -- sorry, retail and pharmacy gross margins in Q4. That's as far as we're willing to go. So this is not something you should take and extrapolate out as 150 basis points on pharmacy. We do expect some improvements in the trend in Q4.

And as James has just said, we are seeing the ability to compensating more in Q4 than Q3 as the trends compare. I think in particular, a couple of areas which are just interesting going forward. First of all, we are getting paid more for, I would say, value-based contracts, particularly in Medicare D. So we're starting to hit some of the performance targets, which is encouraging. And I think also we continue to have the opportunity to work differently in some networks. For example, again, I would point to the prime contract we did some time ago where we have a different approach to marketplace, where we're really much more transparent. And again, that process we believe is -- will become more I say -- I will say available to the market going forward that has been in the past. So it's -- if the reimbursement doesn't go away, the margin is under pressure as we've often said.

So as that goes through, we'll give more updates in terms of what that means in terms of projections. But we're encouraged by the progress there, but we're only halfway through it.

Then you were -- the market builds in new molecules. I'm very excited about the supply chain piece here in the U.S. because we now have a team setup looking to shrink, so stock office. Whether that's left in-store or at stock office and warehouses. And we're using teams from Microsoft. So this shows the benefit of the bigger Microsoft agreement. There's data scientists on this who are helping us build data links to understand what is going on and true causes of shrink and how to eliminate it. And these are $100 million, $200 million opportunities. And that's without getting into the working capital side of it. So I don't want that to be lost. Once we have SAP for Hana in place across the 9,500 stores, that stock fill a visibility that we don't have today. Now we expect significant reductions in the level of inventory required to be held at store levels. So -- and this is a lot

will be huge. So you would expect that exiting 2020, we're starting to see material reductions in inventory levels."

I mean let me start with the last question first, which is the underfunding point. The U.K. government pay in a certain way, they -- I don't want to go into detail of it, but fundamentally, it's a market payment for all the pharmacies in the U.K. And if you go into what's called the PSNC website, there is more details there about how the -- how that works. So we are pretty convinced there's been underfunding in the last period. Now of course, working within the pharmacy contractors and the PSNC, we're now debating that with the government in a positive way as our new contracts are put in place. So that's what we refer to. And of course, we can't make any further comments until that negotiation is complete. But I think in terms of the overall performance of the business. We are making good progress in terms of reinvigorating the Boots model in the U.K. in very difficult times. I don't have to tell you how difficult the marketplace is there. For example, this morning we opened a fantastic new store, a new concept store in Covent Garden that was [indiscernible] around the corner. And this is a health wellness and beauty concept store, which will not only feed the future of Boots, but could also of course give us some great ideas for U.S. market as well. On top of that, we've done a lot of digitalization. We've digitalized the Advantage card, which is still the most popular card in the U.K. by some way in terms of beauty and treat cards and a lot of customers use it. I think it's well under 17 million holders today. We've also created digital pharmacy, we've launched that for the first time in the U.K. in terms of managing prescriptions copies, some of the great ideas that we could pass across the Walgreens as part of the merger. So -- and of course, the cost programs James already referred to in his remarks in terms of moving money from maybe the older model into investing in the future of the Boots business. So that's a story really where we're using the current market situation to make sure that we're investing our future. And we're seeing some interesting lead indicators of performance. And of course, we'll give you more updates as that develops."

I think I'll say what I said already and Stefano said it very clearly, we still have a very efficient, effective and innovative model out of WBAD, and we continue to work in a dimension, which we think is slightly different. We prefer to have contracts with manufacturers to give them certainty of supply so that we get certainty of supply back in the marketplace. That's really important to the customers and allows us to plan together in a different way and that's how we work. Having said that, we all know that the level of opportunities as Stefano is said is changing going forward. It's not we're not going to make savings, we will make savings, it's just changing. So we have setup some innovative partnerships already, the partnership we setup with Express Scripts, for example, is one where we're combining the volume from a PBM with the volume from the Retail Pharmacy. And we continue to look at other ways of making sure that we've got the right scale and mix of partners going into WBAD going forward. I think secondly, the manufacturers are thinking differently as well. And again, we can't talk on their behalf, but you probably head some of the things they have been saying. And we think that our approach to buying in partnership with them and the way that we organize how we work with them will continue to give us advantage into the future going forward. Of course, in the future other markets may open up. We don't know that in reality, and we're not banking on that particularly and how we see the plan going forward. But clearly, things will change in one direction and could change again. And having a global perspective and global volumes we think will give us global opportunities in the future as well."

I mean secondly, you only have to look at comments from other competitive marketplaces to see the pressure that we are all feeling in the marketplace. The other side of the coin is that we continue to believe strongly that the community care in the pharmacy, the physical location in the community with the pharmacist available and accessible I know is a really great opportunity for not just pharmacies but for health care all connected through data, all connected with other health care professionals, all connected to bringing forward new solutions going forward. That's why we are so excited about the work we're doing, not just with Microsoft but with as Stefano said, other relevant partners, for example, Verily, we've managed this well and LabCorp. And I can assure the list could go on in terms of the people who are talking to us and we are talking to them. So we are really confident about the future of pharmacy.

I think it's a little bit of everything you said actually because you have to go back on a journey. Q2 was reimbursement pressure, which we said I think was -- exceeded 30% of the full year reimbursement pressure. So we would've set an unprecedented level. We saw it go back to more a normalized level in Q3. But we saw some slowness on the procurement savings in Q3. And we're going to see those -- both of the variables equalize in Q4. So it gets back to -- you can't really look at it as reimbursement, it's reimbursement net of the mitigation. The biggest 2 are, one is procurement savings, and there's being some tuning between Q3 and Q4 there. When you get to volume, I want to highlight, we had a great quarter in Q3. We set some fairly challenging goals internally. Bear in mind, we had script volume for the first half on a comp basis below 2%. So to come in the high 4s was something, we needed to do it and we need those kind of numbers. That's number one. We're also very pleased with the way retail came in. If you strip it back a little bit, it's down 1.1. We were tracking in the first half of a pretty disappointing 3.5% comp store decline. But the change on change is quite impressive. We won't deliver exactly same numbers, but we will continue to hold onto some of these trend improvements. I think what will happen in Q4 is, you will see a little bit stabilization of the top line outlook together with some improvement in both businesses on the margin side. So it's a confluence of trends. And I'll highlight again then you've got these 2 big onetime items and overheads. So it's too early to call victory in Q4 obviously, but that's where our current expectation is improve gross margins and continued stabilization of scripts and the same-store sales and retail. I hope that helps you as you think through it."

After what was a very disappointing second quarter for us, it is pleasing to be able to report that this quarter has been brought in line with our expectations. That said, the pressures we have seen for sometimes continue to impact our businesses, and we still have a lot to do to deliver the transformation that will allow us to get ahead of the market trends again and return our company to strong and consistent growth. 
We were clear that the action we were undertaking to address the market changes take time, and the impact will, therefore, not fully be reflected in our financial performance until future financial years. But we have been working hard to accelerate our plans and program. 
I have repeatedly said that we have within our company the skills and the assets we need to address the challenges that we face as our markets evolve and transform. 
Last quarter, we told you that we would focus on accelerating the work we are doing to transform our company. We are doing that. The Transformational Cost Management Programs that we began early this year is one of the underlying foundations of the changes that we need to make. Most importantly, this program will help drive a structural change in the company, making us a more efficient, a more agile, and more responsible organization. 
It is expected to provide a significant portion of the funding required for our major technology upgrade and development investments. And of course, an element of it will help to give us a bridge in our financial performance as we restructure our businesses to better meet the needs of an ever more rapidly changing market. 
James and Alex will address some of these points as they talk you through the quarter, which I will ask them to do now. James?"

Third quarter adjusted EPS was $1.47, a constant currency decline of 2.4% versus prior year. The results were slightly ahead of our expectations and included some timing benefits from the fourth quarter. O",1655,"Thank you, Stefano, and good morning, everyone. Third quarter adjusted EPS was $1.47, a constant currency decline of 2.4% versus prior year. The results were slightly ahead of our expectations and included some timing benefits from the fourth quarter. 
Overall, we are tracking well against our strategic goals. We are quite encouraged by U.S. comp sales, which were exactly what we needed to deliver to stay on track to meet our full year expectations. And while it is still early days, our Transformational Cost Management Program is very much on track and accelerating. 
Based on our performance in the quarter, we are reaffirming our full year adjusted EPS guidance. We continue to expect the year to be roughly flat on a constant currency basis. 
Let's now look in more detail at the numbers. In the third quarter, sales increased 0.7%. On a constant currency basis, sales were up 2.9% mainly due to growth in Retail Pharmacy USA and the strong performance from our Pharmaceutical Wholesale division. 
Adjusted operating income declined 11.7% or 10.4% on a constant currency basis. This was mainly due to lower pharmacy margins and a decline in front-of-store sales in the U.S. and lower results in Boots UK.
Adjusted EPS declined 4% to $1.47, a decrease of 2.4% on a constant currency basis. This includes a 5.8 percentage point contribution from our share repurchase program. 
GAAP operating income declined 24.7%, including $86 million of expenses relating to the implementation of our Transformational Cost Management Program and $115 million related to our share of AmerisourceBergen's impairment of PharMEDium. In total, these adjustments account for more than 50% of the year-on-year decline. GAAP EPS declined 16.5% to $1.13 per share. 
Year-to-date sales increased 4.9%, including a currency headwind of 1.9%. On a constant currency basis, year-to-date sales were up 6.8%, reflecting 7.7% growth in Retail Pharmacy USA and 8% growth in Pharmaceutical Wholesale. 
Adjusted operating income declined 8.9% or 7.8% on a constant currency basis. This was more than offset by a 4.8 percentage point contribution from share repurchases and 3.2% from tax, contributing to an increase in adjusted EPS, which was up 1.6% on a constant currency basis. 
Now let's look at the performance of our divisions, starting with Retail Pharmacy USA. Sales increased 2.3% in the quarter mainly due to pharmacy brand inflation and pharmacy script growth. Organic sales increased 2.9%. 
Adjusted gross profit declined 3.9% and gross margin declined 140 basis points mostly due to pharmacy. Adjusted SG&A spend decreased 0.7%. And adjusted SG&A was 17.3% of sales, an improvement of 0.5 percentage points compared to the year ago quarter. 
Adjusted operating income declined 13.8% in the quarter; procurement savings, pharmacy script growth and continued SG&A savings were not enough to offset reimbursement pressure and the lower front of store sales. These results also included store and labor investments of $40 million in the quarter, equivalent to approximately 270 basis points of adjusted operating income. 
Now let's look in more detail at pharmacy. Total pharmacy sales increased 4.3%, reflecting higher brand inflation, prescription volume growth and a strong growth in central specialty, which grew 8.6% year-on-year. 
Comp pharmacy sales increased 6%, and comp prescriptions grew 4.7% in the quarter, a strong improvement on the first half growth of 1.9%. Market share was 21.2% in the quarter, down 50 basis points versus prior year due entirely to our store optimization program. 
Pharmacy gross profit declined versus prior year as script growth was more than offset by lower gross margin. Gross margin was around 150 basis points lower than last year due to continued reimbursement pressure, adverse mix associated with brand inflation and a 50 basis point impact due to the faster growing specialty business. These impacts were partially offset by procurement savings. The key to offsetting long-term reimbursement pressure is building scale, driving efficiency and creating a sizable health care services business. 
Turning next to our U.S. Retail business. Total retail sales decreased 2.9% and were negatively impacted by our store optimization program. Comp retail sales declined 1.1%, an improvement on the first half comp decline of 3.5%. Tobacco accounted for 150 basis points of the comp sales decline, but we did benefit from a 65 basis point tailwind as a result of the cough, cold and flu season. 
Retail gross profit declined mostly due to lower sales, which as I mentioned earlier, were negatively impacted by our store optimization program. Gross margin was down slightly by 20 basis points, an improving trend versus the second quarter as we rebalanced our promotional mix. We expect to see a continued improvement in gross margin trends in the fourth quarter. 
Turning next to Retail Pharmacy International. As usual, I'll talk to constant currency numbers. Total sales declined 1.6% mainly due to a 1% decline in Boots UK in a challenging market. Boots UK comp pharmacy sales increased 0.8%, reflecting prescription growth in the quarter. Whereas comp retail sales declined 2.6% as we continued to gain share in a weak market. 
Our beauty reinvention is now in place in 26 stores, and we remain on track to introduce 25 new brands in 2019. 
Adjusted operating income was down 10.5% due to weak retail sales and lower pharmacy margins in the U.K. Our U.K. pharmacy business was impacted by temporary industry-wide NHS underfunding and higher generic pricing. These impacts were only partially offset by prescription volume growth. We are taking actions to address our U.K. cost base, and I will cover these a little later. 
Turning now to the Pharmaceutical Wholesale division, which I'll also discuss in constant currency. The division delivered another strong quarter with sales up 8.3%, led by emerging markets. Our U.K. performance was aided in part by a customer contract change mentioned last quarter, which contributed 2.3% to revenue growth. Adjusted operating income increased 9.4%, reflecting strong gains in Turkey and solid results from our European business. 
Turning next to cash flow. Operating cash flow was $3.2 billion for the first 9 months of the year. Free cash flow was $2 billion. Operating cash flow was impacted by headwinds of around $1.4 billion. We are lapping a onetime prior year of working capital benefit of $502 million, cash tax payments are $395 million higher, mainly as a result of U.S. tax reform. This year includes legal settlements of $276 million. And we have $200 million of cash costs relating to the ongoing Rite Aid store optimization and integration and the transformational cost management program. 
Underlying working capital increased approximately $500 million primarily due to higher sales. Cash capital investment was $1.2 billion for the first 9 months, $264 million higher than the prior year. This was due mostly for the impact of the Rite Aid store conversions. 
Turning now to our Transformational Cost Management Program. We remain on target to deliver $1.5 billion in annual cost savings by fiscal 2022. Our smart spending benchmarking is complete, targets and execution plans are set up, and we're accelerating a wide-ranging program to reduce pharmacy cost to fill. A 20% head count reduction at our Boots UK headquarters and the reorganization of our U.S. field supervision structure are now complete. 
On digitalization, our Microsoft cloud migration is moving at pace. And we have now started working on optimizing our many IT vendors. Work has also began on building out compelling consumer-value propositions. Given the difficult market conditions in the U.K., we have completed the review of our store portfolio and have started a store optimization program that will impact around 200 locations over the course of the next 18 months. Many of these 200 stores are loss making, and approximately 2/3 of them are within walking distance of another Boots store. 
While the stores we plan to close represent around 8% of our store base, we expect the revenue impact will be around 1%. We do not expect a significant impact on colleagues as we plan to redeploy to nearby stores. 
We are also reviewing our real estate footprint in the U.S. and accelerating the pace of change, especially in our U.S. supply chain. More to follow in the coming months as we work through these key opportunities. 
Turning to guidance. As I mentioned earlier, the third quarter was slightly ahead of our expectations aided by some timing benefits. As a result, we are reaffirming our full year guidance, and we expect adjusted EPS to be roughly flat on a constant currency basis. 
As a reminder, last quarter we told you to expect a range of plus or minus 2%. Given the normal level of volatility in a business of this size, we feel this range is still appropriate. Let me just give you a couple of assumptions. 
As you update your models, you should now be building in $0.06 of negative currency impacts. And this is $0.02 worse than our prior guidance. We continue to project full year share repurchases of $3.8 billion, contributing 4.8 percentage points to adjusted EPS growth. And we now project a full year adjusted effective tax rate of around 15.5% compared to our earlier guidance of 16% to 17%. The lower rate reflects nonrecurring discrete benefits and changes to our geographic mix. 
When we provided our original fiscal '19 guidance, we highlighted incremental store and labor investments of around $150 million. As we accelerate the pace of our digital investments, we now expect total incremental spend of approximately $175 million with a significant portion of the additional spend coming in the fourth quarter. 
Let me finish by highlighting the change in revenue trends coming from Rite Aid. We saw positive revenue contributions from the Rite Aid acquisition in the first 2 quarters of the year. From this quarter on, Rite Aid is actually a headwind to reported revenue due to the ongoing store optimization program. 
I'll now hand you over to Alex, and he will update you on some of the business initiatives we have underway in the U.S."

During the quarter, we've continued to make progress on our 4 strategic priorities. Accelerating digitalization, transforming and restructuring our retail offering, creating a neighborhood health care destination around a more modern pharmacy, and rolling out our Transformational Cost Management program. 
We're also continuing to develop our omnichannel offering. Our Walgreens app has now been downloaded 57.3 million times, up 10.5% since last year. Around 26% of Walgreens retail refill scripts were initiated through digital channels in the quarter, up 18.4% since last year. And have also increased our active Balance Rewards' members to 90.2 million. 
In Retail, our leading beauty brands No7 performed exceptionally well in the quarter. In Walgreens sales of No7 were up by over 50%, helped by the launch and advertising of the No7 Laboratories Line Correcting Booster Serum, and our other retail partners saw significant growth. 
In addition to beauty, we're working on refreshing our own brand portfolio in Walgreens to drive sales and improve the customer value proposition. 
During the past 2 years, over 60% of the Walgreens own brand product portfolio has been relaunched or rebranded enhancing the customer offer through better value and quality to deliver improvements in sales and margin. This work is ongoing. Rite Aid is very much on track. Against our store optimization program, we have completed 631 of the planned 750 stores closures and we continue to see good customer retention. 
As to the many Walgreens own ready stores, 394 have been successfully converted to Walgreens, and we expect to complete the Rite Aid integration by the end of fiscal year 2020. 
We've taken further steps to develop our neighborhood health destinations, working with our partners including LabCorp and Humana, and as we announced during the quarter, VillageMD. With VillageMD, we will be opening 5 state-of-the-art primary care clinics in the Houston area by the end of the year, branded Village Medical at Walgreens. 
We also remain on track to open 125 LabCorp outlets in Walgreens stores this year. And finally on Kroger, the teams are working well together and so far the initial customer response has been positive. 
I'll now hand you back to Stefano."

So as you have heard, we have broadly delivered what we expected. But we have a lot of work ahead to get the business growing again. We have been working hard to initiate or accelerate the changes we need to keep us in line with or leadin",768,"Thank you, Alex. So as you have heard, we have broadly delivered what we expected. But we have a lot of work ahead to get the business growing again. We have been working hard to initiate or accelerate the changes we need to keep us in line with or leading the market. We are investing heavily in updating our systems and infrastructure, creating efficiencies and capabilities, which will give us scope for development for many years to come. 
We are developing new ways to engage with our customers, introducing new services and products through new channels. We are working with partners who bring us the skills, resources, scale and expertise that complement our own to accelerate our development, give us access to new thinking market and allow us to create significant new income streams. 
At the same time, we are continuing our focus on transforming our traditional areas of business to address the challenges of our core markets. Economic and reimbursement pressures have long been and remain a fact of life for us. Over the years, we have developed values at different levels to mitigate the impact of this pressure. 
In recent years, a major element of this mitigation has been improvement in generic procurement, made possible by changes in the global generics manufacturing sector, ongoing patent expiries and significant development in the actual procurement process, all of which have led to continued improvement in buying terms. These buying benefits have enabled us to compensate for the significant demand made on us by payers. 
As we have made clear, the level to which we can mitigate current and future reimbursement pressure toward generic procurement has reduced. Although, it will continue to be an important lever for many years to come. Recognizing this, we are accelerating other levers to mitigate the pressures. We have more to do to cost saving and efficiency, and we expect consistent savings well into the future. There is no doubt that over time we also have to build a range of services and service level that drive benefits for our payer partners.
We believe that the future of pharmacy is aligned to a wider range of health care services provided efficiently and conveniently in a community setting. This is why we are exploring partnerships with a wide range of innovative expert in various fields, allowing us to offer a better service more effectively and at a lower cost to [ ourselves ] than we would be able to do if we had set these services up on our own or paid a significant premium for them. Of course, many of the services are still being tested or are still in development. 
Let's be clear, however, while the number of partnership we are piloting has the potential to have a meaningful impact on our business, no single one of these will define or frame our future. In truth, it will be a combination of products and services working together in the convenience of a community pharmacy that will forward the basis of our future customer proposition. 
The mixture of products and services will inevitably bring together a range of complex and differentiated business models. Their economics will be, at least in part, based on changes to individual's health condition management and over all wellbeing over many years. 
The consequence of getting these services right has a huge potential benefit for us, for our partners and for our customers. But if we rush into them without truly understanding the operational or financial model, we run the risk of wasting an extraordinary amount of time, resources and more. We must be sure of what we are doing before we enter into these businesses in scale. 
Today, many people are looking at our company, indeed at our sector, focused on the immediate risk they perceive us to face. And I understand this, we're far from complacent about the pressures we face. However, we can see the inherent strength of our business. There is an ever-increasing demand for effective, efficient and convenient support for people to manage their health conditions, while leading productive and fulfilling lives in their local communities. 
The unique positioning of community pharmacy and our place in the sector gives us practical and financial scale, reach and strength. It gives us a robust platform on which to evolve and transform our company to meet the ever-changing needs of the markets we serve. And it gives us a fantastic foundation from which to deliver innovation, growth and value for our customers and our shareholders for many years to come.

And I would say that's around $0.03 or $35 million is our best estimate. And the other one is, [ whereas we ] also highlighted in the comments, we're ramping up the amount of spending in store and labor and now digital and development expense. So we've increased the spending on the full year by -- from $150 million to $175 million. There is about a $0.01 of that in the fourth quarter. So think about roughly around $50 million. Around $0.04-ish was it. And when you get to the 2 timing items, one was $0.02 of the $0.03, but essentially the timing of payer contracts when you do the compliance and [ true-up part of you ] hit outcomes or whether you hit volumes in certain tiers. And that's the normal course of business, but we had expected that in Q4. And then a $0.01 is coming from expense timing. We accelerated some real estate savings from Q4 into Q3. So it was actually one of the quieter quarters in terms of volatility and very few surprises. 
What's interesting here -- maybe I'll take the opportunity. As you start looking out into Q4, because this takes some income out of Q4, our Q4 target is actually quite -- when you start working through it, you start working out your estimates. Bear in mind, we had 2 large onetime items last year. And on an EPS basis, we're cycling through these. 
The first one is, you'll recall there was a large true-up, a curtailment benefit relating to retiree medical. That was $110 million. And then in the prior quarter of last year, we made an adjustment for legal costs, which was onetime and that was approximately $60 million. So that's another $0.05. 
So if you think about it, we have a 10 percentage point headwind on EPS in Q4. So we actually -- if you -- when you dissect Q4, we're looking forward to pretty good improving margin trends on the gross margin. And the headwind is all on the overheads and it's all due to onetime items in the prior year. 
So I think as you shift through it -- this -- the volatility in Q3 was actually quite low. When you get into Q4, think more that we have 2 large items last year. So actually when you analyze the result, the core performance is actually quite -- it's improving quite a bit. I hope that's helpful."

Not all of them, but some of the others are very like the Rite Aid optimization where it is -- think of it as a file by. So we've closed 2 stores close to each other in the U.K. And sometimes they're a 5-minute walking distance, and they're transferring over to scripts but you're taking out fixed cost structure.

One other thing, there is other dynamics in the quarter. So in the quarter we sold more branded, and the margin on branded is lower than it is on generic and that creates a mix impact as well. And that's as significant as any other impact. And the problem is, we can't project with accuracy, the individual mix in any single quarter. But if you take out a lot of these mix items, the core reimbursement net of procurement and other mitigations was actually a pretty solid quarter. We do expect some improvement in both retail and gross margin -- sorry, retail and pharmacy gross margins in Q4. That's as far as we're willing to go.

I think in particular, a couple of areas which are just interesting going forward. First of all, we are getting paid more for, I would say, value-based contracts, particularly in Medicare D. So we're starting to hit some of the performance targets, which is encouraging. And I think also we continue to have the opportunity to work differently in some networks. For example, again, I would point to the prime contract we did some time ago where we have a different approach to marketplace, where we're really much more transparent. And again, that process we believe is -- will become more I say -- I will say available to the market going forward than it has been in the past.

So as that goes through, we'll give more updates in terms of what that means in terms of projections. But we're encouraged by the progress there, but we're only halfway through it. 
I think secondly, we have just hired, as you saw quite recently, a very experienced global supply chain leader, Colin Nelson. And again, we're working hard with the team to really understand how to be even more focused on the new capabilities we're building in the business going forward. 
I think in terms of generics, as a Stefano said in his preprepared remarks, we continue to be very, very pleased with the performance of our WBAD office.

If you strip out new molecules, the most recent quarter had -- at least these are our numbers, they're not market numbers. We had -- we saw deflation of around 9%, right? So it's still up at a healthy clip and that will support continued savings in generic procurement. And this is -- the prior quarter was 9.4%. So it's still up there in a healthy high single digit. 
Then you -- the market builds in new molecules. I'm very excited about the supply chain piece going in the U.S. because we now have teams set up looking at shrink, so [ stock losses ]. Whether that's left in-store or at [ stock losses ] in warehouses. And we're using teams from Microsoft. So this shows the benefit of the bigger Microsoft agreement. 
They've put data scientists on this who are helping us build data links to understand what is going on and true causes of shrink and how to eliminate it. And these are $100 million, $200 million opportunities. And that's without getting into the working capital side of it. So I don't want that to be lost. 
Once we have SAP 4HANA in place across the 9,500 stores, that's stock fill visibility that we don't have today. Now we expect significant reductions in the level of inventory required to be held at store levels. So -- and -- but this is a lot

The U.K. government pay in a certain way, they -- I don't want to go into detail of it, but fundamentally, it's a market payment for all the pharmacies in the U.K. And if you go into what's called the PSNC website, there is more details there about how the -- how that works. 
So we are pretty convinced there's been underfunding in the last period. And of course, working within the pharmacy contractors and the PSNC, we're now debating that with the government in a positive way as a new contract's put in place. So that's what we referred to. And of course, we can't make any further comments until that negotiation is complete. 
But I think in terms of the overall performance of the Boots business, we are making good progress in terms of reinvigorating the Boots model in the U.K. in very difficult times. I don't have to tell you how difficult the marketplace is there. For example, this morning we opened a fantastic new store, a new concept store in Covent Garden, there was queues around the corner. And this is a health, wellness and beauty concept store, which will not only feed the future of Boots, but could also of course give us some great ideas for U.S. market as well. 
On top of that, we've done a lot of digitalization. We've digitalized the Advantage card, which is still the most popular card in the U.K. by some way in terms of beauty and treat cards and a lot of customers use it. I think it's well into 17 million holders today. 
We've also created digital pharmacy, we've launched that for the first time in the U.K. in terms of managing prescriptions, [ come up with ] some of the great ideas where we could pass it across from Walgreens as part of the merger. 
So -- and of course, the cost program, James already referred to in his remarks, in terms of moving money from maybe the older model into investing in the future of the Boots business. So that's a story really where we're using the current market situation to make sure that we're investing in our future. And we're seeing some interesting lead indicators of performance. And of course, we'll give you more updates as that develops."

I think I'll say what I said already and Stefano said it very clearly, we still have a very efficient, effective and innovative model out of WBAD, and we continue to work in a dimension, which we think is slightly different. We prefer to have contracts with manufacturers to give them certainty of supply so that we get certainty of supply back in the marketplace. That's really important to the customers and allows us to plan together in a different way and that's how we work. 
Having said that, we all know that the level of opportunities as Stefano has said is changing going forward. It's not we're not going to make savings, we will make savings, it's just changing. So we have setup some innovative partnerships already, the partnership we setup with Express Scripts, for example, is one where we're combining the volume from a PBM with the volume from a Retail Pharmacy. And we continue to look at other ways of making sure that we've got the right scale and mix of partners going into WBAD going forward. 
I think secondly, the manufacturers are thinking differently as well. And again, we can't talk on their behalf, but you've probably heard some of the things they have been saying. And we think that our approach to buying in partnership with them and the way that we organize how we work with them will continue to give us advantage into the future going forward. 
Of course, in the future other markets may open up. We don't know that in reality, and we're not banking on that particularly and how we see the plan going forward. But clearly, things will change in one direction and could change again. And having a global perspective and global volumes we think will give us global opportunities in the future as well."

I think secondly, you only have to look at the comments from other competitors in the marketplace to see the pressure that we are all feeling in the marketplace. The other side of the coin is that we continue to believe strongly that the community care in the pharmacy, the physical location in the community with the pharmacist available and accessible I know is a really great opportunity for not just pharmacy but for health care, all connected through data, all connected with other health care professionals, all connected to bringing forward new solutions going forward. That's why we are so excited about the work we're doing, not just with Microsoft but with as Stefano said, other relevant partners, for example, Verily, we've managed as well and LabCorp. And I can assure you, the list could go on in terms of the people who are talking to us and we are talking to them.

I think it's a little bit of everything you said actually because you have to go back on a journey. Q2 was reimbursement pressure, which we said I think was -- exceeded 30% of the full year reimbursement pressure. So we would've set an unprecedented level. We saw it go back to more a normalized level in Q3. But we saw some slowness on the procurement savings in Q3. 
We're going to see those -- both of the variables equalize in Q4. So it gets back to -- you can't really look at it as reimbursement, it's reimbursement net of the mitigation. The biggest 2 are, one is procurement savings, and there's been some tuning between Q3 and Q4 there. When you get to volume, I want to highlight, we had a great quarter in Q3. We set some fairly challenging goals internally. Bear in mind, we had script volume for the first half on a comp basis below 2%. So to come in, on the high 4s was something -- we needed to do it and we need those kind of numbers. That's number one. 
We're also very pleased with the way retail came in. If you strip it back a little bit, it's down 1.1. We were tracking in the first half of a pretty disappointing 3.5% comp store decline. But the change on change is quite impressive. We won't deliver exactly the same numbers, but we will continue to hold onto some of these trend improvements. 
I think what will happen in Q4 is, you will see a little bit this stabilization of the top line outlook together with some improvement in both businesses on the margin side. So it's a confluence of trends. And then I'll highlight again, then you've got these 2 big onetime items and overheads. 
So it's too early to call victory in Q4 obviously, but that's where our current expectation has improved gross margins and continued stabilization of scripts and the same-store sales and retail. I hope that helps you as you think through it."

After what was a very disappointing second quarter for us, it is pleasing to be able to report that this quarter has been brought in line with our expectations. That said, the pressures we have seen for sometimes continue to impact our businesses, and we still have a lot to do to deliver the transformation that will allow us to get ahead of the market trends again and return our company to strong and consistent growth. 
We were clear that the action we were undertaking to address the market changes take time, and the impact will, therefore, not fully be reflected in our financial performance until future financial years. But we have been working hard to accelerate our plans and program. 
I have repeatedly said that we have within our company the skills and the assets we need to address the challenges that we face as our markets evolve and transform. 
Last quarter, we told you that we would focus on accelerating the work we are doing to transform our company. We are doing that. The Transformational Cost Management Programs that we began early this year is one of the underlying foundations of the changes that we need to make. Most importantly, this program will help drive a structural change in the company, making us a more efficient, a more agile, and more responsible organization. 
It is expected to provide a significant portion of the funding required for our major technology upgrade and development investments. And of course, an element of it will help to give us a bridge in our financial performance as we restructure our businesses to better meet the needs of an ever more rapidly changing market. 
James and Alex will address some of these points as they talk you through the quarter, which I will ask them to do now. James?"
93624,618080564,1768180,"Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc., Q3 2019 Earnings Call, Jun 27, 2019",2019-06-27,"Earnings Calls","Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Stefano, and good morning, everyone. Third quarter adjusted EPS was $1.47, a constant currency decline of 2.4% versus prior year. The results were slightly ahead of our expectations and included some timing benefits from the fourth quarter. O",1655,"Thank you, Stefano, and good morning, everyone. Third quarter adjusted EPS was $1.47, a constant currency decline of 2.4% versus prior year. The results were slightly ahead of our expectations and included some timing benefits from the fourth quarter. 
Overall, we are tracking well against our strategic goals. We are quite encouraged by U.S. comp sales, which were exactly what we needed to deliver to stay on track to meet our full year expectations. And while it is still early days, our Transformational Cost Management Program is very much on track and accelerating. 
Based on our performance in the quarter, we are reaffirming our full year adjusted EPS guidance. We continue to expect the year to be roughly flat on a constant currency basis. 
Let's now look in more detail at the numbers. In the third quarter, sales increased 0.7%. On a constant currency basis, sales were up 2.9% mainly due to growth in Retail Pharmacy USA and the strong performance from our Pharmaceutical Wholesale division. 
Adjusted operating income declined 11.7% or 10.4% on a constant currency basis. This was mainly due to lower pharmacy margins and a decline in front-of-store sales in the U.S. and lower results in Boots UK.
Adjusted EPS declined 4% to $1.47, a decrease of 2.4% on a constant currency basis. This includes a 5.8 percentage point contribution from our share repurchase program. 
GAAP operating income declined 24.7%, including $86 million of expenses relating to the implementation of our Transformational Cost Management Program and $115 million related to our share of AmerisourceBergen's impairment of PharMEDium. In total, these adjustments account for more than 50% of the year-on-year decline. GAAP EPS declined 16.5% to $1.13 per share. 
Year-to-date sales increased 4.9%, including a currency headwind of 1.9%. On a constant currency basis, year-to-date sales were up 6.8%, reflecting 7.7% growth in Retail Pharmacy USA and 8% growth in Pharmaceutical Wholesale. 
Adjusted operating income declined 8.9% or 7.8% on a constant currency basis. This was more than offset by a 4.8 percentage point contribution from share repurchases and 3.2% from tax, contributing to an increase in adjusted EPS, which was up 1.6% on a constant currency basis. 
Now let's look at the performance of our divisions, starting with Retail Pharmacy USA. Sales increased 2.3% in the quarter mainly due to pharmacy brand inflation and pharmacy script growth. Organic sales increased 2.9%. 
Adjusted gross profit declined 3.9% and gross margin declined 140 basis points mostly due to pharmacy. Adjusted SG&A spend decreased 0.7%. And adjusted SG&A was 17.3% of sales, an improvement of 0.5 percentage points compared to the year ago quarter. 
Adjusted operating income declined 13.8% in the quarter; procurement savings, pharmacy script growth and continued SG&A savings were not enough to offset reimbursement pressure and the lower front of store sales. These results also included store and labor investments of $40 million in the quarter, equivalent to approximately 270 basis points of adjusted operating income. 
Now let's look in more detail at pharmacy. Total pharmacy sales increased 4.3%, reflecting higher brand inflation, prescription volume growth and a strong growth in central specialty, which grew 8.6% year-on-year. 
Comp pharmacy sales increased 6%, and comp prescriptions grew 4.7% in the quarter, a strong improvement on the first half growth of 1.9%. Market share was 21.2% in the quarter, down 50 basis points versus prior year due entirely to our store optimization program. 
Pharmacy gross profit declined versus prior year as script growth was more than offset by lower gross margin. Gross margin was around 150 basis points lower than last year due to continued reimbursement pressure, adverse mix associated with brand inflation and a 50 basis point impact due to the faster growing specialty business. These impacts were partially offset by procurement savings. The key to offsetting long-term reimbursement pressure is building scale, driving efficiency and creating a sizable health care services business. 
Turning next to our U.S. Retail business. Total retail sales decreased 2.9% and were negatively impacted by our store optimization program. Comp retail sales declined 1.1%, an improvement on the first half comp decline of 3.5%. Tobacco accounted for 150 basis points of the comp sales decline, but we did benefit from a 65 basis point tailwind as a result of the cough, cold and flu season. 
Retail gross profit declined mostly due to lower sales, which as I mentioned earlier, were negatively impacted by our store optimization program. Gross margin was down slightly by 20 basis points, an improving trend versus the second quarter as we rebalanced our promotional mix. We expect to see a continued improvement in gross margin trends in the fourth quarter. 
Turning next to Retail Pharmacy International. As usual, I'll talk to constant currency numbers. Total sales declined 1.6% mainly due to a 1% decline in Boots UK in a challenging market. Boots UK comp pharmacy sales increased 0.8%, reflecting prescription growth in the quarter. Whereas comp retail sales declined 2.6% as we continued to gain share in a weak market. 
Our beauty reinvention is now in place in 26 stores, and we remain on track to introduce 25 new brands in 2019. 
Adjusted operating income was down 10.5% due to weak retail sales and lower pharmacy margins in the U.K. Our U.K. pharmacy business was impacted by temporary industry-wide NHS underfunding and higher generic pricing. These impacts were only partially offset by prescription volume growth. We are taking actions to address our U.K. cost base, and I will cover these a little later. 
Turning now to the Pharmaceutical Wholesale division, which I'll also discuss in constant currency. The division delivered another strong quarter with sales up 8.3%, led by emerging markets. Our U.K. performance was aided in part by a customer contract change mentioned last quarter, which contributed 2.3% to revenue growth. Adjusted operating income increased 9.4%, reflecting strong gains in Turkey and solid results from our European business. 
Turning next to cash flow. Operating cash flow was $3.2 billion for the first 9 months of the year. Free cash flow was $2 billion. Operating cash flow was impacted by headwinds of around $1.4 billion. We are lapping a onetime prior year of working capital benefit of $502 million, cash tax payments are $395 million higher, mainly as a result of U.S. tax reform. This year includes legal settlements of $276 million. And we have $200 million of cash costs relating to the ongoing Rite Aid store optimization and integration and the transformational cost management program. 
Underlying working capital increased approximately $500 million primarily due to higher sales. Cash capital investment was $1.2 billion for the first 9 months, $264 million higher than the prior year. This was due mostly for the impact of the Rite Aid store conversions. 
Turning now to our Transformational Cost Management Program. We remain on target to deliver $1.5 billion in annual cost savings by fiscal 2022. Our smart spending benchmarking is complete, targets and execution plans are set up, and we're accelerating a wide-ranging program to reduce pharmacy cost to fill. A 20% head count reduction at our Boots UK headquarters and the reorganization of our U.S. field supervision structure are now complete. 
On digitalization, our Microsoft cloud migration is moving at pace. And we have now started working on optimizing our many IT vendors. Work has also began on building out compelling consumer-value propositions. Given the difficult market conditions in the U.K., we have completed the review of our store portfolio and have started a store optimization program that will impact around 200 locations over the course of the next 18 months. Many of these 200 stores are loss making, and approximately 2/3 of them are within walking distance of another Boots store. 
While the stores we plan to close represent around 8% of our store base, we expect the revenue impact will be around 1%. We do not expect a significant impact on colleagues as we plan to redeploy to nearby stores. 
We are also reviewing our real estate footprint in the U.S. and accelerating the pace of change, especially in our U.S. supply chain. More to follow in the coming months as we work through these key opportunities. 
Turning to guidance. As I mentioned earlier, the third quarter was slightly ahead of our expectations aided by some timing benefits. As a result, we are reaffirming our full year guidance, and we expect adjusted EPS to be roughly flat on a constant currency basis. 
As a reminder, last quarter we told you to expect a range of plus or minus 2%. Given the normal level of volatility in a business of this size, we feel this range is still appropriate. Let me just give you a couple of assumptions. 
As you update your models, you should now be building in $0.06 of negative currency impacts. And this is $0.02 worse than our prior guidance. We continue to project full year share repurchases of $3.8 billion, contributing 4.8 percentage points to adjusted EPS growth. And we now project a full year adjusted effective tax rate of around 15.5% compared to our earlier guidance of 16% to 17%. The lower rate reflects nonrecurring discrete benefits and changes to our geographic mix. 
When we provided our original fiscal '19 guidance, we highlighted incremental store and labor investments of around $150 million. As we accelerate the pace of our digital investments, we now expect total incremental spend of approximately $175 million with a significant portion of the additional spend coming in the fourth quarter. 
Let me finish by highlighting the change in revenue trends coming from Rite Aid. We saw positive revenue contributions from the Rite Aid acquisition in the first 2 quarters of the year. From this quarter on, Rite Aid is actually a headwind to reported revenue due to the ongoing store optimization program. 
I'll now hand you over to Alex, and he will update you on some of the business initiatives we have underway in the U.S."

During the quarter, we've continued to make progress on our 4 strategic priorities. Accelerating digitalization, transforming and restructuring our retail offering, creating a neighborhood health care destination around a more modern pharmacy, and rolling out our Transformational Cost Management program. 
We're also continuing to develop our omnichannel offering. Our Walgreens app has now been downloaded 57.3 million times, up 10.5% since last year. Around 26% of Walgreens retail refill scripts were initiated through digital channels in the quarter, up 18.4% since last year. And have also increased our active Balance Rewards' members to 90.2 million. 
In Retail, our leading beauty brands No7 performed exceptionally well in the quarter. In Walgreens sales of No7 were up by over 50%, helped by the launch and advertising of the No7 Laboratories Line Correcting Booster Serum, and our other retail partners saw significant growth. 
In addition to beauty, we're working on refreshing our own brand portfolio in Walgreens to drive sales and improve the customer value proposition. 
During the past 2 years, over 60% of the Walgreens own brand product portfolio has been relaunched or rebranded enhancing the customer offer through better value and quality to deliver improvements in sales and margin. This work is ongoing. Rite Aid is very much on track. Against our store optimization program, we have completed 631 of the planned 750 stores closures and we continue to see good customer retention. 
As to the many Walgreens own ready stores, 394 have been successfully converted to Walgreens, and we expect to complete the Rite Aid integration by the end of fiscal year 2020. 
We've taken further steps to develop our neighborhood health destinations, working with our partners including LabCorp and Humana, and as we announced during the quarter, VillageMD. With VillageMD, we will be opening 5 state-of-the-art primary care clinics in the Houston area by the end of the year, branded Village Medical at Walgreens. 
We also remain on track to open 125 LabCorp outlets in Walgreens stores this year. And finally on Kroger, the teams are working well together and so far the initial customer response has been positive. 
I'll now hand you back to Stefano."

So as you have heard, we have broadly delivered what we expected. But we have a lot of work ahead to get the business growing again.

But we have a lot of work ahead to get the business growing again. We have been working hard to initiate or accelerate the changes we need to keep us in line with or leading the market. We are investing heavily in updating our systems and infrastructure, creating efficiencies and capabilities, which will give us scope for development for many years to come. 
We are developing new ways to engage with our customers, introducing new services and products through new channels. We are working with partners who bring us the skills, resources, scale and expertise that complement our own to accelerate our development, give us access to new thinking market and allow us to create significant new income streams. 
At the same time, we are continuing our focus on transforming our traditional areas of business to address the challenges of our core markets. Economic and reimbursement pressures have long been and remain a fact of life for us. Over the years, we have developed values at different levels to mitigate the impact of this pressure. 
In recent years, a major element of this mitigation has been improvement in generic procurement, made possible by changes in the global generics manufacturing sector, ongoing patent expiries and significant development in the actual procurement process, all of which have led to continued improvement in buying terms. These buying benefits have enabled us to compensate for the significant demand made on us by payers. 
As we have made clear, the level to which we can mitigate current and future reimbursement pressure toward generic procurement has reduced. Although, it will continue to be an important lever for many years to come. Recognizing this, we are accelerating other levers to mitigate the pressures. We have more to do to cost saving and efficiency, and we expect consistent savings well into the future. There is no doubt that over time we also have to build a range of services and service level that drive benefits for our payer partners.
We believe that the future of pharmacy is aligned to a wider range of health care services provided efficiently and conveniently in a community setting. This is why we are exploring partnerships with a wide range of innovative expert in various fields, allowing us to offer a better service more effectively and at a lower cost to [ ourselves ] than we would be able to do if we had set these services up on our own or paid a significant premium for them. Of course, many of the services are still being tested or are still in development. 
Let's be clear, however, while the number of partnership we are piloting has the potential to have a meaningful impact on our business, no single one of these will define or frame our future. In truth, it will be a combination of products and services working together in the convenience of a community pharmacy that will forward the basis of our future customer proposition. 
The mixture of products and services will inevitably bring together a range of complex and differentiated business models. Their economics will be, at least in part, based on changes to individual's health condition management and overall wellbeing over many years. 
The consequence of getting these services right has a huge potential benefit for us, for our partners and for our customers. But if we rush into them without truly understanding the operational or financial model, we run the risk of wasting an extraordinary amount of time, resources and more. We must be sure of what we are doing before we enter into these businesses in scale. 
Today, many people are looking at our company, indeed at our sector, focused on the immediate risk they perceive us to face. And I understand this, we're far from complacent about the pressures we face. However, we can see the inherent strength of our business. There is an ever-increasing demand for effective, efficient and convenient support for people to manage their health conditions while leading productive and fulfilling lives in their local communities. 
The unique positioning of community pharmacy and our place in the sector gives us practical and financial scale, reach and strength. It gives us a robust platform on which to evolve and transform our company to meet the ever-changing needs of the markets we serve. And it gives us a fantastic foundation from which to deliver innovation, growth and value for our customers and our shareholders for many years to come.

And I would say that's around $0.03 or $35 million is our best estimate. And the other one is, [ whereas we ] also highlighted in the comments, we're ramping up the amount of spending in store and labor and now digital and development expense. So we've increased the spending on the full year by -- from $150 million to $175 million. There is about a $0.01 of that in the fourth quarter. So think about roughly around $50 million. Around $0.04-ish was it. And when you get to the 2 timing items, one was $0.02 of the $0.03, but essentially the timing of payer contracts when you do the compliance and [ true-up part of you ] hit outcomes or whether you hit volumes in certain tiers. And that's the normal course of business, but we had expected that in Q4. And then a $0.01 is coming from expense timing. We accelerated some real estate savings from Q4 into Q3. So it was actually one of the quieter quarters in terms of volatility and very few surprises. 
What's interesting here -- maybe I'll take the opportunity. As you start looking out into Q4, because this takes some income out of Q4, our Q4 target is actually quite -- when you start working through it, you start working out your estimates. Bear in mind, we had 2 large onetime items last year. And on an EPS basis, we're cycling through these. 
The first one is, you'll recall there was a large true-up, a curtailment benefit relating to retiree medical. That was $110 million. And then in the prior quarter of last year, we made an adjustment for legal costs, which was onetime and that was approximately $60 million. So that's another $0.05. 
So if you think about it, we have a 10 percentage point headwind on EPS in Q4. So we actually -- if you -- when you dissect Q4, we're looking forward to pretty good improving margin trends on the gross margin. And the headwind is all on the overheads and it's all due to onetime items in the prior year. 
So I think as you shift through it -- this -- the volatility in Q3 was actually quite low. When you get into Q4, think more that we have 2 large items last year. So actually when you analyze the result, the core performance is actually quite -- it's improving quite a bit. I hope that's helpful."

We just recently confirmed the 200 stores in the U.K., and moving -- we'll move ahead aggressively on that. And it's quite interesting as you go through it, about 60% of the stores in the U.K. that we're closing lose money. Not all of them, but some of the others are very like the Rite Aid optimization where it is -- think of it as a file by. So we've closed 2 stores close to each other in the U.K. And sometimes they're a 5-minute walking distance, and they're transferring over to scripts but you're taking out fixed cost structure. 
So the calculations are quite complex. It's -- you have to assess, are you leaving a trading area, which we generally don't like to do. We want to preserve our presence both in the U.K. and in the U.S. And I would highlight that in the U.K., we highlighted in the comments we're reducing the store count by 8%. The impact on revenue is around 1%. So I don't want to call it rounding. But it has no strategic impact on our ability to maintain our strength of our position in the U.K. I would actually argue on the contrary. It makes us even stronger because we're a profitable operator in the U.K. market."

I think the -- we cycle through the FEP contracts, the specialty business growing at 8.6%, we would expect it always to grow at faster than the core business. So it will always be somewhat dilutive to margins. 
One other thing, there is other dynamics in the quarter. So in the quarter we sold more branded, and the margin on branded is lower than it is on generic and that creates a mix impact as well. And that's as significant as any other impact. And the problem is, we can't project with accuracy, the individual mix in any single quarter. But if you take out a lot of these mix items, the core reimbursement net of procurement and other mitigations was actually a pretty solid quarter. We do expect some improvement in both retail and gross margin -- sorry, retail and pharmacy gross margins in Q4. That's as far as we're willing to go. So this is not something you should take and extrapolate out as 150 basis points on pharmacy. We do expect some improvements in the trend in Q4.

And as James has just said, we are seeing the ability to compensate more in Q4 than Q3 as the trends come through. 
I think in particular, a couple of areas which are just interesting going forward. First of all, we are getting paid more for, I would say, value-based contracts, particularly in Medicare D. So we're starting to hit some of the performance targets, which is encouraging. And I think also we continue to have the opportunity to work differently in some networks. For example, again, I would point to the prime contract we did some time ago where we have a different approach to marketplace, where we're really much more transparent. And again, that process we believe is -- will become more I say -- I will say available to the market going forward than it has been in the past. 
So it's a -- reimbursement doesn't go away, the margin is under pressure as we've often said. But we continue to be innovative, we work creatively, and we work hard on new levers as well as the old levers that we've spoken about a lot."

So it's still up at a healthy clip and that will support continued savings in generic procurement. And this is -- the prior quarter was 9.4%. So it's still up there in a healthy high single digit. 
Then you -- the market builds in new molecules. I'm very excited about the supply chain piece going in the U.S. because we now have teams set up looking at shrink, so [ stock losses ]. Whether that's left in-store or at [ stock losses ] in warehouses. And we're using teams from Microsoft. So this shows the benefit of the bigger Microsoft agreement. 
They've put data scientists on this who are helping us build data links to understand what is going on and true causes of shrink and how to eliminate it. And these are $100 million, $200 million opportunities. And that's without getting into the working capital side of it. So I don't want that to be lost. 
Once we have SAP 4HANA in place across the 9,500 stores, that's stock fill visibility that we don't have today. Now we expect significant reductions in the level of inventory required to be held at store levels. So -- and -- but this is a lot

The U.K. government pay in a certain way, they -- I don't want to go into detail of it, but fundamentally, it's a market payment for all the pharmacies in the U.K. And if you go into what's called the PSNC website, there is more details there about how the -- how that works. 
So we are pretty convinced there's been underfunding in the last period. And of course, working within the pharmacy contractors and the PSNC, we're now debating that with the government in a positive way as a new contract's put in place. So that's what we referred to. And of course, we can't make any further comments until that negotiation is complete. 
But I think in terms of the overall performance of the Boots business, we are making good progress in terms of reinvigorating the Boots model in the U.K. in very difficult times. I don't have to tell you how difficult the marketplace is there. For example, this morning we opened a fantastic new store, a new concept store in Covent Garden, there was queues around the corner. And this is a health, wellness and beauty concept store, which will not only feed the future of Boots but could also of course give us some great ideas for U.S. market as well. 
On top of that, we've done a lot of digitalization. We've digitalized the Advantage card, which is still the most popular card in the U.K. by some way in terms of beauty and treat cards and a lot of customers use it. I think it's well into 17 million holders today. 
We've also created digital pharmacy, we've launched that for the first time in the U.K. in terms of managing prescriptions, [ come up with ] some of the great ideas where we could pass it across from Walgreens as part of the merger. 
So -- and of course, the cost program, James already referred to in his remarks, in terms of moving money from maybe the older model into investing in the future of the Boots business. So that's a story really where we're using the current market situation to make sure that we're investing in our future. And we're seeing some interesting lead indicators of performance. And of course, we'll give you more updates as that develops."

That's really important to the customers and allows us to plan together in a different way and that's how we work. 
Having said that, we all know that the level of opportunities as Stefano has said is changing going forward. It's not we're not going to make savings, we will make savings, it's just changing. So we have set up some innovative partnerships already, the partnership we set up with Express Scripts, for example, is one where we're combining the volume from a PBM with the volume from a Retail Pharmacy.

And I was kind of curious, are you starting to see that total number come down? And I guess my question is can the reimbursement pressure subside until some of the capacity comes out of the market?"

The way that we measure the market, internally, we are starting to see some pharmacies close, and I think these numbers are pretty open in the marketplace as well. So that is starting to happen and not reopen. And so I think that is a fact, you can check it obviously out there. 
I think secondly, you only have to look at the comments from other competitors in the marketplace to see the pressure that we are all feeling in the marketplace. The other side of the coin is that we continue to believe strongly that the community care in the pharmacy, the physical location in the community with the pharmacist available and accessible I know is a really great opportunity for not just pharmacy but for health care, all connected through data, all connected with other health care professionals, all connected to bringing forward new solutions going forward. That's why we are so excited about the work we're doing, not just with Microsoft but with as Stefano said, other relevant partners, for example, Verily, we've managed as well and LabCorp. And I can assure you, the list could go on in terms of the people who are talking to us and we are talking to them. 
So we are really confident about the future of pharmacy. We're really confident that the model that we see today will change driven by new technologies and the same need that customers and patients have always had, which is to have a conversation with their local pharmacist in their local community."

I think it's a little bit of everything you said actually because you have to go back on a journey. Q2 was reimbursement pressure, which we said I think was -- exceeded 30% of the full year reimbursement pressure. So we would've set an unprecedented level. We saw it go back to more a normalized level in Q3. But we saw some slowness on the procurement savings in Q3. 
We're going to see those -- both of the variables equalize in Q4. So it gets back to -- you can't really look at it as reimbursement, it's reimbursement net of the mitigation. The biggest 2 are, one is procurement savings, and there's been some tuning between Q3 and Q4 there. When you get to volume, I want to highlight, we had a great quarter in Q3. We set some fairly challenging goals internally. Bear in mind, we had script volume for the first half on a comp basis below 2%. So to come in, on the high 4s was something -- we needed to do it and we need those kind of numbers. That's number one. 
We're also very pleased with the way retail came in. If you strip it back a little bit, it's down 1.1. We were tracking in the first half of a pretty disappointing 3.5% comp store decline. But the change on change is quite impressive. We won't deliver exactly the same numbers, but we will continue to hold onto some of these trend improvements. 
I think what will happen in Q4 is, you will see a little bit this stabilization of the top line outlook together with some improvement in both businesses on the margin side. So it's a confluence of trends. And then I'll highlight again, then you've got these 2 big onetime items and overheads. 
So it's too early to call victory in Q4 obviously, but that's where our current expectation has improved gross margins and continued stabilization of scripts and the same-store sales and retail. I hope that helps you as you think through it."

Today, I'm pleased to report that we delivered quarterly results broadly in line with our expectation. In doing so, we closed our financial year roughly flat year-on-year, which is, again, in line with expectations we set in April. That said, it has not been an easy task for us to recover from a very difficult second quarter and there has been a lot of hard work done by our team to deliver these results over the past 2 quarters. We have continued to make progress against our 4 strategic priorities: Accelerating the digitalization of our company in terms of the way we use technology, to help us run our businesses more efficiently and effectively, and more importantly, to [ announce ] and transform the products and services that we offer our patients and customers and in the way we deliver those services. 
Transforming and restructuring our retail offering, making sure we provide our customers what they want, in the way they want. And using the strength of our extraordinary local presence as an asset to support and reach a modern multichannel, tailored and far more focused, responsive and interactive retail experience. And creating within our store a network of the health care destination backed by our digital investments, providing both services and support. This will announce our whole as a provider of health care to the communities we serve and highly effective and efficient resource of patients and payers alike. 
And of course, to support all of these and to deliver the changes we need to structure our company in a market that constantly demands evermore responsiveness and efficiency, we are delivering on our Transformational Cost Management Program. It is important to make that point. This is about transformation for us, both driving out cost and reinvesting in the business, to help fund investments that we need to make to deliver our strategic priorities. 
This program is truly about savings, to invest for growth. Our teams have worked hard on the development of this strategy and our work just resulted on their delivery. 
We have identified an excellent group of partners that bring our skills, experience and resources to deliver our goal better, more effectively and more efficiently then we could do alone. We are transforming not just our businesses, but our business model to deliver future growth. We have been very clear in our current expectations for the financial year ahead. James will cover them in detail as part of this financial review. 
Looking forward to 2020, we expect adjusted earning pressure to be roughly flat on a constant-currency basis. 
Excluding the impact of the 2019 bonus headwind, we would expect mid-single-digit adjusted earning per share growth. And looking forward, we see a clear line to sustainable, profitable growth, driven by the work we are doing and the investments we're making. 
I will now hand over to James and Alex to take you through today's earnings an update, and we'll come back to take your questions at the end. James?"

Today's results are broad in line with our expectations. Adjusted EPS was $1.43 in the fourth quarter, 2.9% lower than the prior year on a constant-currency basis. Fiscal year adjusted EPS was $5.99, up 0.5%",1140,"Thank you, Stefano, and good morning, everyone. Today's results are broad in line with our expectations. Adjusted EPS was $1.43 in the fourth quarter, 2.9% lower than the prior year on a constant-currency basis. Fiscal year adjusted EPS was $5.99, up 0.5% in constant currencies and in line with our guidance. We are encourage by improved U.S. comparable sales and adjusted gross profit margin performance in the second half of the year. 
Retail Pharmacy International continued to be impacted by a challenging U.K. market, whereas, the Pharmaceutical Wholesale division delivered another strong performance. Our Transformational Cost Management Program is very much on track and with rising visibility on cost savings, we are raising our annual savings target to at least $1.8 billion by fiscal 2022. 
Let's now look in more detail at the full year results. Full year sales increased 4.1% versus prior year. On a constant-currency basis, sales growth was 5.8%, reflecting good performance from both Retail Pharmacy U.S.A. and Pharmaceutical Wholesale. Adjusted operating income declined 9.6% or 8.6% on a constant-currency basis, mainly due to Retail Pharmacy U.S.A. and Boots U.K. partially offset by Pharmaceutical Wholesale. 
Adjusted EPS was $5.99, up 0.5% on a constant-currency basis. Share repurchases contributed 4.9 percentage points with tax adding 4.1 percentage points. These were partially offset by the 3.6 percentage points of adjusted EPS headwinds that are shown on the slide. GAAP operating income declined 20.5% including $477 million of expenses relating to the implementation of our Transformational Cost Management Program and as we mentioned last quarter, $114 million relating to our share of AmerisourceBergen's impairment of pharMEDium. 
In total, these 2 adjustments account for almost 50% of the year-on-year decline. 
In the fourth quarter, sales were up 2.6% on a constant-currency basis, reflecting solid growth in our Retail Pharmacy U.S.A. division and a strong performance in Pharmaceutical Wholesale. Adjusted operating income declined 11.9% or 11.1% on a constant-currency basis. Adjusted EPS was $1.43. The constant-currency decline of 2.9%. 5% of growth came from our share repurchase program and another 7% from tax. However, these were entirely offset by over 12 percentage points of headwinds as we increased investments and we lapped onetime benefits in the fourth quarter of 2018, including a postretirement curtailment gain and a previously disclosed adjustment to legal accruals and settlements. 
GAAP EPS declined 51.4% to $0.75 per share. Just over half this decline was due to 2 factors: A prior-year gain on the sale of Premise Health; and the implementation of our Transformational Cost Management Program. 
Now let's move to Retail Pharmacy U.S.A. Sales increased 2.1% in the fourth quarter reflecting 4.2% growth in pharmacy. Full year sales advanced 6.2%, reflecting the acquired Rite Aid stores and organic sales growth of 3%. Adjusted gross profit declined 1.1% in the quarter with a decline in retail partially offset by higher pharmacy gross profit. Adjusted SG&A spending increased 2.1% in the quarter, entirely due to higher investments and the prior year onetime adjustment associated with previously disclosed legal accruals and settlements. Adjusted operating income declined 12.2% in the quarter and 9.6% full year. The quarter was held back by 9.4 percentage points of headwinds from higher investments and a onetime benefit in the prior year. Excluding these factors, the decline was low single-digit. 
Now let's look in more detail at pharmacy. Total pharmacy sales increased 4.2% in the quarter and 8.6% for the year. Growth in the quarter reflected higher brand inflation and prescription volume growth along with growth in central specialty, which grew 7.8% in the quarter and over 20% for the year. Comp pharmacy sales increased 5.4% in the quarter and 4% for the year. Comp prescriptions grew 3.3% in the quarter and 3% for the year. The trend is improving with comp scripts up 4% in the second half versus 1.9% in the first half. 
As you will recall, we had some network headwinds in the first half, which we've now lapped. 
Market share was 21% in the quarter, down 55 basis points versus prior year, mainly due to the store optimization program. For the full year, market share increased 35 basis points to 21.3%. Pharmacy-adjusted gross profit increased in the quarter with script growth and procurement savings helping to mitigate reimbursement pressure. 
For the full year, pharmacy-adjusted gross profit was down slightly. Fourth quarter adjusted gross margin was 65 basis points lower than last year including a 40 basis point mix impact from specialty. 
Turning next to our U.S. Retail business. Total retail sales decline 3.9% in the quarter impacted by store optimization. Comp retail sales declined 1.2% and excluding tobacco, comp sales were up 0.5%. 
Full year comp sales declined 2.4% with 1.6 percentage points due to tobacco. 
Looking at the second half versus the first half. Second half comp sales were down 1.1% compared with a decline of 3.5% in the first half. Retail-adjusted gross profit declined in the quarter, mostly due to lower reported sales, which were negatively impacted by our store optimization program. 
We did say last quarter that we expected to see improved retail-adjusted gross margin in the fourth quarter and I'm pleased to report that adjusted gross margin increased 35 basis points. 
Full year adjusted gross margin was down 20 basis points as we adjusted promotional spend in the earlier part of the year. 
Turning next to Retail Pharmacy International and as usual, I'll talk to constant-currency numbers. Boots U.K. comp pharmacy sales declined 2% in the quarter and 1.6% in the year, reflecting lower script volume and a lower NHS funding level due to timing shift between years. 
Boots U.K. comp retail sales declined 3.1% in the quarter and 2.6% in the year as of the U.K. market continued to be very challenging. However, we held share in a declining U.K. market with good share performance in Beauty. 
Adjusted operating income was down 20.7% in the quarter and down 16.2% in the year, mainly due to weak retail sales and pressure on retail and pharmacy margins in the U.K. 
Turning now to the Pharmaceutical Wholesale division, which I'll also discuss in constant-currency. Our Pharmaceutical Wholesale division delivered another strong quarter with sales up 7.9%, led by emerging markets and the U.K. In part, our U.K. performance was aided by a customer contract change, which contributed 2.3% of revenue growth. Fourth quarter adjusted operating income increased 6.9% reflecting strong revenue performance and higher earnings from AmerisourceBergen. Full year sales increased 8% and adjusted operating income increased 5.9% versus prior year. 
Turning next the cash flow. Full year operating cash flow was $5.6 billion and free cash flow was $3.9 billion. Our free cash flow was impacted by some fairly large exceptional items and we have covered these on previous calls. 
Excluding these exceptional items, our 2019 free cash flow was around $5.2 billion. 
I'll now hand over to Alex."

I'm going to update you on our initiatives in the U.K. and the U.S., starting with Boots U.K. 
Last quarter, we talked about a number of initiatives to transform our retail offering, develop healthier services and accelerate digitalization in the U.K. We've introduced new beauty hauls in 26 key locations, planning to open flagship trends stores in Covent Garden, London, and more recently, in [indiscernible], Sheffield. 
We're also encouraged by our new brand introductions. 18 new beauty brands were introduced to key stores in the year and a further 17 in September. We're developing [indiscernible] in digital health care with plans for expanding pharmacy services to improve the customer journey and broaden access to health care. We'll register online pharmacy in May 2019, which expanded to includes repeat prescriptions. 
We've digitalized the Boots Advantage Card with [indiscernible] across our all our main customer platforms.  
And importantly, boots.com performed well with sales [ up 14.4% ] in the year and 18.4% in the fourth quarter. 
As James mentioned, we continue to take actions to address our U.K. cost base. In February, we announced our intention to reduce Boots' head office cost by 20%. This program has now been completed and the savings will come through in fiscal year 2020. 
In June, we announced a store optimization program that will impact around 200 Boots locations. We reduced the store count by 18 stores by the end of the fiscal year and are on track to consolidate the remainder by the end of 2020. 
We have also generated cost reductions through simplification of care home operations and the supply chain. 
Turning now to our strategic initiatives in the U.S. We've made significant progress on our 4 strategic priorities during the year. Let me start with a retail offering, where we focus on delivering health, wellness, beauty and convenience both in-store and online. We remain very pleased about our strategic partnership with Kroger. 
In August, we announced expansion of a store pilot to new test locations in Knoxville, Tennessee. The Kroger Express Concept will be available in 50 Walgreens stores under our own health and beauty brands will be available to customers in 17 Kroger stores. 
We're extending our nationwide offering with FedEx, a new customer return system is being introduced to Walgreens stores before the holiday season, giving customers an easier return-on-service for unwanted goods for Walgreens and other selected retailers. We continue to look for solutions for the last mile, building on our presence in the community. We have recently announced our first of a kind partnership with the Wing to test on demand drawing delivery. Joining up with every previously announced trial with FedEx for robot delivery. 
We continued to make progress in health and beauty. We have seen strong progress in the U.S. with No7 skincare and the expanded description of No7 skin care in Walgreens in the months ahead. 
And last month, we launched a stand-alone No7 website, No7beauty.com, alongside a national U.S. TV campaign. 
Turning next to health care. We're strongly focused on creating neighborhood health destinations around the more modern pharmacy. We've made significant steps during the year to develop our primary care business. Our model is based on physicians and clinical pharmacists and we'll have prime kit locations in 4 markets across the U.S., working partnership with Partners in Primary Care, VillageMD and Southwest Medical, and Optimum Company. 
We also plan to develop a new wellness partnership in our stores, and I'm delighted to see that we recently signed a new agreement with Jenny Craig for health and weight loss management company to open centers around 100 Walgreens locations by early 2020. 
We have interviewing our [indiscernible] clinic model and have taken a decision to exit our wholly-owned loss-making clinics but we will continue to walk with a local health system partners who are running successful clinics in 217 Walgreens locations. We now have a network of 15 partners and we recently signed a new agreement with [ Trihealth ] to add a further 7 clinics. 
Our collaboration with LabCorp is well on track. We're aiming to open at least 600 LabCorp patient centers across the U.S, providing diagnostic lab testing in the community. We opened 21 centers in the fourth quarter, taking the total to 58. We've also expanded our reach in specialty, making an equity investment in specialty provider, shields health solutions. We are an important partner for peers, anchored by national network of local community pharmacies and we continue to drive better clinical outcomes through patient medication adherence programs, such as Save a Trip Refills, which we've already has over 2.7 million patients signed up as we aim to lower the cost of care. 
As you've seen, we've announced a strategic partnership with Centene, a leading Medicaid insurer, and RXAdvance, the cloud-based pharmacy benefit manager. 
And we recently signed a multiyear Medicare agreement with United Health Care, including a new co-branded Medicare advantage plan with Walgreens being the only preferred Retail Pharmacy. 
Turning next to digitalization. Our partnership with Microsoft signed in January is essential to driving a technology strategy and the cloud migration program is on plan. We've expanded the fine care platform available on Walgreens.com to include new strategic partners and offerings and has now 30 health care in and over 40 services. 
And we're making good progress in our existing omni-channel business. Our Walgreens app has been downloaded 58.9 million times, up 11.8% since last year and around 26% of Walgreens retail refill scripts were initiated through digital channels in the quarter, up 14% since last year. And we also have increased our active balance awards to members to 89.7 million. 
Finally, we're also really pleased to report that Walgreens digitally-initiated sales reached over $15 billion in the year, up around 25% on last year. 
Now back to James."

I'll now update you our on transformational Cost Management Program while we're making strong progress. In April, we announced we were targeting annual cost savings in excess of $1.5 billion by fiscal 2022. We now have a clear line of sight to multiple cost savings initiatives over a multiyear period, and this gives us the confidence to increase our target. 
We're now raising the annual cost savings target to: In excess of $1.8 billion by fiscal 2022. 
Additionally, we're rolling working capital programs into the cost management program governance and we see meaningful opportunity to reduce working capital investments over the coming years. 
Regarding implementation cost, our estimates are unchanged versus the 8-K we filed on August 6. We continue to estimate that the program will result in cumulative GAAP pretax charges of approximately $1.9 billion to $2.4 billion and we recently re-branded the cost management program internally. It's now called Save to Invest to Grow. 
This emphasizes that we must not only reduce cost to become the leanest operator, but we must also save more to generate the investment dollars needed to fuel long-term capabilities and growth. 
Let me give you a quick update on some of the actions taken in the quarter. On Smart Spend, we've started making policy changes. For example, we're changing how we manage external consultants, mandating competitive bidding and making the contracts more outcome-based. 
On smart organization, last week, we made select reductions in the U.S. support office and additional restructuring is underway in our Retail Pharmacy International and Pharmaceutical Wholesale divisions. We are also working hard to define our new vision and road map for business services. We have completed the review of our real estate footprint and the actions are well underway in both the U.S. and the U.K. and dedicated teams are working hard against our biggest programs, particularly pharmacy cost to fill and shrink. 
We've reorganized our global, digital and IT leadership under a new Chief Information Officer to improve execution and focus. 
We've also defined a new operating model for our day-to-day IT operations. And we've refocused our IT and digital spent to our growth priorities. 
Now let's turn to 2020. Let me start by providing some key assumptions for the upcoming year. We are projecting a full year adjusted effective tax rate of around 17% and this may vary depending on the level of discrete items in the year. This will reduce adjusted EPS growth by approximately 2 percentage points as we lap an exceptionally low tax rate in fiscal 2019. We anticipate full year share repurchases of $1.75 billion. While this is lower than the $3.8 billion of repurchases in fiscal 2019, it is entirely consistent with our prior indications. Share repurchases should contribute around 3.5% to adjusted EPS growth. 
Within the guidance, we are investing heavily to transform WBA, including modernizing and upgrading our core foundational and pharmacy systems and implementing SAP in the U.S. 
We're also investing in new digital capabilities and we have fully funded multiple the pilots that are ongoing across health care and retail. 
In fiscal year '20, we expect to invest $800 million to $850 million, an increase of $250 million to $300 million over the prior year. 
In terms of operating expenses, we expect to invest $300 million to $350 million in 2020, a year-on-year increase of $100 million to $150 million. 
Looking specifically at capital expenditures. We anticipate investing around $500 million in fiscal 2020, and this comes on top of $350 million in fiscal '19. 
In summary, we are investing strategically to modernize and transform our capabilities to drive future growth. Finally, while we don't provide currency guidance, we have provided our internal currency rates in the appendix. As you will see, these assumptions are quite dated and at that time, suggest that we could face a negative year-on-year currency impact of around $0.05. 
The only thing we can be sure of is that we can expect the situation in the U.K. to remain fluid. The pound/dollar rate has moved quite a bit and external estimates range from $1.14 to $1.35. 
Turning now to adjusted EPS guidance for 2020. We are projecting constant-currency adjusted EPS growth to be flat and for a business of our size, you should expect a range of plus or minus 3%. 
As you work through your models, please note that year-on-year adjusted EPS growth is negatively impacted by a lower bonus payout in 2019 and this is a headwind of 6.5%. 
As we look at adjusted EPS phasing for fiscal year 2020, we expect a balanced performance between the first half and the second half with potentially a slightly stronger second half. 
Let me now summarize the projected key drivers of adjusted EPS. The lower 2019 fiscal bonus payout leads to a headwind of 6.5%. Obviously, this year-on-year impact will negatively impact both SG&A expense and adjusted operating income. 
The higher tax rate has an impact of approximately 2%. On the other hand, our share repurchase program should generate a favorable tailwind of around 3.5%. Excluding these headwinds and tailwinds, we would expect operational growth of around 5%. 
Within this 5% number, we are funding the incremental investments I mentioned earlier of around 2% and an approximate 1 percentage point impact from removing e-cigarettes from our stores. 
I will now hand your back to Stefano for his closing comments."

As you've heard, we anticipate a reasonable underlying operating performance for the coming year with solid underlying growth in most of our core businesses. This is very much in line with what we told you some months ago. The action that we have taken to transform our businesses and the drive and focus with which our team are pursuing our strategic priorities gives me confidence in our ability to deliver this goal. I strongly believe in an expanded role of a pharmacy and in our company's ability to play a significant part in shaping our health care is delivered in the community going forward. I remain convinced that we have, in our company, through our partnerships, an extraordinary foundation on which to build. The work currently underway on innovation and transformation across all our businesses. We mean we can and will continue to deliver real value for our customers and investors for many years to come.

I guess, can you walk through some of the components of that may be a little bit on how the company's thinking about volume growth, I think particularly reimbursement is going to be a big question in 2020. So I guess, from a fundamental perspective, is that how you see the business? Kind of what are the building blocks for growth for 2020?"
93624,637706108,1842176,"Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2019",2019-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.","Executives","Yes. So that's a good question. So we did call out the operating performance. Once you take out the headwind coming from the prior year bonus of around 5%. And within as well, we're also covering 2 percentage points of growth investments. So you're gettin",482,"Yes. So that's a good question. So we did call out the operating performance. Once you take out the headwind coming from the prior year bonus of around 5%. And within as well, we're also covering 2 percentage points of growth investments. So you're getting closer to a 7%. And then we removed e-cigarettes. So you could -- actually, if you strip out, these are all the puts and takes we've laid out on Slide 19. 
So the way I think you should think about this is, we expect relative stability in the wholesale business. So you've seen the very strong performance in the current year. And I'd be calling on a -- something mid-single-digit revenue growth. And then I think as you look at the RPI segment, you'd be looking at probably flat to declining revenue. Until we see slight line of sight to improve market circumstances in the U.K. and that's the only question mark we have on the segment. 
And then in the U.S., I think this year, the way you should rationalize the U.S. is this year, we had a contribution coming from Rite Aid. You kind of remove the contribution, I think we're looking forward to pretty strong script growth is our outlook. 
And then secondly, we see continued recovery in the retail business. So we had a very strong exit on retail compared with the first half. The same in pharmacy. We saw a strong recovery on scripts second half, first half. We expect to see a continued of the improved trend. So what that would lead to a low single-digit revenue of the U.S. business. So I think if you look at a total company, we're looking at something in the low single digit, revenue growth may be 2%, maybe 3%. 
So take out Rite Aid this year and your get pretty close at the same kind a number. The way we thought about reimbursement is we've plan reimbursement slightly higher than the last 3-year average and we expect 2020 could be a -- continued tough year on reimbursement and we plan relatively conservatively higher than the last 3-year average and we're not giving any more information on that. 
And then you've seen with the call about the cost management program. That should give you the confidence that we will have significant leverage on the cost side to -- so a combination of the solid revenue growth, plus generic procurement savings continuing at a similar level plus a cost program that is really ramping up and gaining pace, gives us the comfort that we get to this mid-single-digit kind of range before the bonus impact. 
And I'm forgetting a lot of insights in here of how we talk through this. So reimbursement, a little bit higher than the past but a much stronger cost program that give us the confidence to deliver this best case."

And you know the circumstances of the company and it's -- if you think about -- if you save on a growth space, you're going to offset your inflation. For a company this size, you work it out. It's probably $250 million. Then if you're growing your scripts 3%, 4%, 5%, that's another $100 million of incremental cost because you have a incremental cost impact every time you fill in new scripts. So you can be quite easily before you start the year -- you're facing a $400 million headwind. So that's the first part.  How do you offset inflation and how do you offset the impact of volume growth? 
The second one, it seems seen we've taken a very strong stance on the investments and I don't want that message to be lost. We're heading the previously indicated guidance range with substantially higher investments and that's what the cost program is helping us deliver. So we quite hopefully, put in the magnitude of the investments we're actually spending this year. It somewhat gets back to the age of some of the systems we have in the company, where 40% of that investment we have year-on-year is going on new pharmacy systems [in the U.S. and U.K. the and implementation of SAP in the U.S. We will be able to take out an enormous amount of inventory over the next 3 years as we implement these systems [indiscernible]. So these systems pay for themselves. 
The second -- the next, call it third, is on new digital capabilities and then the final piece is, every time we do a pilot, and the pilots are starting to scale up. We have 50 plus 70-- 67 just on Kroger. It costs quite a bit of money to reorganize the stores and try all these pilots. These are all fully funded. 
So that's the -- long answer to your short question was the overhead was to pay for inflation. It's the dramatic step change in the investment profile of the company to drive sustainable, long-term growth. That's the business we're in. We have to drive growth longer-term. And then finally, as part of the business model where reimbursement is offset by general procurement savings, volume and SG&A on a cost discipline."

Our point on the scripts is if you take the second half versus first half, the scripts are now running at second half, 4%. And we have, as you know, a very weak first half. We were up 1.9% and that's because we were lapping these, call it network changes, where we lost 2 points in the previous 12 months. 
And then as you look at the investment profile, I guess, that's the upside scenario. We are quite conservative, we built in the cost of executing the initiatives. We do have working capital benefits built in our internal plans, are quite sizable. So we do expect returns on this current year on cash flow. 
On the pilots themselves, we're not counting on significant flows of incoming 2020. These will be building over the next 3 years and it depends on the success. Any one of them can become significant upside. We just have to see how the pilots play out in the next 12 months."

So these stories were built in a time when a lot of inventory was in the physical location. If you plot out 3 years from now, there'll be no inventory in stores in the back office. So that freed up a couple of 1,000, 2,000 square feet per stores. So if you you think about it, the first piece of the development was free because we've downsized the back office and the storage space. So the impact on our revenue throughput was minimal. And as we go through each of the partnerships, because we're getting an uplift, there's a lot of science that goes into this, so we've been losing -- as you shrink the size of your retail footprint, how much are losing versus you're going to get some uplift from the increased traffic. I don't think you're going to see a massive reduction in the space -- sorry, in the revenue as a result of this, quite the contrary. So what you'll end up is a more efficient box where you're probably dedicating less space to some [indiscernible] where you're not making really much money. You've gotten rid of your storage, you got rid of your back office and then you've got value-added services, we're attracting different customers in there and ideally, your foot traffic has gone up as a result of that and a efficient sales per square foot.  So I don't think you'll see the revenue, I think Alex is right. I think you'll see the revenue find consistent with what we have potentially improving and then you see a big change in the rent. And bear in mind that we're quite over rented. So it's a long-term opportunity for the company versus our competitors. We probably, years ago, entered into lease contracts that were in the best locations, the nicest places and probably overpaid a bit, but as you look forward over a multiyear horizon, we would expect consistent, quite material reductions in the cost of rent. 
And that at the same time, we make each store more efficient in what's in each of the stores. I hope that gives you enough insights on it."

Today, I am pleased to report that we delivered quarterly results broadly in line with our expectation. In doing so, we closed our financial year roughly flat year-on-year, which is, again, in line with the expectation we set in April. 
That said, it has not been an easy task for us to recover from a very difficult second quarter, and there has been a lot of hard work done by our team to deliver these results over the past 2 quarters. 
We have continued to make progress against our 4 strategic priorities: accelerating the digitalization of our company in terms of the way we use technology, to help us run our businesses more efficiently and effectively and, more importantly, to announce and transform the products and services that we offer our patients and customers and in the way we deliver those services; transforming and restructuring our retail offering, making sure we provide our customers what they want, in the way they want; and using the strength of our extraordinary local presence as an asset to support and reach a modern multichannel, tailored and far more focused, responsive and interactive retail experience; and creating within our store a network of health care destination, backed by our digital investments, providing both services and support. This will announce our goal as a co-provider of health care to the communities we serve and a highly effective and efficient resource of patients and payers alike. 
And of course, to support all of these and to deliver the changes we need to structure our company in a market that constantly demands evermore responsiveness and efficiency, we are delivering on our Transformational Cost Management Program.
 It is important to make that point. This is about transformation for us, both driving out costs and reinvesting in the business, to help fund investments that we need to make to deliver our strategic priorities. 
This program is truly about savings, to invest for growth. 
Our teams have worked hard on the development of this strategy, and are working just as hard on their delivery. 
We have identified an excellent group of partners that bring our skills, experience and resources to deliver our goal better, more effectively and more efficiently then we could do alone. We are transforming not just our businesses, but our business model to deliver future growth. 
We have been very clear in our current expectation for the financial year ahead. James will cover them in detail as part of this financial review. 
Looking forward to 2020, we expect adjusted earning pressure to be roughly flat on a constant-currency basis. 
Excluding the impact of the 2019 bonus headwind, we would expect a mid-single-digit adjusted earning per share growth. And looking forward, we see a clear line to sustainable, profitable growth, driven by the work we are doing and the investments we are making. 
I will now hand over to James and Alex to take you through today's earnings and update, and we'll come back to take your questions at the end. James?"

Fiscal year adjusted EPS was $5.99, up",1141,"Thank you, Stefano, and good morning, everyone. 
Today's results are broadly in line with our expectations. Adjusted EPS was $1.43 in the fourth quarter, 2.9% lower than the prior year on a constant-currency basis. Fiscal year adjusted EPS was $5.99, up 0.5% in constant currencies and in line with our guidance. We are encourage by improved U.S. comparable sales and adjusted gross profit margin performance in the second half of the year. 
Retail Pharmacy International continued to be impacted by a challenging U.K. market, whereas the Pharmaceutical Wholesale division delivered another strong performance. Our Transformational Cost Management Program is very much on track. And with rising visibility on cost savings, we are raising our annual savings target to at least $1.8 billion by fiscal 2022. 
Let's now look in more detail at the full year results. Full year sales increased 4.1% versus prior year. On a constant-currency basis, sales growth was 5.8%, reflecting good performance from both Retail Pharmacy USA and Pharmaceutical Wholesale. Adjusted operating income declined 9.6% or 8.6% on a constant-currency basis, mainly due to Retail Pharmacy USA and Boots U.K., partially offset by Pharmaceutical Wholesale. 
Adjusted EPS was $5.99, up 0.5% on a constant-currency basis. Share repurchases contributed 4.9 percentage points with tax adding 4.1 percentage points. These were partially offset by the 3.6 percentage points of adjusted EPS headwinds that are shown on the slide. 
GAAP operating income declined 20.5%, including $477 million of expenses relating to the implementation of our Transformational Cost Management Program and, as we mentioned last quarter, $114 million relating to our share of AmerisourceBergen's impairment of pharMEDium. In total, these 2 adjustments account for almost 50% of the year-on-year decline. 
In the fourth quarter, sales were up 2.6% on a constant-currency basis, reflecting solid growth in our Retail Pharmacy USA division and a strong performance in Pharmaceutical Wholesale. Adjusted operating income declined 11.9% or 11.1% on a constant-currency basis. Adjusted EPS was $1.43 and constant-currency decline of 2.9%. 
5% of growth came from our share repurchase program and another 7% from tax. However, these were entirely offset by over 12 percentage points of headwinds as we increased investments and we lapped one-time benefits in the fourth quarter of 2018, including a postretirement curtailment gain and a previously disclosed adjustment to legal accruals and settlements. 
GAAP EPS declined 51.4% to $0.75 per share. Just over half of this decline was due to 2 factors, a prior-year gain on the sale of Premise Health and the implementation of our Transformational Cost Management Program. 
Now let's move to Retail Pharmacy USA. Sales increased 2.1% in the fourth quarter reflecting 4.2% growth in pharmacy. Full year sales advanced 6.2%, reflecting the acquired Rite Aid stores and organic sales growth of 3%. Adjusted gross profit declined 1.1% in the quarter, with a decline in retail partially offset by higher pharmacy gross profit. 
Adjusted SG&A spending increased 2.1% in the quarter, entirely due to higher investments and the prior year one-time adjustment associated with previously disclosed legal accruals and settlements. Adjusted operating income declined 12.2% in the quarter and 9.6% full year. The quarter was held back by 9.4 percentage points of headwinds from higher investments and a one-time benefit in the prior year. Excluding these factors, the decline was low single digit. 
Now let's look in more detail at pharmacy. Total pharmacy sales increased 4.2% in the quarter and 8.6% for the year. Growth in the quarter reflected higher brand inflation and prescription volume growth along with growth in central specialty, which grew 7.8% in the quarter and over 20% for the year. Comp pharmacy sales increased 5.4% in the quarter and 4% for the year. Comp prescriptions grew 3.3% in the quarter and 3% for the year. The trend is improving with comp scripts up 4% in the second half versus 1.9% in the first half. 
As you will recall, we had some network headwinds in the first half, which we've now lapped. 
Market share was 21% in the quarter, down 55 basis points versus prior year, mainly due to the store optimization program. For the full year, market share increased 35 basis points to 21.3%. 
Pharmacy-adjusted gross profit increased in the quarter with script growth and procurement savings helping to mitigate reimbursement pressure. 
For the full year, pharmacy-adjusted gross profit was down slightly. Fourth quarter adjusted gross margin was 65 basis points lower than last year, including a 40 basis point mix impact from specialty. 
Turning next to our U.S. Retail business. Total retail sales declined 3.9% in the quarter impacted by store optimization. Comp retail sales declined 1.2% and, excluding tobacco, comp sales were up 0.5%. Full year comp sales declined 2.4% with 1.6 percentage points due to tobacco. 
Looking at the second half versus the first half. Second half comp sales were down 1.1% compared with a decline of 3.5% in the first half. Retail-adjusted gross profit declined in the quarter, mostly due to lower reported sales, which were negatively impacted by our store optimization program. 
We did say last quarter that we expected to see improved retail-adjusted gross margin in the fourth quarter, and I'm pleased to report that adjusted gross margin increased 35 basis points. 
Full year adjusted gross margin was down 20 basis points as we adjusted promotional spend in the earlier part of the year. 
Turning next to Retail Pharmacy International. And as usual, I'll talk to constant-currency numbers. 
Boots UK comp pharmacy sales declined 2% in the quarter and 1.6% in the year, reflecting lower script volume and a lower NHS funding level due to timing shift between years. 
Boots UK comp retail sales declined 3.1% in the quarter and 2.6% in the year as the U.K. market continued to be very challenging. However, we held share in a declining U.K. market with good share performance in Beauty. 
Adjusted operating income was down 20.7% in the quarter and down 16.2% in the year, mainly due to weak retail sales and pressure on retail and pharmacy margins in the U.K. 
Turning now to the Pharmaceutical Wholesale division, which I'll also discuss in constant-currency. Our Pharmaceutical Wholesale division delivered another strong quarter with sales up 7.9%, led by emerging markets and the U.K. In part, our U.K. performance was aided by a customer contract change, which contributed 2.3% of revenue growth. 
Fourth quarter adjusted operating income increased 6.9%, reflecting strong revenue performance and higher earnings from AmerisourceBergen. Full year sales increased 8%, and adjusted operating income increased 5.9% versus prior year. 
Turning next the cash flow. Full year operating cash flow was $5.6 billion, and free cash flow was $3.9 billion. Our free cash flow was impacted by some fairly large exceptional items, and we have covered these on previous calls. 
Excluding these exceptional items, our 2019 free cash flow was around $5.2 billion. 
I'll now hand over to Alex."

I'm going to update you on our initiatives in the U.K. and the U.S., starting with Boots UK. 
Last quarter, we talked about a number of initiatives to transform our retail offering, develop healthier services and accelerate digitalization in the U.K. We've introduced new beauty hauls in 26 key locations, and we've opened up flagship stores in Covent Garden London and, more recently, in Mega Hall Sheffield. 
We're also encouraged by our new brand introductions. 18 new beauty brands were introduced to key stores in the year and a further 17 in September. We're developing new initiatives in digital health care with plans for expanding pharmacy services to improve the customer journey and broaden access to health care. We launched our online pharmacy in May 2019, which we've expanded to includes repeat prescriptions. 
We've digitalized the Boots Advantage Card with an app now integrated across our all our main customer platforms. And importantly, boots.com performed well with sales up 14.4% in the year and 18.4% in the fourth quarter. 
As James mentioned, we continue to take actions to address our U.K. cost base. In February, we announced our intention to reduce Boots' head office costs by 20%. This program has now been completed, and the savings will come through in fiscal year 2020. 
In June, we announced a store optimization program that will impact around 200 Boots locations, reduce the store count by 18 stores by the end of the fiscal year, and they're on track to consolidate the remainder by the end of 2020. 
We have also generated cost reductions through simplification of our care home operations and the supply chain. 
Turning now to our strategic initiatives in the U.S. We have made significant progress on our 4 strategic priorities during the year. Let me start with a retail offering where we focus on delivering health, wellness, beauty and convenience, both in-store and online. 
We remain very pleased about our strategic partnership with Kroger. In August, we announced the expansion of our store pilot to new test locations in Knoxville, Tennessee. The Kroger Express concept will be available in 50 Walgreens stores, and their own health and beauty brands will be available to customers in 17 Kroger stores. 
We are extending our nationwide offering with FedEx. A new customer return system is being introduced to Walgreens stores before the holiday season, giving customers an easier returning service for unwanted goods for Walgreens and other selected retailers. We continue to look for solutions for the last mile, building on our presence in the community. 
We have recently announced our first-of-a-kind partnership with Wing to test on-demand drawing delivery, joining up with our previously announced trial with FedEx for robot delivery. 
We continue to make progress in health and beauty. We have seen strong progress in the U.S. with No7 skincare, and we're expanding the distribution of No7 skin care in Walgreens in the months ahead. And last month, we launched a stand-alone No7 website, No7beauty.com, alongside a national U.S. TV campaign. 
Turning next to health care. We're strongly focused on creating neighborhood health destinations around a more modern pharmacy. We have made significant steps during the year to develop our primary care business. Our model is based on physicians and clinical pharmacists, and we'll have primary care locations in 4 markets across the U.S., working in partnership with partners in primary care, VillageMD and Southwest Medical, an Optum Company. 
We also have plans to develop a new wellness partnership in our stores, and I'm delighted to see that we've recently signed a new agreement with Jenny Craig, a health and weight loss management company, to open centers in around 100 Walgreens locations by early 2020. 
We have been interviewing our nurse practitioner clinic model. And we've taken a decision to exit our wholly-owned loss-making clinics, but we will continue to work with our local health system partner, who are running successful clinics in 217 Walgreens locations. We now have a network of 15 partners, and we recently signed a new agreement with TriHealth to add further 7 clinics. 
Our collaboration with LabCorp is well on track. We're aiming to open at least 600 LabCorp patient centers across the U.S., providing diagnostic lab testing in the community. We opened 21 centers in the fourth quarter, taking the total to 58. We've also expanded our reach in specialty, making an equity investment in specialty provider, Shields Health Solutions. 
We are an important partner for peers, anchored by a national network of local community pharmacies. And we continue to drive better clinical outcomes through patient medication adherence programs, such as Save a Trip Refills, which already has over 2.7 million patients signed up as we aim to lower the cost of care. 
As you've seen, we've announced a strategic partnership with Centene, a leading Medicaid insurer, and, RxAdvance, a cloud-based pharmacy benefit manager. 
And we recently signed a multiyear Medicare agreement with UnitedHealthCare, including a new co-branded Medicare Advantage plan, with Walgreens being the only preferred Retail Pharmacy. 
Turning next to digitalization. Our partnership with Microsoft signed in January is essential to driving a technology strategy, and a cloud migration program is on plan. We have expanded the Find Care platform available in walgreens.com to include new strategic partners and offerings and has now 30 health care in and over 40 services. 
And we're making good progress in our existing omnichannel business. Our Walgreens app has been downloaded 58.9 million times, up 11.8% since last year, and around 26% of Walgreens retail refill scripts were initiated through digital channels in the quarter, up 14% since last year. And we also have increased our active Balance Rewards members to 89.7 million. 
Finally, we're also really pleased to report that Walgreens' digitally-initiated sales reached over $15 billion in the year, up around 25% on last year. 
Now back to James."

I'll now update you on our transformational Cost Management Program while we're making strong progress. In April, we announced we were targeting annual cost savings in excess of $1.5 billion by fiscal 2022. We now have a clear line of sight to multiple cost savings initiatives over a multiyear period, and this gives us the confidence to increase our target. 
We're now raising the annual cost savings target to in excess of $1.8 billion by fiscal 2022. Additionally, we are rolling working capital programs into the cost management program governance, and we see meaningful opportunity to reduce working capital investments over the coming years. 
Regarding implementation costs, our estimates are unchanged versus the 8-K we filed on August 6. We continue to estimate that the program will result in cumulative GAAP pretax charges of approximately $1.9 billion to $2.4 billion. And we recently rebranded the cost management program internally. It's now called save to invest to grow. 
This emphasizes that we must not only reduce costs to become the leanest operator, but we must also save more to generate the investment dollars needed to fuel long-term capabilities and growth. 
Let me give you a quick update on some of the actions taken in the quarter. 
On smart spend, we've started making policy changes. For example, we are changing how we manage the external consultants, mandating competitive bidding and making the contracts more outcome-based. 
On smart organization, last week, we made select reductions in the U.S. support office, and additional restructuring is underway in our Retail Pharmacy International and Pharmaceutical Wholesale divisions. We are also working hard to define our new vision and road map for business services. 
We have completed the review of our real estate footprint, and the actions are well underway in both the U.S. and the U.K. And dedicated teams are working hard against our biggest programs, particularly pharmacy costs to fill and shrink. 
We've reorganized our global, digital and IT leadership under a new chief information officer to improve execution and focus. We've also defined a new operating model for our day-to-day IT operations, and we've refocused our IT and digital spent to our growth priorities. 
Now let's turn to 2020. 
Let me start by providing some key assumptions for the upcoming year. We are projecting a full year adjusted effective tax rate of around 17%, and this may vary depending on the level of discrete items in the year. This will reduce adjusted EPS growth by approximately 2 percentage points as we lap an exceptionally low tax rate in fiscal 2019. 
We anticipate full year share repurchases of $1.75 billion. While this is lower than the $3.8 billion of repurchases in fiscal 2019, it is entirely consistent with our prior indications. Share repurchases should contribute around 3.5% to adjusted EPS growth. 
Within the guidance, we are investing heavily to transform WBA, including modernizing and upgrading our core foundational pharmacy systems and implementing SAP in the U.S. 
We are also investing in new digital capabilities, and we have fully funded the multiple pilots that are ongoing across health care and retail. 
In fiscal year '20, we expect to invest $800 million to $850 million, an increase of $250 million to $300 million over the prior year. 
In terms of operating expenses, we expect to invest $300 million to $350 million in 2020, a year-on-year increase of $100 million to $150 million. 
Looking specifically at capital expenditures, we anticipate investing around $500 million in fiscal 2020, and this comes on top of $350 million in fiscal '19. 
In summary, we are investing strategically to modernize and transform our capabilities to drive future growth. Finally, while we don't provide currency guidance, we have provided our internal currency rates in the appendix. As you will see, these assumptions are quite dated and, at the time, suggest that we could face a negative year-on-year currency impact of around $0.05. 
The only thing we can be sure of is that we can expect the situation in the U.K. to remain fluid. The pound/dollar rate has moved quite a bit, and external estimates range from $1.14 to $1.35. 
Turning now to adjusted EPS guidance for 2020. We are projecting constant-currency adjusted EPS growth to be flat. And for a business of our size, you should expect a range of plus or minus 3%. 
As you work through your models, please note that year-on-year adjusted EPS growth is negatively impacted by a lower bonus payout in 2019, and this is a headwind of 6.5%. 
As we look at adjusted EPS phasing for fiscal year 2020, we expect a balanced performance between the first half and the second half with potentially a slightly stronger second half. 
Let me now summarize the projected key drivers of adjusted EPS. The lower 2019 fiscal bonus payout leads to a headwind of 6.5%. Obviously, this year-on-year impact will negatively impact both SG&A expense and adjusted operating income. 
The higher tax rate has an impact of approximately 2%. On the other hand, our share repurchase program should generate a favorable tailwind of around 3.5%. Excluding these headwinds and tailwinds, we would expect operational growth of around 5%. 
Within this 5% number, we are funding the incremental investments I mentioned earlier of around 2% and an approximate 1 percentage point impact from removing e-cigarettes from our stores. 
I will now hand you back to Stefano for his closing comments."

I guess, can you walk through some of the components of that about maybe a little bit on how the company's thinking about volume growth. And I think particularly reimbursement is going to be a big question in 2020. So I guess, from a fundamental perspective, is, how are you seeing the business? Kind of what are the building blocks for growth for 2020?"
93624,637706108,1842321,"Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2019",2019-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.","Executives","Yes. So that's a good question. So the -- we did call out the operating performance once you take out the headwind coming from the prior year bonus of around 5%. And within that as well, we're also covering 2 percentage points of growth investments, so yo",491,"Yes. So that's a good question. So the -- we did call out the operating performance once you take out the headwind coming from the prior year bonus of around 5%. And within that as well, we're also covering 2 percentage points of growth investments, so you're getting closer to a 7%. And then we've removed e-cigarettes, so you could -- actually, if you strip out, these are all the puts and takes we've laid out on Slide 19. 
So the way I think you should think about this is we expect relative stability in the wholesale business. So you've seen the very strong performance in the current year. And I'd be calling on a -- something mid-single-digit revenue growth. And then I think as you look at the RPI segment, you'd be looking at probably flat to declining revenue until we see line of sight to improve market circumstances in the U.K. And that's the only question mark we have on the segment. 
And then in the U.S., I think this year, the way you should rationalize the U.S. is this year, we had a contribution coming from Rite Aid. If you kind of remove the contribution, I think we're looking forward to pretty strong script growth is our outlook. 
And then secondly, we see continued recovery in the retail business. So we had a very strong exit on retail compared with the first half. The same in pharmacy. We saw a strong recovery on scripts second half, first half. We expect to see a continuation of the improved trend. So that would lead to a low single digit revenue in the U.S. business. So I think if you look at the total company, I think we're looking at something in the low single digit revenue growth maybe 2%, maybe 3%. 
So take out Rite Aid this year and you get pretty close to the same kind of number. The way we thought about reimbursement is we've planned reimbursement slightly higher than the last 3-year average, and we expect 2020 to be a continued tough year on reimbursement. And we've planned it relatively conservatively higher than the last 3-year average, and we're not giving any more information on that. 
And then you've seen with the call up of the cost management program, that should give you the confidence that we will have a significant leverage on the cost side to -- so a combination of the solid revenue growth, plus generic procurement savings continuing at a similar level, plus a cost program that is really ramping up and gaining pace, gives us the comfort that we get to this mid-single-digit kind of range before the bonus impact. 
And know I'm not giving you a lot of insights here into how we talk through this. So reimbursement, a little bit higher than in the past, but a much stronger cost program to give us the confidence to deliver this base case."

It's an interesting question, and that's why we won't be providing growth savings on the call because I have a philosophy on this, which is, the only thing that matters is what hits the bottom line. And you know the circumstances of the company. And it's -- if you think about -- if you save on a gross basis, you're going to offset your inflation. And for a company this size, you can work it out. It's probably $250 million. And then if you're growing your scripts 3%, 4%, 5%, that's another $100 million of incremental costs because you have an incremental cost impact every time you fill in new scripts. So you can be quite easily -- before you start the year, you're facing a $400 million headwind. So that's the first part. How do you offset inflation? And how do you offset the impact of volume growth? 
The second one, as you've seen, we've taken a very strong stance on the investments. And I don't want that message to be lost. We're hitting the previously indicated guidance range with substantially higher investments. And that's what the cost program is helping us deliver. So we, quite hopefully, put in the magnitude of the investments we're actually spending this year. And it somewhat gets back to the age of some of the systems we have in the company, where 40% of that investment we have year-on-year is going on new pharmacy systems in the U.S. and U.K. the and implementation of SAP in the U.S. We will be able to take out an enormous amount of inventory over the next 3 years as we implement these systems. Enormous. So these systems will pay for themselves. 
The second -- the next, call it, third, is on new digital capabilities. And then the final piece is, every time we do a pilot -- and the pilots are starting to scale up. We have 50 plus, 70-- 67 just on Kroger. It costs quite a bit of money to reorganize the stores and try these pilots. These are all fully funded. 
So that's -- long answer to your short question was the overhead is to pay for inflation. It's the dramatic step-change in the investment profile of the company to drive sustainable, long-term growth. That's the business we're in. We have to drive growth longer term, and then finally as part of the business model, where reimbursement is offset by general procurement savings volume and SG&A and cost discipline."

You did talk about the relationship on the preferred side for Medicare with United, but is there anything else that's specifically driving that, would be my first question.

Let me give you -- I'll give you a quick answer and let Alex then take the more detailed one. Our point on the scripts is if you take the second half versus first half, the scripts are now running at second half, 4%. And we had, as you know, a very weak first half. We were up 1.9%. And that's because we were lapping these, call it, network changes, where we lost 2 points in the previous 12 months. 
And then as you look at the investment profile, I guess, that's the upside scenario. We are quite conservative. We build in the cost of executing the initiatives. We do have working capital benefits built in our internal plans. They're quite sizable, so we do expect returns this current year on cash flow. 
On the pilots themselves, we're not counting on significant flows of income in 2020. These will be building over the next 3 years, and it depends on the success. Any one of them can become significant upside. We just have to see how the pilots play out in the next 12 months."

Yes, I think regarding prescription growth, we see a return to normal market in Med D, driven by the fact that we got preferred relationships with some of the bigger plans. And we may have lost some of  the small preferred access, but they are very small numbers otherwise. So overall, we feel pretty good about that. You saw an announcement with Centene, where we intend to be more proactive in the a Medicaid space going forward as well. There's still areas that we're working on. First of all, we are able to retain more customers. For example, I mentioned Save a Trip Refill in our prepared remarks. That's driving better retention adherence. 
And last, not least, of course, we are able to consolidate pharmacies, not just already, but the marketplace is changing. We're seeing more pharmacies than normal on the marketplace. And we have a good pipeline of pharmacies that we'll be able to secure in the future and consolidate as the number of pharmacies in the U.S. for the first time, for a long time, seem to be in decline. So we're pretty confident that we'll be at the mark -- or maybe somewhat ahead of the market overall with all of these initiatives in terms of pharmacy growth."

That's why we're testing these pilots. We're trying to see the uplifts on both retail and on scripts. So you've got 3 sources of income in most cases. 
And when we say there isn't a contribution, the FedEx agreement delivers favorable contribution already. And we're already at full capacity, basically. Already, LabCorp, on an income basis, is positive. What's negative is we're investing capital every time we touch the store. So it's more a cash flow negative.

Our work With AllianceRX is really about the central model in the mean, and, of course, working very closely with the owners of Prime, which are the Blues, and particularly the financial contracts. Obviously, we've put together our business with their business just over 2 years ago. And the business is now performing, from an operational point of view, very well, but, clearly, the market is changing, and we're looking forward to how we can, of course, accelerate growth and work even closer with the Blues in that model going forward. 
So if you think of them as 2 separate areas at this stage, and, of course, we recognize the incredible importance of specialty and the new drugs in the marketplace in the years ahead, I think 50% of the value of medication will be in specialty within 3 years.

So these stories were built in a time when a lot of inventory was in the physical location. If you plot out 3 years from now, there'll be no inventory in the stores in the back-office. So that freed up a couple 1,000, 2,000 square feet per stores. So if you think about it, the first piece of the development was free because we've downsized the back-office and the storage space. So the impact on our revenue throughput was minimal. 
And as we go through each of the partnerships, because we're getting an uplift, there's a lot of science that goes into this. So we'll be losing -- if you shrink the size of your retail footprint, how much you are losing versus you're going to get some uplift from the increased traffic, I don't think you're going to see a massive reduction in the space -- sorry, in the revenue as a result of this. Quite the contrary. So what you end up with is a more efficient box, where you're probably dedicating less space to some categories where you weren't making very much money. You've gotten rid of your storage. You got rid of your back-office. And then you've got value-added services who are attracting different customers in there. And ideally, your foot traffic has gone up as a result of that and a more efficient sales per square foot.  So I don't think you'll see the revenue. I think Alex is right. I think you'll see the revenue find consistent with what we have potentially improving. And then you see a big change in the rent. And bear in mind that we're quite overrented, so it's a long-term opportunity for the company. Or versus our competitors, we probably, years ago, entered into lease contracts that were in the best locations, the nicest places and probably overpaid a bit. So as you look forward over a multiyear horizon, we would expect consistent, quite material reductions in the cost of rent. 
And then at the same time, we make each store more efficient in what's in each of the stores. I hope that gives you enough insights on it."

Today, I am pleased to report that we delivered quarterly results broadly in line with our expectation. In doing so, we closed our financial year roughly flat year-on-year, which is, again, in line with the expectation we set in April. 
That said, it has not been an easy task for us to recover from a very difficult second quarter, and there has been a lot of hard work done by our team to deliver these results over the past 2 quarters. 
We have continued to make progress against our 4 strategic priorities: accelerating the digitalization of our company in terms of the way we use technology, to help us run our businesses more efficiently and effectively and, more importantly, to announce and transform the products and services that we offer our patients and customers and in the way we deliver those services; transforming and restructuring our retail offering, making sure we provide our customers what they want, in the way they want; and using the strength of our extraordinary local presence as an asset to support and reach a modern multichannel, tailored and far more focused, responsive and interactive retail experience; and creating within our store a network of health care destination, backed by our digital investments, providing both services and support. This will announce our role as a co-provider of health care to the communities we serve and a highly effective and efficient resource for patients and payers alike. 
And of course, to support all of these and to deliver the changes we need to structure our company in a market that constantly demands evermore responsiveness and efficiency, we are delivering on our Transformational Cost Management Program.
It is important to make that point. This is about transformation for us, both driving out costs and reinvesting in the business, to help fund investments that we need to make to deliver our strategic priorities. 
This program is truly about savings, to invest for growth. 
Our teams have worked hard on the development of this strategy, and are working just as hard on their delivery. 
We have identified an excellent group of partners that bring our skills, experience and resources to deliver our goal better, more effectively and more efficiently than we could do alone. We are transforming not just our businesses, but our business model to deliver future growth. 
We have been very clear in our current expectation for the financial year ahead. James will cover them in detail as part of this financial review. 
Looking forward to 2020, we expect adjusted earning per share to be roughly flat on a constant-currency basis. 
Excluding the impact of the 2019 bonus headwind, we would expect a mid-single-digit adjusted earning per share growth. And looking forward, we see a clear line to sustainable, profitable growth, driven by the work we are doing and the investments we are making. 
I will now hand over to James and Alex to take you through today's earnings and update, and we'll come back to take your questions at the end. James?"

Today's results are broadly in line with our expectations. Adjusted EPS was $1.43 in the fourth quarter, 2.9% lower than the prior year on a constant-currency basis. Fiscal year adjusted EPS was $5.99, up 0.5% in constant currencies and in line with our guidance. We are encourage by improved U.S. comparable sales and adjusted gross profit margin performance in the second half of the year. 
Retail Pharmacy International continued to be impacted by a challenging U.K. market, whereas the Pharmaceutical Wholesale division delivered another strong performance. Our Transformational Cost Management Program is very much on track. And with rising visibility on cost savings, we are raising our annual savings target to at least $1.8 billion by fiscal 2022. 
Let's now look in more detail at the full year results. Full year sales increased 4.1% versus prior year. On a constant-currency basis, sales growth was 5.8%, reflecting good performance from both Retail Pharmacy USA and Pharmaceutical Wholesale. Adjusted operating income declined 9.6% or 8.6% on a constant-currency basis, mainly due to Retail Pharmacy USA and Boots U.K., partially offset by Pharmaceutical Wholesale. 
Adjusted EPS was $5.99, up 0.5% on a constant-currency basis. Share repurchases contributed 4.9 percentage points with tax adding 4.1 percentage points. These were partially offset by the 3.6 percentage points of adjusted EPS headwinds that are shown on the slide. 
GAAP operating income declined 20.5%, including $477 million of expenses relating to the implementation of our Transformational Cost Management Program and, as we mentioned last quarter, $114 million relating to our share of AmerisourceBergen's impairment of pharMEDium. In total, these 2 adjustments account for almost 50% of the year-on-year decline. 
In the fourth quarter, sales were up 2.6% on a constant-currency basis, reflecting solid growth in our Retail Pharmacy USA division and a strong performance in Pharmaceutical Wholesale. Adjusted operating income declined 11.9% or 11.1% on a constant-currency basis. Adjusted EPS was $1.43, a constant-currency decline of 2.9%. 
5% of growth came from our share repurchase program and another 7% from tax. However, these were entirely offset by over 12 percentage points of headwinds as we increased investments and we lapped one-time benefits in the fourth quarter of 2018, including a postretirement curtailment gain and a previously disclosed adjustment to legal accruals and settlements. 
GAAP EPS declined 51.4% to $0.75 per share. Just over half of this decline was due to 2 factors, a prior-year gain on the sale of Premise Health and the implementation of our Transformational Cost Management Program. 
Now let's move to Retail Pharmacy USA. Sales increased 2.1% in the fourth quarter reflecting 4.2% growth in pharmacy. Full year sales advanced 6.2%, reflecting the acquired Rite Aid stores and organic sales growth of 3%. Adjusted gross profit declined 1.1% in the quarter, with a decline in retail partially offset by higher pharmacy gross profit. 
Adjusted SG&A spending increased 2.1% in the quarter, entirely due to higher investments and the prior year one-time adjustment associated with previously disclosed legal accruals and settlements. Adjusted operating income declined 12.2% in the quarter and 9.6% full year. The quarter was held back by 9.4 percentage points of headwinds from higher investments and a one-time benefit in the prior year. Excluding these factors, the decline was low single digit. 
Now let's look in more detail at pharmacy. Total pharmacy sales increased 4.2% in the quarter and 8.6% for the year. Growth in the quarter reflected higher brand inflation and prescription volume growth along with growth in central specialty, which grew 7.8% in the quarter and over 20% for the year. Comp pharmacy sales increased 5.4% in the quarter and 4% for the year. Comp prescriptions grew 3.3% in the quarter and 3% for the year. The trend is improving with comp scripts up 4% in the second half versus 1.9% in the first half. 
As you will recall, we had some network headwinds in the first half, which we've now lapped. 
Market share was 21% in the quarter, down 55 basis points versus prior year, mainly due to the store optimization program. For the full year, market share increased 35 basis points to 21.3%. 
Pharmacy-adjusted gross profit increased in the quarter with script growth and procurement savings helping to mitigate reimbursement pressure. 
For the full year, pharmacy-adjusted gross profit was down slightly. Fourth quarter adjusted gross margin was 65 basis points lower than last year, including a 40 basis point mix impact from specialty. 
Turning next to our U.S. Retail business. Total retail sales declined 3.9% in the quarter impacted by store optimization. Comp retail sales declined 1.2% and, excluding tobacco, comp sales were up 0.5%. Full year comp sales declined 2.4% with 1.6 percentage points due to tobacco. 
Looking at the second half versus the first half. Second half comp sales were down 1.1% compared with a decline of 3.5% in the first half. Retail-adjusted gross profit declined in the quarter, mostly due to lower reported sales, which were negatively impacted by our store optimization program. 
We did say last quarter that we expected to see improved retail-adjusted gross margin in the fourth quarter, and I'm pleased to report that adjusted gross margin increased 35 basis points. 
Full year adjusted gross margin was down 20 basis points as we adjusted promotional spend in the earlier part of the year. 
Turning next to Retail Pharmacy International. And as usual, I'll talk to constant-currency numbers. 
Boots UK comp pharmacy sales declined 2% in the quarter and 1.6% in the year, reflecting lower script volume and a lower NHS funding level due to timing shift between years. 
Boots UK comp retail sales declined 3.1% in the quarter and 2.6% in the year as the U.K. market continued to be very challenging. However, we held share in a declining U.K. market with good share performance in Beauty. 
Adjusted operating income was down 20.7% in the quarter and down 16.2% in the year, mainly due to weak retail sales and pressure on retail and pharmacy margins in the U.K. 
Turning now to the Pharmaceutical Wholesale division, which I'll also discuss in constant-currency. Our Pharmaceutical Wholesale division delivered another strong quarter with sales up 7.9%, led by emerging markets and the U.K. In part, our U.K. performance was aided by a customer contract change, which contributed 2.3% of revenue growth. 
Fourth quarter adjusted operating income increased 6.9%, reflecting strong revenue performance and higher earnings from AmerisourceBergen. Full year sales increased 8%, and adjusted operating income increased 5.9% versus prior year. 
Turning next to cash flow. Full year operating cash flow was $5.6 billion, and free cash flow was $3.9 billion. Our free cash flow was impacted by some fairly large exceptional items, and we have covered these on previous calls. 
Excluding these exceptional items, our 2019 free cash flow was around $5.2 billion. 
I'll now hand over to Alex."

I'm going to update you on our initiatives in the U.K. and the U.S., starting with Boots UK. 
Last quarter, we talked about a number of initiatives to transform our retail offering, develop healthier services and accelerate digitalization in the U.K. We've introduced new beauty halls in 26 key locations, and we've opened up flagship stores in Covent Garden, London, and, more recently, in Meadowhall, Sheffield. 
We're also encouraged by our new brand introductions. 18 new beauty brands were introduced to key stores in the year and a further 17 in September. We're developing new initiatives in digital health care with plans for expanding pharmacy services to improve the customer journey and broaden access to health care. We launched our online pharmacy in May 2019, which we've expanded to includes repeat prescriptions. 
We've digitalized the Boots Advantage Card with an app now integrated across our all our main customer platforms. And importantly, boots.com performed well with sales up 14.4% in the year and 18.4% in the fourth quarter. 
As James mentioned, we continue to take actions to address our U.K. cost base. In February, we announced our intention to reduce Boots' head office costs by 20%. This program has now been completed, and the savings will come through in fiscal year 2020. 
In June, we announced a store optimization program that will impact around 200 Boots locations, reduce the store count by 18 stores by the end of the fiscal year, and they're on track to consolidate the remainder by the end of 2020. 
We have also generated cost reductions through simplification of our care home operations and the supply chain. 
Turning now to our strategic initiatives in the U.S. We have made significant progress on our 4 strategic priorities during the year. Let me start with a retail offering where we focus on delivering health, wellness, beauty and convenience, both in-store and online. 
We remain very pleased about our strategic partnership with Kroger. In August, we announced the expansion of our store pilot to new test locations in Knoxville, Tennessee. The Kroger Express concept will be available in 50 Walgreens stores, and their own health and beauty brands will be available to customers in 17 Kroger stores. 
We are extending our nationwide offering with FedEx. A new customer return system is being introduced to Walgreens stores before the holiday season, giving customers an easier returning service for unwanted goods for Walgreens and other selected retailers. We continue to look for solutions for the last mile, building on our presence in the community. 
We have recently announced our first-of-a-kind partnership with Wing to test on-demand drone delivery, joining up with our previously announced trial with FedEx for robot delivery. 
We continue to make progress in health and beauty. We have seen strong progress in the U.S. with No7 skincare, and we're expanding the distribution of No7 skincare in Walgreens in the months ahead. And last month, we launched a stand-alone No7 website, No7beauty.com, alongside a national U.S. TV campaign. 
Turning next to health care. We're strongly focused on creating neighborhood health destinations around a more modern pharmacy. We have made significant steps during the year to develop our primary care business. Our model is based on physicians and clinical pharmacists, and we'll have primary care locations in 4 markets across the U.S., working in partnership with partners in Primary Care, VillageMD and Southwest Medical, an Optum Company. 
We also have plans to develop a new wellness partnership in our stores, and I'm delighted to say that we've recently signed a new agreement with Jenny Craig, a health and weight loss management company, to open centers in around 100 Walgreens locations by early 2020. 
We have been reviewing our nurse practitioner clinic model. And we've taken a decision to exit our wholly-owned loss-making clinics, but we will continue to work with our local health system partner, who are running successful clinics in 217 Walgreens locations. We now have a network of 15 partners, and we recently signed a new agreement with TriHealth to add further 7 clinics. 
Our collaboration with LabCorp is well on track. We're aiming to open at least 600 LabCorp patient centers across the U.S., providing diagnostic lab testing in the community. We opened 21 centers in the fourth quarter, taking the total to 58. We've also expanded our reach in specialty, making an equity investment in specialty provider, Shields Health Solutions. 
We are an important partner for payers, anchored by a national network of local community pharmacies. And we continue to drive better clinical outcomes through patient medication adherence programs, such as Save a Trip Refills, which already has over 2.7 million patients signed up as we aim to lower the cost of care. 
As you've seen, we've announced a strategic partnership with Centene, a leading Medicaid insurer, and, RxAdvance, a cloud-based pharmacy benefit manager. 
And we recently signed a multiyear Medicare agreement with UnitedHealthCare, including a new co-branded Medicare Advantage plan, with Walgreens being the only preferred Retail Pharmacy. 
Turning next to digitalization. Our partnership with Microsoft signed in January is essential to driving a technology strategy, and a cloud migration program is on plan. We have expanded the Find Care platform available in walgreens.com to include new strategic partners and offerings and has now 30 health care providers and over 40 services. 
And we're making good progress in our existing omnichannel business. Our Walgreens app has been downloaded 58.9 million times, up 11.8% since last year, and around 26% of Walgreens retail refill scripts were initiated through digital channels in the quarter, up 14% since last year. And we also have increased our active Balance Rewards members to 89.7 million. 
Finally, we're also really pleased to report that Walgreens' digitally-initiated sales reached over $15 billion in the year, up around 25% on last year. 
Now back to James."

I'll now update you on our Transformational Cost Management Program while we're making strong progress. In April, we announced we were targeting annual cost savings in excess of $1.5 billion by fiscal 2022. We now have a clear line of sight to multiple cost savings initiatives over a multiyear period, and this gives us the confidence to increase our target. 
We're now raising the annual cost savings target to in excess of $1.8 billion by fiscal 2022. Additionally, we are rolling working capital programs into the cost management program governance, and we see meaningful opportunity to reduce working capital investments over the coming years. 
Regarding implementation costs, our estimates are unchanged versus the 8-K we filed on August 6. We continue to estimate that the program will result in cumulative GAAP pretax charges of approximately $1.9 billion to $2.4 billion. And we recently rebranded the cost management program internally. It's now called Save to Invest to Grow. 
This emphasizes that we must not only reduce costs to become the leanest operator, but we must also save more to generate the investment dollars needed to fuel long-term capabilities and growth. 
Let me give you a quick update on some of the actions taken in the quarter. 
On smart spend, we've started making policy changes. For example, we are changing how we manage the external consultants, mandating competitive bidding and making the contracts more outcome-based. 
On smart organization, last week, we made select reductions in the U.S. support office, and additional restructuring is underway in our Retail Pharmacy International and Pharmaceutical Wholesale divisions. We are also working hard to define our new vision and road map for business services. 
We have completed the review of our real estate footprint, and the actions are well underway in both the U.S. and the U.K. And dedicated teams are working hard against our biggest programs, particularly pharmacy costs to fill and shrink. 
We've reorganized our global, digital and IT leadership under a new chief information officer to improve execution and focus. We've also defined a new operating model for our day-to-day IT operations, and we've refocused our IT and digital spend to our growth priorities. 
Now let's turn to 2020. 
Let me start by providing some key assumptions for the upcoming year. We are projecting a full year adjusted effective tax rate of around 17%, and this may vary depending on the level of discrete items in the year. This will reduce adjusted EPS growth by approximately 2 percentage points as we lap an exceptionally low tax rate in fiscal 2019. 
We anticipate full year share repurchases of $1.75 billion. While this is lower than the $3.8 billion of repurchases in fiscal 2019, it is entirely consistent with our prior indications. Share repurchases should contribute around 3.5% to adjusted EPS growth. 
Within the guidance, we are investing heavily to transform WBA, including modernizing and upgrading our core foundational pharmacy systems and implementing SAP in the U.S. 
We are also investing in new digital capabilities, and we have fully funded the multiple pilots that are ongoing across health care and retail. 
In fiscal year '20, we expect to invest $800 million to $850 million, an increase of $250 million to $300 million over the prior year. 
In terms of operating expenses, we expect to invest $300 million to $350 million in 2020, a year-on-year increase of $100 million to $150 million. 
Looking specifically at capital expenditures, we anticipate investing around $500 million in fiscal 2020, and this comes on top of $350 million in fiscal '19. 
In summary, we are investing strategically to modernize and transform our capabilities to drive future growth. Finally, while we don't provide currency guidance, we have provided our internal currency rates in the appendix. As you will see, these assumptions are quite dated and, at the time, suggest that we could face a negative year-on-year currency impact of around $0.05. 
The only thing we can be sure of is that we can expect the situation in the U.K. to remain fluid. The pound/dollar rate has moved quite a bit, and external estimates range from $1.14 to $1.35. 
Turning now to adjusted EPS guidance for 2020. We are projecting constant-currency adjusted EPS growth to be flat. And for a business of our size, you should expect a range of plus or minus 3%. 
As you work through your models, please note that year-on-year adjusted EPS growth is negatively impacted by a lower bonus payout in 2019, and this is a headwind of 6.5%. 
As we look at adjusted EPS phasing for fiscal year 2020, we expect a balanced performance between the first half and the second half with potentially a slightly stronger second half. 
Let me now summarize the projected key drivers of adjusted EPS. The lower 2019 fiscal bonus payout leads to a headwind of 6.5%. Obviously, this year-on-year impact will negatively impact both SG&A expense and adjusted operating income. 
The higher tax rate has an impact of approximately 2%. On the other hand, our share repurchase program should generate a favorable tailwind of around 3.5%. Excluding these headwinds and tailwinds, we would expect operational growth of around 5%. 
Within this 5% number, we are funding the incremental investments I mentioned earlier of around 2% and an approximate 1 percentage point impact from removing e-cigarettes from our stores. 
I will now hand you back to Stefano for his closing comments."

After our poor second quarter earnings, we told you what we would be doing and we have delivered for 2 quarters. 
As you have heard, we anticipate a reasonable underlying operating performance for the coming year with solid underlying growth in most of our core businesses. This is very much in line with what we told you some months ago. 
The action that we have taken to transform our businesses and the drive and focus with which our teams our pursuing our strategic priorities gives me confidence in our ability to deliver this growth. I strongly believe in an expanded role for pharmacy and in our company's ability to play a significant part in shaping how health care is delivered in the community going forward. 
I remain convinced that we have, in our company, through our partnerships, an extraordinary foundation on which to build. The work currently underway on innovation and transformation across all our businesses, will mean we can and will continue to deliver real value for our customers and investors for many years to come.

I guess, can you walk through some of the components of that about maybe a little bit on how the company's thinking about volume growth. And I think particularly reimbursement is going to be a big question in 2020. So I guess, from a fundamental perspective, is, how are you seeing the business? Kind of what are the building blocks for growth for 2020?"
93624,637706108,1842492,"Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2019",2019-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.","Executives","Yes. So that's a good question. So the -- we did call out the operating performance once you take out the headwind coming from the prior year bonus of around 5%. And within that as well, we're also covering 2 percentage points of growth investments, so yo",491,"Yes. So that's a good question. So the -- we did call out the operating performance once you take out the headwind coming from the prior year bonus of around 5%. And within that as well, we're also covering 2 percentage points of growth investments, so you're getting closer to a 7%. And then we've removed e-cigarettes, so you could -- actually, if you strip out, these are all the puts and takes we've laid out on Slide 19. 
So the way I think you should think about this is we expect relative stability in the wholesale business. So you've seen the very strong performance in the current year. And I'd be calling on a -- something mid-single-digit revenue growth. And then I think as you look at the RPI segment, you'd be looking at probably flat to declining revenue until we see line of sight to improve market circumstances in the U.K. And that's the only question mark we have on the segment. 
And then in the U.S., I think this year, the way you should rationalize the U.S. is, this year we had a contribution coming from Rite Aid. If you kind of remove the contribution, I think we're looking forward to pretty strong script growth is our outlook. 
And then secondly, we see continued recovery in the retail business. So we had a very strong exit on retail compared with the first half. The same in pharmacy. We saw a strong recovery on scripts second half, first half. We expect to see a continuation of the improved trend. So that would lead to a low single digit revenue in the U.S. business. So I think if you look at the total company, I think we're looking at something in the low single digit revenue growth maybe 2%, maybe 3%. 
So take out Rite Aid this year and you get pretty close to the same kind of number. The way we thought about reimbursement is we've planned reimbursement slightly higher than the last 3-year average, and we expect 2020 to be a continued tough year on reimbursement. And we've planned it relatively conservatively higher than the last 3-year average, and we're not giving any more information on that. 
And then you've seen with the call up of the cost management program, that should give you the confidence that we will have a significant leverage on the cost side to -- so a combination of the solid revenue growth, plus generic procurement savings continuing at a similar level, plus a cost program that is really ramping up and gaining pace, gives us the comfort that we get to this mid-single-digit kind of range before the bonus impact. 
And know I'm not giving you a lot of insights here into how we talk through this. So reimbursement, a little bit higher than in the past, but a much stronger cost program to give us the confidence to deliver this base case."

It's an interesting question, and that's why we won't be providing growth savings on the call because I have a philosophy on this, which is, the only thing that matters is what hits the bottom line. And you know the circumstances of the company. And it's -- if you think about -- if you save on a gross basis, you got to offset your inflation. And for a company this size, you can work it out. It's probably $250 million. And then if you're growing your scripts 3%, 4%, 5%, that's another $100 million of incremental costs because you have an incremental cost impact every time you fill in new scripts. So you can be quite easily -- before you start the year, you're facing a $400 million headwind. So that's the first part. How do you offset inflation? And how do you offset the impact of volume growth? 
The second one, as you've seen, we've taken a very strong stance on the investments. And I don't want that message to be lost. We're hitting the previously indicated guidance range with substantially higher investments. And that's what the cost program is helping us deliver. So we, quite hopefully, put in the magnitude of the investments we're actually spending this year. And it somewhat gets back to the age of some of the systems we have in the company, where 40% of that investment we have year-on-year is going on new pharmacy systems in the U.S. and U.K. and implementation of SAP in the U.S. We will be able to take out an enormous amount of inventory over the next 3 years as we implement these systems. Enormous. So these systems will pay for themselves. 
The second -- the next, call it, third, is on new digital capabilities. And then the final piece is, every time we do a pilot -- and the pilots are starting to scale up. We have 50 plus, 70 -- 67 just on Kroger. It costs quite a bit of money to reorganize the stores and try these pilots. These are all fully funded. 
So that's -- long answer to your short question was the overhead is to pay for inflation. It's the dramatic step-change in the investment profile of the company to drive sustainable, long-term growth. That's the business we're in. We have to drive growth longer term, and then finally as part of the business model, where reimbursement is offset by general procurement savings volume and SG&A and cost discipline."

Our point on the scripts is if you take the second half versus first half, the scripts are now running at second half, 4%. And we had, as you know, a very weak first half. We were up 1.9%. And that's because we were lapping these, call it, network changes, where we lost 2 points in the previous 12 months. 
And then as you look at the investment profile, I guess, that's the upside scenario. We are quite conservative. We build in the cost of executing the initiatives. We do have working capital benefits built in our internal plans. They're quite sizable, so we do expect returns this current year on cash flow. 
On the pilots themselves, we're not counting on significant flows of income in 2020. These will be building over the next 3 years, and it depends on the success. Any one of them can become significant upside. We just have to see how the pilots play out in the next 12 months."

Yes, I think regarding prescription growth, we see a return to normal market growth in Med D, driven by the fact that we got preferred relationships with some of the bigger plans. And we may have lost some of the small preferred access, but they are very small numbers otherwise. So overall, we feel pretty good about that. You saw an announcement with Centene, where we intend to be more proactive in the Medicaid space going forward as well. There's 2 other areas that we're working on. First of all, we are able to retain more customers. For example, I mentioned Save a Trip Refill in our prepared remarks. That's driving better retention adherence. 
And last, not least, of course, we are able to consolidate pharmacies, not just Rite Aid, but the marketplace is changing. We're seeing more pharmacies than normal on the marketplace. And we have a good pipeline of pharmacies that we'll be able to secure in the future and consolidate as the number of pharmacies in the U.S. for the first time, for a long time, seem to be in decline.

It sounds like, Alex, that you have a line of sight to where the scripts are coming from, from that perspective, 2% to 3% on the top line. Cost-cutting is going to get you to that 5 percentage range. Do I have that all correct?"

Just be careful. The revenue doesn't track to scripts. So for example, and I won't say much more than this, if you assume higher generic penetration, which typically improves and has been improving over a fairly long period of time and will still improve, not by major amounts, that will have a deflationary amount on your -- deflationary impact on your revenue. So we would believe that the scripts would be higher than 2% to 3%. So there'll be much more leverage in the income statement. So the 2%, call it 3% of revenue, that includes a deflation assumption for a higher utilization of generics."

That's why we're testing these pilots. We're trying to see the uplifts on both retail and on scripts. So you've got 3 sources of income in most cases. 
And when we say there isn't a contribution, the FedEx agreement delivers favorable contribution already. And we're already at full capacity, basically. Already, LabCorp, on an income basis, is positive. What's negative is we're investing capital every time we touch the store. So it's more a cash flow negative.

So it's early days, but that's the model there. Really, it's a community model. 
Our work with AllianceRX is really about the central model in the main, and, of course, working very closely with the owners of Prime, which are the Blues, and particularly the commercial contracts. Obviously, we've put together our business with their business just over 2 years ago. And the business is now performing, from an operational point of view, very well, but, clearly, the market is changing, and we're looking forward to how we can, of course, accelerate growth and work even closer with the Blues in that model going forward. 
So if you think of them as 2 separate areas at this stage, and, of course, we recognize the incredible importance of specialty and the new drugs in the marketplace in the years ahead, I think 50% of the value of medication will be in specialty within 3 years. So of course, we're working very hard on both the individual piece I've mentioned, but also how we combine the Walgreens brand and all of our assets over time to create a more powerful specialty model with our partners."

So these stores were built in a time when a lot of inventory was in the physical location. If you plot out 3 years from now, there'll be no inventory in the stores in the back-office. So that freed up a couple 1,000, 2,000 square feet per stores. So if you think about it, the first piece of the development was free because we've downsized the back-office and the storage space. So the impact on our revenue throughput was minimal. 
And as we go through each of the partnerships, because we're getting an uplift, there's a lot of science that goes into this. So we'll be losing -- if you shrink the size of your retail footprint, how much you are losing versus you're going to get some uplift from the increased traffic, I don't think you're going to see a massive reduction in the space -- sorry, in the revenue as a result of this. Quite the contrary. So what you end up with is a more efficient box, where you're probably dedicating less space to some categories where you weren't making very much money. You've gotten rid of your storage. You got rid of your back-office. And then you've got value-added services who are attracting different customers in there. And ideally, your foot traffic has gone up as a result of that and a more efficient sales per square foot.  So I don't think you'll see the revenue. I think Alex is right. I think you'll see the revenue find consistent with what we have potentially improving. And then you see a big change in the rent. And bear in mind that we're quite overrented, so it's a long-term opportunity for the company. Or versus our competitors, we probably, years ago, entered into lease contracts that were in the best locations, the nicest places and probably overpaid a bit. So as you look forward over a multiyear horizon, we would expect consistent, quite material reductions in the cost of rent. 
And then at the same time, we make each store more efficient in what's in each of the stores. I hope that gives you enough insights on it."

Today, I am pleased to report that we delivered quarterly results broadly in line with our expectation. In doing so, we closed our financial year roughly flat year-on-year, which is, again, in line with the expectation we set in April. 
That said, it has not been an easy task for us to recover from a very difficult second quarter, and there has been a lot of hard work done by our team to deliver these results over the past 2 quarters. 
We have continued to make progress against our 4 strategic priorities: accelerating the digitalization of our company in terms of the way we use technology, to help us run our businesses more efficiently and effectively and, more importantly, to announce and transform the products and services that we offer our patients and customers and in the way we deliver those services; transforming and restructuring our retail offering, making sure we provide our customers what they want, in the way they want; and using the strength of our extraordinary local presence as an asset to support and reach a modern multichannel, tailored and far more focused, responsive and interactive retail experience; and creating within our store a network of health care destination, backed by our digital investments, providing both services and support. This will announce our role as a co-provider of health care to the communities we serve and a highly effective and efficient resource for patients and payers alike. 
And of course, to support all of these and to deliver the changes we need to structure our company in a market that constantly demands evermore responsiveness and efficiency, we are delivering on our Transformational Cost Management Program.
It is important to make that point. This is about transformation for us, both driving out costs and reinvesting in the business, to help fund investments that we need to make to deliver our strategic priorities. This program is truly about savings, to invest for growth. Our teams have worked hard on the development of this strategy, and are working just as hard on their delivery. 
We have identified an excellent group of partners that bring our skills, experience and resources to deliver our goal better, more effectively and more efficiently than we could do alone. We are transforming not just our businesses, but our business model to deliver future growth. We have been very clear in our current expectation for the financial year ahead. James will cover them in detail as part of this financial review. 
Looking forward to 2020. We expect adjusted earning per share to be roughly flat on a constant currency basis. Excluding the impact of the 2019 bonus headwind, we would expect a mid-single-digit adjusted earning per share growth. And looking forward, we see a clear line to sustainable, profitable growth, driven by the work we are doing and the investments we are making. 
I will now hand over to James and Alex to take you through today's earnings and update, and we'll come back to take your questions at the end. James?"

Today's results are broadly in line with our expectations. Adjusted EPS was $1.43 in the fourth quarter, 2.9% lower than the prior year on a constant currency basis. Fiscal year adjusted EPS was $5.99, up 0.",1150,"Thank you, Stefano, and good morning, everyone. Today's results are broadly in line with our expectations. Adjusted EPS was $1.43 in the fourth quarter, 2.9% lower than the prior year on a constant currency basis. Fiscal year adjusted EPS was $5.99, up 0.5% in constant currencies and in line with our guidance. We are encourage by improved U.S. comparable sales and adjusted gross profit margin performance in the second half of the year. 
Retail Pharmacy International continued to be impacted by a challenging U.K. market, whereas the Pharmaceutical Wholesale division delivered another strong performance. Our Transformational Cost Management Program is very much on track. And with rising visibility on cost savings, we are raising our annual savings target to at least $1.8 billion by fiscal 2022. 
Let's now look in more detail at the full year results. Full year sales increased 4.1% versus prior year. On a constant currency basis, sales growth was 5.8%, reflecting good performance from both Retail Pharmacy USA and Pharmaceutical Wholesale. Adjusted operating income declined 9.6% or 8.6% on a constant currency basis, mainly due to Retail Pharmacy USA and Boots U.K., partially offset by Pharmaceutical Wholesale. 
Adjusted EPS was $5.99, up 0.5% on a constant currency basis. Share repurchases contributed 4.9 percentage points with tax adding 4.1 percentage points. These were partially offset by the 3.6 percentage points of adjusted EPS headwinds that are shown on the slide. 
GAAP operating income declined 20.5%, including $477 million of expenses relating to the implementation of our Transformational Cost Management Program and, as we mentioned last quarter, $114 million relating to our share of AmerisourceBergen's impairment of pharMEDium. In total, these 2 adjustments account for almost 50% of the year-on-year decline. 
In the fourth quarter, sales were up 2.6% on a constant currency basis, reflecting solid growth in our Retail Pharmacy USA division and a strong performance in Pharmaceutical Wholesale. Adjusted operating income declined 11.9% or 11.1% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted EPS was $1.43, a constant currency decline of 2.9%. 
5% of growth came from our share repurchase program and another 7% from tax. However, these were entirely offset by over 12 percentage points of headwinds as we increased investments and we lapped one-time benefits in the fourth quarter of 2018, including a postretirement curtailment gain and a previously disclosed adjustment to legal accruals and settlements. 
GAAP EPS declined 51.4% to $0.75 per share. Just over half of this decline was due to 2 factors, a prior-year gain on the sale of Premise Health and the implementation of our Transformational Cost Management Program. 
Now let's move to Retail Pharmacy USA. Sales increased 2.1% in the fourth quarter reflecting 4.2% growth in pharmacy. Full year sales advanced 6.2%, reflecting the acquired Rite Aid stores and organic sales growth of 3%. Adjusted gross profit declined 1.1% in the quarter, with a decline in retail partially offset by higher pharmacy gross profit. 
Adjusted SG&A spending increased 2.1% in the quarter, entirely due to higher investments and the prior year one-time adjustment associated with previously disclosed legal accruals and settlements. Adjusted operating income declined 12.2% in the quarter and 9.6% full year. The quarter was held back by 9.4 percentage points of headwinds from higher investments and a one-time benefit in the prior year. Excluding these factors, the decline was low single digit. 
Now let's look in more detail at pharmacy. Total pharmacy sales increased 4.2% in the quarter and 8.6% for the year. Growth in the quarter reflected higher brand inflation and prescription volume growth along with growth in central specialty, which grew 7.8% in the quarter and over 20% for the year. Comp pharmacy sales increased 5.4% in the quarter and 4% for the year. Comp prescriptions grew 3.3% in the quarter and 3% for the year. The trend is improving with comp scripts up 4% in the second half versus 1.9% in the first half. 
As you will recall, we had some network headwinds in the first half, which we've now lapped. Market share was 21% in the quarter, down 55 basis points versus prior year, mainly due to the store optimization program. For the full year, market share increased 35 basis points to 21.3%. 
Pharmacy-adjusted gross profit increased in the quarter with script growth and procurement savings helping to mitigate reimbursement pressure. For the full year, pharmacy-adjusted gross profit was down slightly. Fourth quarter adjusted gross margin was 65 basis points lower than last year, including a 40 basis point mix impact from specialty. 
Turning next to our U.S. Retail business. Total retail sales declined 3.9% in the quarter impacted by store optimization. Comp retail sales declined 1.2% and, excluding tobacco, comp sales were up 0.5%. Full year comp sales declined 2.4% with 1.6 percentage points due to tobacco. 
Looking at the second half versus the first half. Second half comp sales were down 1.1% compared with a decline of 3.5% in the first half. Retail-adjusted gross profit declined in the quarter, mostly due to lower reported sales, which were negatively impacted by our store optimization program. We did say last quarter that we expected to see improved retail-adjusted gross margin in the fourth quarter, and I'm pleased to report that adjusted gross margin increased 35 basis points. Full year adjusted gross margin was down 20 basis points as we adjusted promotional spend in the earlier part of the year. 
Turning next to Retail Pharmacy International. And as usual, I'll talk to constant currency numbers. Boots UK comp pharmacy sales declined 2% in the quarter and 1.6% in the year, reflecting lower script volume and a lower NHS funding level due to timing shift between years. Boots UK comp retail sales declined 3.1% in the quarter and 2.6% in the year as the U.K. market continued to be very challenging. However, we held share in a declining U.K. market with good share performance in Beauty. Adjusted operating income was down 20.7% in the quarter and down 16.2% in the year, mainly due to weak retail sales and pressure on retail and pharmacy margins in the U.K. 
Turning now to the Pharmaceutical Wholesale division, which I'll also discuss in constant currency. Our Pharmaceutical Wholesale division delivered another strong quarter with sales up 7.9%, led by emerging markets and the U.K. In part, our U.K. performance was aided by a customer contract change, which contributed 2.3% of revenue growth. Fourth quarter adjusted operating income increased 6.9%, reflecting strong revenue performance and higher earnings from AmerisourceBergen. Full year sales increased 8%, and adjusted operating income increased 5.9% versus prior year. 
Turning next to cash flow. Full year operating cash flow was $5.6 billion, and free cash flow was $3.9 billion. Our free cash flow was impacted by some fairly large exceptional items, and we have covered these on previous calls. Excluding these exceptional items, our 2019 free cash flow was around $5.2 billion. 
I'll now hand over to Alex."

I'm going to update you on our initiatives in the U.K. and the U.S., starting with Boots UK. Last quarter, we talked about a number of initiatives to transform our retail offering, develop healthier services and accelerate digitalization",976,"Thank you, James. I'm going to update you on our initiatives in the U.K. and the U.S., starting with Boots UK. Last quarter, we talked about a number of initiatives to transform our retail offering, develop healthier services and accelerate digitalization in the U.K. We've introduced new beauty halls in 26 key locations, and we've opened up flagship stores in Covent Garden, London, and, more recently, in Meadowhall, Sheffield. 
We're also encouraged by our new brand introductions. 18 new beauty brands were introduced to key stores in the year and a further 17 in September. We're developing new initiatives in digital health care with plans for expanding pharmacy services to improve the customer journey and broaden access to health care. We launched our online pharmacy in May 2019, which we've expanded to includes repeat prescriptions. 
We've digitalized the Boots Advantage Card with an app now integrated across our all our main customer platforms. And importantly, boots.com performed well with sales up 14.4% in the year and 18.4% in the fourth quarter. As James mentioned, we continue to take actions to address our U.K. cost base. In February, we announced our intention to reduce Boots' head office costs by 20%. This program has now been completed, and the savings will come through in fiscal year 2020. 
In June, we announced a store optimization program that will impact around 200 Boots locations, reduce the store count by 18 stores by the end of the fiscal year, and they're on track to consolidate the remainder by the end of 2020. We have also generated cost reductions through simplification of our care home operations and the supply chain. 
Turning now to our strategic initiatives in the U.S. We have made significant progress on our 4 strategic priorities during the year. Let me start with a retail offering where we focus on delivering health, wellness, beauty and convenience, both in-store and online. 
We remain very pleased about our strategic partnership with Kroger. In August, we announced the expansion of our store pilot to new test locations in Knoxville, Tennessee. The Kroger Express concept will be available in 50 Walgreens stores, and their own health and beauty brands will be available to customers in 17 Kroger stores. 
We are extending our nationwide offering with FedEx. A new customer return system is being introduced to Walgreens stores before the holiday season, giving customers an easier returning service for unwanted goods for Walgreens and other selected retailers. We continue to look for solutions for the last mile, building on our presence in the community. We have recently announced our first-of-a-kind partnership with Wing to test on-demand drone delivery, joining up with our previously announced trial with FedEx for robot delivery. 
We continue to make progress in health and beauty. We have seen strong progress in the U.S. with No7 skincare, and we're expanding the distribution of No7 skincare in Walgreens in the months ahead. And last month, we launched a stand-alone No7 website, No7beauty.com, alongside a national U.S. TV campaign. 
Turning next to health care. We're strongly focused on creating neighborhood health destinations around a more modern pharmacy. We have made significant steps during the year to develop our primary care business. Our model is based on physicians and clinical pharmacists, and we'll have primary care locations in 4 markets across the U.S., working in partnership with partners in Primary Care, VillageMD and Southwest Medical, an Optum Company. We also have plans to develop a new wellness partnership in our stores, and I'm delighted to say that we've recently signed a new agreement with Jenny Craig, a health and weight loss management company, to open centers in around 100 Walgreens locations by early 2020. 
We have been reviewing our nurse practitioner clinic model. And we've taken a decision to exit our wholly-owned loss-making clinics, but we will continue to work with our local health system partner, who are running successful clinics in 217 Walgreens locations. We now have a network of 15 partners, and we recently signed a new agreement with TriHealth to add further 7 clinics. Our collaboration with LabCorp is well on track. We're aiming to open at least 600 LabCorp patient centers across the U.S., providing diagnostic lab testing in the community. We opened 21 centers in the fourth quarter, taking the total to 58. We've also expanded our reach in specialty, making an equity investment in specialty provider, Shields Health Solutions. 
We are an important partner for payers, anchored by a national network of local community pharmacies. And we continue to drive better clinical outcomes through patient medication adherence programs, such as Save a Trip Refills, which already has over 2.7 million patients signed up as we aim to lower the cost of care. As you've seen, we've announced a strategic partnership with Centene, a leading Medicaid insurer, and, RxAdvance, a cloud-based pharmacy benefit manager. And we recently signed a multiyear Medicare agreement with UnitedHealthCare, including a new co-branded Medicare Advantage plan, with Walgreens being the only preferred Retail Pharmacy. 
Turning next to digitalization. Our partnership with Microsoft signed in January is essential to driving a technology strategy, and a cloud migration program is on plan. We have expanded the Find Care platform available in walgreens.com to include new strategic partners and offerings and has now 30 health care providers and over 40 services. And we're making good progress in our existing omnichannel business. Our Walgreens app has been downloaded 58.9 million times, up 11.8% since last year, and around 26% of Walgreens retail refill scripts were initiated through digital channels in the quarter, up 14% since last year. And we also have increased our active Balance Rewards members to 89.7 million. Finally, we're also really pleased to report that Walgreens' digitally-initiated sales reached over $15 billion in the year, up around 25% on last year.

I'll now update you on our Transformational Cost Management Program while we're making strong progress. In April, we announced we were targeting annual cost savings in excess of $1.5 billion by fiscal 2022. We now have a clear line of sight to multiple cost savings initiatives over a multiyear period, and this gives us the confidence to increase our target. We're now raising the annual cost savings target to in excess of $1.8 billion by fiscal 2022. Additionally, we are rolling working capital programs into the cost management program governance, and we see meaningful opportunity to reduce working capital investments over the coming years. 
Regarding implementation costs, our estimates are unchanged versus the 8-K we filed on August 6. We continue to estimate that the program will result in cumulative GAAP pretax charges of approximately $1.9 billion to $2.4 billion. And we recently rebranded the cost management program internally. It's now called Save to Invest to Grow. This emphasizes that we must not only reduce costs to become the leanest operator, but we must also save more to generate the investment dollars needed to fuel long-term capabilities and growth. 
Let me give you a quick update on some of the actions taken in the quarter. On smart spend, we've started making policy changes. For example, we are changing how we manage the external consultants, mandating competitive bidding and making the contracts more outcome-based. On smart organization, last week, we made select reductions in the U.S. support office, and additional restructuring is underway in our Retail Pharmacy International and Pharmaceutical Wholesale divisions. We are also working hard to define our new vision and road map for business services. 
We have completed the review of our real estate footprint, and the actions are well underway in both the U.S. and the U.K. And dedicated teams are working hard against our biggest programs, particularly pharmacy costs to fill and shrink. We've reorganized our global, digital and IT leadership under a new chief information officer to improve execution and focus. We've also defined a new operating model for our day-to-day IT operations, and we've refocused our IT and digital spend to our growth priorities. 
Now let's turn to 2020. 
Let me start by providing some key assumptions for the upcoming year. We are projecting a full year adjusted effective tax rate of around 17%, and this may vary depending on the level of discrete items in the year. This will reduce adjusted EPS growth by approximately 2 percentage points as we lap an exceptionally low tax rate in fiscal 2019. 
We anticipate full year share repurchases of $1.75 billion. While this is lower than the $3.8 billion of repurchases in fiscal 2019, it is entirely consistent with our prior indications. Share repurchases should contribute around 3.5% to adjusted EPS growth. Within the guidance, we are investing heavily to transform WBA, including modernizing and upgrading our core foundational pharmacy systems and implementing SAP in the U.S. 
We are also investing in new digital capabilities, and we have fully funded the multiple pilots that are ongoing across health care and retail. In fiscal year '20, we expect to invest $800 million to $850 million, an increase of $250 million to $300 million over the prior year. In terms of operating expenses, we expect to invest $300 million to $350 million in 2020, a year-on-year increase of $100 million to $150 million. 
Looking specifically at capital expenditures. We anticipate investing around $500 million in fiscal 2020, and this comes on top of $350 million in fiscal '19. In summary, we are investing strategically to modernize and transform our capabilities to drive future growth. Finally, while we don't provide currency guidance, we have provided our internal currency rates in the appendix. As you will see, these assumptions are quite dated and, at the time, suggest that we could face a negative year-on-year currency impact of around $0.05. The only thing we can be sure of is that we can expect the situation in the U.K. to remain fluid. The pound/dollar rate has moved quite a bit, and external estimates range from $1.14 to $1.35. 
Turning now to adjusted EPS guidance for 2020. We are projecting constant currency adjusted EPS growth to be flat. And for a business of our size, you should expect a range of plus or minus 3%. As you work through your models, please note that year-on-year adjusted EPS growth is negatively impacted by a lower bonus payout in 2019, and this is a headwind of 6.5%. As we look at adjusted EPS phasing for fiscal year 2020, we expect a balanced performance between the first half and the second half with potentially a slightly stronger second half. 
Let me now summarize the projected key drivers of adjusted EPS. The lower 2019 fiscal bonus payout leads to a headwind of 6.5%. Obviously, this year-on-year impact will negatively impact both SG&A expense and adjusted operating income. The higher tax rate has an impact of approximately 2%. On the other hand, our share repurchase program should generate a favorable tailwind of around 3.5%. Excluding these headwinds and tailwinds, we would expect operational growth of around 5%. Within this 5% number, we are funding the incremental investments I mentioned earlier of around 2% and an approximate 1 percentage point impact from removing e-cigarettes from our stores. 
I will now hand you back to Stefano for his closing comments."

As you have heard, we anticipate a reasonable underlying operating performance for the coming year with solid underlying growth in most of our core businesses. This is very much in line with what we told you some months ago. 
The action that we have taken to transform our businesses and the drive and focus with which our teams our pursuing our strategic priorities gives me confidence in our ability to deliver this growth. I strongly believe in an expanded role for pharmacy and in our company's ability to play a significant part in shaping how health care is delivered in the community going forward. 
I remain convinced that we have, in our company, through our partnerships, an extraordinary foundation on which to build. The work currently underway on innovation and transformation across all our businesses, will mean we can and will continue to deliver real value for our customers and investors for many years to come.

I guess, can you walk through some of the components of that about maybe a little bit on how the company's thinking about volume growth. And I think particularly reimbursement is going to be a big question in 2020. So I guess, from a fundamental perspective, is, how are you seeing the business? Kind of what are the building blocks for growth for 2020?"
93624,637706108,1844384,"Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2019",2019-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.","Executives","Yes. So that's a good question. So the -- we did call out the operating performance once you take out the headwind coming from the prior year bonus of around 5%. And within that as well, we're also covering 2 percentage points of growth investments, so yo",491,"Yes. So that's a good question. So the -- we did call out the operating performance once you take out the headwind coming from the prior year bonus of around 5%. And within that as well, we're also covering 2 percentage points of growth investments, so you're getting closer to a 7%. And then we've removed e-cigarettes, so you could -- actually, if you strip out, these are all the puts and takes we've laid out on Slide 19. 
So the way I think you should think about this is we expect relative stability in the wholesale business. So you've seen the very strong performance in the current year. And I'd be calling on a -- something mid-single-digit revenue growth. And then I think as you look at the RPI segment, you'd be looking at probably flat to declining revenue until we see line of sight to improve market circumstances in the U.K. And that's the only question mark we have on the segment. 
And then in the U.S., I think this year, the way you should rationalize the U.S. is, this year we had a contribution coming from Rite Aid. If you kind of remove the contribution, I think we're looking forward to pretty strong script growth is our outlook. 
And then secondly, we see continued recovery in the retail business. So we had a very strong exit on retail compared with the first half. The same in pharmacy. We saw a strong recovery on scripts second half, first half. We expect to see a continuation of the improved trend. So that would lead to a low single digit revenue in the U.S. business. So I think if you look at the total company, I think we're looking at something in the low single digit revenue growth maybe 2%, maybe 3%. 
So take out Rite Aid this year and you get pretty close to the same kind of number. The way we thought about reimbursement is we've planned reimbursement slightly higher than the last 3-year average, and we expect 2020 to be a continued tough year on reimbursement. And we've planned it relatively conservatively higher than the last 3-year average, and we're not giving any more information on that. 
And then you've seen with the call up of the cost management program, that should give you the confidence that we will have a significant leverage on the cost side to -- so a combination of the solid revenue growth, plus generic procurement savings continuing at a similar level, plus a cost program that is really ramping up and gaining pace, gives us the comfort that we get to this mid-single-digit kind of range before the bonus impact. 
And know I'm not giving you a lot of insights here into how we talk through this. So reimbursement, a little bit higher than in the past, but a much stronger cost program to give us the confidence to deliver this base case."

It's an interesting question, and that's why we won't be providing growth savings on the call because I have a philosophy on this, which is, the only thing that matters is what hits the bottom line. And you know the circumstances of the company. And it's -- if you think about -- if you save on a gross basis, you got to offset your inflation. And for a company this size, you can work it out. It's probably $250 million. And then if you're growing your scripts 3%, 4%, 5%, that's another $100 million of incremental costs because you have an incremental cost impact every time you fill in new scripts. So you can be quite easily -- before you start the year, you're facing a $400 million headwind. So that's the first part. How do you offset inflation? And how do you offset the impact of volume growth? 
The second one, as you've seen, we've taken a very strong stance on the investments. And I don't want that message to be lost. We're hitting the previously indicated guidance range with substantially higher investments. And that's what the cost program is helping us deliver. So we, quite hopefully, put in the magnitude of the investments we're actually spending this year. And it somewhat gets back to the age of some of the systems we have in the company, where 40% of that investment we have year-on-year is going on new pharmacy systems in the U.S. and U.K. and implementation of SAP in the U.S. We will be able to take out an enormous amount of inventory over the next 3 years as we implement these systems. Enormous. So these systems will pay for themselves. 
The second -- the next, call it, third, is on new digital capabilities. And then the final piece is, every time we do a pilot -- and the pilots are starting to scale up. We have 50 plus, 70 -- 67 just on Kroger. It costs quite a bit of money to reorganize the stores and try these pilots. These are all fully funded. 
So that's -- long answer to your short question was the overhead is to pay for inflation. It's the dramatic step-change in the investment profile of the company to drive sustainable, long-term growth. That's the business we're in. We have to drive growth longer term, and then finally as part of the business model, where reimbursement is offset by general procurement savings volume and SG&A and cost discipline."

Our point on the scripts is if you take the second half versus first half, the scripts are now running at second half, 4%. And we had, as you know, a very weak first half. We were up 1.9%. And that's because we were lapping these, call it, network changes, where we lost 2 points in the previous 12 months. 
And then as you look at the investment profile, I guess, that's the upside scenario. We are quite conservative. We build in the cost of executing the initiatives. We do have working capital benefits built in our internal plans. They're quite sizable, so we do expect returns this current year on cash flow. 
On the pilots themselves, we're not counting on significant flows of income in 2020. These will be building over the next 3 years, and it depends on the success. Any one of them can become significant upside. We just have to see how the pilots play out in the next 12 months."

Yes, I think regarding prescription growth, we see a return to normal market growth in Med D, driven by the fact that we got preferred relationships with some of the bigger plans. And we may have lost some of the small preferred access, but they are very small numbers otherwise. So overall, we feel pretty good about that. You saw an announcement with Centene, where we intend to be more proactive in the Medicaid space going forward as well. There's 2 other areas that we're working on. First of all, we are able to retain more customers. For example, I mentioned Save a Trip Refill in our prepared remarks. That's driving better retention adherence. 
And last, not least, of course, we are able to consolidate pharmacies, not just Rite Aid, but the marketplace is changing. We're seeing more pharmacies than normal on the marketplace. And we have a good pipeline of pharmacies that we'll be able to secure in the future and consolidate as the number of pharmacies in the U.S. for the first time, for a long time, seem to be in decline.

So let me deal with our investment in Shields to start with that. They really work with health systems to enable the health system to take better care of the patients as they go back into community. We have a number of local assets, both in hospital systems and also specialty pharmacies, where we want to make sure that working with the local health system, we can help them to service and take care of that patient more directly. So it's early days, but that's the model there. Really, it's a community model. 
Our work with AllianceRX is really about the central model in the main, and, of course, working very closely with the owners of Prime, which are the Blues, and particularly the commercial contracts. Obviously, we've put together our business with their business just over 2 years ago. And the business is now performing, from an operational point of view, very well, but, clearly, the market is changing, and we're looking forward to how we can, of course, accelerate growth and work even closer with the Blues in that model going forward. 
So if you think of them as 2 separate areas at this stage, and, of course, we recognize the incredible importance of specialty and the new drugs in the marketplace in the years ahead, I think 50% of the value of medication will be in specialty within 3 years. So of course, we're working very hard on both the individual piece I've mentioned, but also how we combine the Walgreens brand and all of our assets over time to create a more powerful specialty model with our partners."

With the Shields one, it's an early stage investment. We're a minority shareholder, and we're developing the local community model and specialty. We believe that more and more patients will want to be taken care of closer to their home and closer to the community. And as drugs develop, there'll be new payment models that we believe this model will be more suited to."

So these stores were built in a time when a lot of inventory was in the physical location. If you plot out 3 years from now, there'll be no inventory in the stores in the back-office. So that freed up a couple 1,000, 2,000 square feet per stores. So if you think about it, the first piece of the development was free because we've downsized the back-office and the storage space. So the impact on our revenue throughput was minimal. 
And as we go through each of the partnerships, because we're getting an uplift, there's a lot of science that goes into this. So we'll be losing -- if you shrink the size of your retail footprint, how much you are losing versus you're going to get some uplift from the increased traffic, I don't think you're going to see a massive reduction in the space -- sorry, in the revenue as a result of this. Quite the contrary. So what you end up with is a more efficient box, where you're probably dedicating less space to some categories where you weren't making very much money. You've gotten rid of your storage. You got rid of your back-office. And then you've got value-added services who are attracting different customers in there. And ideally, your foot traffic has gone up as a result of that and a more efficient sales per square foot. So I don't think you'll see the revenue. I think Alex is right. I think you'll see the revenue find consistent with what we have potentially improving. And then you see a big change in the rent. And bear in mind that we're quite overrented, so it's a long-term opportunity for the company. Or versus our competitors, we probably, years ago, entered into lease contracts that were in the best locations, the nicest places and probably overpaid a bit. So as you look forward over a multiyear horizon, we would expect consistent, quite material reductions in the cost of rent. 
And then at the same time, we make each store more efficient in what's in each of the stores. I hope that gives you enough insights on it."

Now everybody is coming to this concept, but I can assure you that we are quite advanced -- more advanced than you can see outside the company. And we have done a lot of tests because when you change something in the company and you roll over your new ideas to the stores, you have to invest a huge amount of capital.
