Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today as we review our fourth quarter and full year 2018 results.
Our performance this past year and the actions we have taken over the last several years position us to capitalize on the many opportunities for profitable growth in the years to come. In fact, within the past 24 hours, we received notice from the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services that we were awarded a contract to provide managed-care services state-wide. While we'll celebrate this opportunity, we will quickly shift our focus to implementation tomorrow. And beginning Monday, we'll have senior leadership in the state to begin implementation planning for what is a very thoughtful and comprehensive program structure. We look forward to collaborating with providers and our state partners to serve the Medicaid beneficiaries throughout North Carolina for many years to come.
This morning, I'll highlight some of our accomplishments from 2018 and discuss how we are well-positioned for continued success the enterprise, then Drew will review our financial results in more detail and provide some commentary on our outlook for 2019.
We finished 2018 on a strong note, with full year adjusted earnings per diluted share of $11.03, an increase of nearly 30% as compared to 2017. Adjusted net income for the full year 2018 was 2.6%, a 30 basis point improvement year-over-year. Total revenue of $20.4 billion increased by 20% driven by our acquisition of Meridian and organic growth in our Medicaid and Medicare lines of business.
While we are pleased with our performance this past year, we're even more enthusiastic about the future. We enter 2019 with momentum and are increasing our full year 2019 adjusted earnings per diluted share guidance to a range of $13.25 to $13.50, reflecting our strong finish in 2018 and higher-than-expected enrollment in our Medicare PDP segment.
Turning to a review of our business segments. Our Medicaid Health Plans segment continues to perform well. At the end of the year, we served over 3.9 million Medicaid members, which represent an increase of over 44% versus a year ago. Our adjusted Medicaid premium revenue grew by more than 18%, driven by our mid-year acquisition of Meridian as well as organic growth in Illinois and Arizona.
Beginning December 1, 2018, we began the implementation of our new and expanded manage Medicare assistance contract and our new long-term care and serious mental illness contracts in Florida. While the implementation is still in its early days, it remains on schedule, and we look forward to providing multiyear benefits to our members, providers and state partners by facilitating cost-effective, high quality care. This expanded presence will increase our Florida Medicaid revenue by approximately $1.9 billion.
On January 1, as expected, our legacy Harmony Health Plan Medicaid members in Illinois were consolidated into our Meridian Health Plan. With the consolidation of these members into 1 contract, we expect to drive improved operational and financial performance over the next several years. Additionally, our overall Meridian integration continues to progress well. More recently, on February 1, we began the implementation of the Children's Medical Service contract in Florida. As a reminder, this state-wide program serves over 60,000 children with extremely complex physical and behavioral needs and is completely new to managed care. While the program just started, we are leveraging our expanded presence in Florida to engage with these children, their families, providers and state partners to effectively transition our members to a managed care program.
In Medicaid, we believe WellCare is differentiated through our local approach, coupled with our high touch, integrated care model, which incorporates physical, behavioral, pharmaceutical and social economic needs. By integrating our social determinants of health program, community connections within our care model, WellCare is able to support our members in unique and innovative ways, providing tangible benefits to their overall well-being. In 2018, for example, we connected more than 51,000 people to over 194,000 social service resources, displacing the need for higher cost services with less costly community-based solutions.
A recent example of the success of our local approach and integrated care model comes from our Arizona market where certain of our members faced immediate eviction as their building was condemned. Within a very short period, our local [ market ] team was able to identify the issue and engage with our local care managers and community connections social services program to provide alternative housing resources. We feel these programs are vital to our success and continue to focus on local and community-based solutions that have the potential to improve the overall health and well-being of our members.
Moving to our Medicare Health Plans segment. The premium revenue grew by nearly 19% year-over-year, driven by a combination of organic growth and our acquisition of Meridian. Through January, we served over 561,000 Medicare Advantage members across 22 states.
Our Medicare PDP business posted strong financial result in 2018 that exceeded our expectations. Driven by our new value script product, our enrollment was over 530,000 net new members in 2019. With the addition of new members on January 1, 2020, from the recently closed Aetna PDP divestiture, we expect to see further earnings contribution from our PDP segment in 2020.
Regarding the Aetna PDP transaction, we have already begun to work on ensuring an effective transition of these members for January 1, 2020. With the addition of these PDP members, we estimate that our total 2020 pharmacy spend across all of our lines of business will be approximately $15 billion to $20 billion.
As we look ahead, we continue to see a path to its continued earnings growth for WellCare. Some of the drivers of this growth are currently visible. Our Meridian business is expected to continue to improve and drive further accretion, our new business in the state of Florida is being structured for long-term profitability and success, and our recent PDP acquisition will provide further earnings growth in 2020 and beyond.
The recent North Carolina results, coupled with our #1 score in the most recent for the RFP, are validation of the years of investments into improving our capabilities and our solutions and are a testament to the effective execution by our 12,000 WellCare associates.
In closing, 2018 was a very good year for WellCare. We exited the year with continued momentum and line of sight to multiple earnings levers ahead of us. While we focus on the execution of our near-term commitments, we are also seeking out additional opportunities to drive further growth. The results of these efforts will provide further benefits to our members, providers, partners and shareholders. It's an exciting time for WellCare and we look forward to the next few years.
I'll now turn the call over to Drew for a discussion of our financial results. Drew?"

I'm going to provide you with a wrap up of 2018, including the fourth quarter highlights, and then focus on 2019 and beyond.
As Ken mentioned, 2018 was another very good year for WellCare with meaningful growth in revenue and earnings, but our best accomplishments were the actions we took in 2018 to drive business improvements growth in earnings in 2019 and beyond. We ended 2018 at $11.03 of adjusted EPS, above the top end of our prior 2018 guidance. This represents nearly 30% adjusted EPS growth year-over-year.
With respect to the fourth quarter, our adjusted EPS was $1.63, which was a slightly better result than we forecasted driven largely by continued PDP outperformance due to an MBR that came in below the low end of our prior guidance. Certainly a good way to exit 2018.
Regarding other metrics, the 2018 adjusted SG&A percentage of 8.3% ended up slightly better than the low end of our prior range. As of year-end, our debt-to-cap ratio was 33.4%, with parent cash at $516 million, approximately half of which is earmarked for statutory capital for known 2019 growth, and we have [ $1.1 billion ] available on our credit facility.
In Medicaid, our adjusted MBR ended up 10 basis points above the top of our prior guidance range as we establish the appropriate level of reserves for new business and revenue streams, including Meridian, Arizona and Florida. Absent reserve build, our Medicaid performance was right on track in the quarter. On that topic, days and claims payable was 52.2 days, slightly higher than the 51.9 days as of the end of 2017. Favorable prior development was $28.6 million in the fourth quarter, bringing the full year to $244 million. This compares to $225 million in 2017, good consistency.
Fundamentally, we are pleased with how we ended 2018 and entered 2019 with medical trends stable and in line with our expectations. So good metrics that give us confidence as we start 2019.
While we provided initial 2019 guidance on December 17, we're updating that guidance today to an adjusted EPS range of $13.25 to $13.50, largely reflecting higher PDP volume than previously expected. We also increased the midpoint of the PDP revenue by $50 million as all cover in a minute. Our current guidance excludes any impact from North Carolina in 2019.
A few other highlights from our 2019 guidance. Revenues growing nearly 30%, net income is growing 30% at the midpoint, adjusted EPS is growing 21% year-over-year, and all 3 of our business segments are showing meaningful organic growth year-over-year.
Let me share a few early updates for 2019. We had a strong PDP annual enrollment period and our PDP membership growth for January is over 530,000 net members. We were able to put forth a competitive product in our second enhanced plan based upon our strong pharmacy cost structure, the change in a meaningful difference rule for 2019 and a product structure that encourages the use of generics. For instance, we have deductibles for drugs classified in Tiers 3 through 5. Besides the business value of the new enhanced plan, we believe this growth in a chooser product will position us well as we prepare the addition of the Aetna PDP business in 2020.
In Medicare Advantage, we grew organically approximately 16,000 members in January of 2019. This represents about 3% growth compared to year-end and we are targeting 8% to 10% full-year membership growth in Medicare Advantage. As a reminder, we have a higher relative proportion of these [ SNIP ] dual specialty needs members and has historically experienced the majority of our membership growth outside of the annual enrollment period.
Our early read on the CMS advance notice for 2020 is that the rate increase for WellCare including the benefit we get for our [ star ] rating progression is around 2%. This pure rate change is before risk or a trend or the impact of the ACA fee.
Beyond 2019, we're excited about some positive levers that we have already created for 2020 and beyond. For instance, number one, we expect to advance the Meridian accretion $0.40 to $0.50 in 2019 to $0.70 to $0.80 in 2020 and $1 plus in 2021. Number two, we have cohorts of margin expansion opportunity in our new business such as the [ billing in 9 ] of new revenue in Florida in the legacy WellCare Illinois business, which was merged into Meridian effective January 1, 2019.
Three, WellCare will begin to receive the economic benefits from the Aetna PDP business effective January 1, 2020.
And 4, as Ken mentioned, with our additional pharmacy spend projected at $15 billion to $20 billion, we are enthusiastic about our PBM RFP to be launched this summer for an effective date of January 2021. It's actually fortuitous timing given the potential changing landscape in the pharmacy ecosystem.
As Ken mentioned, we are thrilled to be 1 of 4 state-wide awardees for the state of North Carolina's Medicare program. We'll be focused on execution as we work with the state on launching the new state-wide contract as early as November 1, 2019, for certain regions. As we're able to gain more information around this over, we will update investors regarding its projected financial impact.
While we finished 2018 strong, we've been focused on 2019 and beyond for some time. We're energized about the opportunity in government programs and WellCare's positioning to feed those opportunities. So while we are working on delivering on our commitments for 2019, we're also focused on driving success in 2020 and beyond.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today as we review our fourth quarter and full year 2018 results.
Our performance this past year and the actions we have taken over the last several years position us to capitalize on the many opportunities for profitable growth in the years to come. In fact, within the past 24 hours, we received notice from the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services that we were awarded a contract to provide managed care services state-wide. While we'll celebrate this award today, we will quickly shift our focus to implementation tomorrow. And beginning Monday, we'll have senior leadership in the state to begin implementation planning for what is a very thoughtful and comprehensive program structure. We look forward to collaborating with providers and our state partners to serve the Medicaid beneficiaries throughout North Carolina for many years to come.
This morning, I'll highlight some of our accomplishments from 2018 and discuss how we are well positioned for continued success across the enterprise, then Drew will review our financial results in more detail and provide some commentary on our outlook for 2019.
We finished 2018 on a strong note, with full year adjusted earnings per diluted share of $11.03, an increase of nearly 30% as compared to 2017. Adjusted net income for the full year 2018 was 2.6%, a 30 basis point improvement year-over-year. Total revenue of $20.4 billion increased by 20% driven by our acquisition of Meridian and organic growth in our Medicaid and Medicare lines of business.
While we are pleased with our performance this past year, we're even more enthusiastic about the future. We enter 2019 with momentum and are increasing our full year 2019 adjusted earnings per diluted share guidance to a range of $13.25 to $13.50, reflecting our strong finish in 2018 and higher-than-expected enrollment in our Medicare PDP segment.
Turning to a review of our business segments. Our Medicaid Health Plans segment continues to perform well. At the end of the year, we served over 3.9 million Medicaid members, which represent an increase of over 44% versus a year ago. Our adjusted Medicaid premium revenue grew by more than 18% driven by our midyear acquisition of Meridian as well as organic growth in Illinois and Arizona.
Beginning December 1, 2018, we began the implementation of our new and expanded managed Medicare assistance contract and our new long-term care and serious mental illness contracts in Florida. While the implementation is still in its early days, it remains on schedule, and we look forward to providing multiyear benefits to our members, providers and state partners by facilitating cost-effective, high-quality care. This expanded presence will increase our Florida Medicaid revenue by approximately $1.9 billion.
On January 1, as expected, our legacy Harmony Health Plan Medicaid members in Illinois were consolidated into our Meridian Health Plan. With the consolidation of these members into 1 contract, we expect to drive improved operational and financial performance over the next several years. Additionally, our overall Meridian integration continues to progress well. More recently, on February 1, we began the implementation of the Children's Medical Services contract in Florida. As a reminder, this state-wide program serves over 60,000 children with extremely complex physical and behavioral needs and is completely new to managed care. While the program just started, we are leveraging our expanded presence in Florida to engage with these children, their families, providers and state partners to effectively transition our members to a managed care program.
In Medicaid, we believe WellCare is differentiated through our local approach, coupled with our high-touch, integrated care model, which incorporates physical, behavioral, pharmaceutical and socioeconomic needs. By integrating our social determinants of health program, Community Connections, within our care model, WellCare is able to support our members in unique and innovative ways, providing tangible benefits to their overall well-being. In 2018, for example, we connected more than 51,000 people to over 194,000 social service resources, displacing the need for higher cost services with less costly community-based solutions.
A recent example of the success of our local approach and integrated care model comes from our Arizona market where certain of our members faced immediate eviction as their building was condemned. Within a very short period, our local market team was able to identify the issue and engage with our local care managers and Community Connections' social services program to provide alternative housing resources. We feel these programs are vital to our success and continue to focus on local and community-based solutions that have the potential to improve the overall health and well-being of our members.
Moving to our Medicare Health Plans segment. The premium revenue grew by nearly 19% year-over-year driven by a combination of organic growth and our acquisition of Meridian. Through January, we served over 561,000 Medicare Advantage members across 22 states.
Our Medicare PDP business posted strong financial result in 2018 that exceeded our expectations. Driven by our new Value Script product, our enrollment was over 530,000 net new members in 2019. With the addition of new members on January 1, 2020, from the recently closed Aetna PDP divestiture, we expect to see further earnings contribution from our PDP segment in 2020.
Regarding the Aetna PDP transaction, we have already begun to work on ensuring an effective transition of these members for January 1, 2020. With the addition of these PDP members, we estimate that our total 2020 pharmacy spend across all of our lines of business will be approximately $15 billion to $20 billion.
As we look ahead, we continue to see a path towards continued earnings growth for WellCare. Some of the drivers of this growth are currently visible. Our Meridian business is expected to continue to improve and drive further accretion. Our new business in the State of Florida is being structured for long-term profitability and success. And our recent PDP acquisition will provide further earnings growth in 2020 and beyond.
The recent North Carolina results, coupled with our #1 score in the most recent Florida RFP, are a validation of the years of investments into improving our capabilities and our solutions and are a testament to the effective execution by our 12,000 WellCare associates.
In closing, 2018 was a very good year for WellCare. We exited the year with continued momentum and line of sight to multiple earnings levers ahead of us. While we focus on the execution of our near-term commitments, we are also seeking out additional opportunities to drive further growth. The results of these efforts will provide further benefits to our members, providers, partners and shareholders. It's an exciting time for WellCare, and we look forward to the next few years.
I'll now turn the call over to Drew for a discussion of our financial results. Drew?"
9026347,598287999,1647111,"WellCare Health Plans, Inc., Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Feb 05, 2019",2019-02-05,"Earnings Calls","WellCare Health Plans, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ken. I'm going to provide you with a wrap-up of 2018, including the fourth quarter highlights, and then focus on 2019 and beyond.As Ken mentioned, 2018 was another very good year for WellCare with meaningful growth in revenue and earnings. But o",935,"Thanks, Ken. I'm going to provide you with a wrap-up of 2018, including the fourth quarter highlights, and then focus on 2019 and beyond.
As Ken mentioned, 2018 was another very good year for WellCare with meaningful growth in revenue and earnings. But our best accomplishments were the actions we took in 2018 to drive business improvements growth in earnings in 2019 and beyond. We ended 2018 at $11.03 of adjusted EPS, above the top end of our prior 2018 guidance. This represents nearly 30% adjusted EPS growth year-over-year.
With respect to the fourth quarter, our adjusted EPS was $1.63, which was a slightly better result than we have forecasted driven largely by continued PDP outperformance due to an MBR that came in below the low end of our prior guidance. Certainly, a good way to exit 2018.
Regarding other metrics, the 2018 adjusted SG&A percentage of 8.3% ended up slightly better than the low end of our prior range. As of year-end, our debt-to-cap ratio was 33.4%, with parent cash at $516 million, approximately half of which is earmarked for statutory capital for known 2019 growth, and we have $1.1 billion available on our credit facility.
In Medicaid, our adjusted MBR ended up 10 basis points above the top of our prior guidance range as we establish the appropriate level of reserves for new business and revenue streams, including Meridian, Arizona and Florida. Absent reserve build, our Medicaid performance was right on track in the quarter. On that topic, days in claims payable was 52.2 days, slightly higher than the 51.9 days as of the end of 2017. Favorable prior year development was $28.6 million in the fourth quarter, bringing the full year to $244 million. This compares to $225 million in 2017, good consistency.
Fundamentally, we are pleased with how we ended 2018 and entered 2019 with medical trends stable and in line with our expectations. So good metrics that give us confidence as we start 2019.
While we've provided initial 2019 guidance on December 17, we're updating that guidance today to an adjusted EPS range of $13.25 to $13.50, largely reflecting higher PDP volume than previously expected. We also increased the midpoint of the PDP revenue by $50 million as I'll cover in a minute. Our current guidance excludes any impact from North Carolina in 2019.
A few other highlights from our 2019 guidance. Revenues growing nearly 30%, net income is growing 30% at the midpoint, adjusted EPS is growing 21% year-over-year, and all 3 of our business segments are showing meaningful organic growth year-over-year.
Let me share a few early updates for 2019. We had a strong PDP annual enrollment period, and our PDP membership growth for January is over 530,000 net members. We were able to put forth a competitive product in our second enhanced plan based upon our strong pharmacy cost structure, the change in the meaningful difference rule for 2019 and the product structure that encourages the use of generics. For instance, we have deductibles for drugs classified in Tiers 3 through 5. Besides the business value of the new enhanced plan, we believe this growth in the chooser product will position us well as we prepare for the addition of the Aetna PDP business in 2020.
In Medicare Advantage, we grew organically approximately 16,000 members in January of 2019. This represents about 3% growth compared to year-end, and we are targeting 8% to 10% full year membership growth in Medicare Advantage. As a reminder, we have a higher relative proportion of D-SNP, Dual Special Needs Plan, members and has historically experienced the majority of our membership growth outside of the annual enrollment period.
Our early read on the CMS advance notice for 2020 is that the rate increase for WellCare, including the benefit we get for our Star Rating progression, is around 2%. This pure rate change is before risk or a trend and the impact of the ACA fee.
Beyond 2019, we're excited about some positive levers that we have already created for 2020 and beyond. For instance, number one, we expect to advance the Meridian accretion from $0.40 to $0.50 in 2019 to $0.70 to $0.80 in 2020 and $1-plus in 2021. Number two, we have cohorts of margin expansion opportunity in our new business such as the $1.9 billion of new revenue in Florida and the legacy WellCare Illinois business, which was merged into Meridian effective January 1, 2019. Three, WellCare will begin to receive the economic benefits from the Aetna PDP business effective January 1, 2020. And four, as Ken mentioned, with our additional pharmacy spend projected at $15 billion to $20 billion, we are enthusiastic about our PBM RFP to be launched this summer for an effective date of January 1, 2021. It's actually fortuitous timing given the potential changing landscape in the pharmacy ecosystem.
As Ken mentioned, we are thrilled to be 1 of 4 state-wide awardees for the State of North Carolina's Medicaid program. We'll be focused on execution as we work with the state on launching the new state-wide contract as early as November 1, 2019, for certain regions. As we're able to gain more information around this award, we will update investors regarding its projected financial impact.
While we finished 2018 strong, we've been focused on 2019 and beyond for some time. We're energized about the opportunity in government programs and WellCare's positioning to feast those opportunities. So while we are working on delivering on our commitments for 2019, we're also focused on driving success in 2020 and beyond.

But we're just thrilled with this award because it -- again, it falls in that line of what we've seen recently, a very thoughtful, rigorous program, a highly competitive procurement process, and the philosophy, the underpinnings behind this program are all about integration of physical, behavioral and pharmacy as well as an extremely strong emphasis on the social determinants of health, including food and security, stable housing, transportation, domestic violence, et cetera, so very forward-looking program. And we're committed to doing a great job, and we're all going to advance our gain by virtue of participating in this program."

But you're right, when you look at the full year, in our business, we're so dependent on -- in terms of the cash flow statement optics on when a state pays their bills or when the federal government decides on the 31st to pay or on the 1st to pay you. And so there's really not this notion of uncollectible receivables in the managed care industry. But if Illinois drags an extra month, that's going to be a cash flow item what, and we're a pretty big customer there. They're about half of our receivable on the books. At 12/31, by the way, they made a $260 million payment in January. So these timing elements are going to drive the mechanics around the cash flow statement, but you really have to understand the business in the context because honored premiums will swing, receivables will swing, the ACA fee receivable reimbursement on Medicaid will be a swing item, which is merely timing."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today as we review our fourth quarter and full year 2018 results.
Our performance this past year and the actions we have taken over the last several years position us to capitalize on the many opportunities for profitable growth in the years to come. In fact, within the past 24 hours, we received notice from the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services that we were awarded a contract to provide managed care services state-wide. While we'll celebrate this award today, we will quickly shift our focus to implementation tomorrow. And beginning Monday, we'll have senior leadership in the state to begin implementation planning for what is a very thoughtful and comprehensive program structure. We look forward to collaborating with providers and our state partners to serve the Medicaid beneficiaries throughout North Carolina for many years to come.
This morning, I'll highlight some of our accomplishments from 2018 and discuss how we are well positioned for continued success across the enterprise, then Drew will review our financial results in more detail and provide some commentary on our outlook for 2019.
We finished 2018 on a strong note, with full year adjusted earnings per diluted share of $11.03, an increase of nearly 30% as compared to 2017. Adjusted net income for the full year 2018 was 2.6%, a 30 basis point improvement year-over-year. Total revenue of $20.4 billion increased by 20% driven by our acquisition of Meridian and organic growth in our Medicaid and Medicare lines of business.
While we are pleased with our performance this past year, we're even more enthusiastic about the future. We enter 2019 with momentum and are increasing our full year 2019 adjusted earnings per diluted share guidance to a range of $13.25 to $13.50, reflecting our strong finish in 2018 and higher-than-expected enrollment in our Medicare PDP segment.
Turning to a review of our business segments. Our Medicaid Health Plans segment continues to perform well. At the end of the year, we served over 3.9 million Medicaid members, which represent an increase of over 44% versus a year ago. Our adjusted Medicaid premium revenue grew by more than 18%, driven by our midyear acquisition of Meridian as well as organic growth in Illinois and Arizona.
Beginning December 1, 2018, we began the implementation of our new and expanded managed Medicare assistance contract and our new long-term care and serious mental illness contracts in Florida. While the implementation is still in its early days, it remains on schedule, and we look forward to providing multiyear benefits to our members, providers and state partners by facilitating cost-effective, high-quality care. This expanded presence will increase our Florida Medicaid revenue by approximately $1.9 billion.
On January 1, as expected, our legacy Harmony Health Plan Medicaid members in Illinois were consolidated into our Meridian Health Plan. With the consolidation of these members into 1 contract, we expect to drive improved operational and financial performance over the next several years. Additionally, our overall Meridian integration continues to progress well. More recently, on February 1, we began the implementation of the Children's Medical Services contract in Florida. As a reminder, this state-wide program serves over 60,000 children with extremely complex physical and behavioral needs and is completely new to managed care. While the program just started, we are leveraging our expanded presence in Florida to engage with these children, their families, providers and state partners to effectively transition our members to a managed care program.
In Medicaid, we believe WellCare is differentiated through our local approach, coupled with our high-touch, integrated care model, which incorporates physical, behavioral, pharmaceutical and socioeconomic needs. By integrating our social determinants of health program, Community Connections, within our care model, WellCare is able to support our members in unique and innovative ways, providing tangible benefits to their overall well-being. In 2018, for example, we connected more than 51,000 people to over 194,000 social service resources, displacing the need for higher cost services with less costly community-based solutions.
A recent example of the success of our local approach and integrated care model comes from our Arizona market where certain of our members faced immediate eviction as their building was condemned. Within a very short period, our local market team was able to identify the issue and engage with our local care managers and Community Connections' social services program to provide alternative housing resources. We feel these programs are vital to our success and continue to focus on local and community-based solutions that have the potential to improve the overall health and well-being of our members.
Moving to our Medicare Health Plan segment. The premium revenue grew by nearly 19% year-over-year, driven by a combination of organic growth and our acquisition of Meridian. Through January, we served over 561,000 Medicare Advantage members across 22 states.
Our Medicare PDP business posted strong financial results in 2018 that exceeded our expectations. Driven by our new Value Script product, our enrollment was over 530,000 net new members in 2019. With the addition of new members on January 1, 2020, from the recently closed Aetna PDP divestiture, we expect to see further earnings contribution from our PDP segment in 2020.
Regarding the Aetna PDP transaction, we have already begun to work on ensuring an effective transition of these members for January 1, 2020. With the addition of these PDP members, we estimate that our total 2020 pharmacy spend across all of our lines of business will be approximately $15 billion to $20 billion.
As we look ahead, we continue to see a path towards continued earnings growth for WellCare. Some of the drivers of this growth are currently visible. Our Meridian business is expected to continue to improve and drive further accretion. Our new business in the State of Florida is being structured for long-term profitability and success. And our recent PDP acquisition will provide further earnings growth in 2020 and beyond.
The recent North Carolina results, coupled with our #1 score in the most recent Florida RFP, are a validation of the years of investments into improving our capabilities and our solutions and are a testament to the effective execution by our 12,000 WellCare associates.
In closing, 2018 was a very good year for WellCare. We exited the year with continued momentum and line of sight to multiple earnings levers ahead of us. While we focus on the execution of our near-term commitments, we are also seeking out additional opportunities to drive further growth. The results of these efforts will provide further benefits to our members, providers, partners and shareholders. It's an exciting time for WellCare, and we look forward to the next few years.
I'll now turn the call over to Drew for a discussion of our financial results. Drew?"

I'm going to provide you with a wrap-up of 2018, including the fourth quarter highlights, and then focus on 2019 and beyond.As Ken mentioned, 2018 was another very good year for WellCare with meaningful growth in revenue and earnings. But o",935,"Thanks, Ken. I'm going to provide you with a wrap-up of 2018, including the fourth quarter highlights, and then focus on 2019 and beyond.
As Ken mentioned, 2018 was another very good year for WellCare with meaningful growth in revenue and earnings. But our best accomplishments were the actions we took in 2018 to drive business improvements growth in earnings in 2019 and beyond. We ended 2018 at $11.03 of adjusted EPS, above the top end of our prior 2018 guidance. This represents nearly 30% adjusted EPS growth year-over-year.
With respect to the fourth quarter, our adjusted EPS was $1.63, which was a slightly better result than we had forecasted, driven largely by continued PDP outperformance due to an MBR that came in below the low end of our prior guidance. Certainly, a good way to exit 2018.
Regarding other metrics, the 2018 adjusted SG&A percentage of 8.3% ended up slightly better than the low end of our prior range. As of year-end, our debt-to-cap ratio was 33.4%, with parent cash at $516 million, approximately half of which is earmarked for statutory capital for known 2019 growth, and we have $1.1 billion available on our credit facility.
In Medicaid, our adjusted MBR ended up 10 basis points above the top of our prior guidance range as we establish the appropriate level of reserves for new business and revenue streams, including Meridian, Arizona and Florida. Absent reserve build, our Medicaid performance was right on track in the quarter. On that topic, days in claims payable was 52.2 days, slightly higher than the 51.9 days as of the end of 2017. Favorable prior year development was $28.6 million in the fourth quarter, bringing the full year to $244 million. This compares to $225 million in 2017, good consistency.
Fundamentally, we are pleased with how we ended 2018 and entered 2019 with medical trends stable and in line with our expectations. So, good metrics that give us confidence as we start 2019.
While we've provided initial 2019 guidance on December 17, we're updating that guidance today to an adjusted EPS range of $13.25 to $13.50, largely reflecting higher PDP volume than previously expected. We also increased the midpoint of the PDP revenue by $50 million as I'll cover in a minute. Our current guidance excludes any impact from North Carolina in 2019.
A few other highlights from our 2019 guidance. Revenue's growing nearly 30%, net income is growing 30% at the midpoint, adjusted EPS is growing 21% year-over-year, and all 3 of our business segments are showing meaningful organic growth year-over-year.
Let me share a few early updates for 2019. We had a strong PDP annual enrollment period, and our PDP membership growth for January is over 530,000 net members. We were able to put forth a competitive product in our second enhanced plan based upon our strong pharmacy cost structure, the change in the meaningful difference rule for 2019 and the product structure that encourages the use of generics. For instance, we have deductibles for drugs classified in Tiers 3 through 5. Besides the business value of the new enhanced plan, we believe this growth in the chooser product will position us well as we prepare for the addition of the Aetna PDP business in 2020.
In Medicare Advantage, we grew organically approximately 16,000 members in January of 2019. This represents about 3% growth compared to year-end, and we are targeting 8% to 10% full year membership growth in Medicare Advantage. As a reminder, we have a higher relative proportion of D-SNP, Dual Special Needs Plan, members and has historically experienced the majority of our membership growth outside of the annual enrollment period.
Our early read on the CMS advance notice for 2020 is that the rate increase for WellCare, including the benefit we get for our Star Rating progression, is around 2%. This pure rate change is before risk or a trend and the impact of the ACA fee.
Beyond 2019, we're excited about some positive levers that we have already created for 2020 and beyond. For instance, number one, we expect to advance the Meridian accretion from $0.40 to $0.50 in 2019 to $0.70 to $0.80 in 2020 and $1-plus in 2021. Number two, we have cohorts of margin expansion opportunity in our new business, such as the $1.9 billion of new revenue in Florida and the legacy WellCare Illinois business, which was merged into Meridian effective January 1, 2019. Three, WellCare will begin to receive the economic benefits from the Aetna PDP business effective January 1, 2020. And four, as Ken mentioned, with our additional pharmacy spend projected at $15 billion to $20 billion, we are enthusiastic about our PBM RFP to be launched this summer for an effective date of January 1, 2021. It's actually fortuitous timing given the potential changing landscape in the pharmacy ecosystem.
As Ken mentioned, we are thrilled to be 1 of 4 state-wide awardees for the State of North Carolina's Medicaid program. We'll be focused on execution as we work with the state on launching the new state-wide contract as early as November 1, 2019, for certain regions. As we're able to gain more information around this award, we will update investors regarding its projected financial impact.
While we finished 2018 strong, we've been focused on 2019 and beyond for some time. We're energized about the opportunity in government programs and WellCare's positioning to seize those opportunities. So while we are working on delivering on our commitments for 2019, we're also focused on driving success in 2020 and beyond.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today as we review our fourth quarter and full year 2018 results.
Our performance this past year and the actions we have taken over the last several years position us to capitalize on the many opportunities for profitable growth in the years to come. In fact, within the past 24 hours, we received notice from the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services that we were awarded a contract to provide managed care services statewide. While we'll celebrate this award today, we will quickly shift our focus to implementation tomorrow. And beginning Monday, we'll have senior leadership in the state to begin implementation planning for what is a very thoughtful and comprehensive program structure. We look forward to collaborating with providers and our state partners to serve the Medicaid beneficiaries throughout North Carolina for many years to come.
This morning, I'll highlight some of our accomplishments from 2018 and discuss how we are well positioned for continued success across the enterprise, then Drew will review our financial results in more detail and provide some commentary on our outlook for 2019.
We finished 2018 on a strong note, with full year adjusted earnings per diluted share of $11.03, an increase of nearly 30% as compared to 2017. Adjusted net income for the full year 2018 was 2.6%, a 30 basis point improvement year-over-year. Total revenue of $20.4 billion increased by 20% driven by our acquisition of Meridian and organic growth in our Medicaid and Medicare lines of business.
While we are pleased with our performance this past year, we're even more enthusiastic about the future. We enter 2019 with momentum and are increasing our full year 2019 adjusted earnings per diluted share guidance to a range of $13.25 to $13.50, reflecting our strong finish in 2018 and higher-than-expected enrollment in our Medicare PDP segment.
Turning to a review of our business segments. Our Medicaid Health Plans segment continues to perform well. At the end of the year, we served over 3.9 million Medicaid members, which represent an increase of over 44% versus a year ago. Our adjusted Medicaid premium revenue grew by more than 18%, driven by our midyear acquisition of Meridian as well as organic growth in Illinois and Arizona.
Beginning December 1, 2018, we began the implementation of our new and expanded managed Medicare assistance contract and our new long-term care and serious mental illness contracts in Florida. While the implementation is still in its early days, it remains on schedule, and we look forward to providing multiyear benefits to our members, providers and state partners by facilitating cost-effective, high-quality care. This expanded presence will increase our Florida Medicaid revenue by approximately $1.9 billion.
On January 1, as expected, our legacy Harmony Health Plan Medicaid members in Illinois were consolidated into our Meridian Health Plan. With the consolidation of these members into 1 contract, we expect to drive improved operational and financial performance over the next several years. Additionally, our overall Meridian integration continues to progress well. More recently, on February 1, we began the implementation of the Children's Medical Services contract in Florida. As a reminder, this statewide program serves over 60,000 children with extremely complex physical and behavioral needs and is completely new to managed care. While the program just started, we are leveraging our expanded presence in Florida to engage with these children, their families, providers and state partners to effectively transition our members to a managed care program.
In Medicaid, we believe WellCare is differentiated through our local approach, coupled with our high-touch, integrated care model, which incorporates physical, behavioral, pharmaceutical and socioeconomic needs. By integrating our social determinants of health program, Community Connections, within our care model, WellCare is able to support our members in unique and innovative ways, providing tangible benefits to their overall well-being. In 2018, for example, we connected more than 51,000 people to over 194,000 social service resources, displacing the need for higher cost services with less costly community-based solutions.
A recent example of the success of our local approach and integrated care model comes from our Arizona market where certain of our members faced immediate eviction as their building was condemned. Within a very short period, our local market team was able to identify the issue and engage with our local care managers and Community Connections' social services program to provide alternative housing resources. We feel these programs are vital to our success and continue to focus on local and community-based solutions that have the potential to improve the overall health and well-being of our members.
Moving to our Medicare Health Plan segment. The premium revenue grew by nearly 19% year-over-year, driven by a combination of organic growth and our acquisition of Meridian. Through January, we served over 561,000 Medicare Advantage members across 22 states.
Our Medicare PDP business posted strong financial results in 2018 that exceeded our expectations. Driven by our new Value Script product, our enrollment was over 530,000 net new members in 2019. With the addition of new members on January 1, 2020, from the recently closed Aetna PDP divestiture, we expect to see further earnings contribution from our PDP segment in 2020.
Regarding the Aetna PDP transaction, we have already begun to work on ensuring an effective transition of these members for January 1, 2020. With the addition of these PDP members, we estimate that our total 2020 pharmacy spend across all of our lines of business will be approximately $15 billion to $20 billion.
As we look ahead, we continue to see a path towards continued earnings growth for WellCare. Some of the drivers of this growth are currently visible. Our Meridian business is expected to continue to improve and drive further accretion. Our new business in the State of Florida is being structured for long-term profitability and success. And our recent PDP acquisition will provide further earnings growth in 2020 and beyond.
The recent North Carolina results, coupled with our #1 score in the most recent Florida RFP, are a validation of the years of investments into improving our capabilities and our solutions and are a testament to the effective execution by our 12,000 WellCare associates.
In closing, 2018 was a very good year for WellCare. We exited the year with continued momentum and line of sight to multiple earnings levers ahead of us. While we focus on the execution of our near-term commitments, we are also seeking out additional opportunities to drive further growth. The results of these efforts will provide further benefits to our members, providers, partners and shareholders. It's an exciting time for WellCare, and we look forward to the next few years.
I'll now turn the call over to Drew for a discussion of our financial results. Drew?"
9026347,598287999,1649015,"WellCare Health Plans, Inc., Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Feb 05, 2019",2019-02-05,"Earnings Calls","WellCare Health Plans, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ken. I'm going to provide you with a wrap-up of 2018, including the fourth quarter highlights, and then focus on 2019 and beyond.As Ken mentioned, 2018 was another very good year for WellCare with meaningful growth in revenue and earnings. But o",935,"Thanks, Ken. I'm going to provide you with a wrap-up of 2018, including the fourth quarter highlights, and then focus on 2019 and beyond.
As Ken mentioned, 2018 was another very good year for WellCare with meaningful growth in revenue and earnings. But our best accomplishments were the actions we took in 2018 to drive business improvements growth in earnings in 2019 and beyond. We ended 2018 at $11.03 of adjusted EPS, above the top end of our prior 2018 guidance. This represents nearly 30% adjusted EPS growth year-over-year.
With respect to the fourth quarter, our adjusted EPS was $1.63, which was a slightly better result than we had forecasted, driven largely by continued PDP outperformance due to an MBR that came in below the low end of our prior guidance. Certainly, a good way to exit 2018.
Regarding other metrics, the 2018 adjusted SG&A percentage of 8.3% ended up slightly better than the low end of our prior range. As of year-end, our debt-to-cap ratio was 33.4%, with parent cash at $516 million, approximately half of which is earmarked for statutory capital for known 2019 growth, and we have $1.1 billion available on our credit facility.
In Medicaid, our adjusted MBR ended up 10 basis points above the top of our prior guidance range as we establish the appropriate level of reserves for new business and revenue streams, including Meridian, Arizona and Florida. Absent reserve build, our Medicaid performance was right on track in the quarter. On that topic, days in claims payable was 52.2 days, slightly higher than the 51.9 days as of the end of 2017. Favorable prior year development was $28.6 million in the fourth quarter, bringing the full year to $244 million. This compares to $225 million in 2017, good consistency.
Fundamentally, we are pleased with how we ended 2018 and entered 2019 with medical trends stable and in line with our expectations. So, good metrics that give us confidence as we start 2019.
While we've provided initial 2019 guidance on December 17, we're updating that guidance today to an adjusted EPS range of $13.25 to $13.50, largely reflecting higher PDP volume than previously expected. We also increased the midpoint of the PDP revenue by $50 million as I'll cover in a minute. Our current guidance excludes any impact from North Carolina in 2019.
A few other highlights from our 2019 guidance. Revenue's growing nearly 30%, net income is growing 30% at the midpoint, adjusted EPS is growing 21% year-over-year, and all 3 of our business segments are showing meaningful organic growth year-over-year.
Let me share a few early updates for 2019. We had a strong PDP annual enrollment period, and our PDP membership growth for January is over 530,000 net members. We were able to put forth a competitive product in our second enhanced plan based upon our strong pharmacy cost structure, the change in the meaningful difference rule for 2019 and the product structure that encourages the use of generics. For instance, we have deductibles for drugs classified in Tiers 3 through 5. Besides the business value of the new enhanced plan, we believe this growth in the chooser product will position us well as we prepare for the addition of the Aetna PDP business in 2020.
In Medicare Advantage, we grew organically approximately 16,000 members in January of 2019. This represents about 3% growth compared to year-end, and we are targeting 8% to 10% full year membership growth in Medicare Advantage. As a reminder, we have a higher relative proportion of D-SNP, Dual Special Needs Plan, members and has historically experienced the majority of our membership growth outside of the annual enrollment period.
Our early read on the CMS advance notice for 2020 is that the rate increase for WellCare, including the benefit we get for our Star Rating progression, is around 2%. This pure rate change is before risk or a trend and the impact of the ACA fee.
Beyond 2019, we're excited about some positive levers that we have already created for 2020 and beyond. For instance, number one, we expect to advance the Meridian accretion from $0.40 to $0.50 in 2019 to $0.70 to $0.80 in 2020 and $1-plus in 2021. Number two, we have cohorts of margin expansion opportunity in our new business, such as the $1.9 billion of new revenue in Florida and the legacy WellCare Illinois business, which was merged into Meridian effective January 1, 2019. Three, WellCare will begin to receive the economic benefits from the Aetna PDP business effective January 1, 2020. And four, as Ken mentioned, with our additional pharmacy spend projected at $15 billion to $20 billion, we are enthusiastic about our PBM RFP to be launched this summer for an effective date of January 1, 2021. It's actually fortuitous timing given the potential changing landscape in the pharmacy ecosystem.
As Ken mentioned, we are thrilled to be 1 of 4 statewide awardees for the State of North Carolina's Medicaid program. We'll be focused on execution as we work with the state on launching the new statewide contract as early as November 1, 2019, for certain regions. As we're able to gain more information around this award, we will update investors regarding its projected financial impact.
While we finished 2018 strong, we've been focused on 2019 and beyond for some time. We're energized about the opportunity in government programs and WellCare's positioning to seize those opportunities.

And for those of you that aren't familiar, this current award covers TANF, CHIP and ABD with some very select nonwaiver LTSS membership. So behind David's question is this notion that by winning this, we're pretty enthusiastic about our opportunity as they add some additional more complex populations in the years to come. But there have been no commitments made by Secretary Cohen or anybody else in North Carolina as it relates to the timing. But we're just thrilled with this award because it -- again, it falls in that line of what we've seen recently, a very thoughtful, rigorous program, a highly competitive procurement process, and the philosophy, the underpinnings behind this program are all about integration of physical, behavioral and pharmacy as well as an extremely strong emphasis on the social determinants of health, including food and security, stable housing, transportation, domestic violence, et cetera, so very forward-looking program. And we're committed to doing a great job, and we're all going to advance our gain by virtue of participating in this program."

But you're right, when you look at the full year, in our business, we're so dependent on -- in terms of the cash flow statement optics on when a state pays their bills or when the federal government decides on the 31st to pay or on the 1st to pay you. And so there's really not this notion of uncollectible receivables in the managed care industry. But if Illinois drags an extra month, that's going to be a cash flow item, and we're a pretty big customer there. They're about half of our receivable on the books. At 12/31, by the way, they made a $260 million payment in January. So these timing elements are going to drive the mechanics around the cash flow statement, but you really have to understand the business in the context because honored premiums will swing, receivables will swing, the ACA fee receivable reimbursement on Medicaid will be a swing item, which is merely timing."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today as we review our fourth quarter and full year 2018 results.
Our performance this past year and the actions we have taken over the last several years position us to capitalize on the many opportunities for profitable growth in the years to come. In fact, within the past 24 hours, we received notice from the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services that we were awarded a contract to provide managed care services statewide. While we'll celebrate this award today, we will quickly shift our focus to implementation tomorrow. And beginning Monday, we'll have senior leadership in the state to begin implementation planning for what is a very thoughtful and comprehensive program structure. We look forward to collaborating with providers and our state partners to serve the Medicaid beneficiaries throughout North Carolina for many years to come.
This morning, I'll highlight some of our accomplishments from 2018 and discuss how we are well positioned for continued success across the enterprise, then Drew will review our financial results in more detail and provide some commentary on our outlook for 2019.
We finished 2018 on a strong note, with full year adjusted earnings per diluted share of $11.03, an increase of nearly 30% as compared to 2017. Adjusted net income for the full year 2018 was 2.6%, a 30 basis point improvement year-over-year. Total revenue of $20.4 billion increased by 20% driven by our acquisition of Meridian and organic growth in our Medicaid and Medicare lines of business.
While we are pleased with our performance this past year, we're even more enthusiastic about the future. We enter 2019 with momentum and are increasing our full year 2019 adjusted earnings per diluted share guidance to a range of $13.25 to $13.50, reflecting our strong finish in 2018 and higher-than-expected enrollment in our Medicare PDP segment.
Turning to a review of our business segments. Our Medicaid Health Plans segment continues to perform well. At the end of the year, we served over 3.9 million Medicaid members, which represent an increase of over 44% versus a year ago. Our adjusted Medicaid premium revenue grew by more than 18%, driven by our midyear acquisition of Meridian as well as organic growth in Illinois and Arizona.
Beginning December 1, 2018, we began the implementation of our new and expanded managed Medicare assistance contract and our new long-term care and serious mental illness contracts in Florida. While the implementation is still in its early days, it remains on schedule, and we look forward to providing multiyear benefits to our members, providers and state partners by facilitating cost-effective, high-quality care. This expanded presence will increase our Florida Medicaid revenue by approximately $1.9 billion.
On January 1, as expected, our legacy Harmony Health Plan Medicaid members in Illinois were consolidated into our Meridian Health Plan. With the consolidation of these members into 1 contract, we expect to drive improved operational and financial performance over the next several years. Additionally, our overall Meridian integration continues to progress well. More recently, on February 1, we began the implementation of the Children's Medical Services contract in Florida. As a reminder, this statewide program serves over 60,000 children with extremely complex physical and behavioral needs and is completely new to managed care. While the program just started, we are leveraging our expanded presence in Florida to engage with these children, their families, providers and state partners to effectively transition our members to a managed care program.
In Medicaid, we believe WellCare is differentiated through our local approach, coupled with our high-touch, integrated care model, which incorporates physical, behavioral, pharmaceutical and socioeconomic needs. By integrating our social determinants of health program, Community Connections, within our care model, WellCare is able to support our members in unique and innovative ways, providing tangible benefits to their overall well-being. In 2018, for example, we connected more than 51,000 people to over 194,000 social service resources, displacing the need for higher cost services with less costly community-based solutions.
A recent example of the success of our local approach and integrated care model comes from our Arizona market where certain of our members faced immediate eviction as their building was condemned. Within a very short period, our local market team was able to identify the issue and engage with our local care managers and Community Connections' social services program to provide alternative housing resources. We feel these programs are vital to our success and continue to focus on local and community-based solutions that have the potential to improve the overall health and well-being of our members.
Moving to our Medicare Health Plan segment. The premium revenue grew by nearly 19% year-over-year, driven by a combination of organic growth and our acquisition of Meridian. Through January, we served over 561,000 Medicare Advantage members across 22 states.
Our Medicare PDP business posted strong financial results in 2018 that exceeded our expectations. Driven by our new Value Script product, our enrollment was over 530,000 net new members in 2019. With the addition of new members on January 1, 2020, from the recently closed Aetna PDP divestiture, we expect to see further earnings contribution from our PDP segment in 2020.
Regarding the Aetna PDP transaction, we have already begun to work on ensuring an effective transition of these members for January 1, 2020. With the addition of these PDP members, we estimate that our total 2020 pharmacy spend across all of our lines of business will be approximately $15 billion to $20 billion.
As we look ahead, we continue to see a path towards continued earnings growth for WellCare. Some of the drivers of this growth are currently visible. Our Meridian business is expected to continue to improve and drive further accretion. Our new business in the State of Florida is being structured for long-term profitability and success. And our recent PDP acquisition will provide further earnings growth in 2020 and beyond.
The recent North Carolina results, coupled with our #1 score in the most recent Florida RFP, are a validation of the years of investments into improving our capabilities and our solutions and are a testament to the effective execution by our 12,000 WellCare associates.
In closing, 2018 was a very good year for WellCare. We exited the year with continued momentum and line of sight to multiple earnings levers ahead of us. While we focus on the execution of our near-term commitments, we are also seeking out additional opportunities to drive further growth. The results of these efforts will provide further benefits to our members, providers, partners and shareholders. It's an exciting time for WellCare, and we look forward to the next few years.
I'll now turn the call over to Drew for a discussion of our financial results. Drew?"

I'm going to provide you with a wrap-up of 2018, including the fourth quarter highlights, and then focus on 2019 and beyond.As Ken mentioned, 2018 was another very good year for WellCare with meaningful growth in revenue and earnings. But o",935,"Thanks, Ken. I'm going to provide you with a wrap-up of 2018, including the fourth quarter highlights, and then focus on 2019 and beyond.
As Ken mentioned, 2018 was another very good year for WellCare with meaningful growth in revenue and earnings. But our best accomplishments were the actions we took in 2018 to drive business improvements growth in earnings in 2019 and beyond. We ended 2018 at $11.03 of adjusted EPS, above the top end of our prior 2018 guidance. This represents nearly 30% adjusted EPS growth year-over-year.
With respect to the fourth quarter, our adjusted EPS was $1.63, which was a slightly better result than we had forecasted, driven largely by continued PDP outperformance due to an MBR that came in below the low end of our prior guidance. Certainly, a good way to exit 2018.
Regarding other metrics, the 2018 adjusted SG&A percentage of 8.3% ended up slightly better than the low end of our prior range. As of year-end, our debt-to-cap ratio was 33.4%, with parent cash at $516 million, approximately half of which is earmarked for statutory capital for known 2019 growth, and we have $1.1 billion available on our credit facility.
In Medicaid, our adjusted MBR ended up 10 basis points above the top of our prior guidance range as we establish the appropriate level of reserves for new business and revenue streams, including Meridian, Arizona and Florida. Absent reserve build, our Medicaid performance was right on track in the quarter. On that topic, days in claims payable was 52.2 days, slightly higher than the 51.9 days as of the end of 2017. Favorable prior year development was $28.6 million in the fourth quarter, bringing the full year to $244 million. This compares to $225 million in 2017, good consistency.
Fundamentally, we are pleased with how we ended 2018 and entered 2019 with medical trends stable and in line with our expectations. So, good metrics that give us confidence as we start 2019.
While we've provided initial 2019 guidance on December 17, we're updating that guidance today to an adjusted EPS range of $13.25 to $13.50, largely reflecting higher PDP volume than previously expected. We also increased the midpoint of the PDP revenue by $50 million as I'll cover in a minute. Our current guidance excludes any impact from North Carolina in 2019.
A few other highlights from our 2019 guidance. Revenue's growing nearly 30%, net income is growing 30% at the midpoint, adjusted EPS is growing 21% year-over-year, and all 3 of our business segments are showing meaningful organic growth year-over-year.
Let me share a few early updates for 2019. We had a strong PDP annual enrollment period, and our PDP membership growth for January is over 530,000 net members. We were able to put forth a competitive product in our second enhanced plan based upon our strong pharmacy cost structure, the change in the meaningful difference rule for 2019 and the product structure that encourages the use of generics. For instance, we have deductibles for drugs classified in Tiers 3 through 5. Besides the business value of the new enhanced plan, we believe this growth in the chooser product will position us well as we prepare for the addition of the Aetna PDP business in 2020.
In Medicare Advantage, we grew organically approximately 16,000 members in January of 2019. This represents about 3% growth compared to year-end, and we are targeting 8% to 10% full year membership growth in Medicare Advantage. As a reminder, we have a higher relative proportion of D-SNP, Dual Special Needs Plan, members and has historically experienced the majority of our membership growth outside of the annual enrollment period.
Our early read on the CMS advance notice for 2020 is that the rate increase for WellCare, including the benefit we get for our Star Rating progression, is around 2%. This pure rate change is before risk or a trend and the impact of the ACA fee.
Beyond 2019, we're excited about some positive levers that we have already created for 2020 and beyond. For instance, number one, we expect to advance the Meridian accretion from $0.40 to $0.50 in 2019 to $0.70 to $0.80 in 2020 and $1-plus in 2021. Number two, we have cohorts of margin expansion opportunity in our new business, such as the $1.9 billion of new revenue in Florida and the legacy WellCare Illinois business, which was merged into Meridian effective January 1, 2019. Three, WellCare will begin to receive the economic benefits from the Aetna PDP business effective January 1, 2020. And four, as Ken mentioned, with our additional pharmacy spend projected at $15 billion to $20 billion, we are enthusiastic about our PBM RFP to be launched this summer for an effective date of January 1, 2021. It's actually fortuitous timing given the potential changing landscape in the pharmacy ecosystem.
As Ken mentioned, we are thrilled to be 1 of 4 statewide awardees for the State of North Carolina's Medicaid program. We'll be focused on execution as we work with the state on launching the new statewide contract as early as November 1, 2019, for certain regions. As we're able to gain more information around this award, we will update investors regarding its projected financial impact.
While we finished 2018 strong, we've been focused on 2019 and beyond for some time. We're energized about the opportunity in government programs and WellCare's positioning to seize those opportunities. So while we are working on delivering on our commitments for 2019, we're also focused on driving success in 2020 and beyond.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today as we review our first quarter 2019 results. This morning, I'll review some of the key items from the quarter, discuss some of the opportunities ahead and then Drew will review our financial results in more detail. We are pleased to report first quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share of $3.69, representing a year-over-year increase of 49%. Additionally, we reported adjusted total revenue of $6.7 billion, a 48% increase over the $4.5 billion reported in the same period last year. The revenue and earnings growth in the quarter is largely due to the acquisition of Meridian in September of 2018 and organic growth across all 3 lines of business. 
As we announced just over a month ago, WellCare and Centene signed a Merger Agreement to form the premier managed-care enterprise focused on government sponsored programs. The merger will combine best-in-class capabilities with a strong emphasis on providing high-quality, affordable health care to members in their local communities. We're excited about the long-term opportunities for driving profitable growth as a combined company. In the near term, our focus continues on our commitments to our members, our partners and our shareholders. 
Let's review some of the progress that we're making and the opportunities we have in front of us this year. First, in Florida, our geographic and service expansion in the state is largely complete. We are focusing our efforts on ensuring that our members across all of our programs receive cost-effective high-quality health care. In North Carolina, we're partnering and collaborating with the state to an insured affect the rollout of the new managed Medicaid program. As you may recall, we were selected with the highest overall score to serve members on a statewide basis, beginning in November of this year. Our implementation remains on track as we continue building out our local market leadership team and related infrastructure for this program. 
Our integration of the Aetna PDP business is progressing well as we seek to manage the January 1, 2020, transition to ensure that member disruption is minimized and member retention is maximized for 2020. 
Finally, our integration of the Meridian business remains on schedule. In Illinois, our seamless integration of our legacy harmony business onto the Meridian platform this January with a testament to the hard work and dedication of our market-based associates in Illinois and shared service Associates in Tampa. 
Turning to our financial results. For the first quarter of 2019, all 3 business segments showed growth in membership, revenue and earnings, driven by a combination of organic and acquired growth. Let's start with Medicaid. Medicaid membership at the end of the quarter stands at over 4.1 million members, which represents growth of over 52% year-over-year. Adjusted Medicaid premium revenue grew by 64%, reflecting the acquisition of Meridian and recent RFP wins in Florida and Arizona. 
In our Medicare health plans segments, premium revenue grew by over 18% year-over-year, driven by a combination of organic growth and our acquisition of Meridian. Through the end of the quarter, our Medicare Advantage membership stands at 558,000, representing year-over-year growth of over 10%. 
Finally, our Medicare PDP business showed strong growth and performance in the quarter. Through the end of March, we served over 1.6 million members, an increase of over 557,000 compared with the first quarter of 2018. This strong growth in membership was primarily due to the launch of our new Value Script product. The premium and benefit design of this new product has been highly attractive in today's market. As we've stated previously, we continue to see our PDP business perform better than initial expectations, with an MBR of 89.5% in the first quarter. 
In addition, the risk profile of the members selecting our Value Script product is in line with our underwriting expectations. In closing, our performance for the first quarter is representative of the discipline and rigor we placed on running 3 high-performing profitable and growing businesses. While we have begun the important task of integration planning with Centene, it is clear to our 13,000 associates that we must continue to focus on delivering on the near term commitments that we have made to our members, providers, government partners and shareholders. 
I'll now turn the call over to Drew for a discussion of our financial results. Drew?"

As you saw in our press release, we are not updating 2019 guidance since we're under a Merger Agreement with Centene. However, I'll cover our first quarter results in an enough detail so that you can understand our strong results and that we are delivering so far in 2019. 
For the first quarter of 2019, our adjusted EPS was $3.69 compared with $2.47 in the first quarter of 2018, representing a 49% year-over-year increase. In addition, adjusted total revenue grew by 48% compared with Q1 of 2018 driven by not only the Meridian transaction in September of 2018, but also organic growth in all 3 lines of business. 
Let's go deeper into each line of business. Our Medicaid business was right on track in the first quarter with very strong growth and an adjusted MBR consistent with our expectations. The 64% growth in adjusted Medicaid premium revenue versus Q1 2018 was driven by our acquisition of Meridian, along with organic growth in Florida and Arizona. As expected, these newer businesses carry a higher adjusted MBR than our mature Medicaid businesses, which is the primary driver of the 120 basis point year-over-year increase. This is consistent with the Medicaid road map we provided you in our December '17 guidance presentation. 
As Ken mentioned, we're on track with our very important Medicaid operational activities, including the integration of Meridian, geographical expansion in Arizona and Florida and the implementation of our new SMI and Children's Medical Services contracts in Florida Florida. The implementation of our North Carolina statewide contract is well underway and on schedule for November 2019, launch of 2 regions with the remaining regions scheduled for Q1 of 2020. We will identify for you start-up spending for North Carolina as we incurred during the remainder of 2019. 
Our Medicare Health Plans revenue grew 18% year-over-year driven by organic growth and our acquisition of Meridian. We grew a little bit less than expected during the combined annual and enrollment periods, but we're able to sell our D-SNP products around and we typically experience the majority of our annual growth outside of the annual enrollment period. Our Medicare business had a strong financial quarter with an MBR of 84%, matching Q1 2018's 84% MBR. In a year without an ACA fee, this is a very good result and was better than our expectations. 
With regard to the final 2020 rate from CMS that was published on April 1, WellCare's rate increases anticipated to be about 3%, which includes the benefit of our star score progression, where approximately 42% of our members are in 4 Star contracts. This pure rate change is before risk or trend and the impact of the ACA fee, which is expected to return in 2020. WellCare is looking forward to bring more Medicare advantage tools, talents and experience to the combined Centene WellCare enterprise. 
Our PDP business had an outstanding first quarter. We grew 557,000 members year-over-year, representing 52% membership growth driven by our Value Script product. Furthermore, the PDP MBR was meaningfully ahead of our expectations and was within 80 basis points of Q1 2018. And you recall that 2018 was an outstanding year for our PDP MBR. 
As you heard on the Centene conference call, they look forward to leveraging our pharmacy cost structure and what WellCare has been able to accomplish in the pharmacy arena, especially in Medicare and PDP. Accordingly, we are proceeding with our RFP process to procure the best possible pharmacy cost structure, set of flexible terms, division of responsibilities and PBM partnership. 
In the PDP area, we are equally focused on standing up the acquired Aetna PDP business and trying to retain as much as of that membership as we can for 1/1/20 effective date. 
Regarding other elements of the first quarter quarter, the adjusted SG&A ratio was right on track at 7.3%, down 50 basis points from Q1 2018, driven by continued leverage from growth. Prior year favorable development was $108.2 million in the first quarter, up from $71.5 million in Q1 of 2018. Of course, we're a larger company than a year ago. Days in claims payable was at 49.5 days, slightly down from 50.2 days in Q1 of 2018. This slight decreases consistent with our volume adjusted claims inventory levels. 
Given the typical seasonality drop from Q4 to Q1, it's best to view this metric on the same quarter year-over-year basis. 
Our investment in other income in the quarter was strong at $37 million compared to $20 million in Q1 of '18. Our adjusted effective income tax rate value may appear low in Q1, but that is due to the seasonality of certain discrete items in the quarter, including the benefit associated with the annual Q1 vesting of equity compensation. Our annual adjusted effective income tax rate is still expected to be around 24%. We have plenty of liquidity with just under $300 million of cash on hand apparent and $1.1 billion available on our credit facility as of March 31. 
And finally, net cash used in operating activities in Q1 2019 was $30 million versus cash provided of $445 million in Q1 of 2018. The primary driver of this change was the timing of premium related payments from CMS and a few of our state partners. 
We are pleased to get off to a strong start for 2019 and maintain our focus as a stand-alone company, while we look forward to the next chapter of success for WellCare. We've started the integration planning work with Centene as we map out how to best form the premier government programs franchise in the first half of 2020."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today as we review our first quarter 2019 results. This morning, I'll review some of the key items from the quarter, discuss some of the opportunities ahead, and then Drew will review our financial results in more detail.
We are pleased to report first quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share of $3.69, representing a year-over-year increase of 49%. Additionally, we reported adjusted total revenue of $6.7 billion, a 48% increase over the $4.5 billion reported in the same period last year. The revenue and earnings growth in the quarter is largely due to the acquisition of Meridian in September of 2018 and organic growth across all 3 lines of business.
As we announced just over a month ago, WellCare and Centene signed a Merger Agreement to form the premier managed-care enterprise focused on government-sponsored programs. The merger will combine best-in-class capabilities with a strong emphasis on providing high quality, affordable health care to members in their local communities. We're excited about the long-term opportunities for driving profitable growth as a combined company. In the near term, our focus continues on our commitments to our members, our partners and our shareholders.
Let's review some of the progress that we're making and the opportunities we have in front of us this year. First, in Florida, our geographic and service expansion in the state is largely complete. We are focusing our efforts on ensuring that our members across all of our programs receive cost-effective, high-quality health care. In North Carolina, we're partnering and collaborating with the state to ensure an effective rollout of the new managed Medicaid program.
As you may recall, we were selected with the highest overall score to serve members on a statewide basis beginning in November of this year. Our implementation remains on track as we continue building out our local market leadership team and related infrastructure for this program.
Our integration of the Aetna PDP business is progressing well as we seek to manage the January 1, 2020, transition to ensure that member disruption is minimized and member retention is maximized for 2020.
Finally, our integration of the Meridian business remains on schedule. In Illinois, our seamless integration of our legacy Harmony business onto the Meridian platform this January was a testament to the hard work and dedication of our market-based associates in Illinois and shared service associates in Tampa. 
Turning to our financial results. For the first quarter of 2019, all 3 business segments showed growth in membership, revenue and earnings, driven by a combination of organic and acquired growth. Let's start with Medicaid. Medicaid membership at the end of the quarter stands at over 4.1 million members, which represents growth of over 52% year-over-year. Adjusted Medicaid premium revenue grew by 64%, reflecting the acquisition of Meridian and recent RFP wins in Florida and Arizona.
In our Medicare Health Plans segment, premium revenue grew by over 18% year-over-year, driven by a combination of organic growth and our acquisition of Meridian. Through the end of the quarter, our Medicare Advantage membership stands at 558,000, representing year-over-year growth of over 10%.
Finally, our Medicare PDP business showed strong growth and performance in the quarter. Through the end of March, we served over 1.6 million members, an increase of over 557,000 compared with the first quarter of 2018. This strong growth in membership was primarily due to the launch of our new Value Script product. The premium and benefit design of this new product has been highly attractive in today's market. As we have stated previously, we continue to see our PDP business perform better than initial expectations, with an MBR of 89.5% in the first quarter. In addition, the risk profile of the members selecting our Value Script product is in line with our underwriting expectations.
In closing, our performance through the first quarter is representative of the discipline and rigor we placed on running 3 high-performing profitable and growing businesses. While we have begun the important task of integration planning with Centene, it is clear to our 13,000 associates that we must continue to focus on delivering on the near-term commitments that we have made to our members, providers, government partners and shareholders.
I'll now turn the call over to Drew for a discussion of our financial results. Drew?"

As you saw in our press release, we are not updating 2019 guidance since we're under a Merger Agreement with Centene. However, I'll cover our first quarter results in enough detail so that you can understand our strong results and that we are delivering so far in 2019.
For the first quarter of 2019, our adjusted EPS was $3.69 compared with $2.47 in the first quarter of 2018, representing a 49% year-over-year increase. In addition, adjusted total revenue grew by 48% compared with Q1 of 2018 driven by not only the Meridian transaction in September of 2018, but also organic growth in all 3 lines of business. 
Let's go deeper into each line of business. Our Medicaid business was right on track in the first quarter with very strong growth and an adjusted MBR consistent with our expectations. The 64% growth in adjusted Medicaid premium revenue versus Q1 2018 was driven by our acquisition of Meridian, along with organic growth in Florida and Arizona. As expected, these newer businesses carry a higher adjusted MBR than our mature Medicaid businesses, which is the primary driver of the 120 basis point year-over-year increase. This is consistent with the Medicaid road map we provided you in our December 17th guidance presentation.
As Ken mentioned, we are on track with our very important Medicaid operational activities, including the integration of Meridian, geographical expansion in Arizona and Florida, and the implementation of our new SMI and Children's Medical Services contracts in Florida. The implementation of our North Carolina statewide contract is well underway and on schedule for November 2019 launch of 2 regions, with the remaining regions scheduled for Q1 of 2020. We will identify for you start-up spending for North Carolina as we incur it during the remainder of 2019.
Our Medicare Health Plans' revenue grew 18% year-over-year driven by organic growth and our acquisition of Meridian. We grew a little bit less than expected during the combined annual and open enrollment periods, but we are able to sell our D-SNP products year round, and we typically experience the majority of our annual growth outside of the annual enrollment period.
Our Medicare business had a strong financial quarter with an MBR of 84%, matching Q1 2018's 84% MBR. In a year without an ACA fee, this is a very good result and was better than our expectations.
With regard to the final 2020 rate from CMS that was published on April 1, WellCare's rate increase is anticipated to be about 3%, which includes the benefit of our star score progression, where approximately 42% of our members are in 4-star contracts. This pure rate change is before risk or trend and the impact of the ACA fee, which is expected to return in 2020.
WellCare is looking forward to bringing our Medicare Advantage tools, talents and experience to the combined Centene-WellCare enterprise.
Our PDP business had an outstanding first quarter. We grew 557,000 members year-over-year, representing 52% membership growth driven by our Value Script product. Furthermore, the PDP MBR was meaningfully ahead of our expectations and was within 80 basis points of Q1 2018. And you'll recall that 2018 was an outstanding year for our PDP MBR.
As you heard on the Centene conference call, they look forward to leveraging our pharmacy cost structure and what WellCare has been able to accomplish in the pharmacy arena, especially in Medicare and PDP. Accordingly, we are proceeding with our RFP process to procure the best possible pharmacy cost structure, set of flexible terms, division of responsibilities and PBM partnership.
In the PDP area, we are equally focused on standing up the acquired Aetna PDP business and trying to retain as much of that membership as we can for a 1/1/20 effective date.
Regarding other elements of the first quarter, the adjusted SG&A ratio was right on track at 7.3%, down 50 basis points from Q1 2018, driven by continued leverage from growth. Prior year favorable development was $108.2 million in the first quarter, up from $71.5 million in Q1 of 2018. Of course, we're a larger company than a year ago. Days in claims payable was at 49.5 days, slightly down from 50.2 days in Q1 of 2018. This slight decrease is consistent with our volume-adjusted claims inventory levels.
Given the typical seasonality drop from Q4 to Q1, it's best to view this metric on a same quarter year-over-year basis.
Our investment and other income in the quarter were strong at $37 million compared to $20 million in Q1 of '18. Our adjusted effective income tax rate at face value may appear low in Q1, but that is due to the seasonality of certain discrete items in the quarter, including the benefit associated with the annual Q1 vesting of equity compensation. Our annual adjusted effective income tax rate is still expected to be around 24%.
We had plenty of liquidity with just under $300 million of cash on hand apparent and $1.1 billion available on our credit facility as of March 31. 
And finally, net cash used in operating activities in Q1 2019 was $30 million versus cash provided of $445 million in Q1 of 2018. The primary driver of this change was the timing of premium-related payments from CMS and a few of our state partners.
We are pleased to get off to a strong start for 2019 and maintain our focus as a stand-alone company while we look forward to the next chapter of success for WellCare. We've started the integration planning work with Centene as we map out how to best form the premier government programs franchise in the first half of 2020."

This morning, I'll review some of the key items from the quarter, discuss some of the opportunities ahead, and then Drew will review our financial results in more detail.
We are pleased to report first quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share of $3.69, representing a year-over-year increase of 49%. Additionally, we reported adjusted total revenue of $6.7 billion, a 48% increase over the $4.5 billion reported in the same period last year. The revenue and earnings growth in the quarter is largely due to the acquisition of Meridian in September of 2018 and organic growth across all 3 lines of business.
As we announced just over a month ago, WellCare and Centene signed a Merger Agreement to form the premier managed-care enterprise focused on government-sponsored programs. The merger will combine best-in-class capabilities with a strong emphasis on providing high quality, affordable health care to members in their local communities. We're excited about the long-term opportunities for driving profitable growth as a combined company. In the near term, our focus continues on our commitments to our members, our partners and our shareholders.
Let's review some of the progress that we're making and the opportunities we have in front of us this year. First, in Florida, our geographic and service expansion in the state is largely complete. We are focusing our efforts on ensuring that our members across all of our programs receive cost-effective, high-quality health care. In North Carolina, we're partnering and collaborating with the state to ensure an effective rollout of the new managed Medicaid program.
As you may recall, we were selected with the highest overall score to serve members on a statewide basis beginning in November of this year. Our implementation remains on track as we continue building out our local market leadership team and related infrastructure for this program.
Our integration of the Aetna PDP business is progressing well as we seek to manage the January 1, 2020, transition to ensure that member disruption is minimized and member retention is maximized for 2020.
Finally, our integration of the Meridian business remains on schedule. In Illinois, our seamless integration of our legacy Harmony business onto the Meridian platform this January was a testament to the hard work and dedication of our market-based associates in Illinois and shared service associates in Tampa. 
Turning to our financial results. For the first quarter of 2019, all 3 business segments showed growth in membership, revenue and earnings, driven by a combination of organic and acquired growth. Let's start with Medicaid. Medicaid membership at the end of the quarter stands at over 4.1 million members, which represents growth of over 52% year-over-year. Adjusted Medicaid premium revenue grew by 64%, reflecting the acquisition of Meridian and recent RFP wins in Florida and Arizona.
In our Medicare Health Plans segment, premium revenue grew by over 18% year-over-year, driven by a combination of organic growth and our acquisition of Meridian. Through the end of the quarter, our Medicare Advantage membership stands at 558,000, representing year-over-year growth of over 10%.
Finally, our Medicare PDP business showed strong growth and performance in the quarter. Through the end of March, we served over 1.6 million members, an increase of over 557,000 compared with the first quarter of 2018. This strong growth in membership was primarily due to the launch of our new Value Script product. The premium and benefit design of this new product has been highly attractive in today's market. As we have stated previously, we continue to see our PDP business perform better than initial expectations, with an MBR of 89.5% in the first quarter. In addition, the risk profile of the members selecting our Value Script product is in line with our underwriting expectations.
In closing, our performance through the first quarter is representative of the discipline and rigor we placed on running 3 high-performing profitable and growing businesses. While we have begun the important task of integration planning with Centene, it is clear to our 13,000 associates that we must continue to focus on delivering on the near-term commitments that we have made to our members, providers, government partners and shareholders.
I'll now turn the call over to Drew for a discussion of our financial results. Drew?"

As you saw in our press release, we are not updating 2019 guidance since we're under a Merger Agreement with Centene. However, I'll cover our first quarter results in enough detail so that you can understand our strong results and that we are delivering so far in 2019.
For the first quarter of 2019, our adjusted EPS was $3.69 compared with $2.47 in the first quarter of 2018, representing a 49% year-over-year increase. In addition, adjusted total revenue grew by 48% compared with Q1 of 2018 driven by not only the Meridian transaction in September of 2018, but also organic growth in all 3 lines of business. 
Let's go deeper into each line of business. Our Medicaid business was right on track in the first quarter with very strong growth and an adjusted MBR consistent with our expectations. The 64% growth in adjusted Medicaid premium revenue versus Q1 2018 was driven by our acquisition of Meridian, along with organic growth in Florida and Arizona. As expected, these newer businesses carry a higher adjusted MBR than our mature Medicaid businesses, which is the primary driver of the 120 basis point year-over-year increase. This is consistent with the Medicaid road map we provided you in our December 17th guidance presentation.
As Ken mentioned, we are on track with our very important Medicaid operational activities, including the integration of Meridian, geographical expansion in Arizona and Florida, and the implementation of our new SMI and Children's Medical Services contracts in Florida. The implementation of our North Carolina statewide contract is well underway and on schedule for November 2019 launch of 2 regions, with the remaining regions scheduled for Q1 of 2020. We will identify for you start-up spending for North Carolina as we incur it during the remainder of 2019.
Our Medicare Health Plans' revenue grew 18% year-over-year driven by organic growth and our acquisition of Meridian. We grew a little bit less than expected during the combined annual and open enrollment periods, but we are able to sell our D-SNP products year round, and we typically experience the majority of our annual growth outside of the annual enrollment period.
Our Medicare business had a strong financial quarter with an MBR of 84%, matching Q1 2018's 84% MBR. In a year without an ACA fee, this is a very good result and was better than our expectations.
With regard to the final 2020 rate from CMS that was published on April 1, WellCare's rate increase is anticipated to be about 3%, which includes the benefit of our star score progression, where approximately 42% of our members are in 4-star contracts. This pure rate change is before risk or trend and the impact of the ACA fee, which is expected to return in 2020.
WellCare is looking forward to bringing our Medicare Advantage tools, talents and experience to the combined Centene-WellCare enterprise.
Our PDP business had an outstanding first quarter. We grew 557,000 members year-over-year, representing 52% membership growth driven by our Value Script product. Furthermore, the PDP MBR was meaningfully ahead of our expectations and was within 80 basis points of Q1 2018. And you'll recall that 2018 was an outstanding year for our PDP MBR.
As you heard on the Centene conference call, they look forward to leveraging our pharmacy cost structure and what WellCare has been able to accomplish in the pharmacy arena, especially in Medicare and PDP. Accordingly, we are proceeding with our RFP process to procure the best possible pharmacy cost structure, set of flexible terms, division of responsibilities and PBM partnership.
In the PDP area, we are equally focused on standing up the acquired Aetna PDP business and trying to retain as much of that membership as we can for a 1/1/20 effective date.
Regarding other elements of the first quarter, the adjusted SG&A ratio was right on track at 7.3%, down 50 basis points from Q1 2018, driven by continued leverage from growth. Prior year favorable development was $108.2 million in the first quarter, up from $71.5 million in Q1 of 2018. Of course, we're a larger company than a year ago. Days in claims payable was at 49.5 days, slightly down from 50.2 days in Q1 of 2018. This slight decrease is consistent with our volume-adjusted claims inventory levels.
Given the typical seasonality drop from Q4 to Q1, it's best to view this metric on a same quarter year-over-year basis.
Our investment and other income in the quarter were strong at $37 million compared to $20 million in Q1 of '18. Our adjusted effective income tax rate at face value may appear low in Q1, but that is due to the seasonality of certain discrete items in the quarter, including the benefit associated with the annual Q1 vesting of equity compensation. Our annual adjusted effective income tax rate is still expected to be around 24%.
We had plenty of liquidity with just under $300 million of cash on hand apparent and $1.1 billion available on our credit facility as of March 31. 
And finally, net cash used in operating activities in Q1 2019 was $30 million versus cash provided of $445 million in Q1 of 2018. The primary driver of this change was the timing of premium-related payments from CMS and a few of our state partners.
We are pleased to get off to a strong start for 2019 and maintain our focus as a stand-alone company while we look forward to the next chapter of success for WellCare. We've started the integration planning work with Centene as we map out how to best form the premier government programs franchise in the first half of 2020."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today as we review our second quarter 2019 results.
This morning, I will review key items from the quarter and provide some additional insights into our business and then Drew will review our financial results in more detail.
We are pleased to report second quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share of $4.31 representing a growth of 17% versus the same period last year. Additionally, we reported adjusted total revenue of $7 billion, a 54% increase versus the $4.5 billion we reported last year. Our revenue and earnings growth is largely due to the acquisition of Meridian in September 2018 as well as continued organic growth across all 3 lines of business.
With regards to the pending Centene merger, we continue to pursue regulatory approvals from various state and federal agencies. We were very pleased to see the results from the shareholders votes held last month with shareholders overwhelmingly approving the merger. 
Our integration planning teams continue to work collaboratively, outlining how we will combine our best-in-class capabilities to provide high-quality, affordable health care to our members with their individual needs in mind. While we are dedicating resources to these efforts, the vast majority of our associates remain focused on running our business as a stand-alone company in order to deliver on our 2019 commitments.
Turning to our financial results for the second quarter of 2019. All 3 lines of business continue to demonstrate revenue and earnings growth driven by a combination of organic and acquired growth as well as strong operational execution. 
At the end of the quarter, Medicaid membership stood at 4.1 million members representing growth of over 46% versus versus the same period last year. Adjusted Medicaid premium revenue grew by 69% to $4.7 billion primarily driven by our acquisition of Meridian in 2018 and organic growth in our Florida and Arizona markets. Overall, our Medicaid line of business is performing well with isolated underperformance in one market, which Drew will discuss in further detail. 
Our Medicare Health Plans segment demonstrated strong financial performance in the quarter. Our Medicare MBR was excellent coming in at 82.5%. Premium revenue grew by over 21% year-over-year to $1.9 billion driven by a combination of organic growth and our acquisition of Meridian in 2018 it.
We ended the second quarter with approximately 560,000 members representing year-over-year growth of approximately 10%.
Finally, our Medicare PDP segment continued to demonstrate strong growth and financial outperformance. At the end of the quarter, we served over 1.6 million members, an increase of over 592,000 members or 56% versus the second quarter of last year. This strong growth in membership continues to be driven by the launch of our Value Script product, reflecting strong market demand due to a detracted premium and benefit design. Our PDP business continues to exceed our financial expectations with an MBR of 81.2% in the second quarter.
Now I'll review 2 of the key focus areas for the rest of the year. In North Carolina, we're continuing to prepare for the launch of the new state-wide managed Medicaid program. 2 regions are expected to launch on November 1 with the remaining 4 regions expected to launch on February 1, 2020. We remain fully engaged with our various state partners to ensure both a smooth program launch, and we are ensuring a business that is built with long-term profitable growth in mind.
Second, the integration of Aetna PDP business continues to move forward with membership transition occurring on January 1, 2020. Our efforts remain focused on membership retention as these PDP members have the opportunity to choose a new carrier as they do each and every year.
In closing, our performance for the second quarter continues to highlight the dedication and focus our associates place on ensuring that our businesses operate effectively and profitability as a stand-alone company.
Looking ahead to the future as one combined company, we expect to bring a compelling and diversified portfolio with a shared commitment to our local communities with long-term growth in mind. This will, in turn, provide further opportunities to better serve our members, providers and government partners.

I'm pleased to share some of the financial details of our strong Q2 and year-to-date results as we continue to deliver on our 2019 commitments.
As a reminder from our Q1 call, we are not updating 2019 financial guidance since we are under a merger agreement with Centene.
For the second quarter of 2019, our adjusted EPS was $4.31 compared with $3.69 in the second quarter of 2018 representing a 17% increase year-over-year. On a year-to-date basis, our adjusted EPS at $8 is 30% higher than the first half of 2018 at $6.16.
Adjusted total revenue of $7 billion in the quarter and $13.7 billion year-to-date is 54% and 51% higher than Q2 in the first half of 2018, respectively, driven by our acquisition of Meridian in Q3 of 2018 as well as year-over-year organic growth in all 3 of our segments.
Let's go deeper into each line of business. Our Medicaid business experienced a significant year-over-year adjusted revenue growth of 69% driven by our acquisition of Meridian along with organic growth in Florida and Arizona. As previously discussed, these newer businesses carry a higher adjusted MBR than our matured Medicaid businesses, but nonetheless contribute a higher absolute level of Medicaid earnings year-over-year. Both Florida and Arizona Medicaid businesses were consistent with our expectations in the quarter. The reported adjusted Medicaid MBR of 91.3% in the quarter was higher than our original expectation driven primarily by 2 factors. Factor number one, Illinois. As we have reported in prior quarters, we've been working on the improvement of our Illinois Health Plan, which more than tripled in size when we closed the Meridian transaction last September. While improvement is stay, it's been too slow. Therefore, during early Q2, we committed additional resources to bring to bear all of the capabilities and best practices of the broader company to position this Illinois business for long-term profitability. Given the size of our Illinois business within our Medicaid portfolio, its continued improvement remains one of the company's top priorities with all hands on deck.
Factor number two, quality. We continue to focus on Medicaid quality-related activities throughout health plans, and in particular, we saw a higher portion of new quality and clinical engagement spend in our new Florida Medicaid and Meridian businesses. This actually has a favorable impact on our SG&A rate, so merely a classification trade-off between medical expense and SG&A.
Other than the progress we want to make in the Illinois market, we are pleased with the contributions of our Medicaid business as a whole so far in 2019. As you can see in the press release tables, year-to-date Medicaid gross margin contribution to the enterprise was 26% higher than in the first half of 2018 helping drive our earnings growth.
As Ken mentioned, the implementation our North Carolina state-wide contract is well underway and is expected to commence in November 2019. The start-up spending for North Carolina was just beginning to ramp in Q2 as we incurred $2.9 million pretax or minus $0.04 of adjusted EPS during Q2. Those costs are embedded in adjusted earnings.
Our Medicare Health Plans contributed to the strength in Q2 earnings. The absolute MBR was very strong at 82.5%, and you'll notice it was actually lower than Q2 2018 despite the absence of the ACA fee. Our year-to-date MBR of 83.3% is favorable and bodes well as we look ahead. Membership is at 560,000 members, up from 510,000 a year ago. 
We continue to be excited about our ability to bring Medicare Advantage tools, talents and experience to the combined Centene/WellCare enterprise upon closing.
The strength in our PDP business continued from both the membership and MBR perspective. We grew 592,000 members year-over-year, representing 56% membership growth, driven by of our Value Script product. Furthermore, the PDP MBR continues to track ahead of our expectations. We're excited about the PDP business as we look toward 2020 on multiple fronts. 
First of all, the run rate of the business is strong. Second, in June, we submitted 2020 to CMS for both our legacy WellCare and the legacy Aetna products and look forward to providing value to PDP recipients through our portfolio of basic and enhanced products. We continue to work on the integration of the Aetna PDP business and take the appropriate steps in 2019 to maximize the retention of that business for 1/1/'20. 
Third, we are in an RFP process whereby we expect to make a multi-year PBM commitment on our Medicare and PDP pharmacy spend and procure the best possible pharmacy cost structure, set a flexible terms, division of responsibilities and PBM partnership effective January 1, 2021.
Included in the our the optionality for other lines of business including Medicaid. We expect to wrap up the RFP by the fourth quarter of 2019. 
And fourth, we continue to work with Centene on integration planning, and as you heard Centene say publicly, they look forward to leveraging our pharmacy cost structure and capabilities once the transaction closes.
Regarding other elements of the second quarter, the adjusted SG&A ratio at 6.8% in Q2 was the lowest point in at least the last 10 years at WellCare driven by continued leverage from growth with help from the quality spend discussed earlier. Prior year favorable development was a $103 million in the second quarter consistent with the $102 million in Q2 of 2018. Year-to-date favorable development stands at $211 million versus $173 million in the first half of 2018. Days payable was 48.4 days, slightly down from 49.5 days last quarter.
Our investment in other income in the quarter was strong at $41 million compared to $26 million in Q2 of 2018. Our adjusted effective income tax rate was 24.9% in the quarter, bringing the year-to-date rate to 22.5%. 
We had $249 million of cash on hand a parent and $1.15 billion available on our credit facility as of June 30. And finally, we generated $536 million of cash flow from operations versus $331 million in Q2 of 2018.
In summary, we are progressing nicely through the first half of 2019 as we concurrently maintain our focus as a stand-alone company while working on integration planning with Centene. We look forward to forming the premier government programs company in the first half of 2020.
Thank you for your interest in WellCare."

This will, in turn, provide further opportunities to better serve our members, providers and government partners.
I'll now turn the call over to Drew for a discussion of our financial results. Drew?"

I'm pleased to share some of the financial details of our strong Q2 and year-to-date results as we continue to deliver on our 2019 commitments.
As a reminder from our Q1 call, we are not updating 2019 financial guidance since we are under a merger agreement with Centene.
For the second quarter of 2019, our adjusted EPS was $4.31 compared with $3.69 in the second quarter of 2018 representing a 17% increase year-over-year. On a year-to-date basis, our adjusted EPS at $8 is 30% higher than the first half of 2018 at $6.16.
Adjusted total revenue of $7 billion in the quarter and $13.7 billion year-to-date is 54% and 51% higher than Q2 and the first half of 2018, respectively, driven by our acquisition of Meridian in Q3 of 2018 as well as year-over-year organic growth in all 3 of our segments.
Let's go deeper into each line of business. Our Medicaid business experienced significant year-over-year adjusted revenue growth of 69% driven by our acquisition of Meridian along with organic growth in Florida and Arizona. As previously discussed, these newer businesses carry a higher adjusted MBR than our matured Medicaid businesses, but nonetheless contribute a higher absolute level of Medicaid earnings year-over-year. Both Florida and Arizona Medicaid businesses were consistent with our expectations in the quarter. The reported adjusted Medicaid MBR of 91.3% in the quarter was higher than our original expectation driven primarily by 2 factors. 
Factor number one, Illinois. As we have reported in prior quarters, we've been working on the improvement of our Illinois health plan, which more than tripled in size when we closed the Meridian transaction last September. While improvement is steady, it's been too slow. Therefore, during early Q2, we committed additional resources to bring to bear all of the capabilities and best practices of the broader company to position this Illinois business for long-term profitability. Given the size of our Illinois business within our Medicaid portfolio, its continued improvement remains one of the company's top priorities with all hands on deck.
Factor number two, quality. We continue to focus on Medicaid quality-related activities throughout health plans, and in particular, we saw a higher portion of new quality and clinical engagement spend in our new Florida Medicaid and Meridian businesses. This actually has a favorable impact on our SG&A rate, so merely a classification trade-off between medical expense and SG&A.
Other than the progress we want to make in the Illinois market, we are pleased with the contributions of our Medicaid business as a whole so far in 2019. As you could see in the press release tables, year-to-date Medicaid gross margin contribution to the enterprise was 26% higher than in the first half of 2018 helping drive our earnings growth.
As Ken mentioned, the implementation of our North Carolina state-wide contract is well underway and is expected to commence in November of 2019. The start-up spending for North Carolina was just beginning to ramp in Q2 as we incurred $2.9 million pretax or minus $0.04 of adjusted EPS during Q2. Those costs are embedded in adjusted earnings.
Our Medicare Health Plans contributed to the strength in Q2 earnings. The absolute MBR was very strong at 82.5%, and you'll notice it was actually lower than Q2 2018 despite the absence of the ACA fee. Our year-to-date MBR of 83.3% is favorable and bodes well as we look ahead. Membership is at 560,000 members, up from 510,000 a year ago.
We continue to be excited about our ability to bring Medicare Advantage tools, talents and experience to the combined Centene/WellCare enterprise upon closing.
The strength in our PDP business continued from both the membership and MBR perspective. We grew 592,000 members year-over-year, representing 56% membership growth, driven by our Value Script product. Furthermore, the PDP MBR continues to track ahead of our expectations. We're excited about the PDP business as we look toward 2020 on multiple fronts.
First of all, the run rate of the business is strong. Second, in June, we submitted 2020 bids to CMS for both our legacy WellCare and the legacy Aetna products and look forward to providing value to PDP recipients through our portfolio of basic and enhanced products. We continue to work on the integration of the Aetna PDP business and take the appropriate steps in 2019 to maximize the retention of that business for 1/1/20.
Third, we are in an RFP process whereby we expect to make a multi-year PBM commitment on our Medicare and PDP pharmacy spend and procure the best possible pharmacy cost structure, set flexible terms, division of responsibilities and PBM partnership effective January 1, 2021.
Included in the RFP will be the optionality for other lines of business including Medicaid. We expect to wrap up the RFP by the fourth quarter of 2019.
And fourth, we continue to work with Centene on integration planning, and as you heard Centene say publicly, they look forward to leveraging our pharmacy cost structure and capabilities once the transaction closes.
Regarding other elements of the second quarter, the adjusted SG&A ratio at 6.8% in Q2 was the lowest point in at least the last 10 years at WellCare driven by continued leverage from growth with help from the quality spend discussed earlier. Prior year favorable development was $103 million in the second quarter consistent with the $102 million in Q2 of 2018. Year-to-date favorable development stands at $211 million versus $173 million in the first half of 2018. Days in claims payable was 48.8 days, slightly down from 49.5 days last quarter.
Our investment in other income in the quarter was strong at $41 million compared to $26 million in Q2 of 2018. Our adjusted effective income tax rate was 24.9% in the quarter, bringing the year-to-date rate to 22.5%.
We had $249 million of cash on hand apparent and $1.15 billion available on our credit facility as of June 30. And finally, we generated $536 million of cash flow from operations versus $331 million in Q2 of 2018.
In summary, we are progressing nicely through the first half of 2019 as we concurrently maintain our focus as a stand-alone company while working on integration planning with Centene. We look forward to forming the premier government programs company in the first half of 2020.
Thank you for your interest in WellCare."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today as we review our second quarter 2019 results.
This morning, I will review key items from the quarter and provide some additional insights into our business and then Drew will review our financial results in more detail.
We are pleased to report second quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share of $4.31 representing a growth of 17% versus the same period last year. Additionally, we reported adjusted total revenue of $7 billion, a 54% increase versus the $4.5 billion we reported last year. Our revenue and earnings growth is largely due to the acquisition of Meridian in September 2018 as well as continued organic growth across all 3 lines of business.
With regards to the pending Centene merger, we continue to pursue regulatory approvals from various state and federal agencies. We were very pleased to see the results from the shareholders votes held last month with shareholders overwhelmingly approving the merger. 
Our integration planning teams continue to work collaboratively, outlining how we will combine our best-in-class capabilities to provide high-quality, affordable health care to our members with their individual needs in mind. While we are dedicating resources to these efforts, the vast majority of our associates remain focused on running our business as a stand-alone company in order to deliver on our 2019 commitments.
Turning to our financial results for the second quarter of 2019. All 3 lines of business continue to demonstrate revenue and earnings growth driven by a combination of organic and acquired growth as well as strong operational execution. 
At the end of the quarter, Medicaid membership stood at 4.1 million members representing growth of over 46% versus versus the same period last year. Adjusted Medicaid premium revenue grew by 69% to $4.7 billion primarily driven by our acquisition of Meridian in 2018 and organic growth in our Florida and Arizona markets. Overall, our Medicaid line of business is performing well with isolated underperformance in one market, which Drew will discuss in further detail. 
Our Medicare Health Plans segment demonstrated strong financial performance in the quarter. Our Medicare MBR was excellent coming in at 82.5%. Premium revenue grew by over 21% year-over-year to $1.9 billion driven by a combination of organic growth and our acquisition of Meridian in 2018 it.
We ended the second quarter with approximately 560,000 members representing year-over-year growth of approximately 10%.
Finally, our Medicare PDP segment continued to demonstrate strong growth and financial outperformance. At the end of the quarter, we served over 1.6 million members, an increase of over 592,000 members or 56% versus the second quarter of last year. This strong growth in membership continues to be driven by the launch of our Value Script product, reflecting strong market demand due to a detracted premium and benefit design. Our PDP business continues to exceed our financial expectations with an MBR of 81.2% in the second quarter.
Now I'll review 2 of the key focus areas for the rest of the year. In North Carolina, we're continuing to prepare for the launch of the new state-wide managed Medicaid program. 2 regions are expected to launch on November 1 with the remaining 4 regions expected to launch on February 1, 2020. We remain fully engaged with our various state partners to ensure both a smooth program launch, and we are ensuring a business that is built with long-term profitable growth in mind.
Second, the integration of Aetna PDP business continues to move forward with membership transition occurring on January 1, 2020. Our efforts remain focused on membership retention as these PDP members have the opportunity to choose a new carrier as they do each and every year.
In closing, our performance for the second quarter continues to highlight the dedication and focus our associates place on ensuring that our businesses operate effectively and profitability as a stand-alone company.
Looking ahead to the future as one combined company, we expect to bring a compelling and diversified portfolio with a shared commitment to our local communities with long-term growth in mind.

For the second quarter of 2019, our adjusted EPS was $4.31 compared with $3.69 in the second quarter of 2018 representing a 17% increase year-over-year. On a year-to-date basis, our adjusted EPS at $8 is 30% higher than the first half of 2018 at $6.16.

Let's go deeper into each line of business. Our Medicaid business experienced significant year-over-year adjusted revenue growth of 69% driven by our acquisition of Meridian along with organic growth in Florida and Arizona. As previously discussed, these newer businesses carry a higher adjusted MBR than our matured Medicaid businesses but nonetheless contribute a higher absolute level of Medicaid earnings year-over-year. Both Florida and Arizona Medicaid businesses were consistent with our expectations in the quarter. The reported adjusted Medicaid MBR of 91.3% in the quarter was higher than our original expectation driven primarily by 2 factors. 
Factor number one, Illinois. As we have reported in prior quarters, we've been working on the improvement of our Illinois health plan, which more than tripled in size when we closed the Meridian transaction last September. While improvement is steady, it's been too slow. Therefore, during early Q2, we committed additional resources to bring to bear all of the capabilities and best practices of the broader company to position this Illinois business for long-term profitability. Given the size of our Illinois business within our Medicaid portfolio, its continued improvement remains one of the company's top priorities with all hands on deck.
Factor number two, quality. We continue to focus on Medicaid quality-related activities throughout health plans, and in particular, we saw a higher portion of new quality and clinical engagement spend in our new Florida Medicaid and Meridian businesses. This actually has a favorable impact on our SG&A rate, so merely a classification trade-off between medical expense and SG&A.
Other than the progress we want to make in the Illinois market, we are pleased with the contributions of our Medicaid business as a whole so far in 2019. As you could see in the press release tables, year-to-date Medicaid gross margin contribution to the enterprise was 26% higher than in the first half of 2018 helping drive our earnings growth.
As Ken mentioned, the implementation of our North Carolina statewide contract is well underway and is expected to commence in November of 2019. The start-up spending for North Carolina was just beginning to ramp in Q2 as we incurred $2.9 million pretax or minus $0.04 of adjusted EPS during Q2. Those costs are embedded in adjusted earnings.
Our Medicare Health Plans contributed to the strength in Q2 earnings. The absolute MBR was very strong at 82.5%, and you'll notice it was actually lower than Q2 2018 despite the absence of the ACA fee. Our year-to-date MBR of 83.3% is favorable and bodes well as we look ahead. Membership is at 560,000 members, up from 510,000 a year ago. We continue to be excited about our ability to bring Medicare Advantage tools, talents and experience to the combined Centene/WellCare enterprise upon closing.
The strength in our PDP business continued from both the membership and MBR perspective. We grew 592,000 members year-over-year, representing 56% membership growth, driven by our Value Script product. Furthermore, the PDP MBR continues to track ahead of our expectations. We're excited about the PDP business as we look toward 2020 on multiple fronts.
First of all, the run rate of the business is strong. Second, in June, we submitted 2020 bids to CMS for both our legacy WellCare and the legacy Aetna products and look forward to providing value to PDP recipients through our portfolio of basic and enhanced products. We continue to work on the integration of the Aetna PDP business and take the appropriate steps in 2019 to maximize the retention of that business for 1/1/20.
Third, we are in an RFP process whereby we expect to make a multiyear PBM commitment on our Medicare and PDP pharmacy spend and procure the best possible pharmacy cost structure, set flexible terms, division of responsibilities and PBM partnership effective January 1, 2021. Included in the RFP will be the optionality for other lines of business including Medicaid. We expect to wrap up the RFP by the fourth quarter of 2019. And fourth, we continue to work with Centene on integration planning, and as you heard Centene say publicly, they look forward to leveraging our pharmacy cost structure and capabilities once the transaction closes.
Regarding other elements of the second quarter, the adjusted SG&A ratio at 6.8% in Q2 was the lowest point in at least the last 10 years at WellCare driven by continued leverage from growth with help from the quality spend discussed earlier. Prior year favorable development was $103 million in the second quarter consistent with the $102 million in Q2 of 2018. Year-to-date favorable development stands at $211 million versus $173 million in the first half of 2018. Days in claims payable was 48.8 days, slightly down from 49.5 days last quarter.
Our investment in other income in the quarter was strong at $41 million compared to $26 million in Q2 of 2018. Our adjusted effective income tax rate was 24.9% in the quarter, bringing the year-to-date rate to 22.5%. We had $249 million of cash on hand apparent and $1.15 billion available on our credit facility as of June 30. And finally, we generated $536 million of cash flow from operations versus $331 million in Q2 of 2018.
In summary, we are progressing nicely through the first half of 2019 as we concurrently maintain our focus as a stand-alone company while working on integration planning with Centene. We look forward to forming the premier government programs company in the first half of 2020.
Thank you for your interest in WellCare."

As we stated in connection with our first quarter 2019 call, due to the previously announced definitive merger agreement with Centene Corporation, we are not updating financial guidance. The guidance for the full year 2019 remains as of February 5, 2019. Additionally, we will not be taking questions after these prepared remarks.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today as we review our second quarter 2019 results. This morning, I will review key items from the quarter and provide some additional insights into our business, and then Drew will review our financial results in more detail.
We are pleased to report second quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share of $4.31 representing growth of 17% versus the same period last year. Additionally, we reported adjusted total revenue of $7 billion, a 54% increase versus the $4.5 billion we've reported last year. Our revenue and earnings growth is largely due to the acquisition of Meridian in September 2018 as well as continued organic growth across all 3 lines of business.
With regards to the pending Centene merger, we continue to pursue regulatory approvals from various state and federal agencies. We were very pleased to see the results from the shareholder votes held last month with shareholders overwhelmingly approving the merger.
Our integration planning teams continue to work collaboratively, outlining how we will combine our best-in-class capabilities to provide high-quality, affordable health care to our members with their individual needs in mind. While we are dedicating resources to these efforts, the vast majority of our associates remain focused on running our business as a stand-alone company in order to deliver on our 2019 commitments.
Turning to our financial results for the second quarter of 2019. All 3 lines of business continue to demonstrate revenue and earnings growth driven by a combination of organic and acquired growth as well as strong operational execution.
At the end of the quarter, Medicaid membership stood at 4.1 million members representing growth of over 46% versus the same period last year. Adjusted Medicaid premium revenue grew by 69% to $4.7 billion primarily driven by our acquisition of Meridian in 2018 and organic growth in our Florida and Arizona markets. Overall, our Medicaid line of business is performing well with isolated underperformance in one market, which Drew will discuss in further detail.
Our Medicare Health Plans segment demonstrated strong financial performance in the quarter. Our Medicare MBR was excellent coming in at 82.5%. Premium revenue grew by over 21% year-over-year to $1.9 billion driven by a combination of organic growth and our acquisition of Meridian in 2018. We ended the second quarter with approximately 560,000 members representing year-over-year growth of approximately 10%.
Finally, our Medicare PDP segment continue to demonstrate strong growth and financial outperformance. At the end of the quarter, we served over 1.6 million members, an increase of over 592,000 members or 56% versus the second quarter last year. This strong growth in membership continues to be driven by the launch of our Value Script product, reflecting strong market demand due to a detracted premium and benefit design. Our PDP business continues to exceed our financial expectations with an MBR of 81.2% in the second quarter.
Now I'll review 2 of the key focus areas for the rest of the year. In North Carolina, we're continuing to prepare for the launch of the new statewide managed Medicaid program. 2 regions are expected to launch on November 1 with the remaining 4 regions expected to launch on February 1, 2020. We remain fully engaged with our various state partners to ensure both a smooth program launch and we are ensuring a business that is built with long-term profitable growth in mind.
Second, the integration of Aetna PDP business continues to move forward with membership transition occurring on January 1, 2020. Our efforts remain focused on membership retention as these PDP members have the opportunity to choose a new carrier as they do each and every year.
In closing, our performance through the second quarter continues to highlight the dedication and focus our associates place on ensuring that our businesses operate effectively and profitably as a stand-alone company. Looking ahead to the future as one combined company, we expect to bring a compelling and diversified portfolio with a shared commitment to our local communities with long-term growth in mind. This will, in turn, provide further opportunities to better serve our members, providers and government partners.
I'll now turn the call over to Drew for a discussion of our financial results. Drew?"

I'm pleased to share some of the financial details of our strong Q2 and year-to-date results as we continue to deliver on our 2019 commitments. As a reminder from our Q1 call, we are not updating 2019 financial guidance since we are under a merger agreement with Centene.
For the second quarter of 2019, our adjusted EPS was $4.31 compared with $3.69 in the second quarter of 2018 representing a 17% increase year-over-year. On a year-to-date basis, our adjusted EPS at $8 is 30% higher than the first half of 2018 at $6.16.
Adjusted total revenue of $7 billion in the quarter and $13.7 billion year-to-date is 54% and 51% higher than Q2 and the first half of 2018, respectively, driven by our acquisition of Meridian in Q3 of 2018 as well as year-over-year organic growth in all 3 of our segments.
Let's go deeper into each line of business. Our Medicaid business experienced significant year-over-year adjusted revenue growth of 69% driven by our acquisition of Meridian along with organic growth in Florida and Arizona. As previously discussed, these newer businesses carry a higher adjusted MBR than our matured Medicaid businesses but nonetheless contribute a higher absolute level of Medicaid earnings year-over-year. Both Florida and Arizona Medicaid businesses were consistent with our expectations in the quarter. The reported adjusted Medicaid MBR of 91.3% in the quarter was higher than our original expectation driven primarily by 2 factors. 
Factor number one, Illinois. As we have reported in prior quarters, we've been working on the improvement of our Illinois health plan, which more than tripled in size when we closed the Meridian transaction last September. While improvement is steady, it's been too slow. Therefore, during early Q2, we committed additional resources to bring to bear all of the capabilities and best practices of the broader company to position this Illinois business for long-term profitability. Given the size of our Illinois business within our Medicaid portfolio, its continued improvement remains one of the company's top priorities with all hands on deck.
Factor number two, quality. We continue to focus on Medicaid quality-related activities throughout health plans, and in particular, we saw a higher portion of new quality and clinical engagement spend in our new Florida Medicaid and Meridian businesses. This actually has a favorable impact on our SG&A rate, so merely a classification trade-off between medical expense and SG&A.
Other than the progress we want to make in the Illinois market, we are pleased with the contributions of our Medicaid business as a whole so far in 2019. As you could see in the press release tables, year-to-date Medicaid gross margin contribution to the enterprise was 26% higher than in the first half of 2018 helping drive our earnings growth.

This morning, I will review key items from the quarter, provide some additional insights into our business and share an update on the merger with Centene. Then Drew will review our financial results in greater detail. 
We are pleased to report third quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share of $5.50, which represents a 65% increase over the same period last year. Additionally, we reported total adjusted revenue of $7.1 billion, representing a 43% increase over the same period last year. This growth has enabled us to achieve significant operating leverage as demonstrated by our 90 basis points year-over-year improvement in our adjusted SG&A ratio. All 3 business segments continued to perform very well, and we're excited about our momentum as we finish 2019 and look towards 2020. 
We also continue to make progress on the pending Centene merger. We recently agreed to sell our Missouri and Nebraska health plans to Aetna. The agreement, which is subject to regulatory approvals and the closing of the Centene-WellCare transaction, represents an important milestone towards completing our combination with Centene. I want to acknowledge our associates in Missouri and Nebraska for their tireless commitment to WellCare. They have done an outstanding job serving our members, providers and government partners. 
Additionally, we have received state insurance department conditional approvals in all but 2 states, Illinois and New Jersey. Parties continue to work collaboratively with the Department of Justice to obtain Hart-Scott-Rodino approval. Our integration planning teams continue to work collaboratively and make significant progress to ensure we combine the best of both companies and hit the ground running once the transaction closes. 
Turning back to our financial results and starting with our Medicaid segment. At the end of the quarter, Medicaid membership was 4.1 million and adjusted Medicaid premium revenue grew to $4.8 billion, a 55% increase over last year's third quarter results. Our Medicaid segment is performing very well. I am pleased to see the 130 basis point improvement in our adjusted Medicaid MBR from 91.3% in the second quarter to 89% in the current quarter, and we're beginning to see improvement in our Illinois Medicaid business. Drew will elaborate more on this later. 
In North Carolina, we are cautiously optimistic that all regions will go live on February 1 of 2020, a few months behind the state's original time frame to launch certain regions in November. Thanks to the dedication of many WellCare associates, we are successfully working through the readiness review process and we are on track for the February launch date. 
Our Medicare Health Plans segment continues to produce strong financial results this year. The Medicare MBR of 83.3% is 150 basis points lower than the third quarter of 2018. Medicare premium revenue grew 16% year-over-year to $1.8 billion driven by a combination of organic growth and the acquisition of Meridian. 
Based on our initial read of the competitive landscape for the 2020 plan year, we feel that our products are well positioned to offer value and attractive benefits to seniors, and we struck the appropriate balance between membership growth and margin. We entered 3 new states for 2020, Missouri, New Hampshire and Washington, bringing the total number of states where we offer Medicare plans to 25. We will grow our service area in 2020 by 87 new counties. And we are also expanding our product portfolio with additional PPO [indiscernible] product to meet the diverse needs of our Medicaid beneficiaries. 
The level of sophistication and our strategy and product development improves each year and quite frankly is becoming a core competency at WellCare. Our 2020 plan year Medicare star results were mixed. Although we maintained our 4 star ratings for our Florida and California plans, our ratings in Houston, New York and Maine dropped below 4 stars. On a positive side, were also able to improve the star scores for our Medicare contracts that serve Illinois, Tennessee, Mississippi, Arkansas, South Carolina HMO and Georgia, all of these from 3.0 to 3.5 stars. Achieving 3.5 stars in these contracts has positive financial implications, which Drew will discuss shortly. 
Over the past few years, we have made tremendous strides in improving our quality of results. And we feel that this year's mixed results were the result of an isolated issue related to Universal American integration activity. We have already begun executing a plan to improve member satisfaction and operational measures in these 2H contracts and expect improvement next year. 
Finally, our Medicare PDP segment again demonstrated strong growth and financial performance. At the end of the quarter, we served 1.7 million members, an increase of over 641,000 members or 61% versus the third quarter last year. The strong membership growth is primarily due to the launch of our Value Script product, which has resonated well with seniors due to its attractive premium and benefit design. For the 2020 plan year, we are excited about the positioning of our PDP offerings. Our basic PDP plans will be below the benchmark or within the de minimis range in all 34 CMS regions. 
Regarding our enhanced plans, we were able to introduce a second low-premium product, Wellness Rx due to our acquisition of Aetna's PDP business. We believe this product, coupled with our Value Script product, position us well for 2020. The transition of the Aetna PDP membership to WellCare-branded products is starting on January 1, 2020. This remains a top priority for WellCare. The additional products, consumer insights and tools we now have as a result of the Aetna PDP acquisition in combination with our competitive pharmacy cost structure gives us confidence in our ability to grow this profitable line of business. 
In closing, I am proud of how our WellCare associates have been able to balance their WellCare integration planning responsibilities while staying focused on running our business as demonstrated by our strong year-to-date results. I am excited about the tremendous potential that will arise from a combined Centene-WellCare enterprise. However, we all understand that we must remain focused on executing on our 2019 priorities as this will allow WellCare to move into 2020 and the pending Centene merger with strong momentum. 
I'll now turn the call over to Drew for a more detailed discussion of our financial results. Drew?"
9026347,640456398,1844736,"WellCare Health Plans, Inc., Q3 2019 Earnings Call, Oct 30, 2019",2019-10-30,"Earnings Calls","WellCare Health Plans, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ken.

As a reminder, we are not updating 2019 financial guidance since we are under a Merger Agreement with Centene. 
For the third quarter of 2019, our adjusted EPS was $5.50 compared with $3.33 in the third quarter of 2018, representing a 65% increase year-over-year. On a year-to-date basis, our adjusted EPS is already at $13.50 through 9 months. While Q4 earnings are typically the lowest of the year, we are still on track to deliver very strong earnings in 2019, which bodes well for the strength of our business as we enter into a merger with Centene, anticipated to close by the first half of 2020. 
Adjusted total revenue of $7.1 billion in the quarter, which is 43% higher than Q3 of 2018, was driven by our acquisition of Meridian in September of 2018 as well as year-over-year organic growth in all 3 of our segments. Let's go deeper into each line of business.
Our Medicaid business experienced year-over-year adjusted premium revenue growth of 55% driven by our acquisition of Meridian along with organic growth from our expanded footprint and mix of products in Florida. We were also pleased with the overall performance of the Medicaid business as our adjusted Medicaid MBR was 89.0% in Q3, down from 91.3% in the prior quarter. This is driven by strong execution on quality and health care affordability initiatives as well as rates. 
To follow up on last quarter's commentary, our Illinois business is making progress such that our current and projected performance no longer warrants a premium deficiency reserve or PDR. As such, we released the remaining 10.1 million in Q3, which was worth about 20 basis points on the adjusted Medicaid MBR.  While we've made progress, there is still more wood to chop in Illinois. And while overall Medicaid performance was strong in the quarter, we are never satisfied and always look for additional levers to improve the performance of our businesses and deliver value to our state customers. 
As Ken mentioned, we continue to prepare for the North Carolina statewide contract. The start-up spending for North Carolina continued to ramp up in Q3 as we incurred $9.2 million pretax or minus $0.14 of adjusted EPS during Q3. Those costs are embedded within adjusted earnings. 
Our Medicare Advantage business certainly contributed to the strength of the Q3 earnings. The absolute MBR was very strong at 83.3%, both for Q3 and year-to-date 2019. This is a great result that should bode well for 2020. We are pedal to the metal with the annual enrollment period, and we're pleased to be able to hold aggregate benefits relatively flat in our overall Medicare Advantage product portfolio as previously planned despite the return of the ACA. 
Looking ahead to 2021, our aggregate economic positioning from recently released Star Ratings is consistent with our positioning in 2020 in terms of aggregate revenue and economic star capture. This is because the list of 3.5 stars in many of our Medicare plans, including Georgia, Tennessee, Arkansas, Mississippi, South Carolina HMO and Illinois helped to offset a couple of our legacy Universal American contracts, which fell to 3.5 stars. As Ken stated, we have identified the root cause and have a plan to regain star momentum in these 2 contracts now that the Universal American integration is behind us. 
Moving on to PDP. The strength in our PDP business continued from a membership revenue and MBR perspective. Our membership and revenue grew 60% and 32% respectively year-over-year, and we like the positioning of our products for 2020. PDP MBR continues to track ahead of our expectations with a year-to-date MBR of 82.6 before we enter the fourth quarter, which has a seasonally lower MBR. If you look at the public PDP data, we are well positioned in 2020 with multiple attractive products, including year 2 of our Value Script product, which is performing very well in 2019, a new WellCare Wellness Rx PDP product we designed to be attractive to choosers, and the best auto assign benchmark positioning since I've been at WellCare with 32 regions below the benchmark and 2 de minimis. 
We continue to work on the integration of the Aetna PDP business and take the appropriate steps in 2019 to maximize aggregate PDP membership retention and growth, including legacy WellCare and Aetna products for 1/1/2020. 
On one last pharmacy note, we continue to work through the PBM RFP with multiple parties as we seek to select a partner for 2021 and beyond and expect to wrap up the RFP process in the fourth quarter of 2019.
Regarding other elements of the third quarter, the adjusted SG&A ratio at 7.6% for the quarter compares favorably to 8.5% in Q3 2018. The ratio at 7.2% year-to-date compares favorably to 8.1% in the same period in 2018. As Ken mentioned, very nice operating leverage in 2019. 
Year-to-date favorable development stands at 247 million versus [ 215 million ] in the same period in 2018. Days in claims payable was at 51.4, up from 48.8 days in Q2. 
Our adjusted effective income tax rate was 23 1/4% in the quarter, bringing the year-to-date rate to 22.8%. 
We had $434 million of cash on hand at parent compared to $249 million last quarter end, and $1.2 billion available on our credit facility as of September 30. Finally, our debt-to-capital ratio as of September 30, 2019, was 29.5%. 
We continue to work very well with Centene on integration planning so that you can hit the ground running upon closing of the transaction. I am really pleased with the focus and execution by the WellCare team in 2019 and the resulting strength of our businesses as we work towards closing the transaction. Thank you for your support of WellCare through the years especially the last 5. We appreciate your interest in WellCare."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today as we review our third quarter 2019 results. This morning, I will review key items from the quarter, provide some additional insights into our business and share an update on the merger with Centene. Then Drew will review our financial results in greater detail. 
We are pleased to report third quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share of $5.50, which represents a 65% increase over the same period last year. Additionally, we reported total adjusted revenue of $7.1 billion, representing a 43% increase over the same period last year. This growth has enabled us to achieve significant operating leverage, as demonstrated by our 90 basis point year-over-year improvement in our adjusted SG&A ratio. All 3 business segments continue to perform very well, and we're excited about our momentum as we finish 2019 and look towards 2020. 
We also continue to make progress on the pending Centene merger. We recently agreed to sell our Missouri and Nebraska health plans to Anthem. The agreement, which is subject to regulatory approvals and the closing of the Centene-WellCare transaction, represents an important milestone towards completing our combination with Centene. I want to acknowledge our associates in Missouri and Nebraska for their tireless commitment to WellCare. They have done an outstanding job serving our members, providers and government partners. 
Additionally, we have received state insurance department conditional approvals in all but 2 states, Illinois and New Jersey. Parties continue to work collaboratively with the Department of Justice to obtain Hart-Scott-Rodino approval. Our integration planning teams continue to work collaboratively and make significant progress to ensure we combine the best of both companies and hit the ground running once the transaction closes. 
Turning back to our financial results and starting with our Medicaid segment. At the end of the quarter, Medicaid membership was 4.1 million and adjusted Medicaid premium revenue grew to $4.8 billion, a 55% increase over last year's third quarter result. Our Medicaid segment is performing very well. I am pleased to see the 130 basis point improvement in our adjusted Medicaid MBR from 91.3% in the second quarter to 89% in the current quarter, and we're beginning to see improvement in our Illinois Medicaid business. Drew will elaborate more on this later.
In North Carolina, we are cautiously optimistic that all regions will go live on February 1, 2020, a few months behind the state's original time frame to launch certain regions in November. Thanks to the dedication of many WellCare associates, we are successfully working through the readiness review process and we are on track for the February launch date. 
Our Medicare Health Plans segment continues to produce strong financial results this year. The Medicare MBR of 83.3% is 150 basis points lower than the third quarter of 2018. Medicare premium revenue grew 16% year-over-year to $1.8 billion, driven by a combination of organic growth and the acquisition of Meridian. 
Based on our initial read of the competitive landscape for the 2020 plan year, we feel that our products are well positioned to offer value and attractive benefits to seniors, and we struck the appropriate balance between membership growth and margin. We entered 3 new states for 2020, Missouri, New Hampshire and Washington, bringing the total number of states where we offer Medicare plans to 25. We will grow our service area in 2020 by 87 new counties. And we are also expanding our product portfolio with additional PPO and C-SNP products to meet the diverse needs of our Medicare beneficiaries. 
The level of sophistication and our bid strategy and product development improves each year and quite frankly, is becoming a core competency at WellCare. Our 2020 plan year Medicare star results were mixed. Although we maintained our 4 star ratings for our Florida and California plans, our ratings in Houston, New York and Maine dropped below 4 stars. On a positive side, we were also able to improve the star scores for our Medicare contracts that serve Illinois, Tennessee, Mississippi, Arkansas, South Carolina HMO and Georgia, all of these from 3.0 to 3.5 stars. Achieving 3.5 stars in these contracts has positive financial implications, which Drew will discuss shortly. 
Over the past few years, we have made tremendous strides in improving our quality results. And we feel that this year's mixed results were the result of an isolated issue related to Universal American integration activity. We have already begun executing a plan to improve member satisfaction and operational measures in these 2 H contracts and expect improvement next year. 
Finally, our Medicare PDP segment again demonstrated strong growth and financial performance. At the end of the quarter, we served 1.7 million members, an increase of over 641,000 members or 61% versus the third quarter last year. The strong membership growth is primarily due to the launch of our Value Script product, which has resonated well with seniors due to its attractive premium and benefit design. For the 2020 plan year, we are excited about the positioning of our PDP offerings. Our basic PDP plans will be below the benchmark or within the de minimis range in all 34 CMS regions. 
Regarding our enhanced plans, we were able to introduce a second low-premium product, Wellness Rx, due to our acquisition of Aetna's PDP business. We believe this product, coupled with our Value Script product, position us well for 2020. 
The transition of the Aetna PDP membership to WellCare-branded products is starting on January 1, 2020. This remains a top priority for WellCare. The additional products, consumer insights and tools we now have as a result of the Aetna PDP acquisition in combination with our competitive pharmacy cost structure gives us confidence in our ability to grow this profitable line of business. 
In closing, I am proud of how our WellCare associates have been able to balance their Centene integration planning responsibilities while staying focused on running our business, as demonstrated by our strong year-to-date results. I'm excited about the tremendous potential that will arise from a combined Centene-WellCare enterprise. However, we all understand that we must remain focused on executing on our 2019 priorities as this will allow WellCare to move into 2020 and the pending Centene merger with strong momentum. 
I'll now turn the call over to Drew for a more detailed discussion of our financial results. Drew?"

As a reminder, we are not updating 2019 financial guidance since we are under a Merger Agreement with Centene. 
For the third quarter of 2019, our adjusted EPS was $5.50 compared with $3.33 in the third quarter of 2018, representing a 65% increase year-over-year. On a year-to-date basis, our adjusted EPS is already at $13.50 through 9 months. While Q4 earnings are typically the lowest of the year, we are still on track to deliver very strong earnings in 2019, which bodes well for the strength of our business as we enter into the merger with Centene anticipated to close by the first half of 2020. 
Adjusted total revenue of $7.1 billion in the quarter, which is 43% higher than Q3 of 2018, was driven by our acquisition of Meridian in September of 2018 as well as year-over-year organic growth in all 3 of our segments. 
Let's go deeper into each line of business. Our Medicaid business experienced year-over-year adjusted premium revenue growth of 55%, driven by our acquisition of Meridian along with organic growth from our expanded footprint and mix of products in Florida. We were also pleased with the overall performance of the Medicaid business as our adjusted Medicaid MBR was 89.0% in Q3, down from 91.3% in the prior quarter. This is driven by strong execution on quality and health care affordability initiatives as well as rates. 
To follow up on last quarter's commentary, our Illinois business is making progress such that our current and projected performance no longer warrants a premium deficiency reserve or PDR. As such, we released the remaining $10.1 million in Q3, which was worth about 20 basis points on the adjusted Medicaid MBR. 
While we've made progress, there is still more wood to chop in Illinois. And while overall Medicaid performance was strong in the quarter, we are never satisfied and always look for additional levers to improve the performance of our businesses and deliver value to our state customers. 
As Ken mentioned, we continue to prepare for the North Carolina statewide contract. The start-up spending for North Carolina continued to ramp up in Q3 as we incurred $9.2 million pretax or minus $0.14 of adjusted EPS during Q3. Those costs are embedded within adjusted earnings. 
Our Medicare Advantage business certainly contributed to the strength of the Q3 earnings. The absolute MBR was very strong at 83.3%, both for Q3 and year-to-date 2019. This is a great result that should bode well for 2020. We are pedal to the metal with the annual enrollment period, and we're pleased to be able to hold aggregate benefits relatively flat in our overall Medicare Advantage product portfolio as previously planned despite the return of the ACA fee. 
Looking ahead to 2021, our aggregate economic positioning from recently released Star Ratings is consistent with our positioning in 2020 in terms of aggregate revenue and economic star capture. This is because the list of 3.5 stars in many of our Medicare plans, including Georgia, Tennessee, Arkansas, Mississippi, South Carolina HMO and Illinois, helped to offset a couple of our legacy Universal American H contracts, which fell to 3.5 stars. As Ken stated, we have identified the root cause and have a plan to regain star momentum in these 2 contracts now that the Universal American integration is behind us. 
Moving on to PDP. The strength in our PDP business continued from a membership, revenue and MBR perspective. Our membership and revenue grew 60% and 32%, respectively, year-over-year and we like the positioning of our products for 2020. PDP MBR continues to track ahead of our expectations with a year-to-date MBR of 82.6% before we enter the fourth quarter, which has a seasonally lower MBR.

Our membership and revenue grew 60% and 32%, respectively, year-over-year and we like the positioning of our products for 2020. PDP MBR continues to track ahead of our expectations with a year-to-date MBR of 82.6% before we enter the fourth quarter, which has a seasonally lower MBR. 
If you look at the public PDP data, we are well positioned in 2020 with multiple attractive products, including year 2 of our Value Script product, which is performing very well in 2019; a new WellCare Wellness Rx PDP product we designed to be attractive to choosers; and the best auto-assign benchmark positioning since I've been at WellCare with 32 regions below the benchmark and 2 de minimis. 
We continue to work on the integration of the Aetna PDP business and take the appropriate steps in 2019 to maximize aggregate PDP membership retention and growth, including legacy WellCare and Aetna products for 1/1/2020. 
On one last pharmacy note, we continue to work through the PBM RFP with multiple parties as we seek to select a partner for 2021 and beyond and expect to wrap up the RFP process in the fourth quarter of 2019.
Regarding other elements of the third quarter, the adjusted SG&A ratio at 7.6% for the quarter compares favorably to 8.5% in Q3 2018. The ratio at 7.2% year-to-date compares favorably to 8.1% in the same period in 2018. As Ken mentioned, very nice operating leverage in 2019. 
Year-to-date favorable development stands at $247 million versus $215 million in the same period in 2018. Days in claims payable was at 51.4, up from 48.8 days in Q2. 
Our adjusted effective income tax rate was 23.25% in the quarter, bringing the year-to-date rate to 22.8%. 
We had $434 million of cash on hand at parent compared to $249 million last quarter end and $1.2 billion available on our credit facility as of September 30. 
Finally, our debt-to-capital ratio as of September 30, 2019, was 29.5%. 
We continue to work very well with Centene on integration planning so that we can hit the ground running upon closing of the transaction. I am really pleased with the focus and execution by the WellCare team in 2019 and the resulting strength of our businesses as we work towards closing the transaction. 
Thank you for your support of WellCare through the years, especially the last 5. We appreciate your interest in WellCare."

While these risks and uncertainties may cause our future results to differ from today's statements, we are not undertaking any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement. 
Certain financial information that we will discuss today include adjustments to expenses that we believe are not indicative of long-term business operations. Please refer to our news release published this morning available on our website at www.wellcare.com for a reconciliation of financial measures determined under generally accepted accounting principles to our adjusted measures. We will identify measures that we have adjusted.
Our discussion today will be led by Ken Burdick, WellCare's Chief Executive Officer; and Drew Asher, the company's Chief Financial Officer. As we stated in connection with our first quarter 2019 call, due to the previously announced definitive Merger Agreement with Centene Corporation, we are not updating financial guidance. The guidance for the full year 2019 remains as of February 5, 2019. Additionally, we will not be taking questions after these prepared remarks. 
I will now turn the discussion over to Ken. Ken?"

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today as we review our third quarter 2019 results. This morning, I will review key items from the quarter, provide some additional insights into our business and share an update on the merger with Centene. Then Drew will review our financial results in greater detail. 
We are pleased to report third quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share of $5.50, which represents a 65% increase over the same period last year. Additionally, we reported total adjusted revenue of $7.1 billion, representing a 43% increase over the same period last year. This growth has enabled us to achieve significant operating leverage, as demonstrated by our 90 basis point year-over-year improvement in our adjusted SG&A ratio. All 3 business segments continue to perform very well, and we are excited about our momentum as we finish 2019 and look towards 2020. 
We also continue to make progress on the pending Centene merger. We recently agreed to sell our Missouri and Nebraska health plans to Anthem. The agreement, which is subject to regulatory approvals and the closing of the Centene-WellCare transaction, represents an important milestone towards completing our combination with Centene. I want to acknowledge our associates in Missouri and Nebraska for their tireless commitment to WellCare. They have done an outstanding job serving our members, providers and government partners. 
Additionally, we have received state insurance department conditional approvals in all but 2 states, Illinois and New Jersey. Parties continue to work collaboratively with the Department of Justice to obtain Hart-Scott-Rodino approval. Our integration planning teams continue to work collaboratively and make significant progress to ensure we combine the best of both companies and hit the ground running once the transaction closes. 
Turning back to our financial results and starting with our Medicaid segment. At the end of the quarter, Medicaid membership was 4.1 million and adjusted Medicaid premium revenue grew to $4.8 billion, a 55% increase over last year's third quarter result. Our Medicaid segment is performing very well. I am pleased to see the 130 basis point improvement in our adjusted Medicaid MBR from 91.3% in the second quarter to 89% in the current quarter, and we're beginning to see improvement in our Illinois Medicaid business. Drew will elaborate more on this later.
In North Carolina, we are cautiously optimistic that all regions will go live on February 1, 2020, a few months behind the state's original time frame to launch certain regions in November. Thanks to the dedication of many WellCare associates, we are successfully working through the readiness review process and we are on track for the February launch date. 
Our Medicare Health Plans segment continues to produce strong financial results this year. The Medicare MBR of 83.3% is 150 basis points lower than the third quarter of 2018. Medicare premium revenue grew 16% year-over-year to $1.8 billion, driven by a combination of organic growth and the acquisition of Meridian. 
Based on our initial read of the competitive landscape for the 2020 plan year, we feel that our products are well positioned to offer value and attractive benefits to seniors, and we struck the appropriate balance between membership growth and margin. We entered 3 new states for 2020, Missouri, New Hampshire and Washington, bringing the total number of states where we offer Medicare plans to 25. We will grow our service area in 2020 by 87 new counties. And we are also expanding our product portfolio with additional PPO and C-SNP products to meet the diverse needs of our Medicare beneficiaries. 
The level of sophistication and our bid strategy and product development improves each year and quite frankly, is becoming a core competency at WellCare. Our 2020 plan year Medicare star results were mixed. Although we maintained our 4-star ratings for our Florida and California plans, our ratings in Houston, New York and Maine dropped below 4 stars. On a positive side, we were also able to improve the star scores for our Medicare contracts that serve Illinois, Tennessee, Mississippi, Arkansas, South Carolina HMO and Georgia, all of these from 3.0 to 3.5 stars. Achieving 3.5 stars in these contracts has positive financial implications, which Drew will discuss shortly. 
Over the past few years, we have made tremendous strides in improving our quality results. And we feel that this year's mixed results were the result of an isolated issue related to Universal American integration activity. We have already begun executing a plan to improve member satisfaction and operational measures in these 2 H contracts and expect improvement next year. 
Finally, our Medicare PDP segment again demonstrated strong growth and financial performance. At the end of the quarter, we served 1.7 million members, an increase of over 641,000 members or 61% versus the third quarter last year. The strong membership growth is primarily due to the launch of our Value Script product, which has resonated well with seniors due to its attractive premium and benefit design. For the 2020 plan year, we are excited about the positioning of our PDP offerings. Our basic PDP plans will be below the benchmark or within the de minimis range in all 34 CMS regions. 
Regarding our enhanced plans, we were able to introduce a second low-premium product, Wellness Rx, due to our acquisition of Aetna's PDP business. We believe this product, coupled with our Value Script product, position us well for 2020. 
The transition of the Aetna PDP membership to WellCare-branded products is starting on January 1, 2020. This remains a top priority for WellCare. The additional products, consumer insights and tools we now have as a result of the Aetna PDP acquisition in combination with our competitive pharmacy cost structure gives us confidence in our ability to grow this profitable line of business. 
In closing, I am proud of how our WellCare associates have been able to balance their Centene integration planning responsibilities while staying focused on running our business, as demonstrated by our strong year-to-date results. I'm excited about the tremendous potential that will arise from a combined Centene-WellCare enterprise. However, we all understand that we must remain focused on executing on our 2019 priorities as this will allow WellCare to move into 2020 and the pending Centene merger with strong momentum. 
I'll now turn the call over to Drew for a more detailed discussion of our financial results. Drew?"

As a reminder, we are not updating 2019 financial guidance since we are under a Merger Agreement with Centene. 
For the third quarter of 2019, our adjusted EPS was $5.50 compared with $3.33 in the third quarter of 2018, representing a 65% increase year-over-year. On a year-to-date basis, our adjusted EPS is already at $13.50 through 9 months. While Q4 earnings are typically the lowest of the year, we are still on track to deliver very strong earnings in 2019, which bodes well for the strength of our business as we enter into the merger with Centene anticipated to close by the first half of 2020. 
Adjusted total revenue of $7.1 billion in the quarter, which is 43% higher than Q3 of 2018, was driven by our acquisition of Meridian in September of 2018 as well as year-over-year organic growth in all 3 of our segments. 
Let's go deeper into each line of business. Our Medicaid business experienced year-over-year adjusted premium revenue growth of 55%, driven by our acquisition of Meridian along with organic growth from our expanded footprint and mix of products in Florida. We were also pleased with the overall performance of the Medicaid business as our adjusted Medicaid MBR was 89.0% in Q3, down from 91.3% in the prior quarter. This is driven by strong execution on quality and health care affordability initiatives as well as rates. 
To follow up on last quarter's commentary, our Illinois business is making progress such that our current and projected performance no longer warrants a premium deficiency reserve or PDR. As such, we released the remaining $10.1 million in Q3, which was worth about 20 basis points on the adjusted Medicaid MBR. 
While we've made progress, there is still more wood to chop in Illinois. And while overall Medicaid performance was strong in the quarter, we are never satisfied and always look for additional levers to improve the performance of our businesses and deliver value to our state customers. 
As Ken mentioned, we continue to prepare for the North Carolina statewide contract. The start-up spending for North Carolina continued to ramp up in Q3 as we incurred $9.2 million pretax or minus $0.14 of adjusted EPS during Q3. Those costs are embedded within adjusted earnings. 
Our Medicare Advantage business certainly contributed to the strength of the Q3 earnings. The absolute MBR was very strong at 83.3%, both for Q3 and year-to-date 2019. This is a great result that should bode well for 2020. We are pedal to the metal with the annual enrollment period, and we're pleased to be able to hold aggregate benefits relatively flat in our overall Medicare Advantage product portfolio as previously planned despite the return of the ACA fee. 
Looking ahead to 2021, our aggregate economic positioning from recently released Star Ratings is consistent with our positioning in 2020 in terms of aggregate revenue and economic star capture. This is because the list of 3.5 stars in many of our Medicare plans, including Georgia, Tennessee, Arkansas, Mississippi, South Carolina HMO and Illinois, helped to offset a couple of our legacy Universal American H contracts, which fell to 3.5 stars. As Ken stated, we have identified the root cause and have a plan to regain star momentum in these 2 contracts now that the Universal American integration is behind us.

Our membership and revenue grew 60% and 32%, respectively, year-over-year and we like the positioning of our products for 2020. PDP MBR continues to track ahead of our expectations with a year-to-date MBR of 82.6% before we enter the fourth quarter, which has a seasonally lower MBR.
