So we had a good start to fiscal 2019, growing 9% in our first fiscal quarter compared to the same period a year ago. The strength of our business model delivered another quarter of sustained revenues, strong earnings and an extremely strong free cash flow. 
Our semiconductor business helped us relatively well. Not surprisingly, our wireless business was down sharply, and our storage business underperformed somewhat. However, these challenges were mitigated, more than mitigated by our networking business, which grew double digits year-over-year. In addition, we were very pleased to see that the broadband business has started to recover and stabilize in the quarter. In fact, putting in all together, the semiconductor segment was actually up year-over-year in the first quarter if you exclude the expected sharp decline in wireless.
Turning to infrastructure. This business, which includes SAN switching, mainframe and enterprise software delivered solid top line results, benefiting from a very robust enterprise spending environment. The integration of CA onto the Broadcom platform is very well underway, and we are confident that we can meet, if not exceed, in the long term -- exceed the long-term revenue and profitability target that we laid out for CA to you last year. In fact, renewals in our CA business have been strong this past quarter, and we believe we are -- the dollar commitments from our core customers will continue to grow. 
Many of our peers have commented that they are seeing a softening demand environment, especially out of China. While we're experiencing the same demand dynamics, we have factored in much of this macroeconomic backdrop when we provided fiscal 2019 guidance last quarter. As a result, after a solid start to the year, we are reaffirming our fiscal 2019 revenue guidance of $24.5 billion. Having said that, we expect our semiconductor business to bottom in the second fiscal quarter, driven almost entirely by the seasonal drop in wireless. But looking to the second half, we are confident the semiconductor business will resume very meaningful growth. This will be driven by strong product cycles in both wireless and networking, coupled with a recovery in broadband. Infrastructure software, on the other hand, is expected to sustain throughout the year. 
So in summary, our diversification strategy is working, and we are effectively managing the decline in wireless as well as in the broader semiconductor industry headwinds. 
Now let me turn over to Tom to provide you with more color in Q1."
25016048,602450197,1687642,"Broadcom Inc., Q1 2019 Earnings Call, Mar 14, 2019",2019-03-14,"Earnings Calls","Broadcom Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Hock. Consolidated net revenue for the first quarter was $5.8 billion, a 9% increase from a year ago. And EPS came in at $5.55, an 8% increase from a year ago, off of a 441 million weighted average fully diluted share count. In addition, fr",790,"Thank you, Hock. 
Consolidated net revenue for the first quarter was $5.8 billion, a 9% increase from a year ago. And EPS came in at $5.55, an 8% increase from a year ago, off of a 441 million weighted average fully diluted share count. 
In addition, free cash flow is $2.03 billion or 35% of revenue. I would highlight free cash flow grew 39% year-over-year. 
The semiconductor solutions segment revenue was $4.4 billion and represented 76% of our total revenue this quarter. This was down 12% year-on-year on a comparable basis. But as Hock explained, the semiconductor segment was actually up slightly year-over-year in the first quarter, excluding wireless. 
Let me now turn to our infrastructure software segment. Revenue was $1.4 billion and represented 24% of revenue. SAN switching continues to perform extremely well. And as Hock mentioned, mainframe enterprise software is off to a good start.
Let me now provide additional detail on the financial performance. Operating expenses were $1.08 billion. Operating income from continuing operations was $3.05 billion and represented 52.7% of net revenue. 
Adjusted EBITDA was $3.24 billion and represented 55.9% of net revenue. This figure excludes $143 million of depreciation. 
Inventory decreased $50 million from the prior quarter. Similarly, semiconductor receivables were actually down, which is typical for Q1 even though receivables increased $352 million overall due to the CA acquisition. Total current liabilities excluding debt increased $2.5 billion due to CA. However, excluding CA, total current liabilities excluding debt decreased meaningfully more than receivables, primarily due to the payment of our annual performance bonus in Q1. 
In addition, we spent $99 million on capital expenditures. As a result, we had record Q1 free cash flow from operations at $2.03 billion or 35% of revenue. This represents 39% growth in free cash flow from operations compared to Q1 of 2018. 
I would note a couple of things. One, fiscal Q1 is typically our seasonally weakest cash flow quarter due to the annual performance bonus payment we make to our employees in the quarter that we accrue throughout the prior fiscal year. In Q1, we paid approximately $530 million in APV cash bonuses to our employees. 
And second, I would also note that we accrued $723 million of restructuring integration expenses, of which that includes $363 million of cash payments in the quarter. 
In Q1, we returned $4.6 billion to stockholders consisting of $1.1 billion in the form of cash dividends and $3.5 billion for the repurchase and elimination of 14.2 million AVGO shares. We ended the quarter with $5.1 billion of cash, $37.6 billion of total debt, 396 million outstanding shares and 451 million fully diluted shares outstanding.
Turning to our fiscal year 2019 guidance. As Hock discussed, we are reaffirming our full year revenue guidance of approximately $24.5 billion, including approximately $19.5 billion from semiconductor solutions and approximately $5 billion from infrastructure software. IP licensing is not expected to generate a material amount of revenue. 
On a non-GAAP basis, operating margins are expected to be approximately 51%. Net interest expense and others is expected to be approximately $1.25 billion. We do not contemplate any debt paydown in fiscal year 2019. 
The tax rate is forecasted to be approximately 11%. Depreciation is expected to be approximately $600 million. CapEx is expected to be approximately $550 million. And as a result, free cash flow from continuing operations is expected to be approximately $10 billion. 
And finally, stock-based compensation expense is expected to be approximately $2 billion. As we outlined last quarter, we granted approximately 31 million of restricted and performance stock units as part of the multiyear grant that would vest over the next 7 years. As a result, for modeling purposes, we would expect the fully diluted share count in the second quarter to be approximately 450 million. This excludes any stock repurchases. Similarly, for modeling purposes, we would expect stock-based compensation expense to be approximately $530 million in Q2. Looking forward beyond Q2, we would expect the share count excluding the stock repurchases and eliminations to remain relatively unchanged, and the quarterly stock-based compensation in the second half of 2018 will start to decrease slightly each quarter. We would expect stock-based compensation to level out at approximately $1.5 billion in 2021. 
Now on the capital allocation. Our capital allocation strategy remains the same. We plan to maintain the current quarterly dividend payout of $2.65 per share throughout the year, subject to quarterly board approval, which means we plan to pay out over $4 billion in cash dividends in fiscal 2019. In addition, we remain committed to buying back and eliminating a total of $8 billion of stock in fiscal 2019.
That concludes my prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions] Operator, please open up the call for questions."

And it's broader in data centers, but let's start with data centers. Tomahawk 3, which is the 12.8 terabit top of the rack switch, which has just barely started production shipments. In fact, we do expect -- we are fully expecting the ramp of Tomahawk 3 as part of the broader data center scale-out with 400 gig pipes in the connect, so to speak, to really start just about right now. In fact, our Q2, fiscal Q2 and progressing up to the rest, the end of the year as more and more on the names you were mentioning type of cloud jumping and expand upgrade as the same data centers and simply because, as you know, expanding the capacity of data centers and pipes is the simplest way to be decongest, to minimize or mitigate congestion control in these huge data centers, in this large cloud. So there's a broad refreshing and upgrading of data centers among these cloud guys. One area, as mentioned, Tomahawk 3 are shipping, which is just starting this quarter in significant volumes. What's also not so perhaps obvious but is very real for us is the fact that [indiscernible] 400 gigabit per second throughput pipes, you need interconnect, fiber optic interconnect that are built and dedicated in that area. And it's very high-tech products, which we are very deeply engaged in. And that brings the content in bio multiple sectors in this data center And then as you expand the top of the right switch, I you have you need to connect data center to data center, what is called DCI interconnectivity. And the approach that is being taken, which we are also very engaged in, have been multiple OEMs supporting the cloud guys is obviously coherent, coherent fiber optic connection at 400 gig. And we believe we are very much in the lead on that area as well. So these are product lines -- product cycles we are seeing that are continuing their emphasis of double-digit growth in networking. And it expands more than that. In routing, we are going to be launching and ramping our new generation router, Jericho 2, probably in Q3 of our fiscal year. And that's going into edge routing, call routing among the service providers, especially the telecom guys. And we're starting to see the preparation in that happening. So yes, we feel very good about about networking and the ability to sustain the level of growth we have been seeing."

And a big part of this driving the recovery is cable motors, with the delivery DOCSIS, as they call it, 3.1. We've seen implementations across multiple carriers, service providers of DOCSIS 3.1 so that's very good. What we're also seeing, of course, is in gateway access, which is a big part of broadband. Among many carriers, too, is the new generation of DSL, digital subscriber line, as they need to expand capacity and throughput and go through what called the next-generation 35B and we see a lot of that in Europe, some in North American carriers. But what's also equally interesting is as they go to the last mile into households, what we're also seeing is adoption of wireless connectivity or what we all call WiFi. And what we're seeing now is as we see this wired gateways, whether it's cable, modem DOCSIS 3.1 of digital subscriber line, we are seeing -- especially in the back half of the year, enterprises and more and more service providers, telecoms start to attach the next-generation WiFi, WiFi 6 on to those gateways. And in WiFi 6, I'm very, very pleased to note that we are very much in the lead in having developed and productized a whole suite of products that address towards those enterprise, and so this provides us and -- but most of that will be only shipping, we believe, in the second half of the year, but fiscal and both calendar.

I mean, as I say, we have done quite a bit of acquisitions in very strong assets -- there's an echo -- in the semiconductor space. And obviously, it's something we continue to look at because, obviously, semiconductor is a core area for us and -- but you also know we're not necessarily limiting ourselves to that. We look to a broader area of technology, software and appliances as Brocade would be considered. And while we continue the interest in the semiconductor space and there's still targets and be continue to be very thoughtful and timely in terms of the time -- in terms of how we approach those acquisitions. And we have observed our behavior over the last several years. We tend to do it in a very -- in a measured pace simply because it's important. In fact, it's critical on any acquisition to make that we can integrate it very, very well. And that's what we're doing with CA right now, and we're right in the thick of it, as you noticed in the numbers we're going through as we drive down to generate the kind of business model we expect to get out of CA. Turning on to the next question you asked, which is -- which leads to software, yes, it's turning out to be a very, very nice deal for us. We actually are seeing for our core customers, as you recall, we have differentiated customers associated with the very core large customers who consumes both mainframe and enterprise distributor software as opposed to much smaller long tail of noncore customers. If you look at those core customers we're focusing on, after about at least 1 quarter now today more than 1 quarter of going through selling, renewals and adoption of our software, we feel that the business model has been extremely -- our business model has been extremely successful. I mean, the growth as we see of dollars that we get through renewals and expansion of footprint in those core customers are -- it's pretty -- it's surpassing our expectations. It's gone double digits. But that's only 3 months, so we're still early stage, and we'll continue to push that. But as we also made certain announcements on at least 1 or maybe 2 deals we have done on our new PLA model of both mainframe and enterprise free software, this has been very well received in the marketplace by our core customers, and we are hopeful it's something that makes so much sense that we'll expand -- we'll expect to see more and more of these significant transactions occurring as we move forward through the rest of the year."

And we will see, for want of better word, because it's seasonal and it's very significant sharp bounce back, which adds to my -- our confidence that our full year guidance is something that's going to happen. Very simple. And that in the second half, we'd see that meaningful, you correctly pointed out, somewhat double-digit growth in the semiconductor segment of our business. It's -- as I mentioned in answer to earlier questions, data center, especially networking, we have a whole slew of new product cycles. We'll generate a big part of that double-digit growth. So in our view, wireless -- actually, that happened in the past. And in this particular year, perhaps the difference between this coming year '19 versus '18 is simply 2 things. One is we're probably going to get better share as mentioned before. And secondly, content increase. It always happens, year after year, as I mentioned an example, in WiFi, you'll see WiFi 6. WiFi 6 is not just in enterprise and gateways in service providers. We are seeing WiFi 6, the new generation in 20082.11 AA and in handsets, that drives -- I call it strong content increase and as they increase amount of bands in that we constantly see as basically wireless continue to proliferate in various areas in the world, continues to expand the amount of bands, content in this next-generation phone. So all that is going to drive a bounce back with perhaps increased content for -- for our products. As far as volume is concerned, yes, like I will probably be as uncertain as you are how much the volume would be but regardless, it's -- there's a lot of mitigating factors, and the biggest part of it is pure content increase."

So we had a good start to fiscal 2019, growing 9% in our first fiscal quarter compared to the same period a year ago. The strength of our business model delivered another quarter of sustained revenues, strong earnings and an extremely strong free cash flow. 
Our semiconductor business held up relatively well. Not surprisingly, our wireless business was down sharply, and our storage business underperformed somewhat. However, these challenges were mitigated, more than mitigated by our networking business, which grew double digits year-over-year. In addition, we were very pleased to see that the broadband business has started to recover and stabilize in the quarter. In fact, putting in all together, the semiconductor segment was actually up year-over-year in the first quarter if you exclude the expected sharp decline in wireless.
Turning to infrastructure. This business, which includes SAN switching, mainframe and enterprise software delivered solid top line results, benefiting from a very robust enterprise spending environment. The integration of CA onto the Broadcom platform is very well underway, and we are confident that we can meet, if not exceed, in the long term -- exceed the long-term revenue and profitability target that we laid out for CA to you last year. In fact, renewals in our CA business have been strong this past quarter, and we believe we are -- the dollar commitments from our core customers will continue to grow. 
Many of our peers have commented that they are seeing a softening demand environment, especially out of China. While we're experiencing the same demand dynamics, we have factored in much of this macroeconomic backdrop when we provided fiscal 2019 guidance last quarter. As a result, after a solid start to the year, we are reaffirming our fiscal 2019 revenue guidance of $24.5 billion. 
Having said that, we expect our semiconductor business to bottom in the second fiscal quarter, driven almost entirely by the seasonal drop in wireless. But looking to the second half, we are confident the semiconductor business will resume very meaningful growth. This will be driven by strong product cycles in both wireless and networking, coupled with a recovery in broadband. Infrastructure software, on the other hand, is expected to sustain throughout the year. 
So in summary, our diversification strategy is working, and we are effectively managing the decline in wireless as well as the broader semiconductor industry headwinds. 
Now let me turn over to Tom to provide you with more color on Q1."
25016048,602450197,1687809,"Broadcom Inc., Q1 2019 Earnings Call, Mar 14, 2019",2019-03-14,"Earnings Calls","Broadcom Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Hock. Consolidated net revenue for the first quarter was $5.8 billion, a 9% increase from a year ago. And EPS came in at $5.55, an 8% increase from a year ago, off of a 441 million weighted average fully diluted share count. In addition, free",790,"Thank you, Hock. Consolidated net revenue for the first quarter was $5.8 billion, a 9% increase from a year ago. And EPS came in at $5.55, an 8% increase from a year ago, off of a 441 million weighted average fully diluted share count. 
In addition, free cash flow is $2.03 billion or 35% of revenue. I would highlight free cash flow grew 39% year-over-year. 
The semiconductor solutions segment revenue was $4.4 billion and represented 76% of our total revenue this quarter. This was down 12% year-on-year on a comparable basis. But as Hock explained, the semiconductor segment was actually up slightly year-over-year in the first quarter, excluding wireless. 
Let me now turn to our infrastructure software segment. Revenue was $1.4 billion and represented 24% of revenue. SAN switching continues to perform extremely well. And as Hock mentioned, mainframe enterprise software is off to a good start.
Let me now provide additional detail on our financial performance. Operating expenses were $1.08 billion. Operating income from continuing operations was $3.05 billion and represented 52.7% of net revenue. 
Adjusted EBITDA was $3.24 billion and represented 55.9% of net revenue. This figure excludes $143 million of depreciation. 
Inventory decreased $50 million from the prior quarter. Similarly, semiconductor receivables were actually down, which is typical for Q1 even though receivables increased $352 million overall due to the CA acquisition. Total current liabilities, excluding debt, increased $2.5 billion due to CA. However, excluding CA, total current liabilities excluding debt decreased meaningfully more than receivables, primarily due to the payment of our annual performance bonus in Q1. 
In addition, we spent $99 million on capital expenditures. As a result, we had record Q1 free cash flow from operations at $2.03 billion or 35% of revenue. This represents 39% growth in free cash flow from operations compared to Q1 of 2018. 
I would note a couple of things. One, fiscal Q1 is typically our seasonally weakest cash flow quarter due to the annual performance bonus payment we make to our employees in the quarter that we accrue all throughout the prior fiscal year. In Q1, we paid approximately $530 million in APV cash bonuses to our employees. 
And second, I would also note that we accrued $723 million of restructuring integration expenses, of which that includes $363 million of cash payments in the quarter. 
In Q1, we returned $4.6 billion to stockholders consisting of $1.1 billion in the form of cash dividends and $3.5 billion for the repurchase and elimination of 14.2 million AVGO shares. We ended the quarter with $5.1 billion of cash, $37.6 billion of total debt, 396 million outstanding shares and 451 million fully diluted shares outstanding.
Turning to our fiscal year 2019 guidance. As Hock discussed, we are reaffirming our full year revenue guidance of approximately $24.5 billion, including approximately $19.5 billion from semiconductor solutions and approximately $5 billion from infrastructure software. IP licensing is not expected to generate a material amount of revenue. 
On a non-GAAP basis, operating margins are expected to be approximately 51%. Net interest expense and others expected to be approximately $1.25 billion. We do not contemplate any debt paydown in fiscal year 2019. 
The tax rate is forecasted to be approximately 11%. Depreciation is expected to be approximately $600 million. CapEx is expected to be approximately $550 million. And as a result, free cash flow from continuing operations is expected to be approximately $10 billion. 
And finally, stock-based compensation expense is expected to be approximately $2 billion. As we outlined last quarter, we granted approximately 31 million of restricted and performance stock units as part of the multiyear grant that will vest over the next 7 years. As a result, for modeling purposes, we would expect the fully diluted share count in the second quarter to be approximately 450 million. This excludes any stock repurchases. 
Similarly, for modeling purposes, we would expect stock-based compensation expense to be approximately $530 million in Q2. Looking forward beyond Q2, we would expect the share count, excluding any stock repurchases and eliminations, to remain relatively unchanged, and the quarterly stock-based compensation in the second half of 2019 to start to decrease slightly each quarter. We would expect stock-based compensation to level out at approximately $1.5 billion in 2021. 
Now on to capital allocation. Our capital allocation strategy remains the same. We plan to maintain the current quarterly dividend payout of $2.65 per share throughout the year, subject to quarterly board approval, which means we plan to pay out over $4 billion in cash dividends in fiscal 2019.

And it's broader than just data centers. But let's start with data centers. Tomahawk 3, which is the 12.8 terabit top of the rack switch, has just barely started production shipments. In fact, we do expect -- we are fully expecting the ramp of Tomahawk 3 as part of the broader data center scale-out with 400 gig pipes in the connect, so to speak, to really start just about right now. In fact, our Q2, fiscal Q2 and progressing up to the rest of the end of the year as more and more on the names you were mentioning type of cloud jumping and expand -- and upgrade as the same as data centers, and simply because, as you know, expanding the capacity of data centers and pipes is the simplest way to decongest, to minimize or mitigate congestion control in these huge data centers, in this large cloud tech. So there's a broad refreshing and upgrading of data centers among these cloud guys. One area, as mentioned, Tomahawk 3, are shipping, which is just starting this quarter in significant volumes. What's also not so perhaps obvious, but is very real for us, is the fact that not at the run 400 gigabit per second throughput pipes, you need interconnect, fiber optic interconnect that are built and dedicated in that area. That's very high-tech products, which we are very deeply engaged in. And that brings the content on bio multiple sector in this data center realm. And then as you expand the top of the right switch, I can't resist saying, you have to -- you need to connect data center to data center, what is called DCI interconnectivity. And the approach that is being taken, which we are also very engaged in, have been multiple OEMs, who are supporting the cloud guys, is obviously coherent, coherent fiber optic connection at 400 gig. And we believe we are very much in the lead on that area as well. So these are product lives of product cycles we are seeing that are continuing their impetus of double-digit growth in networking. And it expands more than that. In routing, we are going to be launching and ramping our new generation router, Jericho 2, probably in Q3 of our fiscal year. And that's going into Edge routing, call routing, among the service providers, especially the telecom guys. And we're starting to see the preparation in that happening. So yes, we feel very good about networking and the ability to sustain the level of growth we have been seeing."

And a big part of driving the recovery is cable modem with their delivery DOCSIS, as they call it, 3.1. We've seen implementations across multiple carriers, service providers of DOCSIS 3.1 so that's very good. What we're also seeing, of course, is in gateway access, which is a big part of broadband. Among many carriers, too, is the new generation of DSL, digital subscriber line, as they need to expand capacity and throughput and go through -- what they're calling the next-generation G.fast or 35B and we're seeing a lot of that in Europe, some in North American carriers. So but what's also equally interesting is as they go to the last mile into households, what we're also seeing is adoption of wireless connectivity or what we all call Wi-Fi. And what we're seeing now is as we see this wired gateways, whether it's cable modem, DOCSIS 3.1, our digital subscriber line, we are seeing -- especially in the back half of the year, enterprises and more, and more service providers, telecoms start to attach the next-generation Wi-Fi, Wi-Fi 6 on to those gateways. And in Wi-Fi 6, I'm very, very pleased to note that we are very much in the lead in having developed and productized a whole suite of products that perfectly address towards those enterprise, and so this provides us -- and that -- but most of that will be only shipping, we believe, in the second half of the year, but fiscal and both calendar.

I mean, as I say, we have done quite a bit of acquisitions in very strong assets -- there's an echo -- in the semiconductor space. And it's obviously in here. It's something we continue to look at because, obviously, semiconductor is a core area for us and -- but you also know we're not necessarily limiting ourselves to that. We look towards a broader area of technology, software and appliances as Brocade would be considered. And while we continue the interest in the semiconductor space and there are still targets, and we'll be -- continue to be very thoughtful and timely in terms of the time -- in terms of how we approach those acquisitions. And we have observed our behavior over the last several years. We tend to do it in a very -- on a measured pace simply because it's important. In fact, it's critical on any acquisition we make that we can integrate it very, very well. And that's what we're doing with CA right now, and we're right in the thick of it, as you noticed in the numbers we are going through as we drive down to generate the kind of business model we expect to get out of CA. Turning on to the next question you asked, which is -- which leads to software. Yes, it's turning out to be a very, very nice deal for us. We actually are seeing for our core customers, as you recall, we have differentiated customers associated between very core large customers who consumes both mainframe and enterprise distributed software as opposed to much smaller long tail of non-core customers. If you look at those core customers we are focusing on, after about at least one quarter now today more than one quarter of going through selling, renewals and adoption of our software, we feel that the business model has been extremely -- our business model has been extremely successful. I mean, the growth as we see of dollars that we get through renewals and expansion of use footprint in those core customers are -- it's pretty -- it's surpassing our expectations. It's gone double digits. But that's only 3 months, so we're still early stage, and we'll continue to push that. But as we have also made certain announcements on at least 1 or maybe 2 deals we have done on our new PLA model of both mainframe and enterprise breed software, this has been very well received in the marketplace by our core customers, and we are hopeful it's something that makes so much sense that we'll expand -- we'll expect to see more and more of these significant transactions occurring as we move forward through the rest of the year."

It's actually not that because that product cycle in wireless is, in all our views, as is mine, very predictable. And we will see that happen in our Q3 -- fiscal Q3, Q4 of this -- of this fiscal '19. It will. We're already starting production in our wafer sets, which has longer product cycle on FBARs in some of the products. And we will see, for want of better word, because it's so seasonal and it's very significant, a sharp bounce back, which adds to my -- our confidence that our full year guidance is something that's going to happen. Very simple. And that in the second half, we'd see that meaningful, you correctly pointed out, somewhat double-digit growth in the semiconductor segment of the business. It's -- as I mentioned in answer to earlier questions, data center, especially networking, we have a whole slew of new product cycles. We'll generate a big part of that double-digit growth. So in our view, wireless -- actually, that's happened in the past. And in this particular year, perhaps the difference between this coming year '19 versus '18 is simply 2 things. One is we're probably going to get better share as mentioned before. And secondly, content increase. It always happens, year after year, as I mentioned an example, in Wi-Fi, you'll see Wi-Fi 6. Wi-Fi 6 is not just in enterprise and excess gateways in service providers. We are seeing Wi-Fi 6, the new generation in 802.11ax in handsets, and that drives -- I call it strong content increase, as the increase amount of bands in the ad bar that we constantly see as basically wireless continue to proliferate in various areas of the world, continues to expand the amount of bands, content in this next-generation phone. So all that is going to drive a bounce back with perhaps increased content for -- for our products. As far as volume is concerned, yes, like you, I will probably be as uncertain as you are, how much the volume would be? But regardless, it's -- there's a lot of mitigating factors, and the biggest part of it is pure content increase."

And as Tom said, just one quarter. We expect to see more reductions. And these are not just cost of goods sold, but down below the line of operating expenses that we go through it better. One -- for Q1 is very critical to is the fact that it's product mix. Wireless is down, and the other products are humming along, our semiconductor products. And remember, year by year nature of a product life cycles in those semiconductor products, we always have an opportunity to expand by delivering more value to our customers, expand our gross margin around 50 to 100 basis points on just its natural cadence. That and mix, I think, is adding a lot of tailwind through improvement in gross margin."

This sounds like it's going to be a much stronger rebound than normal just on content alone. I mean, correct me if I'm wrong, but you've got 3 big areas that you're playing with, just enhancements alone. Of course your standard ball business, which covers everything above 2.4 gig. You're doing more products in the antenna congestion area now because I know you're doing antenna flexors and that problem is getting much more acute over the next year, especially as 5G comes on. But the Wi-Fi, 802.11ax, like you mentioned, not only in enterprise, but we're seeing that in handsets, and isn't it the cast that you've got a big lead over your closest competitor, maybe Qualcomm here. So should we expect, one, to see a bigger rebound just on content; two, for maybe just to have more legs than we'd otherwise expected beginning next year? I know units are an issue, but given Wi-Fi itself is being deployed, just -- and you play stronger to that, it should last longer, shouldn't it?"

So we had a good start to fiscal 2019, growing 9% in our first fiscal quarter compared to the same period a year ago. The strength of our business model delivered another quarter of sustained revenues, strong earnings and an extremely strong free cash flow. 
Our semiconductor business held up relatively well. Not surprisingly, our wireless business was down sharply, and our storage business underperformed somewhat. However, these challenges were mitigated, more than mitigated by our networking business, which grew double digits year-over-year. In addition, we were very pleased to see that the broadband business has started to recover and stabilize in the quarter. In fact, putting it all together, the semiconductor segment was actually up year-over-year in the first quarter if you exclude the expected sharp decline in wireless.
Turning to infrastructure. This business, which includes SAN switching, mainframe and enterprise software, delivered solid top line results, benefiting from a very robust enterprise spending environment. The integration of CA onto the Broadcom platform is very well underway, and we are confident that we can meet, if not exceed, in the long term -- exceed the long-term revenue and profitability target that we laid out for CA to you last year. In fact, renewals in our CA business have been strong this past quarter, and we believe we are -- and the dollar commitments from our core customers will continue to grow. 
Many of our peers have commented that they are seeing a softening demand environment, especially out of China. While we're experiencing the same demand dynamics, we have factored in much of this macroeconomic backdrop when we provided fiscal 2019 guidance last quarter. As a result, after a solid start to the year, we are reaffirming our fiscal 2019 revenue guidance of $24.5 billion. 
Having said that, we expect our semiconductor business to bottom in the second fiscal quarter, driven almost entirely by the seasonal drop in wireless. But looking to the second half, we are confident the semiconductor business will resume very meaningful growth. This will be driven by strong product cycles in both wireless and networking, coupled with a recovery in broadband. Infrastructure software, on the other hand, is expected to sustain throughout the year. 
So in summary, our diversification strategy is working, and we are effectively managing the decline in wireless as well as the broader semiconductor industry headwinds. 
Now let me turn over to Tom to provide you with more color on Q1."

Consolidated net revenue for the first quarter was $5.8 billion, a 9% increase from a year ago. And EPS came in at $5.55, an 8% increase from a year ago, off of a 441 million weighted average fully diluted share count. In addition, free",790,"Thank you, Hock. Consolidated net revenue for the first quarter was $5.8 billion, a 9% increase from a year ago. And EPS came in at $5.55, an 8% increase from a year ago, off of a 441 million weighted average fully diluted share count. 
In addition, free cash flow is $2.03 billion or 35% of revenue. I would highlight free cash flow grew 39% year-over-year. 
The semiconductor solutions segment revenue was $4.4 billion and represented 76% of our total revenue this quarter. This was down 12% year-on-year on a comparable basis. But as Hock explained, the semiconductor segment was actually up slightly year-over-year in the first quarter, excluding wireless. 
Let me now turn to our infrastructure software segment. Revenue was $1.4 billion and represented 24% of revenue. SAN switching continues to perform extremely well. And as Hock mentioned, mainframe enterprise software is off to a good start.
Let me now provide additional detail on our financial performance. Operating expenses were $1.08 billion. Operating income from continuing operations was $3.05 billion and represented 52.7% of net revenue. 
Adjusted EBITDA was $3.24 billion and represented 55.9% of net revenue. This figure excludes $143 million of depreciation. 
Inventory decreased $50 million from the prior quarter. Similarly, semiconductor receivables were actually down, which is typical for Q1 even though receivables increased $352 million overall due to the CA acquisition. Total current liabilities, excluding debt, increased $2.5 billion due to CA. However, excluding CA, total current liabilities excluding debt decreased meaningfully more than receivables, primarily due to the payment of our annual performance bonus in Q1. 
In addition, we spent $99 million on capital expenditures. As a result, we had record Q1 free cash flow from operations at $2.03 billion or 35% of revenue. This represents 39% growth in free cash flow from operations compared to Q1 of 2018. 
I would note a couple of things. One, fiscal Q1 is typically our seasonally weakest cash flow quarter due to the annual performance bonus payment we make to our employees in the quarter that we accrue all throughout the prior fiscal year. In Q1, we paid approximately $530 million in APV cash bonuses to our employees. 
And second, I would also note that we accrued $723 million of restructuring integration expenses, of which that includes $363 million of cash payments in the quarter. 
In Q1, we returned $4.6 billion to stockholders consisting of $1.1 billion in the form of cash dividends and $3.5 billion for the repurchase and elimination of 14.2 million AVGO shares. We ended the quarter with $5.1 billion of cash, $37.6 billion of total debt, 396 million outstanding shares and 451 million fully diluted shares outstanding.
Turning to our fiscal year 2019 guidance. As Hock discussed, we are reaffirming our full year revenue guidance of approximately $24.5 billion, including approximately $19.5 billion from semiconductor solutions and approximately $5 billion from infrastructure software. IP licensing is not expected to generate a material amount of revenue. 
On a non-GAAP basis, operating margins are expected to be approximately 51%. Net interest expense and others is expected to be approximately $1.25 billion. We do not contemplate any debt paydown in fiscal year 2019. 
The tax rate is forecasted to be approximately 11%. Depreciation is expected to be approximately $600 million. CapEx is expected to be approximately $550 million. And as a result, free cash flow from continuing operations is expected to be approximately $10 billion. 
And finally, stock-based compensation expense is expected to be approximately $2 billion. As we outlined last quarter, we granted approximately 31 million of restricted and performance stock units as part of the multiyear grant that will vest over the next 7 years. As a result, for modeling purposes, we would expect the fully diluted share count in the second quarter to be approximately 450 million. This excludes any stock repurchases. 
Similarly, for modeling purposes, we would expect stock-based compensation expense to be approximately $530 million in Q2. Looking forward beyond Q2, we would expect the share count, excluding any stock repurchases and eliminations, to remain relatively unchanged, and the quarterly stock-based compensation in the second half of 2019 to start to decrease slightly each quarter. We would expect stock-based compensation to level out at approximately $1.5 billion in 2021. 
Now onto capital allocation. Our capital allocation strategy remains the same. We plan to maintain the current quarterly dividend payout of $2.65 per share throughout the year, subject to quarterly board approval, which means we plan to pay out over $4 billion in cash dividends in fiscal 2019. In addition, we remain committed to buying back and eliminating a total of $8 billion of stock in fiscal 2019.
That concludes my prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions] Operator, please open up the call for questions."

And it's broader than just data centers. But let's start with data centers. Tomahawk 3, which is the 12.8 terabit top of the rack switch, has just barely started production shipments. In fact, we do expect -- we are fully expecting the ramp of Tomahawk 3 as part of the broader data center scale-out with 400 gig pipes interconnect, so to speak, to really start just about right now. In fact, our Q2, fiscal Q2 and progressing up to the rest of the end of the year as more and more of the names you mentioned in hyper cloud jumping and expand -- and -- and upgrade, I would say, in their data centers, and simply because, as you know, expanding the capacity of data centers and pipes is the simplest way to decongest, to minimize or mitigate congestion control in these huge data centers, in this large cloud tech. So there's a broad refreshing and upgrading of data centers among these cloud guys. One area, as mentioned, Tomahawk 3, shipping, which is just starting this quarter in significant volumes. What's also not so perhaps obvious, but is very real for us, is the fact that in order to run 400 gigabit per second throughput pipes, you need interconnect, fiber optic interconnect that are built and dedicated in that area. That's very high-tech products, which we are very deeply engaged in. And that brings the content to -- on via multiple factors in this data center realm. And then as you expand the top of the right switch, I can't resist saying, you have to -- when you need to connect data center to data center, what is called DCI interconnectivity. And the approach that has been taken, which we are also very engaged in, with -- been multiple OEMs, who are supporting the cloud guys, is obviously coherent, coherent fiber optic connection at 400 gig. And we believe we are very much in the lead on that area as well. So these are product lives or product cycles we are seeing that are continuing their impetus of double-digit growth in networking. And it extends more than that. In routing, we are going to be launching and ramping our new generation router, Jericho 2, probably in Q3 of our fiscal year. And that's going into Edge routing, call routing, among the service providers, especially the telecom guys. And we're starting to see the preparation in that happening. So yes, we feel very good about networking and the ability to sustain the level of growth we have been seeing."

And a big part of driving the recovery is cable modem, video delivery. DOCSIS, as they call it, 3.1. We've seen implementations across multiple carriers, service providers of DOCSIS 3.1 so that's very good. One we're also seeing, of course, is in gateway access, which is a big part of broadband. Among many carriers, too, is the new generation of DSL, digital subscriber line, as they need to expand capacity and throughput and go to -- what they're calling the next-generation G.fast or 35B and we're seeing a lot of that in Europe, some in North American carriers too. But what's also equally interesting is as they go to the last mile into households, what we're also seeing is adoption of wireless connectivity or what we all call Wi-Fi. And what we're seeing now is as we see these wired gateways, whether it's cable modem, DOCSIS 3.1, or digital subscriber line, we are seeing -- especially in the back half of the year, enterprises and more and more service providers, telecoms, start to attach the next-generation Wi-Fi, Wi-Fi 6 onto those gateways.

I mean, as I say, we have done quite a bit of acquisitions in very strong assets -- there's an echo -- in the semiconductor space. And it's obviously in here -- it's something we continue to look at because, obviously, semiconductor is a core area for us and -- but you also know we're not necessarily limiting ourselves to that. We look towards a broader area of technology, software and appliances as Brocade would be considered. And but we continue to be interest in the semiconductor space and there are still targets, and we'll be -- continue to be very thoughtful and timely in terms of the time -- in terms of how we approach those acquisitions. And we have observed our behavior over the last several years. We tend to do it in a very -- on a measured pace simply because it's important. In fact, it's critical on any acquisition we make that we can integrate it very, very well. And that's what we're doing with CA right now, and we're right in the thick of it, as you noticed in the numbers we are going through as we drive down to generate the kind of business model we expect to get out of CA. Turning on to the next question you asked, which is -- which leads to software. Yes, it's turning out to be a very, very nice deal for us. We actually are seeing for our core customers, as you recall, we have differentiated customers associated between very core large customers which -- who consumes both mainframes and enterprise distributed software as opposed to much smaller long tail of non-core customers. If we look at those core customers we are focusing on, after about at least one quarter now today more than one quarter of going through selling, renewals and adoption of our software, we feel that the business model has been extremely -- our business model has been extremely successful. I mean, the growth as we see it of dollars that we get through renewals and expansion of use footprint in those core customers are -- it's pretty -- it's surpassing our expectations. It's gone double digits. But that's only 3 months, so we're still early stage, and we'll continue to push that. But as we have also made certain announcements on at least 1 or maybe 2 deals we have done on our new PLA model of both mainframe and enterprise breed software, this has been very well received in the marketplace by our core customers, and we are hopeful it's something that makes so much sense that we'll expand -- we expect to see more and more of these significant transactions occurring as we move forward through the rest of the year."

It's actually not that because that product cycle in wireless is, in all our views, as is mine, very predictable. And we will see that happen in our Q3 -- fiscal Q3, Q4 of this -- of this fiscal '19. It will. We're already starting production in our wafer sets, which has longer product cycle on FBARs -- and some of our products. And we will see, for want of better word, because it's so seasonal and it's very significant, a sharp bounce back, which adds to my -- our confidence that our full year guidance is something that's going to happen. Very simple. And that in the second half, we'd see that meaningful, you correctly pointed out, somewhat double-digit growth in the semiconductor segment of the business. It's -- as I mentioned in answer to earlier questions, data center, especially networking, we have a whole slew of new product cycles. We'll generate a big part of that double-digit growth. So will, in our view, wireless -- actually, that's happened in the past. And in this particular year, so perhaps the difference between this coming year '19 versus '18 is simply 2 things. One is we're probably going to get better share, as mentioned before. And secondly, content increase. It always happens, year after year, as I mentioned. As example, in Wi-Fi, you'll see Wi-Fi 6. Wi-Fi 6 is not just in enterprise and access gateways in service providers. We are seeing Wi-Fi 6, the new generation in 802.11ax in handsets, and that drives -- I call it strong content increase, as they increase the amount of bands in the FBAR that we constantly see as basically wireless continue to proliferate though in various areas in -- of the world, continues to expand in amount of bands, content in this next-generation phone. So all that is going to drive a bounce back with perhaps increased content for -- for our products. As far as volume is concerned, yes, like you, I will probably be as uncertain as you are, how much the volume would be. But regardless, it's -- there's a lot of mitigating factors, and the biggest part of it is pure content increase."

The strength of our business model delivered another quarter of sustaine",419,"Thank you, Bea, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. 
So we had a good start to fiscal 2019, growing 9% in our first fiscal quarter compared to the same period a year ago. The strength of our business model delivered another quarter of sustained revenues, strong earnings and an extremely strong free cash flow. 
Our semiconductor business held up relatively well. Not surprisingly, our wireless business was down sharply, and our storage business underperformed somewhat. However, these challenges were mitigated, more than mitigated by our networking business, which grew double digits year-over-year. In addition, we were very pleased to see that the broadband business has started to recover and stabilize in the quarter. In fact, putting it all together, the semiconductor segment was actually up year-over-year in the first quarter if you exclude the expected sharp decline in wireless.
Turning to infrastructure. This business, which includes SAN switching, mainframe and enterprise software, delivered solid top line results, benefiting from a very robust enterprise spending environment. The integration of CA onto the Broadcom platform is very well underway, and we are confident that we can meet, if not exceed, in the long term -- exceed the long-term revenue and profitability target that we laid out for CA to you last year. In fact, renewals in our CA business have been strong this past quarter, and we believe we are -- and the dollar commitments from our core customers will continue to grow. 
Many of our peers have commented that they are seeing a softening demand environment, especially out of China. While we're experiencing the same demand dynamics, we have factored in much of this macroeconomic backdrop when we provided fiscal 2019 guidance last quarter. As a result, after a solid start to the year, we are reaffirming our fiscal 2019 revenue guidance of $24.5 billion. 
Having said that, we expect our semiconductor business to bottom in the second fiscal quarter, driven almost entirely by the seasonal drop in wireless. But looking to the second half, we are confident the semiconductor business will resume very meaningful growth. This will be driven by strong product cycles in both wireless and networking, coupled with a recovery in broadband. Infrastructure software, on the other hand, is expected to sustain throughout the year. 
So in summary, our diversification strategy is working, and we are effectively managing the decline in wireless as well as the broader semiconductor industry headwinds. 
Now let me turn over to Tom to provide you with more color on Q1."
25016048,602450197,1690087,"Broadcom Inc., Q1 2019 Earnings Call, Mar 14, 2019",2019-03-14,"Earnings Calls","Broadcom Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Hock. Consolidated net revenue for the first quarter was $5.8 billion, a 9% increase from a year ago. And EPS came in at $5.55, an 8% increase from a year ago, off of a 441 million weighted average fully diluted share count. In addition, free",790,"Thank you, Hock. Consolidated net revenue for the first quarter was $5.8 billion, a 9% increase from a year ago. And EPS came in at $5.55, an 8% increase from a year ago, off of a 441 million weighted average fully diluted share count. 
In addition, free cash flow is $2.03 billion or 35% of revenue. I would highlight free cash flow grew 39% year-over-year. 
The semiconductor solutions segment revenue was $4.4 billion and represented 76% of our total revenue this quarter. This was down 12% year-on-year on a comparable basis. But as Hock explained, the semiconductor segment was actually up slightly year-over-year in the first quarter, excluding wireless. 
Let me now turn to our infrastructure software segment. Revenue was $1.4 billion and represented 24% of revenue. SAN switching continues to perform extremely well. And as Hock mentioned, mainframe enterprise software is off to a good start.
Let me now provide additional detail on our financial performance. Operating expenses were $1.08 billion. Operating income from continuing operations was $3.05 billion and represented 52.7% of net revenue. 
Adjusted EBITDA was $3.24 billion and represented 55.9% of net revenue. This figure excludes $143 million of depreciation. 
Inventory decreased $50 million from the prior quarter. Similarly, semiconductor receivables were actually down, which is typical for Q1 even though receivables increased $352 million overall due to the CA acquisition. Total current liabilities, excluding debt, increased $2.5 billion due to CA. However, excluding CA, total current liabilities excluding debt decreased meaningfully more than receivables, primarily due to the payment of our annual performance bonus in Q1. 
In addition, we spent $99 million on capital expenditures. As a result, we had record Q1 free cash flow from operations at $2.03 billion or 35% of revenue. This represents 39% growth in free cash flow from operations compared to Q1 of 2018. 
I would note a couple of things. One, fiscal Q1 is typically our seasonally weakest cash flow quarter due to the annual performance bonus payment we make to our employees in the quarter that we accrue all throughout the prior fiscal year. In Q1, we paid approximately $530 million in APV cash bonuses to our employees. 
And second, I would also note that we accrued $723 million of restructuring integration expenses, of which that includes $363 million of cash payments in the quarter. 
In Q1, we returned $4.6 billion to stockholders consisting of $1.1 billion in the form of cash dividends and $3.5 billion for the repurchase and elimination of 14.2 million AVGO shares. We ended the quarter with $5.1 billion of cash, $37.6 billion of total debt, 396 million outstanding shares and 451 million fully diluted shares outstanding.
Turning to our fiscal year 2019 guidance. As Hock discussed, we are reaffirming our full year revenue guidance of approximately $24.5 billion, including approximately $19.5 billion from semiconductor solutions and approximately $5 billion from infrastructure software. IP licensing is not expected to generate a material amount of revenue. 
On a non-GAAP basis, operating margins are expected to be approximately 51%. Net interest expense and others is expected to be approximately $1.25 billion. We do not contemplate any debt paydown in fiscal year 2019. 
The tax rate is forecasted to be approximately 11%. Depreciation is expected to be approximately $600 million. CapEx is expected to be approximately $550 million. And as a result, free cash flow from continuing operations is expected to be approximately $10 billion. 
And finally, stock-based compensation expense is expected to be approximately $2 billion. As we outlined last quarter, we granted approximately 31 million of restricted and performance stock units as part of the multiyear grant that will vest over the next 7 years. As a result, for modeling purposes, we would expect the fully diluted share count in the second quarter to be approximately 450 million. This excludes any stock repurchases. 
Similarly, for modeling purposes, we would expect stock-based compensation expense to be approximately $530 million in Q2. Looking forward beyond Q2, we would expect the share count, excluding any stock repurchases and eliminations, to remain relatively unchanged, and the quarterly stock-based compensation in the second half of 2019 to start to decrease slightly each quarter. We would expect stock-based compensation to level out at approximately $1.5 billion in 2021. 
Now onto capital allocation. Our capital allocation strategy remains the same. We plan to maintain the current quarterly dividend payout of $2.65 per share throughout the year, subject to quarterly board approval, which means we plan to pay out over $4 billion in cash dividends in fiscal 2019. In addition, we remain committed to buying back and eliminating a total of $8 billion of stock in fiscal 2019.
That concludes my prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions] Operator, please open up the call for questions."

And it's broader than just data centers. But let's start with data centers. Tomahawk 3, which is the 12.8 terabit top of the rack switch, has just barely started production shipments. In fact, we do expect -- we are fully expecting the ramp of Tomahawk 3 as part of the broader data center scale-out with 400 gig pipes interconnect, so to speak, to really start just about right now. In fact, our Q2, fiscal Q2 and progressing up to the rest of the end of the year as more and more of the names you mentioned in hyper cloud jumping and expand -- and -- and upgrade, I would say, in their data centers, and simply because, as you know, expanding the capacity of data centers and pipes is the simplest way to decongest, to minimize or mitigate congestion control in these huge data centers, in this large cloud tech. So there's a broad refreshing and upgrading of data centers among these cloud guys. One area, as mentioned, Tomahawk 3, shipping, which is just starting this quarter in significant volumes. What's also not so perhaps obvious, but is very real for us, is the fact that in order to run 400 gigabit per second throughput pipes, you need interconnect, fiber optic interconnect that are built and dedicated in that area. That's very high-tech products, which we are very deeply engaged in. And that brings the content to -- on via multiple factors in this data center realm. And then as you expand the top of the right switch, I can't resist saying, you have to -- when you need to connect data center to data center, what is called DCI interconnectivity. And the approach that has been taken, which we are also very engaged in, with -- been multiple OEMs, who are supporting the cloud guys, is obviously coherent, coherent fiber optic connection at 400 gig. And we believe we are very much in the lead on that area as well. So these are product lives or product cycles we are seeing that are continuing their impetus of double-digit growth in networking. And it extends more than that. In routing, we are going to be launching and ramping our new generation router, Jericho 2, probably in Q3 of our fiscal year. And that's going into Edge routing, call routing, among the service providers, especially the telecom guys. And we're starting to see the preparation in that happening. So yes, we feel very good about networking and the ability to sustain the level of growth we have been seeing."

And a big part of driving the recovery is cable modem, video delivery. DOCSIS, as they call it, 3.1. We've seen implementations across multiple carriers, service providers of DOCSIS 3.1 so that's very good. One we're also seeing, of course, is in gateway access, which is a big part of broadband. Among many carriers, too, is the new generation of DSL, digital subscriber line, as they need to expand capacity and throughput and go to -- what they're calling the next-generation G.fast or 35B and we're seeing a lot of that in Europe, some in North American carriers too. But what's also equally interesting is as they go to the last mile into households, what we're also seeing is adoption of wireless connectivity or what we all call Wi-Fi. And what we're seeing now is as we see these wired gateways, whether it's cable modem, DOCSIS 3.1, or digital subscriber line, we are seeing -- especially in the back half of the year, enterprises and more and more service providers, telecoms, start to attach the next-generation Wi-Fi, Wi-Fi 6 onto those gateways. And in Wi-Fi 6, I'm very, very pleased to note that we are very much in the lead in having developed and productized a whole suite of products that perfectly address towards those enterprise and service providers.

I mean, as I say, we have done quite a bit of acquisitions in very strong assets -- there's an echo -- in the semiconductor space. And it's obviously in here -- it's something we continue to look at because, obviously, semiconductor is a core area for us and -- but you also know we're not necessarily limiting ourselves to that. We look towards a broader area of technology, software and appliances as Brocade would be considered. And but we continue to be interest in the semiconductor space and there are still targets, and we'll be -- continue to be very thoughtful and timely in terms of the time -- in terms of how we approach those acquisitions. And we have observed our behavior over the last several years. We tend to do it in a very -- on a measured pace simply because it's important. In fact, it's critical on any acquisition we make that we can integrate it very, very well. And that's what we're doing with CA right now, and we're right in the thick of it, as you noticed in the numbers we are going through as we drive down to generate the kind of business model we expect to get out of CA. Turning on to the next question you asked, which is -- which leads to software. Yes, it's turning out to be a very, very nice deal for us. We actually are seeing for our core customers, as you recall, we have differentiated customers associated between very core large customers which -- who consumes both mainframes and enterprise distributed software as opposed to much smaller long tail of non-core customers. If we look at those core customers we are focusing on, after about at least one quarter now today more than one quarter of going through selling, renewals and adoption of our software, we feel that the business model has been extremely -- our business model has been extremely successful. I mean, the growth as we see it of dollars that we get through renewals and expansion of use footprint in those core customers are -- it's pretty -- it's surpassing our expectations. It's gone double digits. But that's only 3 months, so we're still early stage, and we'll continue to push that. But as we have also made certain announcements on at least 1 or maybe 2 deals we have done on our new PLA model of both mainframe and enterprise breed software, this has been very well received in the marketplace by our core customers, and we are hopeful it's something that makes so much sense that we'll expand -- we expect to see more and more of these significant transactions occurring as we move forward through the rest of the year."

We are seeing Wi-Fi 6, the new generation in 802.11ax in handsets, and that drives -- I call it strong content increase, as they increase the amount of bands in the FBAR that we constantly see as basically wireless continue to proliferate though in various areas in -- of the world, continues to expand in amount of bands, content in this next-generation phone. So all that is going to drive a bounce back with perhaps increased content for -- for our products. As far as volume is concerned, yes, like you, I will probably be as uncertain as you are, how much the volume would be. But regardless, it's -- there's a lot of mitigating factors, and the biggest part of it is pure content increase."

Let me touch on the second quarter results, after which I will update you on the current environment and our outlook for the second half of the year. Looking at the second quarter just passe",542,"Thank you, Bea, and thank you, everyone, for joining in today. Let me touch on the second quarter results, after which I will update you on the current environment and our outlook for the second half of the year. 
Looking at the second quarter just passed, it really went as planned. Networking continued to perform very well. Our broadband business started to recover. This was offset by the anticipated sharp decline in wireless and the ongoing softness in storage. On the other hand, the infrastructure software business delivered solid top line results, benefiting from the sustained enterprise demand for our mainframe and distributed software as well as SAN switching products. The integration of CA is progressing well. 
Just last week, we reached a major milestone with day 2, which is the integration of the CA's business processes onto Broadcom's IT platform. We remain confident that we can meet, if not exceed, the long-term revenue and profitability targets that we laid out for CA to you last year.  Renewals in our CA business are strong, and the dollar commitments from our core customers continue to grow. 
Now let me address the current business environment and our outlook for the remainder of the year. We have, as I indicated, performed very much to plan in the first half of fiscal '19. And in the second half, we had expected a recovery. However, while enterprise and mainframe software demand remained stable, particularly in North America and Europe, with respect to semiconductors, it is clear that the U.S.-China trade conflict including the Huawei export ban is creating economic and political uncertainty and reducing visibility for our global OEM customers. As a result, demand volatility has increased and our customers are actively reducing inventory levels to manage risks. This leads us to believe the second half of 2019 will be more in line with the first half as opposed to the previously expected recovery. We now anticipate fiscal 2019 semiconductor solutions segment revenue of $17.5 billion, which translates into a year-over-year decline in the high single digits. CA software continues to perform above our original expectations while SAN switching is slowing down after a very strong first half. As a result, we are maintaining our fiscal 2019 infrastructure software outlook at $5 billion. 
While this scenario has been playing out, I should emphasize the fundamentals of our business remains very much intact. We continue to execute on the very road map for next-generation network switching and routing in the cloud and enterprises including the leading edge Triton for software defined network switch just recently announced this week. We've also secured the next generations of our front end and a large North America OEM, which positions us very well for the transition into 5G. We continue to win increasing numbers of compute offload accelerators in the hypercloud operators across AI, video transcoding, encryption and networking. We are pleased with the realm of our new -- of our new generation Wi-Fi 802.11aa otherwise called WiFi 6 in enterprise gateways and carrier access bonds. All this leads us confident that we will able to continue to drive sustained long-term revenue growth and increasing free cash flow.

Consolidated net revenue for the second quarter was $5.5 billion, a 10% increase from a year ago, and EPS came in at $5.21, a 7% increase from a year ago off of a [ 448  ] million weighted average fully diluted character share count. In a",623,"Thank you, Hock. Consolidated net revenue for the second quarter was $5.5 billion, a 10% increase from a year ago, and EPS came in at $5.21, a 7% increase from a year ago off of a [ 448  ] million weighted average fully diluted character share count. In addition, we have record free cash flow of $2.54 billion or 46% of revenue. Free cash flow grew 20% year-over-year. 
The semiconductor solutions segment revenue was $4.1 billion and represented 74% of our total revenue this quarter. This was down 10% as expected year-on-year on a comparable basis. 
Our infrastructure software segment revenue was $1.4 billion and represented 26% of revenue. 
Let me now provide additional detail on our financial performance. 
Operating expenses were $1.02 billion. Operating income from continuing operations was $2.95 billion and represented 53.5% of net revenue. Adjusted EBITDA was $3.11 billion and represented 56.4% of net revenue. This figure excludes $142 million of depreciation. Receivables in the quarter decreased $193 million, and inventory decreased $40 million from the prior quarter. 
I would also note that we accrued $136 million of restructuring integration expenses and made [ $218  ] million of cash restructuring integration payments in the quarter. Finally, we spent $125 million on capital expenditures. 
In the second quarter, we returned $2.4 billion to stockholders consisting of $1.1 billion in the form of cash dividends and $1.3 billion for the repurchase and elimination of 4.7 million of AVGO shares. We ended the quarter with $5.3 billion of cash, $37.5 billion of total debt, 399 million outstanding shares and 447 million fully diluted shares outstanding. We also refinanced our $18 billion of term loans that we put in place at the beginning of fiscal 2019 to finance the CA acquisition via a combination of $11 billion of investment grade bonds and a new term loan we're able to extend our average debt maturity to approximately 5 years and substantially reduce the [indiscernible] debt [indiscernible] 1 year. As of today, our average cost of borrowing stands at approximately 3.7%. 
Turning to our fiscal year 2019 guidance. As Hock discussed, we are updating our full year revenue guidance to $22.5 billion, including approximately $17.5 billion from semiconductor solutions and approximately $5 billion from infrastructure software. IP licensing is not expected to generate a material amount of revenue. On a non-GAAP basis, operating margins are expected to be approximately 52.5%, an increase of approximately 750 basis points from prior guidance. Net interest expense and others [indiscernible] approximately $1.3 billion. We do not contemplate any debt paydown in fiscal year 2019. The tax rate is forecast to be approximately 11%. Depreciation is expected to be approximately $600 million. CapEx is expected to be approximately $500 million. As a result, free cash flow is expected to be approximately $9 billion, which takes into account projected restructuring integration charges of approximately $1.1 billion. Stock-based compensation expense is expected to be approximately $2.2 billion. And finally, we expect weighted average diluted share count to be 444 million for Q3 and 443 million for Q4, and this excludes any impacts from share buybacks and eliminations. 
Now on the capital allocation. Our capital allocation strategy remains the same. We plan to maintain the current quarterly dividend payout of [ $2.65  ] per share throughout the year subject to quarterly Board approval, which means we plan to pay out over $4 billion in cash dividends in fiscal 2019. In addition, we remain committed to buying back and eliminating a total $8 billion of stock in fiscal 2019. In the first half of the fiscal year, we have spent $4.8 billion for the repurchase and elimination of shares.
That concludes my prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions] Operator, please open up the call for questions."

So we are seeing a very reactive here, so I've got to believe that includes this $300 billion of potential tariffs could be in place. 
Also keep in mind something I should add is that even as we see some -- there are 2 parts of this. One part is what's the impact of the Huawei ban on a company like us selling components and technology? Well, short term, keep in mind we'll see a very sharp impact simply because no purchases a lot, and there's no obvious substitution in place from other OEMs replace over end demand, which may exist, which may continue to exist. Give it a few months, give it 6 months, if those end demand still remains out there, other OEMs qualified to take over those to replace Huawei on those demand and other OEMs will come in, and those OEMs will continue to buy our products. And so we have a rebalancing and readjustment in demand from our side but short-term, we do not expect to see that."

As you noticed, on our balance sheet, our inventory has been very well managed, tightly managed, and we continue to be very, very consistent through all this in the range of 65 days of inventory. So it's this reduction very much a reaction of the supply chain of the end user, which really reflects on our direct customers where there's a sharp reduction in inventory out there. And are we talking significant? Yes. We believe it is -- what we've seen is very significant, and we anticipate that to continue, which reflects in our revised guidance for the rest of this year, which is the next less than 6 months out there.

Let me touch on the second quarter results, after which I will update you on the current environment and our outlook for the second half of the year.Looking at the second quarter just passed",537,"Thank you, Bea, and thank you, everyone, for joining in today. Let me touch on the second quarter results, after which I will update you on the current environment and our outlook for the second half of the year.
Looking at the second quarter just passed, it really went as planned. Networking continued to perform very well, and our broadband business started to recover. This was offset by the anticipated sharp decline in wireless and the ongoing softness in storage. On the other hand, the infrastructure software business delivered solid top line results, benefiting from sustained enterprise demand for our mainframe and distributed software as well as SAN switching products.
The integration of CA is progressing well. Just last week, we reached a major milestone with day 2, which is the integration of the CA business processes onto Broadcom's IP platform. We remain confident that we can meet, if not exceed, the long-term revenue and profitability targets that we laid out for CA to you last year. Renewals in our CA business are strong, and the dollar commitments from our core customers continue to grow.
Now let me address the current business environment and our outlook for the remainder of the year. We have, as I indicated, performed very much to plan in the first half of fiscal '19. And in the second half, we had expected a recovery. However, while enterprise and mainframe software demand remained stable, particularly in North America and Europe, with respect to semiconductors, it is clear that the U.S.-China trade conflict, including the Huawei export ban, is creating economic and political uncertainty and reducing visibility for our global OEM customers. As a result, demand volatility has increased and our customers are actively reducing inventory levels to manage risks. This leads us to believe the second half of 2019 will be more in line with the first half as opposed to the previously expected recovery. We now anticipate fiscal 2019 semiconductor solutions segment revenue of $17.5 billion, which translates into a year-over-year decline in the high single digits.
CA software continues to perform above our original expectations while SAN switching is slowing down after a very strong first half. As a result, we are maintaining our fiscal 2019 infrastructure software outlook at $5 billion.
While this scenario has been playing out, I should emphasize the fundamentals of our business remains very much intact. We continue to execute on the very rich road map for next-generation network switching and routing in the cloud and enterprises, including the leading-edge Trident 4 software-defined network switch just recently announced this week. We've also secured the next 2 generations of RF front-end at a large North American OEM, which positions us very well for the transition into 5G. We continue to win increasing numbers of compute off-load accelerators in the hypercloud operators across AI, video transcoding, encryption and networking. We are pleased with the ramp of our new-generation Wi-Fi 802.11ax, otherwise called Wi-Fi 6, in enterprise gateways and carrier access bonds. All this leaves us confident that we will able to continue to drive sustained long-term revenue growth and increasing free cash flow.
Let me now turn it over to Tom who will provide you with more color."

Consolidated net revenue for the second quarter was $5.5 billion, a 10% increase from a year ago.

Consolidated net revenue for the second quarter was $5.5 billion, a 10% increase from a year ago. And EPS came in at $5.21, a 7% increase from a year ago off of a 448 million weighted average fully diluted character share count. In addition, we have record free cash flow of $2.54 billion or 46% of revenue. Free cash flow grew 20% year-over-year. The semiconductor solutions segment revenue was $4.1 billion and represented 74% of our total revenue this quarter, which was down 10% as expected year-on-year on a comparable basis. Our infrastructure software segment revenue was $1.4 billion and represented 26% of revenue.
Let me now provide additional detail on our financial performance. Operating expenses were $1.02 billion. Operating income from continuing operations was $2.95 billion and represented 53.5% of net revenue. Adjusted EBITDA was $3.11 billion and represented 56.4% of net revenue. This figure excludes $142 million of depreciation. Receivables in the quarter decreased $193 million, and inventory decreased $40 million from the prior quarter. I would also note that we accrued $136 million of restructuring and integration expenses and made $218 million of cash restructuring and integration payments in the quarter. Finally, we spent $125 million on capital expenditures.
In the second quarter, we returned $2.4 billion to stockholders consisting of $1.1 billion in the form of cash dividends and $1.3 billion for the repurchase and elimination of 4.7 million AVGO shares. We ended the quarter with $5.3 billion of cash, $37.5 billion of total debt, 399 million outstanding shares and 447 million fully diluted shares outstanding. We also refinanced our $18 billion of term loans that we put in place at the beginning of fiscal 2019 to finance the CA acquisition. Via a combination of $11 billion of investment grade bonds and a new term loan, we're able to extend our average debt maturity to approximately 5 years and substantially reduce the quantum of debt due in any one year. As of today, our average cost of borrowing stands at approximately 3.7%.
Turning to our fiscal year 2019 guidance. As Hock discussed, we are updating our full year revenue guidance to $22.5 billion, including approximately $17.5 billion from semiconductor solutions and approximately $5 billion from infrastructure software. IP licensing is not expected to generate a material amount of revenue. On a non-GAAP basis, operating margins are expected to be approximately 52.5%, an increase of approximately 150 basis points from our prior guidance. Net interest expense and others are expected to be approximately $1.3 billion. We do not contemplate any debt pay-down in fiscal year 2019.
The tax rate is forecast to be approximately 11%. Depreciation is expected to be approximately $600 million. CapEx is expected to be approximately $500 million. As a result, free cash flow is expected to be approximately $9 billion, which takes into account projected restructuring and integration charges of approximately $1.1 billion. Stock-based compensation expense is expected to be approximately $2.2 billion. And finally, we expect weighted average diluted share count to be 444 million for Q3 and 443 million for Q4, and this excludes any impacts from share buybacks and eliminations.
Now on to capital allocation. Our capital allocation strategy remains the same. We plan to maintain the current quarterly dividend payout of $2.65 per share throughout the year subject to quarterly Board approval, which means we plan to pay out over $4 billion in cash dividends in fiscal 2019. In addition, we remain committed to buying back and eliminating a total $8 billion of stock in fiscal 2019. In the first half of the fiscal year, we have spent $4.8 billion for the repurchase and elimination of shares.
That concludes my prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions] Operator, please open up the call for questions."

And we continue to see that. And it is an emerging space from our perspective. But nonetheless, it's a space that seems to be growing very steadily and continuing to trend up very significantly. And this is a space we believe at the end -- in a matter of 3 to 5 years could be a significant percentage of the total compute spend within any large-scale data center.

We have the belief that things are -- environment is very, very nervous. And that's why we see a very, very sharp and rapid contraction of supply chain and orders out there from our customers, especially our global OEM customers even as we believe, as I mentioned in North America and Europe, end demand hasn't reflected that. So we are seeing a very reactive mood here. And so I got to believe that includes the sense that this $300 billion of next round of potential tariffs could be in place.
Also keep in mind, something I should add is that even as we see some -- there are 2 parts to this. One part is what's the impact of the Huawei ban on a company like us selling components and technology? Well, short term, keep in mind, we'll see a very sharp impact simply because there are no purchases allowed, and there's no obvious substitution in place from other OEMs replace -- taking over end demand, which may exist, which may continue to exist. Give it a few months, give it 6 months, if those end demand still remains out there, mostly other OEMs qualified to take over those, to replace Huawei on those demand and other OEMs will come in, and those OEMs will continue to buy our products. And so we have a rebalancing and readjustment in demand from our side. But short term, we do not expect to see that."

As you noticed, on our balance sheet, our inventory has been very well managed, tightly managed, and we continue to be very, very consistent through all this, in the range of 65 days of inventory.

Let me touch on the second quarter results, after which I will update you on the current environment and our outlook for the second half of the year.Looking at the second quarter just passed",537,"Thank you, Bea, and thank you, everyone, for joining in today. Let me touch on the second quarter results, after which I will update you on the current environment and our outlook for the second half of the year.
Looking at the second quarter just passed, it really went as planned. Networking continued to perform very well, and our broadband business started to recover. This was offset by the anticipated sharp decline in wireless and the ongoing softness in storage. On the other hand, the infrastructure software business delivered solid top line results, benefiting from sustained enterprise demand for our mainframe and distributed software as well as SAN switching products.
The integration of CA is progressing well. Just last week, we reached a major milestone with day 2, which is the integration of the CA business processes onto Broadcom's IT platform. We remain confident that we can meet, if not exceed, the long-term revenue and profitability targets that we laid out for CA to you last year. Renewals in our CA business are strong, and the dollar commitments from our core customers continue to grow.
Now let me address the current business environment and our outlook for the remainder of the year. We have, as I indicated, performed very much to plan in the first half of fiscal '19. And in the second half, we had expected a recovery. However, while enterprise and mainframe software demand remained stable, particularly in North America and Europe, with respect to semiconductors, it is clear that the U.S.-China trade conflict, including the Huawei export ban, is creating economic and political uncertainty and reducing visibility for our global OEM customers. As a result, demand volatility has increased and our customers are actively reducing inventory levels to manage risks. This leads us to believe the second half of 2019 will be more in line with the first half as opposed to the previously expected recovery. We now anticipate fiscal 2019 semiconductor solutions segment revenue of $17.5 billion, which translates into a year-over-year decline in the high single digits.
CA software continues to perform above our original expectations, while SAN switching is slowing down after a very strong first half. As a result, we are maintaining our fiscal 2019 infrastructure software outlook at $5 billion.
While this scenario has been playing out, I should emphasize the fundamentals of our business remains very much intact. We continue to execute on the very rich road map for next-generation network switching and routing in the cloud and enterprises, including the leading-edge Trident 4 software-defined network switch just recently announced this week. We've also secured the next 2 generations of RF front-end at a large North American OEM, which positions us very well for the transition into 5G. We continue to win increasing numbers of compute offload accelerators in the hypercloud operators across AI, video transcoding, encryption and networking. We are pleased with the ramp of our new-generation WiFi 802.11ax, otherwise called Wi-Fi 6, in enterprise gateways and carrier access points. All this leaves us confident that we will able to continue to drive sustained long-term revenue growth and increasing free cash flow.
Let me now turn it over to Tom who will provide you with more color."

Consolidated net revenue for the second quarter was $5.5 billion, a 10% increase from a year ago.

Consolidated net revenue for the second quarter was $5.5 billion, a 10% increase from a year ago. And EPS came in at $5.21, a 7% increase from a year ago off of a 448 million weighted average fully diluted share count. In addition, we have record free cash flow of $2.54 billion or 46% of revenue. Free cash flow grew 20% year-over-year. The semiconductor solutions segment revenue was $4.1 billion and represented 74% of our total revenue this quarter, which was down 10% as expected year-on-year on a comparable basis. Our infrastructure software segment revenue was $1.4 billion and represented 26% of revenue.
Let me now provide additional detail on our financial performance. Operating expenses were $1.02 billion. Operating income from continuing operations was $2.95 billion and represented 53.5% of net revenue. Adjusted EBITDA was $3.11 billion and represented 56.4% of net revenue. This figure excludes $142 million of depreciation. Receivables in the quarter decreased to $193 million, and inventory decreased to $40 million from the prior quarter. I would also note that we accrued $136 million of restructuring and integration expenses and made $218 million of cash restructuring and integration payments in the quarter. Finally, we spent $125 million on capital expenditures.
In the second quarter, we returned $2.4 billion to stockholders consisting of $1.1 billion in the form of cash dividends and $1.3 billion for the repurchase and elimination of 4.7 million AVGO shares. We ended the quarter with $5.3 billion of cash, $37.5 billion of total debt, 399 million outstanding shares and 447 million fully diluted shares outstanding. We also refinanced our $18 billion of term loans that we put in place at the beginning of fiscal 2019 to finance the CA acquisition. Via a combination of $11 billion of investment-grade bonds and a new term loan, we're able to extend our average debt maturity to approximately 5 years and substantially reduce the quantum of debt due in any one year. As of today, our average cost of borrowing stands at approximately 3.7%.
Turning to our fiscal year 2019 guidance. As Hock discussed, we are updating our full year revenue guidance to $22.5 billion, including approximately $17.5 billion from semiconductor solutions and approximately $5 billion from infrastructure software. IP licensing is not expected to generate a material amount of revenue. On a non-GAAP basis, operating margins are expected to be approximately 52.5%, an increase of approximately 150 basis points from our prior guidance. Net interest expense and others are expected to be approximately $1.3 billion. We do not contemplate any debt pay-down in fiscal year 2019.
The tax rate is forecast to be approximately 11%. Depreciation is expected to be approximately $600 million. CapEx is expected to be approximately $500 million. As a result, free cash flow is expected to be approximately $9 billion, which takes into account projected restructuring and integration charges of approximately $1.1 billion. Stock-based compensation expense is expected to be approximately $2.2 billion. And finally, we expect weighted average diluted share count to be 444 million for Q3 and 443 million for Q4, and this excludes any impacts from share buybacks and eliminations.
Now on to capital allocation. Our capital allocation strategy remains the same. We plan to maintain the current quarterly dividend payout of $2.65 per share throughout the year subject to quarterly Board approval, which means we plan to pay out over $4 billion in cash dividends in fiscal 2019. In addition, we remain committed to buying back and eliminating a total $8 billion of stock in fiscal 2019. In the first half of the fiscal year, we have spent $4.8 billion for the repurchase and elimination of shares.
That concludes my prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions] Operator, please open up the call for questions."

So we are seeing a very reactive mode here. And so I got to believe that includes the sense that this $300 billion of next round of potential tariffs could be in place.
Also keep in mind, something I should add is that even as we see some -- there are 2 parts to this. One part is what's the impact of the Huawei ban on a company like us selling components and technology? Well, short term, keep in mind, we'll see a very sharp impact simply because there are no purchases allowed, and there's no obvious substitution in place from other OEMs replace -- taking over end demand, which may exist -- which may continue to exist. Give it a few months, give it 6 months, if those end demand still remains out there, we'll see other OEMs qualified to take over those -- to replace Huawei on those demand and other OEMs will come in, and those OEMs will continue to buy our products. And so we have a rebalancing and readjustment in demand from our side. But short term, we do not expect to see that."

Let me touch on the second quarter results, after which I will update you on the current environment and our outlook for the second half of the year.Looking at the second quarter just passed",537,"Thank you, Bea, and thank you, everyone, for joining in today. Let me touch on the second quarter results, after which I will update you on the current environment and our outlook for the second half of the year.
Looking at the second quarter just passed, it really went as planned. Networking continued to perform very well, and our broadband business started to recover. This was offset by the anticipated sharp decline in wireless and the ongoing softness in storage. On the other hand, the infrastructure software business delivered solid top line results, benefiting from sustained enterprise demand for our mainframe and distributed software as well as SAN switching products.
The integration of CA is progressing well. Just last week, we reached a major milestone with day 2, which is the integration of the CA business processes onto Broadcom's IT platform. We remain confident that we can meet, if not exceed, the long-term revenue and profitability targets that we laid out for CA to you last year. Renewals in our CA business are strong, and the dollar commitments from our core customers continue to grow.
Now let me address the current business environment and our outlook for the remainder of the year. We have, as I indicated, performed very much to plan in the first half of fiscal '19. And in the second half, we had expected a recovery. However, while enterprise and mainframe software demand remained stable, particularly in North America and Europe, with respect to semiconductors, it is clear that the U.S.-China trade conflict, including the Huawei export ban, is creating economic and political uncertainty and reducing visibility for our global OEM customers. As a result, demand volatility has increased and our customers are actively reducing inventory levels to manage risks. This leads us to believe the second half of 2019 will be more in line with the first half as opposed to the previously expected recovery. We now anticipate fiscal 2019 semiconductor solutions segment revenue of $17.5 billion, which translates into a year-over-year decline in the high single digits.
CA software continues to perform above our original expectations, while SAN switching is slowing down after a very strong first half. As a result, we are maintaining our fiscal 2019 infrastructure software outlook at $5 billion.
While this scenario has been playing out, I should emphasize the fundamentals of our business remains very much intact. We continue to execute on the very rich road map for next-generation network switching and routing in the cloud and enterprises, including the leading-edge Trident 4 software-defined network switch just recently announced this week. We've also secured the next 2 generations of RF front-end at a large North American OEM, which positions us very well for the transition into 5G. We continue to win increasing numbers of compute offload accelerators in the hypercloud operators across AI, video transcoding, encryption and networking. We are pleased with the ramp of our new-generation WiFi 802.11ax, otherwise called Wi-Fi 6, in enterprise gateways and carrier access points. All this leaves us confident that we will able to continue to drive sustained long-term revenue growth and increasing free cash flow.
Let me now turn it over to Tom who will provide you with more color."

Consolidated net revenue for the second quarter was $5.5 billion, a 10% increase from a year ago. And EPS came in at $5.21, a 7% increase from a year ago off of a 448 million weighted average fully diluted share count. In addition, we have record free cash flow of $2.54 billion or 46% of revenue. Free cash flow grew 20% year-over-year. The semiconductor solutions segment revenue was $4.1 billion and represented 74% of our total revenue this quarter, which was down 10% as expected year-on-year on a comparable basis. Our infrastructure software segment revenue was $1.4 billion and represented 26% of revenue.
Let me now provide additional detail on our financial performance. Operating expenses were $1.02 billion. Operating income from continuing operations was $2.95 billion and represented 53.5% of net revenue. Adjusted EBITDA was $3.11 billion and represented 56.4% of net revenue. This figure excludes $142 million of depreciation. Receivables in the quarter decreased to $193 million, and inventory decreased to $40 million from the prior quarter. I would also note that we accrued $136 million of restructuring and integration expenses and made $218 million of cash restructuring and integration payments in the quarter. Finally, we spent $125 million on capital expenditures.
In the second quarter, we returned $2.4 billion to stockholders consisting of $1.1 billion in the form of cash dividends and $1.3 billion for the repurchase and elimination of 4.7 million AVGO shares. We ended the quarter with $5.3 billion of cash, $37.5 billion of total debt, 399 million outstanding shares and 447 million fully diluted shares outstanding. We also refinanced our $18 billion of term loans that we put in place at the beginning of fiscal 2019 to finance the CA acquisition. Via a combination of $11 billion of investment-grade bonds and a new term loan, we're able to extend our average debt maturity to approximately 5 years and substantially reduce the quantum of debt due in any one year. As of today, our average cost of borrowing stands at approximately 3.7%.
Turning to our fiscal year 2019 guidance. As Hock discussed, we are updating our full year revenue guidance to $22.5 billion, including approximately $17.5 billion from semiconductor solutions and approximately $5 billion from infrastructure software. IP licensing is not expected to generate a material amount of revenue. On a non-GAAP basis, operating margins are expected to be approximately 52.5%, an increase of approximately 150 basis points from our prior guidance. Net interest expense and others are expected to be approximately $1.3 billion. We do not contemplate any debt pay-down in fiscal year 2019.
The tax rate is forecast to be approximately 11%. Depreciation is expected to be approximately $600 million. CapEx is expected to be approximately $500 million. As a result, free cash flow is expected to be approximately $9 billion, which takes into account projected restructuring and integration charges of approximately $1.1 billion. Stock-based compensation expense is expected to be approximately $2.2 billion. And finally, we expect weighted average diluted share count to be 444 million for Q3 and 443 million for Q4, and this excludes any impacts from share buybacks and eliminations.
Now on to capital allocation. Our capital allocation strategy remains the same. We plan to maintain the current quarterly dividend payout of $2.65 per share throughout the year subject to quarterly Board approval, which means we plan to pay out over $4 billion in cash dividends in fiscal 2019. In addition, we remain committed to buying back and eliminating a total $8 billion of stock in fiscal 2019. In the first half of the fiscal year, we have spent $4.8 billion for the repurchase and elimination of shares.
That concludes my prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions] Operator, please open up the call for questions."

Also keep in mind, something I should add is that even as we see some -- there are 2 parts to this. One part is what's the impact of the Huawei ban on a company like us selling components and technology? Well, short term, keep in mind, we'll see a very sharp impact simply because there are no purchases allowed, and there's no obvious substitution in place from other OEMs replace -- taking over end demand, which may exist -- which may continue to exist. Give it a few months, give it 6 months, if those end demand still remains out there, we'll see other OEMs qualified to take over those -- to replace Huawei on those demand and other OEMs will come in, and those OEMs will continue to buy our products.

We believe it is -- what we've seen is very significant, and we anticipate that to continue, which reflects in our revised guidance for the rest of this year, which is the next less than 6 months out there. Beyond that, who knows?"

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Looking at the third quarter. Consolidated net revenue was $5.5 billion, a 9% increase from the year ago. Semiconductor solution revenue was $4.4 billion, down 5% year-on-year",1162,"Thank you, Bea. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. 
Looking at the third quarter. Consolidated net revenue was $5.5 billion, a 9% increase from the year ago. Semiconductor solution revenue was $4.4 billion, down 5% year-on-year and up 6% quarter-over-quarter. Networking continued to perform well driven by strong demand for our merchants switching and routing platforms. And as we also expected, shipments of custom silicon solutions in AI, Broadcom and video transcoding to cloud data centers were strong. Wireless is, of course, seeing the beginning of a typical seasonal uptick and the initial positive effects of increased content. These tailwinds were partially offset by weaker demand in storage and broadband. 
Revenue for infrastructure software was $1.1 billion. The CA business is running above our expectation, benefiting from sustained enterprise demand for our mainframe and distributed software. However, SAN switching demand has paused as our partner OEM supply chain compressed in these uncertain conditions. 
Now let me address the current environment and outlook. Enterprise and mainframe software customer demand continues to remain stable, particularly in North America and Western Europe. SAN switching demand will likely continue to be down another quarter while inventory in the OEM channels have been worked down. As it relates to semiconductors, although the U.S.-China trade conflict continues, we have not seen further deterioration in our business, both specific to China as well as globally. Accordingly, we continue to expect to achieve over $22.5 billion of revenue in fiscal 2019, including $17.5 billion from semiconductor solutions and $5 billion from infrastructure software. 
Looking into next year. Infrastructure software is stable as renewals among our core customer base continue to be very solid. However, visibility continues to be very limited on the semiconductors side so we are managing the business with an expectation that we will continue to operate in a very low growth, uncertain macro environment for the foreseeable future. 
Fortunately, the fundamentals of our semiconductor business remain so strong. As you know, our business is all about connectivity from CPUs to memory in data centers, core to edge in networks, central office to devices and distributed systems, and here we continue to benefit from the underlying trend in the IT world and insatiable need for increasing bandwidth to connecting. In data centers, come out switching have gone from 3.2 terabits per second just 3 years ago to 12.8 terabits per second today. In cloud computing, as the limits to constrained CPU and GPU performance, the pipes linking computing cycles to the network and storage expense. PCI Express Gen 4 today at 16G replaces Gen 3 with the likes of next generation CPU. Legacy network interface controllers are becoming really intelligent, what we now call smart links and take on the task of accelerating workloads offload from non-optimized CPU within cloud computing. Even in SAN, storage area networks, Fibre Channel progresses its bandwidth at 32 gigabit per second in generation 6 today to generation 7 at 64 gigabit per second next year to reap the full benefit of all-flash arrays in enterprise storage. And to truly connect computer storage replacing direct attach copper, fiber optics running in 100 gig -- 100G channels are moving to 400 G as hyper cloud -- our hyper cloud customers scale out data centers with Tomahawk 3 today. 
Turning to telco networks. Call routing has gone from 1.6 terabits per second a few weeks ago to 9.6 terabits as represented by our Jericho 2 router today. In broadband, cable modem DOCSIS 3.0 at 1 gigabit today will move to DOCSIS 4.0 at 10 gigabits over the next few years as cable operators need to compete against 5G networks. So it is with DSM, digital subscriber lines, where a near 500 megabit per second of dataflow today, we will upshift to over 1 gigabit per second in G.fast, which may equate so we need GPON at 2.5 gigabits. And even with that reports today to launch in the mass markets with 10G ex band.  Of course, wireless connectivity [indiscernible] in the most headline and enterprise access gateways, the protocol has moved from 802.11ac to the new 802.11ax otherwise called Wi-Fi 6. Hence, we are at the cusp of telecommunication migrating from 4G to next next-generation 5G in radio access networks and smartphones. We are enabling these fundamental trends in the marketplace. This gives us confidence that we will continue to sustain and grow our semiconductor business over the long term. 
Moving on, let's talk about software. First, the CA. As we mentioned, our model for CA is to focus on the 500 largest enterprises in the world, the biggest users of our infrastructure software. Based on experience through fiscal third quarter 2019, we expect our core customer business that's up for renewal in fiscal year 2019 to grow over 20%. Meanwhile, the attrition rate of business from the long tail of customers behind this core group is anticipated to be over 10% for fiscal 2019. We have another 2-plus years to turn over the CA customer contract, but based on the trends of renewal growth from these core customer base in excess of the attrition of noncore business over the last 9 months, we're confident that we can meet, if not exceed, the long-term revenue and profitability targets that we laid out for CA to you last year when we acquired that business. Our integration activity is largely complete with operating expenses to support CA approximately target levels. 
Finally, let me take a few moments to talk about our planned acquisition of the Symantec enterprise business announced in August. Acquiring Symantec furthers our efforts to build one of the world's leading infrastructure technology platforms. It's a logical next step in Broadcom's infrastructure software strategy and adds 160 billion cybersecurity market to the Broadcom's addressable TAM. We will gain a portfolio of critical security solutions that are deeply embedded among our core customers. There will be meaningful cross-selling opportunities with Brocade and CA solutions, and we believe this acquisition will enable Broadcom to gain the largest share of the wallet of these core customers, and we expect this transaction to add more than $2 billion of sustainable run rate revenue with the leading franchises and cybersecurity and we also expect to achieve in excess of $1 billion in run rate cost synergies within 12 months [indiscernible] and importantly, this transaction gives us the opportunity to achieve our ongoing financial objective of double-digit cash on cash returns. The integration planning process is well underway. And as you likely saw, we cleared HSR last week. We remain on track to pull the transaction in the first quarter fiscal 2020 subject to approvals in the European Union in Japan as well as, of course, customary closing conditions. To some, a broad and increasingly diversified portfolio of leadership, technology franchises has allowed us today to sustain revenue and increase cash flows even in this challenging market environment.
Now let me turn this call over to Tom."

Consolidated net revenue for the third quarter was $5.5 billion, a 9% increase from the year ago. The semiconductor solutions segment revenue was $4.4 billion and represented 79% of our total revenue this quarter. This is down 5% year-on-",851,"Thank you, Hock. Consolidated net revenue for the third quarter was $5.5 billion, a 9% increase from the year ago. The semiconductor solutions segment revenue was $4.4 billion and represented 79% of our total revenue this quarter. This is down 5% year-on-year on a comparable basis. Our infrastructure software segment revenue was $1.1 billion and represented 21% of revenue. 
Free cash flow was 42% of revenue or $2.31 billion and grew 8.5% year-over-year. 
Let me now provide additional detail on our financial performance. Operating expenses were $1.01 billion driven by further reductions from CA-related activities. Operating income from continuing operations was $2.91 billion and represented 52.8% of net revenue. Adjusted EBITDA was $3.06 billion and represented 55.6% of net revenue. This figure excludes $141 million of depreciation. In terms of working capital, our payables increased $237 million, was somewhat offset by receivables increase of $55 million and an inventory increase of $57 million from the prior quarter. I would also note that we accrued $110 million of restructuring and integration expenses and made $164 million of cash restructuring and integration payments in the quarter. 
Finally, we spent $112 million on capital expenditures. In the third quarter, we returned $2 billion to stockholders consisting of $1.1 billion in the form of cash dividends and $977 million for the repurchase and elimination of 3.5 million AVGO shares. We ended the quarter with $5.5 billion of cash, $37.6 billion of total debt, 398 million outstanding shares and had 442 million fully diluted shares for the quarter. 
Turning to our fiscal year 2019 guidance. As Hock discussed, we are maintaining our full year revenue guidance of $22.5 billion including approximately $17.5 billion from semiconductor solutions and approximately $5 billion from infrastructure software. IP licensing is not expected to generate a material amount of revenue. On a non-GAAP basis, operating margins are expected to be approximately 52.5%. Net interest expense and other is expected to be approximately $1.3 billion. The tax rate is forecasted to be approximately 11%. Depreciation is expected to be approximately $600 million. CapEx is expected to be approximately $500 million. As a result, free cash flow is expected to be approximately $9 billion, which does take into account projected restructuring and integration charges of approximately $1.1 billion. Note, as of the end of the third quarter, $6.9 billion of free cash flow has been generated and includes $969 million of restructuring and integration charges. Stock-based compensation expense is expected to be approximately $2.2 billion, and finally, we expect average diluted share count to be 440 million for Q4, and this excludes any impact from share buybacks and eliminations.
Now on the capital app allocation. As many of you know, Broadcom had a business model that generates a very healthy amount of free cash flow across an increasingly diverse and stable set of mainly infrastructure technology franchises. Over the last 3 years we have worked to create a more transparent and balanced capital allocation policy. First and foremost were committed to return half of our free cash flow shareholders each year in the form of cash dividends. In essence, this allows the AVGO stockholder to decide how best to reinvest 50% of the free cash flow that we generate. In return, we have an effect the Broadcom stockholder to reinvest the remainder of the free cash flow after the dividend is distributed. Fundamentally, we think that we have a unique M&A strategy that allows us to consistently reinvest these excess cash flows that will drive returns well above our free cash flow yields. Over the past few years, we've developed a road map primarily around infrastructure software starting with Brocade and then with CA and now Symantec that will allow us to continue execute on the strategy for many years to come. So going forward, our plan is to use this excess cash for acquisitions and/or to pay down debt that we borrowed to make these acquisitions.
Now over the last year so, we have bought back a lot of stock. We had an opportunity to buy stock at depressed prices following the see an announcement. We also want to limit the onetime multiyear grant we did earlier this year. And all, we have invested $13.1 billion to repurchase or eliminate a total of 54.5 million shares at an average price of approximately $240 per share over the last 16 months through the end of our fiscal Q3 '19. So in summary, we think this decision made a lot of sense. That being said, maintaining our core capital allocation strategy of dividends and M&A while pursuing meaningful buybacks has caused us to increase our leverage and leverage multiples through substantially. Especially in light of the week macro environment we are seeing today, we are conscious of the risk that our levered balance sheet creates, and are very focused on managing those risks. As a result, we we transition our focus to deleveraging the balance sheet following the recent Symantec acquisition announcement.

We fully expect to see that and, frankly, that's as far as we see in this typical outlook because it obviously depends at the end of the day of our OEM customers, but we do see that this year. We do not see any major departure from that. And year-on-year things, are quite predictable in this respect but having said that, as you know, we are a company much more than just wireless today in -- even in our semiconductor solutions, where we have broad areas where we participate in and there are multiple puts and takes as I kind of indicated in terms of what happened in Q3. While we see continuing strength in networking, computing offload into data centers, we do see some weaknesses in storage and broadband. And probably, things look better next quarter for wireless, but maybe some other areas of and then will go the opposite way. But broadly, our large portfolio and broadband versus the and the fact that we are very fundamentally strong in each of those areas we are in, which we're saying what we are seeing and what we're saying here in the semiconductor macro market, which is we are pretty well represented on average, we are not as strong as it was same time last year. And if you look at our data so far year-to-date, we're down probably on average about 8% year-on-year or thereabouts, which is in my view what we think -- what we think the market is on a broad basis excluding memory, of course, and the fact that we were year-on-year down in Q1 and Q2 this fiscal year and probably less down in the back half of fiscal '19 should not be taken as the fact that there's a bottom and there's possibly a recovery. That's why we make the statement. We know we're pretty confident were at the bottom.

But what I do see is that yes, in all of this areas we participate in as networking and data centers, routing in core and metro networks or in cable, and cable and broadband where we all are one thing is clear, which is the nice thing we had we see in technology, especially the semiconductor technology. It's a constant evolution of the products we do. Constant demand for improved performance or unsupported, increased bandwidth in essentially connectivity. And depending on in the particular applications, some may spend 1 year, some may spend 3 years to make a transition, but they do happen and they continue to happen, and that's what keeps demand sustained for our technology, for our products. And that's what underpins, as reported, a long-term growth forecast in semiconductors for us mid-single digits. And I don't mean 1 year. I don't mean necessarily even 2 or 3 years. I mean over the next 5 years, 10 years because think about it, right, in 2018, fiscal, our semiconductor business organically take out new acquisitions grew 12% year-on-year from '17. And in '17, we grew and, October 16, about 10% organically. So I frankly I do not expect that high-end rate double-digit rate in this fiscal where we have pretty well represented, of course a broad area to be able to continue at that rate of growth and so we see in '19 a decline from a strong '18 as I've said probably mid- to high-single digits. Not unexpected but taken over a period of multiple years, we believe we have -- we will achieve that mid-single-digit compound annual growth rate. But I won't do that every year."

So what we've done is we've said it's all about the free cash flow from operations obviously includes as restructuring charges and that's add back, those for the purposes of calculating the dividends. So when we get to the end of the year, we'll take the cash flow from operations a lot about the restructuring integration charges and will divide it by 2 to get to the number that we used to calculate the dividend. This year, we don't have any specific onetime large campus initiatives or things like that, that would also look at the back half especially if we have a fairly good proxy of how we think about dividend and the recommendation of the Board at the end of this year. In service investment grade, I think we talked about this before but maintaining investment-grade similar to dividends policy is core principle here and I think the reason for that and how can I discuss it as many times internally as it provides maximum flexibility for us to continue to pursue our strategy. It's always been very important. So over time, we had this onetime event. We bought back a bunch of stock as we talked about in the prepared remarks that's pushed leverage up more so than we normally would. We think based on the economics and the results so far, that was the right decision, but we're really looking forward to going back to the point we pursued in the past, which is following their distribution of the dividend, we still have a lot of cash flow and net cash flow we think based on our strategy is best used for M&A because that's where the returns are most optimal. But as part of that, we often borrow money to finance those acquisitions and then we go and pay that down. So I think we're going back to a more traditional playbook. And as part of that, given the size and the scale and the increasing diversity of the business in the sheer profitability in the cash flows, we are very much in investment grade company and we're going to be very focused on an investment grade status going forward."

Well, it's a very interesting question, and I guess I put it 2 ways. One is touching on cloud spending. We might see some of what a lot of people are seeing an comment lately, which is an improvement and in cloud spending in multiple areas especially in scaling out new generation data centers and as the expanded business, and we obviously benefited from that in our switching, routing and some of our specific custom offload programs in AI of just Symantec. And we see that as we all know cloud spending is starting to be a bit like telco spending very lumpy. What we see on the other half of our business in infrastructure is with enterprises, end users and here, from the viewpoint of an opportunity to see and users directly, we see end-user enterprise enterprises are end users who are the end users especially the largest bunch of our core customers, their spending continues. The IT budget is pretty strong and they're spending continues because they need the digital transformation as their business continues fairly decently and that has not impacted, which is why our infrastructure software business renewals continue to grow very nicely and that's not an issue. It's when we sell components to OEMs will then make it into the systems to sell to the same end users that we see a difference, and the difference is simply that I think given as far as we could gather, given the uncertainty in this environment that everybody is constraining all our partners -- are constraining their supply chain and compressing the supply chain, so to speak and then action order compressing is really a reduction in what appears to be demand. So it's really interesting as we see this that on the software side, things are direct sales to large enterprises continue fairly unabated, but when it comes to selling components through partners to the same end users, we see different perspective slowdown constrained. And it's reflected, obviously, in the numbers we are showing here and it also is reflected in the outlook that we're giving to you guys."

Well it is in that portfolio licensing arrangements as the sales model, our business model we applied to our infrastructure software, which is CA at this point has been in my mind and to be fair, it's less than a year since we launched it and since he took over CA in the last November. I would call it very successful it's been very encouraging and the big part of why we think it's encouraging and why it works is because we just focused on the largest 500, 600 customers of CA. These are guys where we have large decent-sized, large footprints to begin with. And as we go towards renewals, our ability to offer a portfolio licensing arrangement unlimited capacity on the full range of products, broad product set that we have that extends beyond from mainframe to distributed software is extremely attractive and, of course, affected through those large enterprises who buys a lot of those infrastructure software so we have done multiple deals and multiple renewals, and we continue to be very engaged with those countries. So I guess my conclusion is by focusing on these largest customer we launched -- where we have large footprint that exists and where the ability to consume more of those software we have and makes up a lot of sense and as I put in some of my comments earlier on, this ability to focus on this largest guys and put the sales motion technically and commercially very effectively on this large customers and possibly not focused on the noncore customers and is a key part of the whole model and what makes the whole model work since simply contextually we have renewing of these contracts the larger footprints on the portfolio licensing agreement as I mentioned at a rate of over 20% annually while we are -- probably because of lack of focus -- reducing our smaller noncore customers at 10%, and those core customers represents 80% of our overall revenue while the long tail represents only 20% ends up in a situation after 1 year or almost 1 year where we show net gains of over 10%. Keep that going, 3 years later, we reached an average term of every contract we put in place, we would see a clear step up in our revenues from this business, we like to believe double-digit growth."

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Looking at the third quarter. Consolidated net revenue was $5.5 billion, a 9% increase from the year ago. Semiconductor solution revenue was $4.4 billion, down 5% year-on-year",1178,"Thank you, Bea. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. 
Looking at the third quarter. Consolidated net revenue was $5.5 billion, a 9% increase from the year ago. Semiconductor solution revenue was $4.4 billion, down 5% year-on-year and up 6% quarter-over-quarter. Networking continued to perform well driven by strong demand for our merchants switching and routing platforms. And as we also expected, shipments of custom silicon solutions in AI, Smart NIC and video transcoding to cloud data centers were strong. Wireless is, of course, seeing the beginning of a typical seasonal uptick and the initial positive effects of increased content. These tailwinds were partially offset by weaker demand in storage and broadband. 
Revenue for infrastructure software was $1.1 billion. The CA business is running above our expectation, benefiting from sustained enterprise demand for our mainframe and distributed software. However, SAN switching demand has paused as our partner OEM supply chain compressed in these uncertain conditions. 
Now let me address the current environment and outlook. Enterprise and mainframe software customer demand continues to remain stable, particularly in North America and Western Europe. SAN switching demand will likely continue to be down another quarter while inventory in the OEM channels have been worked down. As it relates to semiconductors, although the U.S.-China trade conflict continues, we have not seen further deterioration in our business, both specific to China as well as globally. Accordingly, we continue to expect to achieve over $22.5 billion of revenue in fiscal 2019, including $17.5 billion from semiconductor solutions and $5 billion from infrastructure software. 
Looking into next year. Infrastructure software is stable as renewals among our core customer base continue to be very solid. However, visibility continues to be very limited on the semiconductors side so we are managing the business with an expectation that we will continue to operate in a very low growth, uncertain macro environment for the foreseeable future. 
Fortunately, the fundamentals of our semiconductor business remain strong. As you know, our business is all about connectivity from CPUs to memory in data centers, core to edge in networks, central office to client devices in distributed systems. And here we continue to benefit from the underlying trend in the IT world and insatiable need for increasing bandwidth to connect things. In data centers, Tomahawk switching have gone from 3.2 terabits per second just 3 years ago to 12.8 terabits per second today. In cloud computing, as the limits to Moore's Law constrained CPU and GPU performance, the pipes linking computing cycles to the network and storage expense. PCI Express Gen 4 today at 16G replaces Gen 3 with the likes of next-generation Rome CPU. Legacy network interface controllers, NICs as they say, are becoming really intelligent, what we now call Smart NICs, and take on the task of accelerating workloads, offload from non-optimized CPU within cloud computing. 
Even in SAN, that's storage area network, Fibre Channel progresses its bandwidth at 32 gigabit per second in Generation 6 today to Generation 7 at 64 gigabit per second next year to reap the full benefit of all-flash arrays in enterprise storage. And to truly connect computer storage, replacing direct attach copper, fiber optics running in 100 gig -- 100G channels are moving to 400G as hyper cloud -- our hyper cloud customers scale out data centers with Tomahawk 3 today. 
Turning to telco networks. Call routing has gone from 1.6 terabits per second a few years ago to 9.6 terabits as represented by our Jericho 2 router today. In broadband, cable modem with DOCSIS 3.0 at 1 gigabit today will move to DOCSIS 4.0 at 10 gigabits over the next few years as cable operators need to compete against 5G networks. So it is with DSL, digital subscriber line, we're at a near 500 megabit per second of dataflow today. We will upshift to over 1 gigabit per second in G.fast, which may seem inadequate, so we need GPON at 2.5 gigabits. And even with that, we're poised today to launch into mass markets with 10G xPON. 
Of course, wireless connectivity too has seen the most headline. And in enterprise access gateways, the protocol has moved from 802.11ac to the new OFDMA-enabled 802.11ax, otherwise called WiFi 6. And we are at the cusp of cellular communication migrating from 4G to next-generation 5G in radio access networks and smartphones. We are enabling these fundamental trends in the marketplace. This gives us confidence that we will continue to sustain and grow our semiconductor business over the long term. 
Moving on, let's talk about software. First, the CA. As we mentioned, our model for CA is to focus on the 500 largest enterprises in the world, the biggest users of our infrastructure software. Based on experience through fiscal third quarter 2019, we expect our core customer business that's up for renewal in fiscal year 2019 to grow over 20%. Meanwhile, the attrition rate of business from the long tail of customers behind this core group is anticipated to be over 10% for fiscal 2019. We have another 2-plus years to turn over the CA customer contract, but based on the trends of renewal growth from these core customer base in excess of the attrition of noncore business over the last 9 months, we're confident that we can meet, if not exceed, the long-term revenue and profitability targets that we laid out for CA to you last year when we acquired that business. Our integration activity is largely complete with operating expenses to support CA approaching target levels. 
Finally, let me take a few more minutes to talk about our planned acquisition of the Symantec enterprise business announced in August. Acquiring Symantec furthers our efforts to build on the world's leading infrastructure technology platforms. It is the logical next step in Broadcom's infrastructure software strategy and adds $160 billion cybersecurity market to the Broadcom's addressable TAM. We will gain a portfolio of mission-critical security solutions that are deeply embedded among our core customers. There will be meaningful cross-selling opportunities with Brocade and CA solutions, and we believe this acquisition will enable Broadcom to gain a larger share of the wallet of these core customers, and we expect this transaction to add more than $2 billion of sustainable run rate revenue with its leading franchises in cybersecurity, and we also expect to achieve in excess of $1 billion in run rate cost synergies within 12 months post close. And importantly, this transaction gives us the opportunity to achieve our ongoing financial objective of double-digit cash on cash returns. The integration planning process is well underway. And as you likely saw, we cleared HSR last week. We remain on track to close the transaction in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 subject to anti-trust approvals in the European Union and Japan as well as, of course, customary closing conditions. 
To sum, a broad and increasingly diversified portfolio of leadership, technology franchises has allowed us today to sustain revenue and increase cash flows even in this challenging market environment.
Now let me turn this call over to Tom."

Consolidated net revenue for the third quarter was $5.5 billion, a 9% increase from a year ago. The semiconductor solutions segment revenue was $4.4 billion and represented 79% of our total revenue this quarter. This is down 5% year-on-",859,"Thank you, Hock. 
Consolidated net revenue for the third quarter was $5.5 billion, a 9% increase from a year ago. The semiconductor solutions segment revenue was $4.4 billion and represented 79% of our total revenue this quarter. This is down 5% year-on-year on a comparable basis. Our infrastructure software segment revenue was $1.1 billion and represented 21% of revenue. Free cash flow was 42% of revenue or $2.31 billion and grew 8.5% year-over-year. 
Let me now provide additional detail on our financial performance. Operating expenses were $1.01 billion driven by further reductions from CA-related activities. Operating income from continuing operations was $2.91 billion and represented 52.8% of net revenue. Adjusted EBITDA was $3.06 billion and represented 55.6% of net revenue. This figure excludes $141 million of depreciation. In terms of working capital, our payables increase of $237 million was somewhat offset by receivables increase of $55 million and an inventory increase of $57 million from the prior quarter. I would also note that we accrued $110 million of restructuring and integration expenses and made $164 million of cash restructuring and integration payments in the quarter. Finally, we spent $112 million on capital expenditures. 
In the third quarter, we returned $2 billion to stockholders consisting of $1.1 billion in the form of cash dividends and $977 million for the repurchase and elimination of 3.5 million AVGO shares. We ended the quarter with $5.5 billion of cash, $37.6 billion of total debt, 398 million outstanding shares and had 442 million fully diluted shares for the quarter. 
Turning to our fiscal year 2019 guidance. As Hock discussed, we are maintaining our full year revenue guidance of $22.5 billion including approximately $17.5 billion from semiconductor solutions and approximately $5 billion from infrastructure software. IP licensing is not expected to generate a material amount of revenue. On a non-GAAP basis, operating margins are expected to be approximately 52.5%. Net interest expense and other is expected to be approximately $1.3 billion. The tax rate is forecasted to be approximately 11%. Depreciation is expected to be approximately $600 million. CapEx is expected to be approximately $500 million. As a result, free cash flow is expected to be approximately $9 billion, which does take into account projected restructuring and integration charges of approximately $1.1 billion. Note, as of the end of the third quarter, $6.9 billion of free cash flow has been generated and includes $969 million of restructuring and integration charges. Stock-based compensation expense is expected to be approximately $2.2 billion, and finally, we expect average diluted share count to be 440 million for Q4, and this excludes any impact from share buybacks and eliminations.
Now onto capital allocation. As many of you know, Broadcom has a business model that generates a very healthy amount of free cash flow across an increasingly diverse and stable set of mainly infrastructure technology franchises. Over the last 3 years, we have worked to create a more transparent and balanced capital allocation policy. First and foremost, we're committed to return half of our free cash flow to shareholders each year in the form of cash dividends. In essence, this allows the AVGO stockholder to decide how best to reinvest 50% of the free cash flow that we generate. In return, we have, in effect, as the Broadcom stockholder put trust in management, to ultimately reinvest the remainder of the free cash flow after the dividend is distributed. Fundamentally, we think that we have a unique M&A strategy that allows us to consistently reinvest these excess cash flows that will drive returns well above our free cash flow yields. Over the past few years, we've developed a road map primarily around infrastructure software starting with Brocade and then with CA and now Symantec that will allow us to continue to execute on the strategy for many years to come. So going forward, our plan is to use this excess cash for acquisitions and/or to pay down debt that we borrowed to make these acquisitions.
Now over the last year or so, we have bought back a lot of stock. We had an opportunity to buy stock at depressed prices following the CA announcement. We also want to limit the dilution from the onetime multiyear grant we did earlier this year. In all, we have invested $13.1 billion to repurchase or eliminate a total of 54.5 million shares at an average price of approximately $240 per share over the last 16 months through the end of our fiscal Q3 '19. So in summary, we think this decision made a lot of sense. That being said, maintaining our core capital allocation strategy of dividends and M&A while pursuing meaningful buybacks in parallel has caused us to increase our leverage and leverage multiples pretty substantially. Especially in light of the weak macro environment we are seeing today, we are conscious of the risk that a more levered balance sheet creates and are very focused on managing those risks. As a result, we have started to transition our focus to deleveraging the balance sheet following the recent Symantec acquisition announcement.
That concludes my prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions] Operator, please open up the call for questions."

But as we sit here right now over the rest of this calendar year, if not fiscal year, what we are seeing is, you're right, it appears we have hit bottom at least in the semiconductors. As it relates to the semiconductor solutions side, we have hit bottom. And we are kind of looking ahead and seeing that we're staying right here, more or less, with little seasonality that pops up every now and then as we are seeing to some extent probably in the next few months as we see ramp-up of our North American -- large North American OEM customer enhances.

And to be very specific of what you're asking in wireless, it's -- as we've always done in previous years, we see beginning of uptick seasonality in the Q3, which is the July quarter. And we'll see more of it in our last quarter of the fiscal year, which is October quarter, and we fully expect to see that. And frankly, that's as far as we see in this typical kind of outlook because it obviously depends at the end of the day on reset of our OEM customers. But we do see that this year. We do not see any major departure from that. And year-on-year, things are quite predictable in this respect. But having said that, as you know, we are a company much more than just wireless today. Even in our semiconductor solutions, we have broad areas where we participate in, and there are multiple puts and takes, as I kind of indicated in terms of what happened in Q3. While we see continuing strength in networking, computing offload in the data centers, we do see some weaknesses in storage and broadband. And it will probably -- things might probably look better next quarter for wireless, but maybe there are some other areas of mitigate -- that will go the opposite way. 
But broadly, given our large portfolio and broad diversity and the fact that we are very fundamentally strong in each of those areas we are in, which we are saying -- what we are seeing and what we are saying here is that in the semiconductor macro market, which is where we are pretty well represented on average, we are not as strong as it was same time last year. And if you look at our data so far this year-to-date, we're down probably on average about 8% year-on-year or thereabouts, which is in my view what we think what the market -- what we think the market is on a broad basis excluding memory, of course. And the fact that we were year-on-year down more in Q1, Q2 this fiscal year and probably less down in the back half of fiscal '19 should not be taken as a fact that that's a bottom and there's possibly a recovery. That's why we make the statement. We know we're pretty confident we're at the bottom. The question is there is no -- not much clarity or visibility yet or certainty that any sharp recovery is around the corner."

So our perception -- our ability to see how big that ramp is at any particular point in time is also dependent on the fact that different operators in different countries will probably want to ramp up at different points in time different parts of the network, whether it's a front side ramp or the backhaul.

This is an ongoing trend, and I was using examples because these are examples ongoing that we see today, recent past and going forward in the future. But what I do see is that, yes, in all these areas we participate in, from -- as networking in data centers, routing in core and metro networks or in cable, in cable and broadband where we all are, one thing is clear, which is the nice thing we had -- we see in technology, especially the semiconductor technology. There is a constant evolution of the products we do as constant demand for improved performance or positive increase in bandwidth in essentially dual connectivity. And depending on the particular applications, some may spend 1 year, some may spend 3 years to make a transition. But they do happen, and they continue to happen. And that's what keeps demand sustained for our technology, for our products. And that's what underpins, as reported, a long-term growth forecast in semiconductors for us of mid-single digits. 
And I don't mean 1 year. I don't mean necessarily even 2 or 3 years. I mean over the next 5 years, 10 years because think about it, right, in 2018 fiscal, our semiconductor business organically, take out all acquisitions, grew 12% year-on-year from '17. And in '17, we grew another -- over '16, about 10% organically. So I frankly do not expect that high rate, double-digit rate in these fiscals where we are pretty well represented across a broad area to be able to continue at that rate of growth. And so we see in '19 a decline from a strong '18, as I've said, of probably mid- to high single digits. Not unexpected but taken over a period of multiple years, we believe we have -- we will achieve that mid-single-digit compounded annual growth rate. But I won't do that every year."

In the past, that 50% dividend policy you have, it's very clear, but the free cash flow that generates that at times has been a little more subjective due to onetime charges finishing the classic Broadcom campus, et cetera. So how does restructuring charges -- how do they fit into the math of free cash flow. And then the investment grade target where you want to keep it there, what sort of leverage target should we think about? Would you guys more aggressively be paying down debt as opposed to repurchasing shares in the near future?"

I think on the cash flow side, Ross, what we try to do is create somewhat of a formula because we do typically have acquisitions, we do have investments we make to get to the synergy targets. And in fact, what we're trying to do is deliver the benefits to the stockholders the year with which we are able to achieve those synergies. So what we've done is we've said, look, let's look at the free cash flow from operations, obviously includes those restructuring charges, and let's add back those for the purposes of calculating the dividends. 
So when we get to the end of the year, we'll take the cash flow from operations. We'll add back the restructuring, integration charges, and in effect -- we'll divide it by 2 to get to the number that we used to calculate the dividend. This year, we don't have any specific onetime large campus initiatives or things like that, that we would also look to back out. So that should be a fairly good proxy for how we think about the dividend and the recommendation of the Board at the end of this year. In terms of investment grade, I think we talked about this before, but maintaining investment grade similar to the dividends policy is a core principle here. And I think the reason for that, and Hock and I discuss it many times internally, is it provides maximum flexibility for us to continue to pursue our strategy. It's always been very important. So over time, we had this onetime event. We bought back a bunch of stock as I talked about in the prepared remarks that's pushed leverage up more so than we normally would. We think based on the economics and the results so far, that was the right decision. 
But we're really looking forward to going back to the playbook we pursued in the past, which is following the distribution of the dividend, and we still have a lot of cash flow. And that cash flow, we think, based on our strategy, is best used for M&A because that's where the returns are most optimal. But as part of that, we often borrow money to finance those acquisitions, and then we go and pay that debt down. So I think we're going back to a more traditional playbook. And as part of that, given the size and the scale and the increasing diversity of the business and the sheer profitability and the cash flows, we're very much an investment-grade company, and we're going to be very focused on maintaining that investment-grade status going forward."

Well, it's a very interesting question, and I guess I'd put it 2 ways. One is touching on cloud spending. We pretty much see some of what a lot of people are seeing in comments lately, which is an improvement in cloud spending in multiple areas especially in scaling out new generation data centers as they expand their business. And we obviously benefit from that in switching, routing and some of our specific custom offload programs in AI or just Smart NICs. And we see that. But as we all know these days, cloud spending is starting to be a bit like telco spending, very lumpy. 
What we see on the other half of our business, in infrastructure, is with enterprises, end users. And here, from the viewpoint of an opportunity to see end users directly, we see end user -- enterprises or end users, who are the end users, especially the largest bunch, our core customers, their spending continues. Their IT budget is pretty strong, and their spending continues because they need that digital transformation as their business continues fairly decently. And that has not impacted, which is why our infrastructure software business renewals continue to grow very nicely, and that's not an issue. It's when we sell components to OEMs, who then make it into systems to sell to these same end users that we see a difference. And the difference is simply that I think given as far as we could gather, given the uncertainty in this environment, that everybody is constraining all our partners -- are constraining their supply chain and compressing their supply chain, so to speak. And that action of compressing is really a reduction in orders, a reduction in what appears to be demand. So it's really interesting as we see this, that on the software side, things are -- direct sales to large enterprises continue fairly unabated. But when it comes to selling components through partners to these same end users, we see a different perspective, a slowdown, a constraint. And it's reflected, obviously, in the numbers we are showing here. And it also is reflected in the outlook that we're giving to you guys."

Well, it is in that portfolio licensing arrangements as a sales model or business model we apply to our infrastructure software business, which is CA at this point, has been, in my mind, and to be fair, it's less than a year since we launched it, since we took over CA only last November. It's been, I would call it, very successful. It's been very encouraging. And a big part of why we think it is encouraging and why it works is because we just focus on the largest 500, 600 customers of CA. These are guys where we have large -- decent-sized or large footprints to begin with. And as we go towards renewals, our ability to offer a portfolio-wide licensing arrangement, unlimited capacity on the full range of products, broad product set we have that extends beyond -- from mainframe to distributed software is extremely attractive and cost effective to those large enterprises who buys a lot of those infrastructure software. So we have done multiple deals as we went through multiple renewals, and we continue to be very engaged with those companies.
So I guess my conclusion is by focusing on these largest customers with large -- where we have large footprint that exists and where the ability to consume more of those software we have, it makes up a lot of sense. And as I put in some of my comments earlier on, this ability to focus on this largest guys and put the sales motion technically and commercially very effectively on these large customers and possibly not focus on the long tail of noncore customers is a key part of the whole model and what makes the whole model work simply because conceptually, we are renewing those contracts with larger footprints on portfolio licensing agreement, as I mentioned, at a rate of over 20% annually while we are, probably because of lack of focus, reducing or attriting smaller noncore customers at 10%. And those core customers represent 80% of our overall revenue while the long tail represents only 20%, ends up in a situation after 1 year or almost 1 year where we show net gains of over 10%. Keep that going, 3 years later, we reach the average term of every contract we put in place, we would see a clear step-up in our revenues from this business of, we like to believe, double-digit growth."

Looking at the third quarter. Consolidated net revenue was $5.5 billion, a 9% increase from a year ago. Semiconductor solution revenue was $4.4 billion, down 5% year-on-year and up 6% quarter-over-quarter. Networking continued to perform well driven by strong demand for our merchants switching and routing platforms. And as we also expected, shipments of custom silicon solutions in AI, Smart NIC and video transcoding to cloud data centers were strong. Wireless is, of course, seeing the beginning of a typical seasonal uptick and the initial positive effects of increased content. These tailwinds were partially offset by weaker demand in storage and broadband. 
Revenue for infrastructure software was $1.1 billion. The CA business is running above our expectation, benefiting from sustained enterprise demand for our mainframe and distributed software. However, SAN switching demand has paused as our partner OEM supply chain compressed in these uncertain conditions. 
Now let me address the current environment and outlook. Enterprise and mainframe software customer demand continues to remain stable, particularly in North America and Western Europe. SAN switching demand will likely continue to be down another quarter while inventory in the OEM channels are being worked down. As it relates to semiconductors, although the U.S.-China trade conflict continues, we have not seen further deterioration in our business, both specific to China as well as globally. Accordingly, we continue to expect to achieve over $22.5 billion of revenue in fiscal 2019, including $17.5 billion from semiconductor solutions and $5 billion from infrastructure software. 
Looking to next year. Infrastructure software is stable as renewals among our core customer base continue to be very solid. However, visibility continues to be very limited on the semiconductors side so we are managing the business with an expectation that we will continue to operate in a very low growth, uncertain macro environment for the foreseeable future. 
Fortunately, the fundamentals of our semiconductor business remain strong. As you know, our business is all about connectivity from CPUs to memory in data centers, core to edge in networks, central office to client devices in distributed systems. And here we continue to benefit from the underlying trend in the IT world an insatiable need for increasing bandwidth to connect things. In data centers, Tomahawk switching have gone from 3.2 terabits per second just 3 years ago to 12.8 terabits per second today. In cloud computing, as the limits to Moore's Law constrained CPU and GPU performance, the pipes linking computing cycles to the network and storage expense. PCI Express Gen 4 today at 16G replaces Gen 3 with the likes of next-generation Rome CPU. Legacy network interface controllers, NICs as they say, are becoming really intelligent, what we now call Smart NICs, and take on the task of accelerating workloads, offload from non-optimized CPU within cloud computing. 
Even in SAN, that's storage area network, Fibre Channel progresses its bandwidth at 32 gigabit per second in Generation 6 today to Generation 7 at 64 gigabit per second next year to reap the full benefit of all-flash arrays in enterprise storage. And to truly connect computer storage, replacing direct attach copper, fiber optics running in 100 gig -- 100G channels are moving to 400G as hyper cloud -- our hyper cloud customers scale out data centers with Tomahawk 3 today. 
Turning to telco networks. Call routing has gone from 1.6 terabits per second a few years ago to 9.6 terabits as represented by our Jericho 2 router today. In broadband, cable modem with DOCSIS 3.0 at 1 gigabit today will move to DOCSIS 4.0 at 10 gigabits over the next few years as cable operators need to compete against 5G networks. So it is with DSL, digital subscriber line, we're at a near 500 megabit per second of dataflow today. We will upshift to over 1 gigabit per second in G.fast, which may seem inadequate, so we need GPON at 2.5 gigabits. And even with that, we're poised today to launch into mass markets with 10G xPON. 
Of course, wireless connectivity too has seen the most headline. And in enterprise access gateways, the protocol has moved from 802.11ac to the new OFDMA-enabled 802.11ax, otherwise called WiFi 6. And we are at the cusp of cellular communication migrating from 4G to next-generation 5G in radio access networks and smartphones. We are enabling these fundamental trends in the marketplace. This gives us confidence that we will continue to sustain and grow our semiconductor business over the long term. 
Moving on, let's talk about software. First, the CA. As we mentioned, our model for CA is to focus on the 500 largest enterprises in the world, the biggest users of our infrastructure software. Based on experience through fiscal third quarter 2019, we expect our core customer business that's up for renewal in fiscal year 2019 to grow over 20%. Meanwhile, the attrition rate of business from the long tail of customers behind this core group is anticipated to be over 10% for fiscal 2019. We have another 2-plus years to turn over the CA customer contract, but based on the trends of renewal growth from these core customer base in excess of the attrition of noncore business over the last 9 months, we're confident that we can meet, if not exceed, the long-term revenue and profitability targets that we laid out for CA to you last year when we acquired that business. Our integration activity is largely complete with operating expenses to support CA approaching target levels. 
Finally, let me take a few more minutes to talk about our planned acquisition of the Symantec enterprise business announced in August. Acquiring Symantec furthers our efforts to build one of world's leading infrastructure technology platforms. It is the logical next step in Broadcom's infrastructure software strategy and adds $160 billion cybersecurity market to the Broadcom's addressable TAM. We will gain a portfolio of mission-critical security solutions that are deeply embedded among our core customers. There will be meaningful cross-selling opportunities with Brocade and CA solutions, and we believe this acquisition will enable Broadcom to gain a larger share of the wallet of these core customers, and we expect this transaction to add more than $2 billion of sustainable run rate revenue with its leading franchises in cybersecurity, and we also expect to achieve in excess of $1 billion in run rate cost synergies within 12 months post close. And importantly, this transaction gives us the opportunity to achieve our ongoing financial objective of double-digit cash on cash returns. The integration planning process is well underway. And as you likely saw, we cleared HSR last week. We remain on track to close the transaction in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 subject to anti-trust approvals in the European Union and Japan as well as, of course, customary closing conditions. 
To sum, a broad and increasingly diversified portfolio of leadership, technology franchises has allowed us today to sustain revenue and increase cash flows even in this challenging market environment.
Now let me turn this call over to Tom."

Consolidated net revenue for the third quarter was $5.5 billion, a 9% increase from a year ago. The semiconductor solutions segment revenue was $4.4 billion and represented 79% of our total revenue this quarter. This is down 5% year-on-",862,"Thank you, Hock. 
Consolidated net revenue for the third quarter was $5.5 billion, a 9% increase from a year ago. The semiconductor solutions segment revenue was $4.4 billion and represented 79% of our total revenue this quarter. This is down 5% year-on-year on a comparable basis. Our infrastructure software segment revenue was $1.1 billion and represented 21% of revenue. Free cash flow was 42% of revenue or $2.31 billion and grew 8.5% year-over-year. 
Let me now provide additional detail on our financial performance. Operating expenses were $1.01 billion driven by further reductions from CA-related activities. Operating income from continuing operations was $2.91 billion and represented 52.8% of net revenue. Adjusted EBITDA was $3.06 billion and represented 55.6% of net revenue. This figure excludes $141 million of depreciation. In terms of working capital, our payables increase of $237 million was somewhat offset by receivables increase of $55 million and an inventory increase of $57 million from the prior quarter. I would also note that we accrued $110 million of restructuring and integration expenses and made $164 million of cash restructuring and integration payments in the quarter. Finally, we spent $112 million on capital expenditures. 
In the third quarter, we returned $2 billion to stockholders consisting of $1.1 billion in the form of cash dividends and $977 million for the repurchase and elimination of 3.5 million AVGO shares. We ended the quarter with $5.5 billion of cash, $37.6 billion of total debt, 398 million outstanding shares and had 442 million fully diluted shares for the quarter. 
Turning to our fiscal year 2019 guidance. As Hock discussed, we are maintaining our full year revenue guidance of $22.5 billion including approximately $17.5 billion from semiconductor solutions and approximately $5 billion from infrastructure software. IP licensing is not expected to generate a material amount of revenue. On a non-GAAP basis, operating margins are expected to be approximately 52.5%. Net interest expense and other is expected to be approximately $1.3 billion. The tax rate is forecasted to be approximately 11%. Depreciation is expected to be approximately $600 million. CapEx is expected to be approximately $500 million. As a result, free cash flow is expected to be approximately $9 billion, which does take into account projected restructuring and integration charges of approximately $1.1 billion. Note, as of the end of the third quarter, $6.9 billion of free cash flow has been generated and includes $969 million of restructuring and integration charges. Stock-based compensation expense is expected to be approximately $2.2 billion, and finally, we expect average diluted share count to be 440 million for Q4, and this excludes any impact from share buybacks and eliminations.
Now onto capital allocation. As many of you know, Broadcom has a business model that generates a very healthy amount of free cash flow across an increasingly diverse and stable set of mainly infrastructure technology franchises. Over the last few years, we have worked to create a more transparent and balanced capital allocation policy. First and foremost, we have committed to return half of our free cash flow to shareholders each year in the form of cash dividends. In essence, this allows the AVGO stockholder to decide how best to reinvest 50% of the free cash flow that we generate. In return, we have, in effect, asked the Broadcom stockholder to put trust in management, to optimally reinvest the remainder of the free cash flow after the dividend is distributed. Fundamentally, we think that we have a unique M&A strategy that allows us to consistently reinvest these excess cash flows that will drive returns well above our free cash flow yields. Over the past few years, we've developed a road map primarily around infrastructure software starting with Brocade and then with CA and now Symantec that will allow us to continue to execute on the strategy for many years to come. So going forward, our plan is to use this excess cash for acquisitions and/or to pay down debt that we borrow to make these acquisitions.
Now over the last year or so, we have bought back a lot of stock. We had an opportunity to buy stock at depressed prices following the CA announcement. We also want to limit the dilution from the onetime multiyear grant we did earlier this year. In all, we have invested $13.1 billion to repurchase or eliminate a total of 54.5 million shares at an average price of approximately $240 per share over the last 16 months through the end of our fiscal Q3 '19. So in summary, we think this decision made a lot of sense. That being said, maintaining our core and capital allocation strategy of dividends and M&A while pursuing meaningful buybacks in parallel has caused us to increase our leverage and leverage multiples pretty substantially. Especially in light of the weak macro environment we are seeing today, we are conscious of the risk that a more levered balance sheet creates and are very focused on managing those risks. As a result, we have started to transition our focus to deleveraging the balance sheet following the recent Symantec acquisition announcement.
That concludes my prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions] Operator, please open up the call for questions."

But as we sit here right now over the rest of this calendar year, if not fiscal year, what we are seeing is, you're right, it appears we have hit bottom at least in the semiconductors. As it relates to the semiconductor solutions side, we have hit bottom. And we are kind of looking ahead and seeing that we're staying right here, more or less, with little seasonality that pops up every now and then as we are seeing to some extent probably in the next few months as we see ramp-up of our North American -- large North American OEM customer enhances.

And to be very specific of what you're asking in wireless, it's -- as we've always done in previous years, we see beginning of uptick seasonality in the Q3, which is the July quarter. And we'll see more of it in our last quarter of the fiscal year, which is October quarter, and we fully expect to see that. And frankly, that's as far as we see in this typical kind of outlook because it obviously depends at the end of the day on reset of our OEM customers. But we do see that this year. We do not see any major departure from that. And year-on-year, things are quite predictable in this respect. But having said that, as you know, we are a company much more than just wireless today. Even in our semiconductor solutions, we have broad areas where we participate in, and there are multiple puts and takes, as I kind of indicated in terms of what happened in Q3. While we see continuing strength in networking, computing offload in the data centers, we do see some weaknesses in storage and broadband. And it will probably -- things might probably look better next quarter for wireless, but maybe there are some other areas of mitigate -- that will go the opposite way. 
But broadly, given our large portfolio and broad diversity and the fact that we are very fundamentally strong in each of those areas we are in, which we are saying -- what we are seeing and what we are saying here is that in the semiconductor macro market, which is where we are pretty well represented on average, we are not as strong as it was same time last year. And if you look at our data so far this year-to-date, we're down probably on average about 8% year-on-year or thereabouts, which is in my view what we think what the market -- what we think the market is on a broad basis excluding memory, of course. And the fact that we were year-on-year down more in Q1, Q2 this fiscal year and probably less down in the back half of fiscal '19 should not be taken as a fact that that's a bottom and there's possibly a recovery. That's why we make the statement. We know we're pretty confident we're at the bottom. The question is there is no -- not much clarity or visibility yet or certainty that any sharp recovery is around the corner."

So our perception -- our ability to see how big that ramp is at any particular point in time is also dependent on the fact that different operators in different countries will probably want to ramp up at different points in time different parts of the network, whether it's a front side ramp or the backhaul.

This is an ongoing trend, and I was using examples because these are examples ongoing that we see today, recent past and going forward in the future. But what I do see is that, yes, in all these areas we participate in, from -- as networking in data centers, routing in core and metro networks or in cable, in cable and broadband where we all are, one thing is clear, which is the nice thing we had -- we see in technology, especially the semiconductor technology. There is a constant evolution of the products we do as constant demand for improved performance or [ as I put it ] increased bandwidth [ since we do ] connectivity. And depending on the particular applications, some may spend 1 year, some may spend 3 years to make a transition. But they do happen, and they continue to happen. And that's what keeps demand sustained for our technology, for our products. And that's what underpins, as we put it, a long-term growth forecast in semiconductors for us of mid-single digits. 
And I don't mean 1 year. I don't mean necessarily even 2 or 3 years. I mean over the next 5 years, 10 years because think about it, right, in 2018 fiscal, our semiconductor business organically, take out all acquisitions, grew 12% year-on-year from '17. And in '17, we grew another -- over '16, about 10% organically. So I frankly do not expect that high of rate, double-digit rate in these fiscals where we are pretty well represented across a broad area to be able to continue at that rate of growth. And so we see in '19 a decline from a strong '18, as I said, of probably mid- to high single digits. Not unexpected but taken over a period of multiple years, we believe we have -- we will achieve that mid-single-digit compounded annual growth rate. But I won't do that every year."

So what we've done is we've said, look, let's look at the free cash flow from operations, obviously includes those restructuring charges, and let's add back those for the purposes of calculating the dividends. 
So when we get to the end of the year, we'll take the cash flow from operations. We'll add back the restructuring, integration charges, and in effect -- we'll divide by 2 to get to the number that we used to calculate the dividend. This year, we don't have any specific onetime large campus initiatives or things like that, that we would also look to back out. So that should be a fairly good proxy for how we think about the dividend and the recommendation of the Board at the end of this year. In terms of investment grade, I think we talked about this before, but maintaining investment grade similar to the dividend policy is a core principle here. And I think the reason for that, and Hock and I discussed it many times internally, is it provides maximum flexibility for us to continue to pursue our strategy. It's always been very important. So over time, we had this onetime event. We bought back a bunch of stock as I talked about in the prepared remarks. That's pushed leverage up more so than we normally would. We think based on the economics and the results so far, that was the right decision. 
But we're really looking forward to going back to the playbook we pursued in the past, which is following the distribution of the dividend, we still have a lot of cash flow. And that cash flow, we think, based on our strategy, is best used for M&A because that's where the returns are most optimal. But as part of that, we often borrow money to finance those acquisitions, and then we go and pay that debt down. So I think we're going back to a more traditional playbook. And as part of that, given the size and the scale and the increasing diversity of the business and the sheer profitability and the cash flows, we're very much an investment-grade company, and we're going to be very focused on maintaining that investment-grade status going forward."

Well, it's a very interesting question, and I guess I'd put it 2 ways. One is touching on cloud spending. We pretty much see some of what a lot of people are seeing in comments lately, which is an improvement in cloud spending in multiple areas especially in scaling out new generation data centers as they expand their business. And we obviously benefit from that in switching, routing and some of our specific custom offload programs in AI or just Smart NICs. And we see that. But as we all know these days, cloud spending is starting to be a bit like telco spending, very lumpy. 
What we see on the other half of our business, in infrastructure, is with enterprises, end users. And here, from the viewpoint of an opportunity to see end users directly, we see end user -- enterprises or end users, who are the end users, especially the largest bunch, our core customers, their spending continues. Their IT budget is pretty strong, and their spending continues because they need that digital transformation as their business continues fairly decently. And that has not impacted, which is why our infrastructure software business renewals continue to grow very nicely, and that's not an issue. It's when we sell components to OEMs, who then make it into systems to sell to these same end users that we see a difference. And the difference is simply that I think given as far as we could gather, given the uncertainty in this environment, that everybody is constraining -- all our partners are constraining their supply chain and compressing their supply chain, so to speak. And that action of compressing is really a reduction in orders, a reduction in what appears to be demand. So it's really interesting as we see this, that on the software side, things are -- direct sales to large enterprises continue fairly unabated. But when it comes to selling components through partners to these same end users, we see a different perspective, a slowdown, a constraint. And it's reflected, obviously, in the numbers we are showing here. And it also is reflected in the outlook that we're giving to you guys."

Well, it is in that portfolio licensing arrangements as a sales model or business model we apply to our infrastructure software business, which is CA at this point, has been, in my mind, and to be fair, it's less than a year since we launched it, since we took over CA only last November. It's been, I would call it, very successful. It's been very encouraging. And a big part of why we think it is encouraging and why it works is because we just focus on the largest 500, 600 customers of CA. These are guys where we have large -- decent-sized or large footprints to begin with. And as we go towards renewals, our ability to offer a portfolio-wide licensing arrangement, unlimited capacity on the full range of products, broad product set we have that extends beyond -- from mainframe to distributed software is extremely attractive and cost effective to those large enterprises who buys a lot of those infrastructure software. So we have done multiple deals as we went through multiple renewals, and we continue to be very engaged with those companies.
So I guess my conclusion is by focusing on these largest customers with large -- where we have large footprint that exists and where the ability to consume more of those software we have, it makes up a lot of sense. And as I put in some of my comments earlier on, this ability to focus on this largest guys and put the sales motion technically and commercially very effectively on these large customers and possibly not focus on the long tail of noncore customers is a key part of the whole model and what makes the whole model work simply because conceptually, we are renewing those contracts with larger footprints on portfolio licensing agreement, as I mentioned, at a rate of over 20% annually while we are, probably because of lack of focus, reducing or [ attriting ] smaller noncore customers at 10%. And those core customers represent 80% of our overall revenue while the long tail represents only 20%, ends up in a situation after 1 year almost 1 year where we show net gains of over 10%. Keep that going, 3 years later, we reach the average term of every contract we put in place, we would see a clear step-up in our revenues from this business of, we like to believe, double-digit growth."

Looking at the third quarter. Consolidated net revenue was $5.5 billion, a 9% increase from a year ago. Semiconductor solution revenue was $4.4 billion, down 5% year-on-year and up 6% quarter-over-quarter. Networking continued to perform well driven by strong demand for our merchants switching and routing platforms. And as we also expected, shipments of custom silicon solutions in AI, Smart NIC and video transcoding to cloud data centers were strong. Wireless is, of course, seeing the beginning of a typical seasonal uptick and the initial positive effects of increased content. These tailwinds were partially offset by weaker demand in storage and broadband. 
Revenue for infrastructure software was $1.1 billion. The CA business is running above our expectation, benefiting from sustained enterprise demand for our mainframe and distributed software. However, SAN switching demand has paused as our partner OEM supply chain compressed in these uncertain conditions. 
Now let me address the current environment and outlook. Enterprise and mainframe software customer demand continues to remain stable, particularly in North America and Western Europe. SAN switching demand will likely continue to be down another quarter while inventory in the OEM channels are being worked down. As it relates to semiconductors, although the U.S.-China trade conflict continues, we have not seen further deterioration in our business, both specific to China as well as globally. Accordingly, we continue to expect to achieve over $22.5 billion of revenue in fiscal 2019, including $17.5 billion from semiconductor solutions and $5 billion from infrastructure software. 
Looking to next year. Infrastructure software is stable as renewals among our core customer base continue to be very solid. However, visibility continues to be very limited on the semiconductors side so we are managing the business with an expectation that we will continue to operate in a very low growth, uncertain macro environment for the foreseeable future. 
Fortunately, the fundamentals of our semiconductor business remain strong. As you know, our business is all about connectivity from CPUs to memory in data centers, core to edge in networks, central office to client devices in distributed systems. And here we continue to benefit from the underlying trend in the IT world an insatiable need for increasing bandwidth to connect things. In data centers, Tomahawk switching have gone from 3.2 terabits per second just 3 years ago to 12.8 terabits per second today. In cloud computing, as the limits to Moore's Law constrained CPU and GPU performance, the pipes linking computing cycles to the network and storage expense. PCI Express Gen 4 today at 16G replaces Gen 3 with the likes of next-generation Rome CPU. Legacy network interface controllers, NICs as they say, are becoming really intelligent, what we now call Smart NICs, and take on the task of accelerating workloads, offload from non-optimized CPU within cloud computing. 
Even in SAN, that's storage area network, Fibre Channel progresses its bandwidth at 32 gigabit per second in Generation 6 today to Generation 7 at 64 gigabit per second next year to reap the full benefit of all-flash arrays in enterprise storage. And to truly connect computer storage, replacing direct attach copper, fiber optics running in 100 gig -- 100G channels are moving to 400G as hyper cloud -- our hyper cloud customers scale out data centers with Tomahawk 3 today. 
Turning to telco networks. Call routing has gone from 1.6 terabits per second a few years ago to 9.6 terabits as represented by our Jericho 2 router today. In broadband, cable modem with DOCSIS 3.0 at 1 gigabit today will move to DOCSIS 4.0 at 10 gigabits over the next few years as cable operators need to compete against 5G networks. So it is with DSL, digital subscriber line, we're at a near 500 megabit per second of dataflow today. We will upshift to over 1 gigabit per second in G.fast, which may seem inadequate, so we need GPON at 2.5 gigabits. And even with that, we're poised today to launch into mass markets with 10G xPON. 
Of course, wireless connectivity too has seen the most headline. And in enterprise access gateways, the protocol has moved from 802.11ac to the new OFDMA-enabled 802.11ax, otherwise called WiFi 6. And we are at the cusp of cellular communication migrating from 4G to next-generation 5G in radio access networks and smartphones. We are enabling these fundamental trends in the marketplace. This gives us confidence that we will continue to sustain and grow our semiconductor business over the long term. 
Moving on, let's talk about software. First, the CA. As we mentioned, our model for CA is to focus on the 500 largest enterprises in the world, the biggest users of our infrastructure software. Based on experience through fiscal third quarter 2019, we expect our core customer business that's up for renewal in fiscal year 2019 to grow over 20%. Meanwhile, the attrition rate of business from the long tail of customers behind this core group is anticipated to be over 10% for fiscal 2019. We have another 2-plus years to turn over the CA customer contract, but based on the trends of renewal growth from these core customer base in excess of the attrition of noncore business over the last 9 months, we're confident that we can meet, if not exceed, the long-term revenue and profitability targets that we laid out for CA to you last year when we acquired that business. Our integration activity is largely complete with operating expenses to support CA approaching target levels. 
Finally, let me take a few more minutes to talk about our planned acquisition of the Symantec enterprise business announced in August. Acquiring Symantec furthers our efforts to build one of world's leading infrastructure technology platforms. It is the logical next step in Broadcom's infrastructure software strategy and adds $160 billion cybersecurity market to the Broadcom's addressable TAM. We will gain a portfolio of mission-critical security solutions that are deeply embedded among our core customers. There will be meaningful cross-selling opportunities with Brocade and CA solutions, and we believe this acquisition will enable Broadcom to gain a larger share of the wallet of these core customers, and we expect this transaction to add more than $2 billion of sustainable run rate revenue with its leading franchises in cybersecurity, and we also expect to achieve in excess of $1 billion in run rate cost synergies within 12 months post close. And importantly, this transaction gives us the opportunity to achieve our ongoing financial objective of double-digit cash on cash returns. The integration planning process is well underway. And as you likely saw, we cleared HSR last week. We remain on track to close the transaction in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 subject to anti-trust approvals in the European Union and Japan as well as, of course, customary closing conditions. 
To sum, a broad and increasingly diversified portfolio of leadership, technology franchises has allowed us today to sustain revenue and increase cash flows even in this challenging market environment.
Now let me turn this call over to Tom."

Consolidated net revenue for the third quarter was $5.5 billion, a 9% increase from a year ago. The semiconductor solutions segment revenue was $4.4 billion and represented 79% of our total revenue this quarter. This is down 5% year-on-",862,"Thank you, Hock. 
Consolidated net revenue for the third quarter was $5.5 billion, a 9% increase from a year ago. The semiconductor solutions segment revenue was $4.4 billion and represented 79% of our total revenue this quarter. This is down 5% year-on-year on a comparable basis. Our infrastructure software segment revenue was $1.1 billion and represented 21% of revenue. Free cash flow was 42% of revenue or $2.31 billion and grew 8.5% year-over-year. 
Let me now provide additional detail on our financial performance. Operating expenses were $1.01 billion driven by further reductions from CA-related activities. Operating income from continuing operations was $2.91 billion and represented 52.8% of net revenue. Adjusted EBITDA was $3.06 billion and represented 55.6% of net revenue. This figure excludes $141 million of depreciation. In terms of working capital, our payables increase of $237 million was somewhat offset by receivables increase of $55 million and an inventory increase of $57 million from the prior quarter. I would also note that we accrued $110 million of restructuring and integration expenses and made $164 million of cash restructuring and integration payments in the quarter. Finally, we spent $112 million on capital expenditures. 
In the third quarter, we returned $2 billion to stockholders consisting of $1.1 billion in the form of cash dividends and $977 million for the repurchase and elimination of 3.5 million AVGO shares. We ended the quarter with $5.5 billion of cash, $37.6 billion of total debt, 398 million outstanding shares and had 442 million fully diluted shares for the quarter. 
Turning to our fiscal year 2019 guidance. As Hock discussed, we are maintaining our full year revenue guidance of $22.5 billion including approximately $17.5 billion from semiconductor solutions and approximately $5 billion from infrastructure software. IP licensing is not expected to generate a material amount of revenue. On a non-GAAP basis, operating margins are expected to be approximately 52.5%. Net interest expense and other is expected to be approximately $1.3 billion. The tax rate is forecasted to be approximately 11%. Depreciation is expected to be approximately $600 million. CapEx is expected to be approximately $500 million. As a result, free cash flow is expected to be approximately $9 billion, which does take into account projected restructuring and integration charges of approximately $1.1 billion. Note, as of the end of the third quarter, $6.9 billion of free cash flow has been generated and includes $969 million of restructuring and integration charges. Stock-based compensation expense is expected to be approximately $2.2 billion, and finally, we expect average diluted share count to be 440 million for Q4, and this excludes any impact from share buybacks and eliminations.
Now onto capital allocation. As many of you know, Broadcom has a business model that generates a very healthy amount of free cash flow across an increasingly diverse and stable set of mainly infrastructure technology franchises. Over the last few years, we have worked to create a more transparent and balanced capital allocation policy. First and foremost, we have committed to return half of our free cash flow to shareholders each year in the form of cash dividends. In essence, this allows the AVGO stockholder to decide how best to reinvest 50% of the free cash flow that we generate. In return, we have, in effect, asked the Broadcom stockholder to put trust in management, to optimally reinvest the remainder of the free cash flow after the dividend is distributed. Fundamentally, we think that we have a unique M&A strategy that allows us to consistently reinvest these excess cash flows that will drive returns well above our free cash flow yields. Over the past few years, we've developed a road map primarily around infrastructure software starting with Brocade and then with CA and now Symantec that will allow us to continue to execute on the strategy for many years to come. So going forward, our plan is to use this excess cash for acquisitions and/or to pay down debt that we borrow to make these acquisitions.
Now over the last year or so, we have bought back a lot of stock. We had an opportunity to buy stock at depressed prices following the CA announcement. We also want to limit the dilution from the onetime multiyear grant we did earlier this year. In all, we have invested $13.1 billion to repurchase or eliminate a total of 54.5 million shares at an average price of approximately $240 per share over the last 16 months through the end of our fiscal Q3 '19. So in summary, we think this decision made a lot of sense. That being said, maintaining our core and capital allocation strategy of dividends and M&A while pursuing meaningful buybacks in parallel has caused us to increase our leverage and leverage multiples pretty substantially. Especially in light of the weak macro environment we are seeing today, we are conscious of the risk that a more levered balance sheet creates and are very focused on managing those risks. As a result, we have started to transition our focus to deleveraging the balance sheet following the recent Symantec acquisition announcement.
That concludes my prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions] Operator, please open up the call for questions."

But as we sit here right now over the rest of this calendar year, if not fiscal year, what we are seeing is, you're right, it appears we have hit bottom at least in the semiconductors. As it relates to the semiconductor solutions side, we have hit bottom. And we are kind of looking ahead and seeing that we're staying right here, more or less, with little seasonality that pops up every now and then as we are seeing to some extent probably in the next few months as we see ramp-up of our North American -- large North American OEM customer enhances. But other than that, broadly, we're kind of staying at the bottom."

How should we think about this build cycle for you this year prior -- relative to past years? I mean there is a view that you're gaining content on the RF side. You've got WiFi 6. Your largest customer is also not staggering their phone launch this year. They've got some tariff issues that they might want to pull in some builds. So just as you look at the results for the July quarter, were they up sequentially kind of in that mid-teens level? How do we think about October? And how long is this build? And what's the seasonal look into January? If you could give us any sort of color, that would be helpful."

And to be very specific of what you're asking in wireless, it's -- as we've always done in previous years, we see beginning of uptick seasonality in the Q3, which is the July quarter. And we'll see more of it in our last quarter of the fiscal year, which is October quarter, and we fully expect to see that. And frankly, that's as far as we see in this typical kind of outlook because it obviously depends at the end of the day on reset of our OEM customers. But we do see that this year. We do not see any major departure from that. And year-on-year, things are quite predictable in this respect. But having said that, as you know, we are a company much more than just wireless today. Even in our semiconductor solutions, we have broad areas where we participate in, and there are multiple puts and takes, as I kind of indicated in terms of what happened in Q3. While we see continuing strength in networking, computing offload in the data centers, we do see some weaknesses in storage and broadband. And it will probably -- things might probably look better next quarter for wireless, but maybe there are some other areas of mitigate -- that will go the opposite way. 
But broadly, given our large portfolio and broad diversity and the fact that we are very fundamentally strong in each of those areas we are in, which we are saying -- what we are seeing and what we are saying here is that in the semiconductor macro market, which is where we are pretty well represented on average, we are not as strong as it was same time last year. And if you look at our data so far this year-to-date, we're down probably on average about 8% year-on-year or thereabouts, which is in my view what we think what the market -- what we think the market is on a broad basis excluding memory, of course. And the fact that we were year-on-year down more in Q1, Q2 this fiscal year and probably less down in the back half of fiscal '19 should not be taken as a fact that that's a bottom and there's possibly a recovery. That's why we make the statement. We know we're pretty confident we're at the bottom. The question is there is no -- not much clarity or visibility yet or certainty that any sharp recovery is around the corner."

We touch at the handset level. We touch somewhat at radio access, but we believe we probably touch most at the backhaul, the networks. And I think each of them ramps, will ramp 5G at different times. So our perception -- our ability to see how big that ramp is at any particular point in time is also dependent on the fact that different operators in different countries will probably want to ramp up at different points in time different parts of the network, whether it's a front side ramp or the backhaul. And my guess is probably you won't see much of it until later this year, early part of next year, as far as we are concerned, which is more of the backhaul where it affects our numbers."

This is an ongoing trend, and I was using examples because these are examples ongoing that we see today, recent past and going forward in the future. But what I do see is that, yes, in all these areas we participate in, from -- as networking in data centers, routing in core and metro networks or in cable, in cable and broadband where we all are, one thing is clear, which is the nice thing we had -- we see in technology, especially the semiconductor technology. There is a constant evolution of the products we do as constant demand for improved performance or [ as I put it ] increased bandwidth [ since we do ] connectivity. And depending on the particular applications, some may spend 1 year, some may spend 3 years to make a transition. But they do happen, and they continue to happen. And that's what keeps demand sustained for our technology, for our products. And that's what underpins, as we put it, a long-term growth forecast in semiconductors for us of mid-single digits. 
And I don't mean 1 year. I don't mean necessarily even 2 or 3 years. I mean over the next 5 years, 10 years because think about it, right, in 2018 fiscal, our semiconductor business organically, take out all acquisitions, grew 12% year-on-year from '17. And in '17, we grew another -- over '16, about 10% organically. So I frankly do not expect that high of rate, double-digit rate in these fiscals where we are pretty well represented across a broad area to be able to continue at that rate of growth. And so we see in '19 a decline from a strong '18, as I said, of probably mid- to high single digits. Not unexpected but taken over a period of multiple years, we believe we have -- we will achieve that mid-single-digit compounded annual growth rate. But I won't do that every year."

In the past, that 50% dividend policy you have, it's very clear, but the free cash flow that generates that at times has been a little more subjective due to onetime charges finishing the classic Broadcom campus, et cetera. So how does restructuring charges -- how do they fit into the math of free cash flow. And then the investment grade target where you want to keep it there, what sort of leverage target should we think about with you guys more aggressively be paying down debt as opposed to repurchasing shares in the near future?"

I think on the cash flow side, Ross, what we tried to do is create somewhat of a formula because we do typically have acquisitions, we do have investments we make to get to the synergy targets. And in fact, what we're trying to do is deliver the benefits to the stockholders the year with which we are able to achieve those synergies. So what we've done is we've said, look, let's look at the free cash flow from operations, obviously includes those restructuring charges, and let's add back those for the purposes of calculating the dividends. 
So when we get to the end of the year, we'll take the cash flow from operations. We'll add back the restructuring, integration charges, and in effect -- we'll divide by 2 to get to the number that we used to calculate the dividend. This year, we don't have any specific onetime large campus initiatives or things like that, that we would also look to back out. So that should be a fairly good proxy for how we think about the dividend and the recommendation of the Board at the end of this year. In terms of investment grade, I think we talked about this before, but maintaining investment grade similar to the dividend policy is a core principle here. And I think the reason for that, and Hock and I discussed it many times internally, is it provides maximum flexibility for us to continue to pursue our strategy. It's always been very important. So over time, we had this onetime event. We bought back a bunch of stock as I talked about in the prepared remarks. That's pushed leverage up more so than we normally would. We think based on the economics and the results so far, that was the right decision. 
But we're really looking forward to going back to the playbook we pursued in the past, which is following the distribution of the dividend, we still have a lot of cash flow. And that cash flow, we think, based on our strategy, is best used for M&A because that's where the returns are most optimal. But as part of that, we often borrow money to finance those acquisitions, and then we go and pay that debt down. So I think we're going back to a more traditional playbook. And as part of that, given the size and the scale and the increasing diversity of the business and the sheer profitability and the cash flows, we're very much an investment-grade company, and we're going to be very focused on maintaining that investment-grade status going forward."

Well, it's a very interesting question, and I guess I'd put it 2 ways. One is touching on cloud spending. We pretty much see some of what a lot of people are seeing in comments lately, which is an improvement in cloud spending in multiple areas especially in scaling out new generation data centers as they expand their business. And we obviously benefit from that in switching, routing and some of our specific custom offload programs in AI or just Smart NICs. And we see that. But as we all know these days, cloud spending is starting to be a bit like telco spending, very lumpy. 
What we see on the other half of our business, in infrastructure, is with enterprises, end users. And here, from the viewpoint of an opportunity to see end users directly, we see end user -- enterprises or end users, who are the end users, especially the largest bunch, our core customers, their spending continues. Their IT budget is pretty strong, and their spending continues because they need that digital transformation as their business continues fairly decently. And that has not impacted, which is why our infrastructure software business renewals continue to grow very nicely, and that's not an issue. It's when we sell components to OEMs, who then make it into systems to sell to these same end users that we see a difference. And the difference is simply that I think given as far as we could gather, given the uncertainty in this environment, that everybody is constraining -- all our partners are constraining their supply chain and compressing their supply chain, so to speak. And that action of compressing is really a reduction in orders, a reduction in what appears to be demand. So it's really interesting as we see this, that on the software side, things are -- direct sales to large enterprises continue fairly unabated. But when it comes to selling components through partners to these same end users, we see a different perspective, a slowdown, a constraint. And it's reflected, obviously, in the numbers we are showing here. And it also is reflected in the outlook that we're giving to you guys."

Well, it is in that portfolio licensing arrangements as a sales model or business model we apply to our infrastructure software business, which is CA at this point, has been, in my mind, and to be fair, it's less than a year since we launched it, since we took over CA only last November. It's been, I would call it, very successful. It's been very encouraging. And a big part of why we think it is encouraging and why it works is because we just focus on the largest 500, 600 customers of CA. These are guys where we have large -- decent-sized or large footprints to begin with. And as we go towards renewals, our ability to offer a portfolio-wide licensing arrangement, unlimited capacity on the full range of products, broad product set we have that extends beyond -- from mainframe to distributed software is extremely attractive and cost effective to those large enterprises who buys a lot of those infrastructure software. So we have done multiple deals as we went through multiple renewals, and we continue to be very engaged with those companies.
So I guess my conclusion is by focusing on these largest customers with large -- where we have large footprint that exists and where the ability to consume more of those software we have, it makes up a lot of sense. And as I put in some of my comments earlier on, this ability to focus on this largest guys and put the sales motion technically and commercially very effectively on these large customers and possibly not focus on the long tail of noncore customers is a key part of the whole model and what makes the whole model work simply because conceptually, we are renewing those contracts with larger footprints on portfolio licensing agreement, as I mentioned, at a rate of over 20% annually while we are, probably because of lack of focus, reducing or [ attriting ] smaller noncore customers at 10%. And those core customers represent 80% of our overall revenue while the long tail represents only 20%, ends up in a situation after 1 year almost 1 year where we show net gains of over 10%. Keep that going, 3 years later, we reach the average term of every contract we put in place, we would see a clear step-up in our revenues from this business of, we like to believe, double-digit growth."

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining today. Now we concluded fiscal year 2019 with record revenue of $22.6 billion, growing 8% year-over-year despite a challenging environment. Our Semiconductor Solutions segment declined",1055,"Thank you, Bea. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining today. 
Now we concluded fiscal year 2019 with record revenue of $22.6 billion, growing 8% year-over-year despite a challenging environment. Our Semiconductor Solutions segment declined 8% year-over-year, but this was more than offset by our Infrastructure Software segment benefiting from the integration and healthy results from the CA business. 
In semiconductors, almost all product lines were down year-on-year, with one clear exception and that's networking where the existing growth drivers continue via strong momentum. In infrastructure software, renewals in our core accounts grew double digits, which more than offset the expected attrition in our noncore accounts. 
Now as we embark on fiscal 2020, I want to provide you some insight into our latest strategic assessment of our semiconductor businesses and our current view of the market. 
I also want to give you an update on our software business, including our latest Symantec acquisition. I'm sure you have seen the guidance in our earnings release today that we are headed towards $25 billion in revenue -- $25 billion in revenue in 2020. And I'll let Tom go through the details on how we get this. 
But before I turn this over to him, let me now give you the broader picture. So when we look at our Semiconductor segment today, we are increasingly thinking about it as a core and [indiscernible], semiconductor business that consists of networking, broadband and storage connectivity products, focused on enterprise service providers and cloud infrastructure. Here, we get a lot of strategic synergies and scale across our end markets with our customers and with our core silicon technology.  This, in turn, drives efficiencies in our sales, R&D and supply chain activities. 
Our Infrastructure Software businesses, which focus primarily on large enterprises are, in fact, quite complementary and enhance these core semi businesses by bringing us closer to our end customers. This gives us a natural barrier to entry and gives us comfort that we can drive sustainable revenue growth and improve profitability long term. 
Alongside these cars core semiconductor businesses, we have several valuable semiconductor businesses, they are much more standalone in nature due to their unique customers, technology and supply chain characteristics. Now this will include our wireless businesses and our industrial businesses. We don't have the same kind of synergies with this as we do in our core semi business. 
Increasingly, we view this business as more financial assets, especially in terms of capital allocation, balance sheet optimization and how we choose to leverage resources and manage the company. 
Turning to our current assessment for call semi business is extremely positive. We believe we are uniquely positioned with an industry leading portfolio, extending connectivity across enterprise, telco and cloud, in data center switching and routing. We're enabling the cloud. With the transition to 400-gigabit per second. 
We also just announced 800 gigabits per second, which further demonstrates our leadership in this space by far. 
In 5G cellular infrastructure, we are leveraging our ethernet technology to bring the network to the Edge in open [indiscernible], all regulated sales networks. Through a combination of custom and standard products across both and long and digital domains. 
And as we know, smallest loans for computing starts to slow down as it has. We continue to gain momentum in developing and delivering [indiscernible] when accelerates to offload computing for the cloud service providers across an increasing variety of workloads. 
Initially, with virtualization, hypervisors and extending today to AI, security, encryption and video transcoding. And in wireless, excess in enterprise and home gateways, we are, of course, leading the market transition to WiFi 6. 
And finally, we actually do have now an organic integrated silicon photonics effort underway, combining our capabilities in switching, with a strong legacy in fiber optics for next-generation cloud and networking architectures. 
So in summary, we plan to increase our investment of cost semiconductor businesses to position ourselves for expected future growth opportunities, where we can leverage our scale of investment industry-leading focus execution and breadth of IP. Now we all know, it has been a tough year for semiconductors in general. We file semiconductor segment down approximately 8% as I indicated, but if you look at our core semi business, as I define it, it has held up reasonably well. To put some numbers around it, this business did a little over $11 billion in sales in 2019, which was down just less than 4% from 2018. 
Creating this business is stabilizing. And we believe given the growth drivers I just highlighted over the next several years that this business can actually grow 6% to 8% annually. 
Turning to infrastructure software. We started a few years ago with Brocade,  storage area networking switch business. Then we acquired CA, which is a leading independent provider of mainframe tools and we just closed on Symantec, the leading enterprise security software provider in November. 
Our Brocade acquisitions was predicated on view that a fiber channel [indiscernible] switching market for large enterprises was sustainable, and then we could just grow our leadership position with additional investment. And after a couple of years now, still clear, this investment thesis was right. 
Similarly, we bought CA because we felt the mainframe market for the launch of enterprises was stable. And, in fact, growing. And [indiscernible] seeing was critical to customers who rely on mainframe surround the business. It's still early innings 1 year now, just over 1 year, but mainframe compute is growing with our target customers. We are increasing investments in mainframes to support our leadership position. 
The CA customer transition continues with core accounts growing double digits while non-core accounts are treated as we had planned. We expect Symantec to start with 1.8 billion of calls, sustainable incremental annual run rate revenue that we believe we can grow to over $2 billion over the next 3 years. 
Our Infrastructure Software segment is becoming more predictable with ratable recurring revenue contribution from CA and now also with Symantec. And we anticipate over $7 billion infrastructure software revenue in fiscal 2020. 
In summary, therefore, our long-term plan for this company is to advance in organic growth in our core semi business, while continuing to scale up our infrastructure software business through disciplined and highly accretive acquisitions. 
Now let me turn the call over to Tom."

Let me start with a review of our fourth quarter and fiscal 2019 results. I'll then spend some time discussing our outlook for fiscal 2020, after which we will open up the call for questions. Consolidated net revenue for the fourth quar",1370,"Thank you, Hock. Let me start with a review of our fourth quarter and fiscal 2019 results. I'll then spend some time discussing our outlook for fiscal 2020, after which we will open up the call for questions. 
Consolidated net revenue for the fourth quarter was $5.8 billion, a 6% increase from a year ago. Semiconductor Solutions revenue was $4.6 billion and represented 79% of our total revenue this quarter. This is down 7% year-on-year and up 5% quarter-over-quarter. 
On a sequential basis, networking sustained, driven by an uptick in our custom silicon solutions. Storage also held up, driven by increased demand for high-capacity drives. This was offset by increased volatility in broadband, especially as the market prepares for the Wi-Fi 6 transition. 
And as is typical in our fourth fiscal quarter, wireless was seasonally up. Revenue for the infrastructure software segment was $1.2 billion and represented 21% of revenue. The CA business continues to perform well. Sand switching demand remains muted as our partner OEM supply chain continues to compress. 
That being said, the SAN switching business was up from the Q3 low points and the market for these products looks to be stabilizing. 
Looking down at P&L sequentially. Gross margins dropped given the seasonal mix shift to wireless in our semi business, while operating expenses remained relatively flat at just over $1 billion. 
Operating income from continuous operations was $3 billion and represented 52.3% of net revenue. Adjusted EBITDA was $3.2 billion and represented 54.8% of net revenue. This figure excludes $143 million of depreciation. 
I would also note that we accrued $119 million of restructuring and integration expenses and made $150 million of cash restructuring integration payments in the quarter. These expenses and payments are primarily related to CA. 
We spent $96 million on capital expenditures and free cash flow represented 41% of revenue or $2.4 billion. 
In the quarter, we returned $1.6 billion to our common stockholders, including $1.1 billion of cash dividends. 
As we previewed when we announced the Symantec deal in Q4, we initiated the transition from stock buybacks to debt repayment. In the quarter, we invested $587 million for the repurchase and elimination of 2.1 million AVGO shares. However, we also paid down $4.8 billion of debt with proceeds from our preferred stock offering and excess cash flow. We ended the quarter with $5.1 billion of cash, $32.8 billion of total debt, 398 million outstanding common shares and 444 million fully diluted shares for the quarter. 
Now let's recap performance for the full fiscal year 2019. Our revenue hit a new record of $22.6 billion, growing 8% year-on-year. Semiconductor solutions revenue was $17.4 billion, down 8% year-over-year. 
As Hock reviewed, revenue from our core semiconductor business, which does not include wireless and industrial was down 4%. Infrastructure software revenue was $5.2 billion, which included $3.4 billion from CA mainframe and enterprise and $1.8 billion from Brocade SAN switching. 
Gross margin for the year was a record high of 71%, up from 67% a year ago. The addition of CA as well as the beneficial mix in some of your product sales drove the gross margin expansion. 
Additionally, operating expenses expanded to $4.1 billion with the addition of CA, offset by lower annual performance bonus amounts relative to 2018. 
Operating income from continuing operations was $11.9 billion, up 14.4% year-over-year and represented 52.8% of net revenue. Adjusted EBITDA was $12.6 billion, up 13.5% year-over-year and represented 55.7% of net revenue. This figure excludes $569 million of depreciation. 
I would also note that we accrued $1.1 billion of restructuring integration expenses and made $883 million of cash restructuring integration payments in fiscal 2019. 
We spent $432 million on capital expenditures and free cash flow represented 41% of revenue or $9.3 billion. Free cash flow grew 12.4% year-over-year. 
For the year, we returned $10.6 billion to our common stockholders, consisting of $4.2 billion in the form of cash dividends and $6.4 billion for the repurchase and elimination of 24.5 million AVGO shares. 
Okay. So now let's look ahead to fiscal 2020. The outlook for our business is as follows. In the Semiconductor Solutions segment, we expect to achieve approximately $18 billion in revenue. Let me unpack this a bit. We expect our core semiconductor business to deliver approximately $12 billion in revenues in 2020, which would represent approximately 7% growth compared to 2019. Our wireless businesses, which let me remind everybody consists of 3 primary product lines: one is RF; the other is WiFi Bluetooth combos; and finally, our mixed signal custom products, which we sell almost exclusively to 1 of our large smartphone customers. 
RF, which represented approximately $2.2 billion of revenues in fiscal 2019 is expected to grow high single digits given the initial ramp in 5G phones. 
Wi-Fi Bluetooth combos, which was approximately $2.2 billion in fiscal 2019 is expected to be down low single digits. The adoption of new Wi-Fi 6 solutions at our 2 large smartphone customers will be offset by the completion of our movement away from non-core, lower margin legacy Wi-Fi business which will adversely impact this product line 2022 revenues. 
Finally, our mixed signal custom product line, which was approximately $1.1 billion in fiscal 2019 is expected to drop to less than $500 million in fiscal 2020. The reduction in revenues here is driven by a change in architecture and our primary smartphone customer as well as our decision to reduce our investment in this area and focus our engineering resources on more sustainable and profitable activities in our core semi business. 
Finally, industrial, which consists primarily of opto electronic power management and sensing product lines, we expect business will stabilize and recover in fiscal '20 after a challenging fiscal 2019 And  to contribute approximately $1 billion in revenues. 
Switching to the Software segment. As Hock reviewed, we expect the business to grow to approximately $7 billion. Symantec is expected to contribute approximately $1.8 billion, including the effects of purchase accounting, while CA and the Brocade are expected to be relatively flat to up slightly. 
So on a consolidated basis, we are forecasting net revenue to be approximately $25 billion, excuse me, plus or minus $500 million for fiscal 2020. 
One housekeeping item, our IP intellectual property segment will be included in our Semi Solutions segment going forward, given this business represented a material amount of revenue. We will, therefore, have 2 reporting segments in fiscal '20, Semiconductor Solutions and Infrastructure Software. 
Turning to our fiscal year 2020 guidance on a non-GAAP basis, operating margins and adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to be relatively flat in fiscal '20. There are a number of specific headwinds, as. Hock discussed, we are increasing our investment near-term in our core semi business to take advantage of growth opportunities we see there. We're also in a transition year with Symantec, given effective purchase accounting near-term and onetime expenses tied to the transition services agreement in place with Norton Lifelock. 
And finally, we will have a headwind from our bonus accrual we're setting a target, which impacts 2020. 
Looking beyond fiscal '20, we expect to continue to expand our operating margins organically and are targeting 55% by fiscal 2022. 
Now on to capital allocation. We remain committed to returning approximately 50% of our prior year free cash flow to stockholders in the form of cash dividends. With that, on the dividend based on approximately $9 billion of free cash flow after M&A and related items that we generated in fiscal 2019, we are increasing our target quarterly common stock cash dividend starting this quarter of $3.25 per share. This constitutes an increase of 23%. We plan to maintain this dividend payout throughout the year subject to quarterly board approval, which means we plan to pay out just over $5 billion in cash dividends in fiscal '20. 
Consistent with our capital allocation policy, we will reassess the dividend this time next year based on our fiscal '20 free cash flow from operations results. 
In addition, we plan to pay down approximately $4 billion in debt in fiscal '20 as part of our commitment to maintain our investment-grade credit rating. 
That concludes my prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions] Operator, please open up the call for questions."

You have Tomahawk, Triangulo, your compute and security acceleration, ASICs and the new optical connectivity portfolio, there was a bit of pause in cloud spending in the first half of this year, but it looks like that, that is starting to reaccelerate and looking to be strong in 2020. You also have the start of the 400-gig upgrade cycle. So for fiscal '20, how do you see the dis-center part of your semi franchise performing relative to 2019? Is this going to be another strong year? 
And then just secondarily, one of your customers, Cisco, just announced that they're getting into the merchant silicon market for cloud networking. You guys have a strong position here. And in fact, has helped these guys, both merchant and ASIC on their networking platform, it would be great to get your views on this customer now as a potential competitor?"

And there are 2 parts to each of these, as you know, there's the cloud guys, service provider and the cloud guys, and there is the more traditional enterprise. And we see spending in the cloud guys, as you correctly pointed out, stepping up more and more in 2020. We've seen some of it this year, calendar -- in the later part of calendar '19 in investment in storage, and we will start to see in 2020, spending on networking to start ramping up, especially with regard to 200 gigabit and 400 gigabit, especially in the second half of the year, which will be great for us because of our product portfolio, Tomahawk 3 and Trident 4 in these areas as well as, of course, the spine. 
So to us, we see 2020 as continued growth momentum basically in our data center business, especially when it relates to cloud. In enterprise, we are not so sure. Enterprise has clearly taken a pause second half of '19, calendar '19, and we see that pause probably continuing for a while into '20 before possibly in our thinking slowly recovering later half of 2020 for enterprise. And that's a -- there's a clear difference in the spending. And with respect to one of our very good customers coming into merchant silicon with the recent announcement, I think yesterday on 1 silicon or the silicon 1 and route 8000, I think it's  -- we welcome that because it validates a couple of things we've been pushing for years. One of which is that there will be and there has been and will be more and more disaggregation of software, the operating system from Hotwire, the silicon, the chip that supports it. There will be more and more disaggregation. As you know, traditionally, it's all wrapped into a black box as one. That disaggregation path has, obviously, been pushed and we have enabled them by the cloud guys, a hyper cloud guys. And we have been very successful enabling it, and that's great. So the fact that Cisco has joined it, in our view, validates the model, the trend we have been pushing, And it's great to see that we're right in that regard. 
So we'll welcome the competition. I just want to add this morning to cloud that we're seeing that happen. It's also in enterprise, traditional enterprise, particularly some of the large telcos, who you classify as cloud, too, and I don't need to mention name, but a few of the very large telcos, both in North America and in Europe, are also pushing down that path with us very, very closely. And the -- and some of them are very far along, especially we're using our Jericho 2 router,to enable it. And talking of Jericho 2 router, which we're using today to enable the path of those telcos, enterprises towards disaggregation of hardware and software has been around, and we've been shipping it for over a year, and that runs 10 terabits per second. The same bandwidth as silicon 1 announced yesterday. 
And earlier this week, we announced as a future successor, 25.6 terabits per second switching and multi. And that's where we're pushing a 2.5x, the performance of what just came out."

Obviously, networking is, especially merchant silicon and networking has been a very strong driver. And particularly so in latter part of '19 when enterprise spending slowed down and stabilized, but it definitely slowed down. But cloud starts to recover and the various -- the portfolio had various positions we have product portfolio we have in all these areas,allows us on balance to mitigate quite a bit this slowdown. And the big one, [ one ] of the biggest areas that [announced ] mitigation to any slowdown in networking, as you've seen, is compute offload. Here, this is very much a cloud spend. And the biggest area of mitigation, it continues to be AI. We ship AI chips, provides 1 of the biggest segments for opportunities, I should say, for compute outlook business. And this is a real business now. We're shipping several hundred million dollars a year and growing of these AI chips. 
We are also starting in March in a few other areas as in virtualization or hypervisor, we all typically cost monthly. And that we're starting to happen. And that's also in flow and in enterprise, the move towards higher than performance mix is also helping clients that. 
So there's a whole [ slew ] of things in data centers that mitigate each other. Having said that, in 2019, especially second half broadband. And we are investing in this area. The video delivery in cable in which DSL, digital subscriber line copper, or PON, fiber to the home, slowed down second half of '19. We're now seeing, as we approach the end of the year, a lot of momentum as telcos simply recover their spending in broadband, and we're seeing a very sharp recovery. When all this mix put together, broadband, we see as far as a market that's very stable, go through cycles with an underlying push on WiFi access as more and more of this excess gateways are now  deploying while WiFi, as I say, especially the next-generation Wi-Fi 6. So that creates a little degree of growth. 
But broadband in general, stable, go through a cycle and sometimes will offset but the data center networking business is a secular growth area, and that's why we talked about stepping up our investment in this area. And that's the other reason we want to highlight on the call that we are actually investing, increasing a level of investment as a percent of revenue, as an example, in this particular area. And that includes our foray into silicon photonics, which is intended to enable integration of the silicon switch, together with fiber optic interconnects as we move from 25.6 gigabit per second routing to the next-gen 2 years from now, 51 terabit per second. It's so high density, I think we need that integration, and we're preparing towards that [indiscernible]."

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining today. Now we concluded fiscal year 2019 with record revenue of $22.6 billion, growing 8% year-over-year despite a challenging environment.

Now we concluded fiscal year 2019 with record revenue of $22.6 billion, growing 8% year-over-year despite a challenging environment. Our semiconductor solutions segment declined 8% year-over-year, but this was more than offset by our infrastructure software segment benefiting from the integration and healthy results from the CA business.
In semiconductors, almost all product lines were down year-on-year, with one clear exception, and that's networking, where the existing growth drivers continue their strong momentum. In infrastructure software, renewals in our core accounts grew double digits, which more than offset the expected attrition in our noncore accounts. 
Now as we embark on fiscal 2020, I want to provide you some insight into our latest strategic assessment of our semiconductor businesses and our current view of the market. I also want to give you an update on our software business, including our latest Symantec acquisition. I'm sure you have seen the guidance in our earnings release today that we are headed towards $25 billion in revenue -- $25 billion in revenue in 2020. And I'll let Tom go through the details on how we get there. 
But before I turn this over to him, let me now give you the broader picture. So when we look at our semiconductor segment today, we are increasingly thinking about it as a core and fabless semiconductor business that consists of networking, broadband and storage connectivity products, focused on enterprise service providers and cloud infrastructure. Here, we get a lot of strategic synergies and scale across our end markets with our customers and with our core silicon technology. This, in turn, drives efficiencies in our sales, R&D and supply chain activities. 
Our infrastructure software businesses, which focus primarily on large enterprises are, in fact, quite complementary and enhance these core semi businesses by bringing us closer to our end customers. This gives us a natural barrier to entry and gives us comfort that we can drive sustainable revenue growth and improve profitability long term. 
Alongside these core semiconductor businesses, we have several valuable semiconductor businesses that are much more stand-alone in nature due to their unique customers, technology and supply chain characteristics. Now this will include our wireless businesses and our industrial businesses. We don't have the same kind of synergies with this as we do in our core semi business. 
Increasingly, we view this business as more financial assets, especially in terms of capital allocation, balance sheet optimization and how we choose to leverage resources and manage the company. 
Turning to our current assessment for core semi business. It's extremely positive. We believe we are uniquely positioned with an industry-leading portfolio, extending connectivity across enterprise, telcos and cloud, in data center switching and routing. We're enabling the cloud with the transition to 400-gigabit per second. We also just announced 800-gigabit per second, which further demonstrates our leadership in this space by far. 
In 5G cellular infrastructure, we are leveraging our ethernet technology to bring the network to the Edge in open RAN or radio access networks through a combination of custom and standard products across both analog and digital domains. 
And as we know, as Moore's Law for computing starts to slow down as it has, we continue to gain momentum in developing and delivering hardware accelerators to offload computing for the cloud service providers across an increasing variety of workloads, initially with virtualization, hypervisors and expanding today to AI, security, encryption and video transcoding. And in wireless access in enterprise and home gateways, we are of course leading the market transition to WiFi 6. 
And finally, we actually do have now an organic integrated silicon photonics effort underway, combining our capabilities in switching with our strong legacy in fiber optics for next-generation cloud and networking architectures. 
So in summary, we plan to increase our investment in our core semiconductor businesses to position ourselves for expected future growth opportunities, where we can leverage our scale of investment, industry-leading focused execution and breadth of IP. Now we all know it has been a tough year for semiconductors in general. We -- our semiconductor segment is down approximately 8% as I indicated, but if you look at our core semi business, as I define it, it has held up reasonably well. To put some numbers around it, this business did a little over $11 billion in sales in 2019, which was down just less than 4% from 2018. 
We think this business is stabilizing. And we believe given the growth drivers I just highlighted over the next several years that this business can actually grow 6% to 8% annually. 
Turning to infrastructure software. We started a few years ago with Brocade, storage area networking switch business. Then we acquired CA, which is a leading independent provider of mainframe tools, and we just closed on Symantec, the leading enterprise security software provider in November. 
Our Brocade acquisition was predicated on view that a fiber channel SAN switching market for large enterprises was sustainable and that we could just grow our leadership position with additional investment. And after a couple of years now, it's clear this investment thesis was right. 
Similarly, we bought CA because we felt the mainframe market for the launch of enterprises was stable and, in fact, growing, and that CA was critical to customers who rely on mainframe to run their business. It's still early innings 1 year now, just over 1 year, but mainframe compute is growing with our target customers. We are increasing investments in mainframes to support our leadership position. 
The CA customer transition continues with core accounts growing double digits while noncore accounts attrit as we had planned. We expect Symantec to start with $1.8 billion of core sustainable incremental annual run rate revenue that we believe we can grow to over $2 billion over the next 3 years. 
Our infrastructure software segment is becoming more predictable with ratable recurring revenue contribution from CA and now also with Symantec. And we anticipate over $7 billion infrastructure software revenue in fiscal 2020. 
In summary, therefore, our long-term plan for this company is to advance in organic growth in our core semi business while continuing to scale up our infrastructure software business through disciplined and highly accretive acquisitions. 
Now let me turn the call over to Tom."

Let me start with a review of our fourth quarter and fiscal 2019 results. I'll then spend some time discussing our outlook for fiscal 2020, after which we will open up the call for questions. Consolidated net revenue for the fourth quar",1364,"Thank you, Hock. Let me start with a review of our fourth quarter and fiscal 2019 results. I'll then spend some time discussing our outlook for fiscal 2020, after which we will open up the call for questions. 
Consolidated net revenue for the fourth quarter was $5.8 billion, a 6% increase from a year ago. Semiconductor solutions revenue was $4.6 billion and represented 79% of our total revenue this quarter. This is down 7% year-on-year and up 5% quarter-over-quarter. 
On a sequential basis, networking sustained driven by an uptick in our custom silicon solutions. Storage also held up driven by increased demand for high-capacity drives. This was offset by increased volatility in broadband, especially as the market prepares for the WiFi 6 transition. 
And as is typical in our fourth fiscal quarter, wireless was seasonally up. Revenue for the infrastructure software segment was $1.2 billion and represented 21% of revenue. The CA business continues to perform well. SAN switching demand remains muted as our partner OEM supply chain continues to compress. 
That being said, the SAN switching business was up from the Q3 low points, and the market for these products looks to be stabilizing. 
Looking down the P&L sequentially. Gross margins dropped given the seasonal mix shift to wireless in our semi business, while operating expenses remained relatively flat at just over $1 billion. 
Operating income from continuous operations was $3 billion and represented 52.3% of net revenue. Adjusted EBITDA was $3.2 billion and represented 54.8% of net revenue. This figure excludes $143 million of depreciation. 
I would also note that we accrued $119 million of restructuring/integration expenses and made $150 million of cash restructuring/integration payments in the quarter. These expenses and payments are primarily related to CA. 
We spent $96 million on capital expenditures, and free cash flow represented 41% of revenue or $2.4 billion. 
In the quarter, we returned $1.6 billion to our common stockholders, including $1.1 billion of cash dividends. 
As we previewed when we announced the Symantec deal, in Q4, we initiated the transition from stock buybacks to debt repayment. In the quarter, we invested $587 million for the repurchase and elimination of 2.1 million AVGO shares. However, we also paid down $4.8 billion of debt with proceeds from our preferred stock offering and excess cash flow. We ended the quarter with $5.1 billion of cash, $32.8 billion of total debt, 398 million outstanding common shares and 444 million fully diluted shares for the quarter. 
Now let's recap performance for the full fiscal year 2019. Our revenue hit a new record of $22.6 billion, growing 8% year-on-year. Semiconductor solutions revenue was $17.4 billion, down 8% year-over-year. 
As Hock reviewed, revenue from our core semiconductor business, which does not include wireless and industrial, was down 4%. Infrastructure software revenue was $5.2 billion, which included $3.4 billion from CA mainframe and enterprise and $1.8 billion from Brocade SAN switching. 
Gross margin for the year was a record high of 71%, up from 67% a year ago. The addition of CA as well as the beneficial mix in semiconductor product sales drove the gross margin expansion. 
Additionally, operating expenses expanded to $4.1 billion with the addition of CA, offset by lower annual performance bonus amounts relative to 2018. 
Operating income from continuing operations was $11.9 billion, up 14.4% year-over-year and represented 52.8% of net revenue. Adjusted EBITDA was $12.6 billion, up 13.5% year-over-year and represented 55.7% of net revenue. This figure excludes $569 million of depreciation. 
I would also note that we accrued $1.1 billion of restructuring/integration expenses and made $883 million of cash restructuring/integration payments in fiscal 2019. We spent $432 million on capital expenditures, and free cash flow represented 41% of revenue or $9.3 billion. Free cash flow grew 12.4% year-over-year. 
For the year, we returned $10.6 billion to our common stockholders, consisting of $4.2 billion in the form of cash dividends and $6.4 billion for the repurchase and elimination of 24.5 million AVGO shares. 
Okay. So now let's look ahead to fiscal 2020. The outlook for our business is as follows. In the semiconductor solutions segment, we expect to achieve approximately $18 billion in revenue. Let me unpack this a bit. We expect our core semiconductor business to deliver approximately $12 billion in revenues in 2020, which would represent approximately 7% growth compared to 2019. Our wireless businesses which, let me remind everybody, consists of 3 primary product lines: one is RF; the other is WiFi/Bluetooth combos; and finally, our mixed signal custom products, which we sell almost exclusively to one of our large smartphone customers. 
RF, which represented approximately $2.2 billion of revenues in fiscal 2019 is expected to grow high single digits given the initial ramp in 5G phones. 
WiFi/Bluetooth combos, which was approximately $2.2 billion in fiscal 2019, is expected to be down low single digits. The adoption of new WiFi 6 solutions at our 2 large smartphone customers will be offset by the completion of our movement away from noncore, lower-margin legacy WiFi business, which will adversely impact this product line's 2022 revenues. 
Finally, our mixed signal custom product line, which was approximately $1.1 billion in fiscal 2019, is expected to drop to less than $500 million in fiscal 2020. The reduction in revenues here is driven by a change in architecture at our primary smartphone customer as well as our decision to reduce our investment in this area and focus our engineering resources on more sustainable and profitable activities in our core semi business. 
Finally, industrial, which consists primarily of optoelectronic power management and sensing product lines, we expect business will stabilize and recover in fiscal '20 after a challenging fiscal 2019 and to contribute approximately $1 billion in revenues. 
Switching to the software segment. As Hock reviewed, we expect the business to grow to approximately $7 billion. Symantec is expected to contribute approximately $1.8 billion, including the effects of purchase accounting, while CA and Brocade are expected to be relatively flat to up slightly. 
So on a consolidated basis, we are forecasting net revenue to be approximately $20 billion -- $25 billion, excuse me, plus or minus $500 million for fiscal 2020. 
One housekeeping item, our IP or intellectual property segment will be included in our semi solutions segment going forward given this business represented a material amount of revenue. We will therefore have 2 reporting segments in fiscal '20, semiconductor solutions and infrastructure software. 
Turning to our fiscal year 2020 guidance. On a non-GAAP basis, operating margins and adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to be relatively flat in fiscal '20. There are a number of specific headwinds. As Hock discussed, we are increasing our investment near term in our core semi business to take advantage of growth opportunities we see there. We're also in a transition year with Symantec given effective purchase accounting near term and onetime expenses tied to the transition services agreement in place with Norton LifeLock. And finally, we will have a headwind from our bonus accrual, we're setting a target, which impacts 2020. 
Looking beyond fiscal '20, we expect to continue to expand our operating margins organically and are targeting 55% by fiscal 2022. 
Now on to capital allocation. We remain committed to returning approximately 50% of our prior year free cash flow to stockholders in the form of cash dividends. With that, on the dividend, based on approximately $9 billion of free cash flow after M&A and related items that we generated in fiscal 2019, we are increasing our target quarterly common stock cash dividend starting this quarter to $3.25 per share. This constitutes an increase of 23%. We plan to maintain this dividend payout throughout the year, subject to quarterly Board approval, which means we plan to pay out just over $5 billion in cash dividends in fiscal '20. 
Consistent with our capital allocation policy, we will reassess the dividend this time next year based on our fiscal '20 free cash flow from operations results. 
In addition, we plan to pay down approximately $4 billion in debt in fiscal '20 as part of our commitment to maintain our investment-grade credit rating. 
That concludes my prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions] Operator, please open up the call for questions."

There was a bit of pause in cloud spending in the first half of this year, but it looks like that, that is starting to reaccelerate and looking to be strong in 2020. You also have the start of the 400-gig upgrade cycle. So for fiscal '20, how do you see the data center part of your semi franchise performing relative to 2019? Is this going to be another strong year? 
And then just secondarily, one of your customers, Cisco, just announced that they're getting into the merchant silicon market for cloud networking. You guys have a strong position here and, in fact, have helped these guys, both merchant and ASIC on their networking platform. It would be great to get your views on this customer now as a potential competitor."

And there are 2 parts to each of these, as you know. There's the cloud guys, service provider, the cloud guys, and there is the more traditional enterprise. And we see spending in the cloud guys, as you correctly pointed out, stepping up more and more in 2020. We've seen some of it this year, calendar -- in the later part of calendar '19 in investment in storage, and we will start to see in 2020 spending on networking to start ramping up, especially with regard to 200-gigabit and 400-gigabit, especially in the second half of the year, which will be great for us because of our product portfolio, Tomahawk 3 and even Trident 4, in these areas as well as, of course, the spine.
So to us, we see 2020 as continuing growth momentum basically in our data center business, especially when it relates to cloud. In enterprise, we are not so sure. Enterprise has clearly taken a pause second half of '19, calendar '19, and we see that pause probably continuing for a while into '20 before possibly, in our thinking, slowly recovering later half of 2020 for enterprise. And that's -- there's a clear difference in the spending. And with respect to one of our very good customers turning into -- coming into merchant silicon with the recent announcement, I think yesterday, on One Silicon -- or the Silicon One and the Router 8000, I think it's -- we welcome that because it validates a couple of things we've been pushing for years. One of which is that there will be and there has been and will be more and more disaggregation of software, the operating system, from hardware, the silicon, the chip that supports it. There will be more and more disaggregation. As you know, traditionally, it's all wrapped into a black box as one. That disaggregation path has obviously been pushed, and we have enabled that by the cloud guys, the hypercloud guys. And we have been very successful enabling it, and that's great. So the fact that Cisco has joined it, in our view, validates the model, the trend we have been pushing. And it's great to see that we're right in that regard. So we'll welcome the competition. 
I just want to add it's not only in cloud that we're seeing that happen. It's also in enterprise, traditional enterprise, particularly some of the large telcos who you classify as cloud, too, and I don't need to mention names, but a few of the very large telcos, both in North America and in Europe are also pushing down that path with us very, very closely. And they're very -- and some of them are very far along, especially we're using our Jericho 2 router to enable it. And talking of which, that Jericho 2 router, which we're using today to enable the path of those telcos, enterprises towards disaggregation of hardware and software, has been around, and we've been shipping it for over a year. And that runs 10 terabits per second. The same bandwidth as Silicon One announced yesterday. 
And earlier this week, we announced as a future successor 25.6-terabit per second switching and routing. And that's where we're pushing now, 2.5x the performance of what just came out."

And it gives you a sense how powerful those technology and franchises are that they can stand-alone, fairly large size in these markets. But as we look at all our portfolio companies, they are assets and franchises and where we particularly highlight for this purposes of this review while we pull out cost and misses. There's a lot of synergies. There's a lot of push in data centers, networking, and it covers both cloud and enterprises and covers both hardware and increasingly software operating systems like eventually even infrastructure software. And we want to highlight that difference and highlight the difference, in particular, to show you that in those core areas of data centers, we don't drop as much as the marketplace, as we saw in 2019, where year-on-year organically, we're down only 4%. And that we expect some -- in 2020 to actually grow -- recover fairly quickly to mid- to high single digits year-on-year. Very fast in this end market because the environment is -- the market environment is good. And we lead it by a long shot. We lead in providing the technology, which is another interesting thing between selling systems and selling components. Components, be it software, be it semiconductor solution, is driven a lot by technology, good, strong technology which can be applied to allow customers to create differentiated systems. 
Selling systems, in software, is very much a relationship business, a very embedded software, where the key is service and support as opposed to technology and -- to get to that difference. But that's really what we're trying to show here. That's why we highlight the strength of our core semiconductor network franchise."

On our core semiconductor business, touching on the first part of it, obviously networking is -- especially merchant silicon in networking has been a very strong driver. And particularly so in latter part of '19 when enterprise spending slowed down, and it has stabilized, but it definitely slowed down. And -- but cloud starts to recover, and the various -- the portfolio, the various positions we have -- product portfolio we have in all these areas allows us on balance to mitigate quite a bit this slowdown. And the big one -- the biggest area that allows mitigation to any slowdown in networking, as you've seen, is compute offload. Here, this is very much a cloud spend. And the biggest area of mitigation, it continues to be AI. We ship AI chips, provides one of the biggest segments for compute -- opportunities, I should say, for compute offload business. And this is a real business now. We're shipping several hundred million dollars a year and growing of these AI chips. 
We are also starting in March in a few other areas as in virtualization or hypervisor, we all typically call Smart NIC. But that, we're starting to see happen. And that's also in cloud. And in enterprise, the move towards higher bandwidth mix, performance mix, is also helping clients there. 
So there's a whole slew of things in data centers that mitigate each other. Having said that, in 2019, especially second half, broadband. We are very big in this area. The video delivery in cable in -- which is DSL, digital subscriber line copper, or PON, fiber to the home, slowed down second half '19. We're now seeing, as we approach the end of the year, a lot of great momentum as telcos seem to recover their spending in broadband, and we're seeing a very sharp recovery. When all this mix is put together, broadband, we see as far as a market, that's very stable, go through cycles with an underlying push on WiFi access as more and more of this access gateways are now deploying WiFi, as I say, especially the next-generation WiFi 6. So that creates a little degree of growth. 
But broadband in general, stable, goes through cycles and sometimes will offset it. But the data center networking business is a secular growth area, and that's why we talked about stepping up our investment in this area. And that's the other reason we want to highlight on the call, that we are actually investing, increasing the level of investment as a percent of revenue, as an example, in this particular area. And that includes our foray into silicon photonics, which is intended to enable integration of the silicon switch, together with fiber optic interconnects as we move from 25.6-gigabit per second routing to the next gen -- 2 years from now, 51-terabit per second. It's so high density. I think we need that integration, and we're preparing towards that direction."

And I indicated in my opening remarks, and we've been very specific in the base station as a best example. I call it radio access network. It's really -- another term is base station. And the base station for 5G networks to improve latency, to improve density throughput, the architect, the operators are pushing the network, the backhaul, all the network that takes a signal from the base station, they're pushing that right to the edge, which is into the base station. In other words, ethernet is likely to be under open RAN, the open base RAN, we'll push as far as possible into the radios. And you really run the entire line end-to-end as much as you can on ethernet. 
Even CPRI, which is typically the protocol that's used between the radio -- in the radio is now being minimized and squeezed out as opposed to just running a common higher bandwidth ethernet, which is, by the way, plays right up to our switching strength, routing and switching strength. So we are very engaged now with OEMs in those -- infrastructure side, in developing, testing and working on the key elements within the base station.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining today. Now we concluded fiscal year 2019 with record revenue of $22.6 billion, growing 8% year-over-year despite a challenging environment.

Now we concluded fiscal year 2019 with record revenue of $22.6 billion, growing 8% year-over-year despite a challenging environment. Our semiconductor solutions segment declined 8% year-over-year, but this was more than offset by our infrastructure software segment benefiting from the integration and healthy results from the CA business.
In semiconductors, almost all product lines were down year-on-year, with one clear exception, and that's networking, where the existing growth drivers continue their strong momentum. In infrastructure software, renewals in our core accounts grew double digits, which more than offset the expected attrition in our noncore accounts. 
Now as we embark on fiscal 2020, I want to provide you some insight into our latest strategic assessment of our semiconductor businesses and our current view of the market. I also want to give you an update on our software business, including our latest Symantec acquisition. I'm sure you have seen the guidance in our earnings release today that we are headed towards $25 billion in revenue -- $25 billion in revenue in 2020. And I'll let Tom go through the details on how we get there. 
But before I turn this over to him, let me now give you the broader picture. So when we look at our semiconductor segment today, we are increasingly thinking about it as a core and fabless semiconductor business that consists of networking, broadband and storage connectivity products, focused on enterprise service providers and cloud infrastructure. Here, we get a lot of strategic synergies and scale across our end markets with our customers and with our core silicon technology. This in turn drives efficiencies in our sales, R&D and supply chain activities. 
Our infrastructure software businesses, which focus primarily on large enterprises are, in fact, quite complementary and enhance these core semi businesses by bringing us closer to our end customers. This gives us a natural barrier to entry and gives us comfort that we can drive sustainable revenue growth and improve profitability long term. 
Alongside these core semiconductor businesses, we have several valuable semiconductor businesses that are much more stand-alone in nature due to their unique customers, technology and supply chain characteristics. Now this will include our wireless businesses and our industrial businesses. We don't have the same kind of synergies with this as we do in our core semi business. 
Increasingly, we view this business as more financial assets, especially in terms of capital allocation, balance sheet optimization and how we choose to leverage resources and manage the company. 
Turning to our current assessment for our core semi business, it's extremely positive. We believe we are uniquely positioned with an industry-leading portfolio, extending connectivity across enterprise, telcos and cloud, in data center switching and routing. We're enabling the cloud with the transition to 400-gigabit per second. We also just announced 800-gigabit per second, which further demonstrates our leadership in this space by far. 
In 5G cellular infrastructure, we are leveraging our ethernet technology to bring the network to the Edge in open RAN or radio access networks through a combination of custom and standard products across both analog and digital domains. 
And as we know, as Moore's Law for computing starts to slow down as it has, we continue to gain momentum in developing and delivering hardware accelerators to offload computing for the cloud service providers across an increasing variety of workloads, initially with virtualization, hypervisors and expanding today to AI, security, encryption and video transcoding. And in wireless access in enterprise and home gateways, we are of course leading the market transition to WiFi 6. 
And finally, we actually do have now an organic integrated silicon photonics effort underway, combining our capabilities in switching with our strong legacy in fiber optics for next-generation cloud and networking architectures. 
So in summary, we plan to increase our investment in our core semiconductor businesses to position ourselves for expected future growth opportunities, where we can leverage our scale of investment, industry-leading focused execution and breadth of IP. Now we all know it has been a tough year for semiconductors in general, with our semiconductor segment down approximately 8% as I indicated.  But if you look at our core semi business, as I define it, it has held up reasonably well. To put some numbers around it, this business did a little over $11 billion in sales in 2019, which was down just less than 4% from 2018. 
We think this business is stabilizing. And we believe given the growth drivers I just highlighted over the next several years that this business can actually grow 6% to 8% annually. 
Turning to infrastructure software. We started a few years ago with Brocade, a storage area networking switch business. Then we acquired CA, which is a leading independent provider of mainframe tools, and we just closed on Symantec, the leading enterprise security software provider in November. 
Our Brocade acquisition was predicated on view that a fiber channel SAN switching market for large enterprises was sustainable and that we could just grow our leadership position with additional investment. And after a couple of years now, it's fairly clear this investment thesis was right. 
Similarly, we bought CA because we felt the mainframe market for the launch of enterprises was stable and, in fact, growing, and that CA was critical to customers who rely on mainframes to run their businesses. It's still early innings 1 year now, just over 1 year, but mainframe compute is growing with our target customers. We are increasing investments in mainframes to support our leadership position. 
The CA customer transition continues with core accounts growing double digits while noncore accounts attrit as we had planned. We expect Symantec to start with $1.8 billion of core sustainable incremental annual run rate revenue that we believe we can grow to over $2 billion over the next 3 years. 
Our infrastructure software segment is becoming more predictable with ratable recurring revenue contribution from CA and now also with Symantec. And we anticipate over $7 billion infrastructure software revenue in fiscal 2020. 
In summary, therefore, our long-term plan for this company is to invest in organic growth in our core semi business while continuing to scale up our infrastructure software business through disciplined and highly accretive acquisitions. 
Now let me turn the call over to Tom."

Let me start with a review of our fourth quarter and fiscal 2019 results. I'll then spend some time discussing our outlook for fiscal 2020, after which we will open up the call for questions. Consolidated net revenue for the fourth quar",1364,"Thank you, Hock. Let me start with a review of our fourth quarter and fiscal 2019 results. I'll then spend some time discussing our outlook for fiscal 2020, after which we will open up the call for questions. 
Consolidated net revenue for the fourth quarter was $5.8 billion, a 6% increase from a year ago. Semiconductor solutions revenue was $4.6 billion and represented 79% of our total revenue this quarter. This was down 7% year-on-year and up 5% quarter-over-quarter. 
On a sequential basis, networking sustained driven by an uptick in our custom silicon solutions. Storage also held up driven by increased demand for high-capacity drives. This was offset by increased volatility in broadband, especially as the market prepares for the WiFi 6 transition. 
And as is typical in our fourth fiscal quarter, wireless was seasonally up. Revenue for the infrastructure software segment was $1.2 billion and represented 21% of revenue. The CA business continues to perform well. SAN switching demand remains muted as our partner OEM supply chain continues to compress. 
That being said, the SAN switching business was up from the Q3 low points, and the market for these products looks to be stabilizing. 
Looking down the P&L sequentially. Gross margins dropped given the seasonal mix shift to wireless in our semi business, while operating expenses remained relatively flat at just over $1 billion. 
Operating income from continuous operations was $3 billion and represented 52.3% of net revenue. Adjusted EBITDA was $3.2 billion and represented 54.8% of net revenue. This figure excludes $143 million of depreciation. 
I would also note that we accrued $119 million of restructuring/integration expenses and made $150 million of cash restructuring/integration payments in the quarter. These expenses and payments are primarily related to CA. 
We spent $96 million on capital expenditures, and free cash flow represented 41% of revenue or $2.4 billion. 
In the quarter, we returned $1.6 billion to our common stockholders, including $1.1 billion of cash dividends. 
As we previewed when we announced the Symantec deal, in Q4, we initiated the transition from stock buybacks to debt repayment. In the quarter, we invested $587 million for the repurchase and elimination of 2.1 million AVGO shares. However, we also paid down $4.8 billion of debt with proceeds from our preferred stock offering and excess cash flow. We ended the quarter with $5.1 billion of cash, $32.8 billion of total debt, 398 million outstanding common shares and 444 million fully diluted shares for the quarter. 
Now let's recap performance for the full fiscal year 2019. Our revenue hit a new record of $22.6 billion, growing 8% year-on-year. Semiconductor solutions revenue was $17.4 billion, down 8% year-over-year. 
As Hock reviewed, revenue from our core semiconductor business, which does not include wireless and industrial, was down 4%. Infrastructure software revenue was $5.2 billion, which included $3.4 billion from CA mainframe and enterprise and $1.8 billion from Brocade SAN switching. 
Gross margin for the year was a record high 71%, up from 67% a year ago. The addition of CA as well as the beneficial mix in semiconductor product sales drove the gross margin expansion. 
Additionally, operating expenses expanded to $4.1 billion with the addition of CA, offset by lower annual performance bonus amounts relative to 2018. 
Operating income from continuing operations was $11.9 billion, up 14.4% year-over-year and represented 52.8% of net revenue. Adjusted EBITDA was $12.6 billion, up 13.5% year-over-year and represented 55.7% of net revenue. This figure excludes $569 million of depreciation. 
I would also note that we accrued $1.1 billion of restructuring/integration expenses and made $883 million of cash restructuring/integration payments in fiscal 2019. We spent $432 million on capital expenditures, and free cash flow represented 41% of revenue or $9.3 billion. Free cash flow grew 12.4% year-over-year. 
For the year, we returned $10.6 billion to our common stockholders, consisting of $4.2 billion in the form of cash dividends and $6.4 billion for the repurchase and elimination of 24.5 million AVGO shares. 
Okay. So now let's look ahead to fiscal 2020. The outlook for our business is as follows. In the semiconductor solutions segment, we expect to achieve approximately $18 billion in revenue. Let me unpack this a bit. We expect our core semiconductor business to deliver approximately $12 billion in revenues in 2020, which would represent approximately 7% growth compared to 2019. Our wireless businesses which, let me remind everybody, consists of 3 primary product lines: one is RF; the other is WiFi/Bluetooth combos; and finally, our mixed signal custom products, which we sell almost exclusively to one of our large smartphone customers. 
RF, which represented approximately $2.2 billion of revenues in fiscal 2019 is expected to grow high single digits given the initial ramp in 5G phones. 
WiFi/Bluetooth combos, which was approximately $2.2 billion in fiscal 2019, is expected to be down low single digits. The adoption of new WiFi 6 solutions at our 2 large smartphone customers will be offset by the completion of our movement away from noncore, lower-margin legacy WiFi business, which will adversely impact this product line's 2022 revenues. 
Finally, our mixed signal custom product line, which was approximately $1.1 billion in fiscal 2019, is expected to drop to less than $500 million in fiscal 2020. The reduction in revenues here is driven by a change in architecture at our primary smartphone customer as well as our decision to reduce our investment in this area and focus our engineering resources on more sustainable and profitable activities in our core semi business. 
Finally, industrial, which consists primarily of optoelectronic power management and sensing product lines, we expect business will stabilize and recover in fiscal '20 after a challenging fiscal 2019 and to contribute approximately $1 billion in revenues. 
Switching to the software segment. As Hock reviewed, we expect the business to grow to approximately $7 billion. Symantec is expected to contribute approximately $1.8 billion, including the effects of purchase accounting, while CA and Brocade are expected to be relatively flat to up slightly. 
So on a consolidated basis, we are forecasting net revenue to be approximately $20 billion -- $25 billion, excuse me, plus or minus $500 million for fiscal 2020. 
One housekeeping item, our IP or intellectual property segment will be included in our semi solutions segment going forward given this business represented a material amount of revenue. We'll therefore have 2 reporting segments in fiscal '20, semiconductor solutions and infrastructure software. 
Turning to our fiscal year 2020 guidance. On a non-GAAP basis, operating margins and adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to be relatively flat in fiscal '20. There are a number of specific headwinds. As Hock discussed, we are increasing our investment near term in our core semi business to take advantage of growth opportunities we see there. We're also in a transition year with Symantec given effects of purchase accounting near term and onetime expenses tied to the transition services agreement in place with Norton LifeLock. And finally, we will have a headwind from our bonus accrual.  We'll be setting a target, which impacts 2020. 
Looking beyond fiscal '20, we expect to continue to expand our operating margins organically and are targeting 55% by fiscal 2022. 
Now on to capital allocation. We remain committed to returning approximately 50% of our prior year free cash flow to stockholders in the form of cash dividends. With that, on the dividend, based on approximately $9 billion of free cash flow after M&A and related items that we generated in fiscal 2019, we are increasing our target quarterly common stock cash dividend starting this quarter to $3.25 per share. This constitutes an increase of 23%. We plan to maintain this dividend payout throughout the year, subject to quarterly Board approval, which means we plan to pay out just over $5 billion in cash dividends in fiscal '20. 
Consistent with our capital allocation policy, we will reassess the dividend this time next year based on our fiscal '20 free cash flow from operations results. 
In addition, we plan to pay down approximately $4 billion in debt in fiscal '20 as part of our commitment to maintain our investment-grade credit rating. 
That concludes my prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions] Operator, please open up the call for questions."

You got Tomahawk, Trident, Jericho, your compute and security acceleration, ASICs and the new optical connectivity portfolio. There was a bit of pause in cloud spending in the first half of this year, but it looks like that, that is starting to reaccelerate and looking to be strong in 2020. You also have the start of the 400-gig upgrade cycle. So for fiscal '20, how do you see the data center part of your semi franchise performing relative to 2019? Is this going to be another strong year? 
And then just secondarily, one of your customers, Cisco, just announced that they're getting into the merchant silicon market for cloud networking. You guys have a strong position here and, in fact, have helped these guys, both merchant and ASIC on their networking platforms. It would be great to get your views on this customer now as a potential competitor."

And there are 2 parts to each of these, as you know. There's the cloud guys, service provider and cloud guys, and there is the more traditional enterprise. And we see spending in the cloud guys, as you correctly pointed out, stepping up more and more in 2020. We've seen some of it this year, calendar -- in the later part of calendar '19 in investment in storage, and we will start to see in 2020 spending on networking to start ramping up, especially with regard to 200-gigabit and 400-gigabit, especially in the second half of the year, which will be great for us because of our product portfolio, Tomahawk 3 and even Trident 4, in these areas as well as, of course, the spine.
So to us, we see 2020 as continue growth momentum basically in our data center business, especially when it relates to cloud. In enterprise, we are not so sure. Enterprise has clearly taken a pause second half of '19, calendar '19, and we see that pause probably continuing for a while into '20 before possibly, in our thinking, slowly recovering later half of 2020 for enterprise. And that's -- I mean there's a clear difference in the spending. And with respect to one of our very good customers turning into -- coming into merchant silicon with the recent announcement, I think yesterday, on One Silicon -- or the Silicon One and the Router 8000, I think it's -- we welcome that because it validates couple of things we've been pushing for years. One of which is that there will be and there has been and will be more and more disaggregation of software, the operating system, from hardware, the silicon, the chip that supports it. There will be more and more disaggregation. As you know, traditionally, it's all wrapped into a black box as one. That disaggregation path has obviously been pushed, and we have enabled that by the cloud guys, the hypercloud guys. And we have been very successful enabling it, and that's great. So the fact that Cisco has joined it, in our view, validates the model, the trend we have been pushing. And it's great to see that we're right in that regard. So we'll welcome the competition. 
I just want to add it's not only in cloud that we're seeing that happen. It's also in enterprise, traditional enterprise, particularly some of the large telcos who you classify as cloud, too, and I don't need to mention names, but a few of the very large telcos, both in North America and in Europe are also pushing down that path with us very, very closely. And they're very -- and some of them are very far along, especially -- and we're using our Jericho 2 router to enable it. And talking of which, that Jericho 2 router, which we're using today to enable the path of those telcos, enterprises towards disaggregation of hardware and software, has been around, and we've been shipping it for over a year. And that runs 10 terabits per second. The same bandwidth as Silicon One announced yesterday. 
And earlier this week, we announced as a future successor 25.6-terabit per second switching and routing. And that's where we're pushing now, 2.5x the performance of what just came out."

On our core semiconductor business, touching on the first part of it, obviously networking is -- especially merchant silicon in networking has been a very strong driver. And particularly so in the latter part of '19 when enterprise spending slowed down, and it has stabilized, but it has definitely slowed down. And -- but cloud starts to recover, and the various -- the portfolio, the various positions we have -- product portfolio we have in all these areas allows us on balance to mitigate quite a bit this slowdown. And the big -- one the of biggest area that allows mitigation to any slowdown in networking, as you've seen, is compute offload. Here, this is very much a cloud spend. And the biggest area of mitigation, it continues to be AI. We ship AI chips, provides one of the biggest segment for opportunities, I should say, for compute offload business. And this is a real business now. We're shipping several hundred million dollars a year and growing of these AI chips. 
We are also starting to emerge in a few other areas as in virtualization or hypervisor, and we all typically call Smart NIC. But that, we're starting to see happen. And that's also in cloud. And in enterprise, the move towards higher bandwidth mix, performance mix, is also helping clients there. 
So there's a whole slew of things in data centers that mitigate each other. Having said that, in 2019, especially second half, broadband. We are very big in this area. The video delivery in cable in -- which are in DSL, digital subscriber line copper, or PON, fiber to the home, slowed down second half '19. We're now seeing, as we approach the end of the year, a lot of great momentum as telcos seem to recover their spending in broadband, and we're seeing a very sharp recovery. When all this mix is put together, broadband, we see as far as a market, that's very stable, go through cycles with an underlying push on WiFi access as more and more of this access gateways are now deploying WiFi, as I say, especially the next-generation WiFi 6. So that creates a little degree of growth. 
But broadband in general, stable, goes through cycles and sometimes will offset it. But the data center networking business is a secular growth area, and that's why we talked about stepping up our investment in this area. And that's the other reason we want to highlight on the call, that we are actually investing, increasing the level of investment as a percent of revenue, as an example, in this particular area. And that includes our foray into silicon photonics, which is intended to enable integration of the silicon switch, together with fiber optic interconnects as we move from 25.6-gigabit per second routing to the next gen, 2 years from now, 51-terabit per second. It's so high density, I think we need that integration, and we're preparing towards that direction."

And I indicated in my opening remarks, and we've been very specific in the base station as a best example. I call it radio access network. It's really -- another term is base station. And the base station for 5G networks to improve latency, to improve density throughput, the architect, the operators are pushing the network, the backhaul, all the network that takes a signal from the base station, they're pushing that right to the edge, which is into the base station. In other words, ethernet is likely to be under open RAN, the open base RAN, we'll push as far as possible into the radios. And you really run the entire line end-to-end as much as you can on ethernet. 
Even CPRI, which is typically the protocol that's used between the radio -- in the radio is now being minimized and squeezed out as opposed to just running a common higher bandwidth ethernet, which is, by the way, plays right up to our switching strength, routing and switching strength. So we are very engaged now with OEMs in those -- on infrastructure side, in developing, testing and working on the key elements within the base station. That's our push very hard into 5G infrastructure, which is to no degree, part of the increased investment in core semis that Tom indicated of at least $200 million a year, not all of it, but a big part of it."

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining today. Now we concluded fiscal year 2019 with record revenue of $22.6 billion, growing 8% year-over-year despite a challenging environment. Our semiconductor solutions segment declined",1056,"Thank you, Bea. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining today. 
Now we concluded fiscal year 2019 with record revenue of $22.6 billion, growing 8% year-over-year despite a challenging environment. Our semiconductor solutions segment declined 8% year-over-year, but this was more than offset by our infrastructure software segment benefiting from the integration and healthy results from the CA business.
In semiconductors, almost all product lines were down year-on-year, with one clear exception, and that's networking, where the existing growth drivers continue their strong momentum. In infrastructure software, renewals in our core accounts grew double digits, which more than offset the expected attrition in our noncore accounts. 
Now as we embark on fiscal 2020, I want to provide you some insight into our latest strategic assessment of our semiconductor businesses and our current view of the market. I also want to give you an update on our software business, including our latest Symantec acquisition. I'm sure you have seen the guidance in our earnings release today that we are headed towards $25 billion in revenue -- $25 billion in revenue in 2020. And I'll let Tom go through the details on how we get there. 
But before I turn this over to him, let me now give you the broader picture. So when we look at our semiconductor segment today, we are increasingly thinking about it as a core and fabless semiconductor business that consists of networking, broadband and storage connectivity products, focused on enterprise service providers and cloud infrastructure. Here, we get a lot of strategic synergies and scale across our end markets with our customers and with our core silicon technology. This in turn drives efficiencies in our sales, R&D and supply chain activities. 
Our infrastructure software businesses, which focus primarily on large enterprises are, in fact, quite complementary and enhance these core semi businesses by bringing us closer to our end customers. This gives us a natural barrier to entry and gives us comfort that we can drive sustainable revenue growth and improve profitability long term. 
Alongside these core semiconductor businesses, we have several valuable semiconductor businesses that are much more stand-alone in nature due to their unique customers, technology and supply chain characteristics. Now this will include our wireless businesses and our industrial businesses. We don't have the same kind of synergies with this as we do in our core semi business. 
Increasingly, we view this business as more financial assets, especially in terms of capital allocation, balance sheet optimization and how we choose to leverage resources and manage the company. 
Turning to our current assessment for our core semi business, it's extremely positive. We believe we are uniquely positioned with an industry-leading portfolio, extending connectivity across enterprise, telcos and cloud, in data center switching and routing. We're enabling the cloud with the transition to 400-gigabit per second. We also just announced 800-gigabit per second, which further demonstrates our leadership in this space by far. 
In 5G cellular infrastructure, we are leveraging our ethernet technology to bring the network to the Edge in open RAN or radio access networks through a combination of custom and standard products across both analog and digital domains. 
And as we know, as Moore's Law for computing starts to slow down as it has, we continue to gain momentum in developing and delivering hardware accelerators to offload computing for the cloud service providers across an increasing variety of workloads, initially with virtualization, hypervisors and expanding today to AI, security, encryption and video transcoding. And in wireless access in enterprise and home gateways, we are of course leading the market transition to WiFi 6. 
And finally, we actually do have now an organic integrated silicon photonics effort underway, combining our capabilities in switching with our strong legacy in fiber optics for next-generation cloud and networking architectures. 
So in summary, we plan to increase our investment in our core semiconductor businesses to position ourselves for expected future growth opportunities, where we can leverage our scale of investment, industry-leading focused execution and breadth of IP. Now we all know it has been a tough year for semiconductors in general, with our semiconductor segment down approximately 8% as I indicated. But if you look at our core semi business, as I define it, it has held up reasonably well. To put some numbers around it, this business did a little over $11 billion in sales in 2019, which was down just less than 4% from 2018. 
We think this business is stabilizing. And we believe given the growth drivers I just highlighted over the next several years that this business can actually grow 6% to 8% annually. 
Turning to infrastructure software. We started a few years ago with Brocade, a storage area networking switch business. Then we acquired CA, which is a leading independent provider of mainframe tools, and we just closed on Symantec, the leading enterprise security software provider in November. 
Our Brocade acquisition was predicated on view that a fiber channel SAN switching market for large enterprises was sustainable and that we could just grow our leadership position with additional investment. And after a couple of years now, it's fairly clear this investment thesis was right. 
Similarly, we bought CA because we felt the mainframe market for the launch of enterprises was stable and, in fact, growing, and that CA was critical to customers who rely on mainframes to run their businesses. It's still early innings 1 year now, just over 1 year, but mainframe compute is growing with our target customers. We are increasing investments in mainframes to support our leadership position. 
The CA customer transition continues with core accounts growing double digits while noncore accounts attrit as we had planned. We expect Symantec to start with $1.8 billion of core sustainable incremental annual run rate revenue that we believe we can grow to over $2 billion over the next 3 years. 
Our infrastructure software segment is becoming more predictable with ratable recurring revenue contribution from CA and now also with Symantec. And we anticipate over $7 billion infrastructure software revenue in fiscal 2020. 
In summary, therefore, our long-term plan for this company is to invest in organic growth in our core semi business while continuing to scale up our infrastructure software business through disciplined and highly accretive acquisitions. 
Now let me turn the call over to Tom."

Consolidated net revenue for the fourth quar",1364,"Thank you, Hock. Let me start with a review of our fourth quarter and fiscal 2019 results. I'll then spend some time discussing our outlook for fiscal 2020, after which we will open up the call for questions. 
Consolidated net revenue for the fourth quarter was $5.8 billion, a 6% increase from a year ago. Semiconductor solutions revenue was $4.6 billion and represented 79% of our total revenue this quarter. This was down 7% year-on-year and up 5% quarter-over-quarter. 
On a sequential basis, networking sustained driven by an uptick in our custom silicon solutions. Storage also held up driven by increased demand for high-capacity drives. This was offset by increased volatility in broadband, especially as the market prepares for the WiFi 6 transition. 
And as is typical in our fourth fiscal quarter, wireless was seasonally up. Revenue for the infrastructure software segment was $1.2 billion and represented 21% of revenue. The CA business continues to perform well. SAN switching demand remains muted as our partner OEM supply chain continues to compress. 
That being said, the SAN switching business was up from the Q3 low points, and the market for these products looks to be stabilizing. 
Looking down the P&L sequentially. Gross margins dropped given the seasonal mix shift to wireless in our semi business, while operating expenses remained relatively flat at just over $1 billion. 
Operating income from continuous operations was $3 billion and represented 52.3% of net revenue. Adjusted EBITDA was $3.2 billion and represented 54.8% of net revenue. This figure excludes $143 million of depreciation. 
I would also note that we accrued $119 million of restructuring/integration expenses and made $150 million of cash restructuring/integration payments in the quarter. These expenses and payments are primarily related to CA. 
We spent $96 million on capital expenditures, and free cash flow represented 41% of revenue or $2.4 billion. 
In the quarter, we returned $1.6 billion to our common stockholders, including $1.1 billion of cash dividends. 
As we previewed when we announced the Symantec deal, in Q4, we initiated the transition from stock buybacks to debt repayment. In the quarter, we invested $587 million for the repurchase and elimination of 2.1 million AVGO shares. However, we also paid down $4.8 billion of debt with proceeds from our preferred stock offering and excess cash flow. We ended the quarter with $5.1 billion of cash, $32.8 billion of total debt, 398 million outstanding common shares and 444 million fully diluted shares for the quarter. 
Now let's recap performance for the full fiscal year 2019. Our revenue hit a new record of $22.6 billion, growing 8% year-on-year. Semiconductor solutions revenue was $17.4 billion, down 8% year-over-year. 
As Hock reviewed, revenue from our core semiconductor business, which does not include wireless and industrial, was down 4%. Infrastructure software revenue was $5.2 billion, which included $3.4 billion from CA mainframe and enterprise and $1.8 billion from Brocade SAN switching. 
Gross margin for the year was a record high 71%, up from 67% a year ago. The addition of CA as well as the beneficial mix in semiconductor product sales drove the gross margin expansion. 
Additionally, operating expenses expanded to $4.1 billion with the addition of CA, offset by lower annual performance bonus amounts relative to 2018. 
Operating income from continuing operations was $11.9 billion, up 14.4% year-over-year and represented 52.8% of net revenue. Adjusted EBITDA was $12.6 billion, up 13.5% year-over-year and represented 55.7% of net revenue. This figure excludes $569 million of depreciation. 
I would also note that we accrued $1.1 billion of restructuring/integration expenses and made $883 million of cash restructuring/integration payments in fiscal 2019. We spent $432 million on capital expenditures, and free cash flow represented 41% of revenue or $9.3 billion. Free cash flow grew 12.4% year-over-year. 
For the year, we returned $10.6 billion to our common stockholders, consisting of $4.2 billion in the form of cash dividends and $6.4 billion for the repurchase and elimination of 24.5 million AVGO shares. 
Okay. So now let's look ahead to fiscal 2020. The outlook for our business is as follows. In the semiconductor solutions segment, we expect to achieve approximately $18 billion in revenue. Let me unpack this a bit. We expect our core semiconductor business to deliver approximately $12 billion in revenues in 2020, which would represent approximately 7% growth compared to 2019. Our wireless businesses which, let me remind everybody, consists of 3 primary product lines: one is RF; the other is WiFi/Bluetooth combos; and finally, our mixed signal custom products, which we sell almost exclusively to one of our large smartphone customers. 
RF, which represented approximately $2.2 billion of revenues in fiscal 2019 is expected to grow high single digits given the initial ramp in 5G phones. 
WiFi/Bluetooth combos, which was approximately $2.2 billion in fiscal 2019, is expected to be down low single digits. The adoption of new WiFi 6 solutions at our 2 large smartphone customers will be offset by the completion of our movement away from noncore, lower-margin legacy WiFi business, which will adversely impact this product line's 2022 revenues. 
Finally, our mixed signal custom product line, which was approximately $1.1 billion in fiscal 2019, is expected to drop to less than $500 million in fiscal 2020. The reduction in revenues here is driven by a change in architecture at our primary smartphone customer as well as our decision to reduce our investment in this area and focus our engineering resources on more sustainable and profitable activities in our core semi business. 
Finally, industrial, which consists primarily of optoelectronic power management and sensing product lines, we expect business will stabilize and recover in fiscal '20 after a challenging fiscal 2019 and to contribute approximately $1 billion in revenues. 
Switching to the software segment. As Hock reviewed, we expect the business to grow to approximately $7 billion. Symantec is expected to contribute approximately $1.8 billion, including the effects of purchase accounting, while CA and Brocade are expected to be relatively flat to up slightly. 
So on a consolidated basis, we are forecasting net revenue to be approximately $20 billion -- $25 billion, excuse me, plus or minus $500 million for fiscal 2020. 
One housekeeping item, our IP or intellectual property segment will be included in our semi solutions segment going forward given this business represented a material amount of revenue. We'll therefore have 2 reporting segments in fiscal '20, semiconductor solutions and infrastructure software. 
Turning to our fiscal year 2020 guidance. On a non-GAAP basis, operating margins and adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to be relatively flat in fiscal '20. There are a number of specific headwinds. As Hock discussed, we are increasing our investment near term in our core semi business to take advantage of growth opportunities we see there. We're also in a transition year with Symantec given effects of purchase accounting near term and onetime expenses tied to the transition services agreement in place with Norton LifeLock. And finally, we will have a headwind from our bonus accrual. We'll be setting a target, which impacts 2020. 
Looking beyond fiscal '20, we expect to continue to expand our operating margins organically and are targeting 55% by fiscal 2022. 
Now on to capital allocation. We remain committed to returning approximately 50% of our prior year free cash flow to stockholders in the form of cash dividends. With that, on the dividend, based on approximately $9 billion of free cash flow after M&A and related items that we generated in fiscal 2019, we are increasing our target quarterly common stock cash dividend starting this quarter to $3.25 per share. This constitutes an increase of 23%. We plan to maintain this dividend payout throughout the year, subject to quarterly Board approval, which means we plan to pay out just over $5 billion in cash dividends in fiscal '20. 
Consistent with our capital allocation policy, we will reassess the dividend this time next year based on our fiscal '20 free cash flow from operations results. 
In addition, we plan to pay down approximately $4 billion in debt in fiscal '20 as part of our commitment to maintain our investment-grade credit rating. 
That concludes my prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions] Operator, please open up the call for questions."

You got Tomahawk, Trident, Jericho, your compute and security acceleration, ASICs and the new optical connectivity portfolio. There was a bit of pause in cloud spending in the first half of this year, but it looks like that, that is starting to reaccelerate and looking to be strong in 2020. You also have the start of the 400-gig upgrade cycle. So for fiscal '20, how do you see the data center part of your semi franchise performing relative to 2019? Is this going to be another strong year? 
And then just secondarily, one of your customers, Cisco, just announced that they're getting into the merchant silicon market for cloud networking. You guys have a strong position here and, in fact, have helped these guys, both merchant and ASIC on their networking platforms. It would be great to get your views on this customer now as a potential competitor."

And there are 2 parts to each of these, as you know. There's the cloud guys, service provider and cloud guys, and there is the more traditional enterprise. And we see spending in the cloud guys, as you correctly pointed out, stepping up more and more in 2020. We've seen some of it this year, calendar -- in the later part of calendar '19 in investment in storage, and we will start to see in 2020 spending on networking to start ramping up, especially with regard to 200-gigabit and 400-gigabit, especially in the second half of the year, which will be great for us because of our product portfolio, Tomahawk 3 and even Trident 4, in these areas as well as, of course, the spine.
So to us, we see 2020 as continue growth momentum basically in our data center business, especially when it relates to cloud. In enterprise, we are not so sure. Enterprise has clearly taken a pause second half of '19, calendar '19, and we see that pause probably continuing for a while into '20 before possibly, in our thinking, slowly recovering later half of 2020 for enterprise. And that's -- I mean there's a clear difference in the spending. And with respect to one of our very good customers turning into -- coming into merchant silicon with the recent announcement, I think yesterday, on One Silicon -- or the Silicon One and the Router 8000, I think it's -- we welcome that because it validates couple of things we've been pushing for years. One of which is that there will be and there has been and will be more and more disaggregation of software, the operating system, from hardware, the silicon, the chip that supports it. There will be more and more disaggregation. As you know, traditionally, it's all wrapped into a black box as one. That disaggregation path has obviously been pushed, and we have enabled that by the cloud guys, the hypercloud guys. And we have been very successful enabling it, and that's great. So the fact that Cisco has joined it, in our view, validates the model, the trend we have been pushing. And it's great to see that we're right in that regard. So we'll welcome the competition. 
I just want to add it's not only in cloud that we're seeing that happen. It's also in enterprise, traditional enterprise, particularly some of the large telcos who you classify as cloud, too, and I don't need to mention names, but a few of the very large telcos, both in North America and in Europe are also pushing down that path with us very, very closely. And they're very -- and some of them are very far along, especially -- and we're using our Jericho 2 router to enable it. And talking of which, that Jericho 2 router, which we're using today to enable the path of those telcos, enterprises towards disaggregation of hardware and software, has been around, and we've been shipping it for over a year. And that runs 10 terabits per second. The same bandwidth as Silicon One announced yesterday. 
And earlier this week, we announced as a future successor 25.6-terabit per second switching and routing. And that's where we're pushing now, 2.5x the performance of what just came out."

But as we look at all our portfolio companies, they are assets and franchises and where we particularly highlight for this purposes of this review while we pull out costs and [ misses ]. There's a lot of synergies. There's a lot of push in data centers, networking, and it covers both cloud and enterprises and covers both hardware and increasingly software operating systems, like eventually even infrastructure software. And we want to highlight that difference and highlight the difference, in particular, to show you that in those core areas of data centers, we don't drop as much as the marketplace, as we saw in 2019, where year-on-year organically, we're down only 4%. And that we expect some -- in 2020 to actually grow -- recover fairly quickly to mid- to high single digits year-on-year. Very fast in this end market because the environment is -- in the market, the environment is good. And we lead it by a long shot. We lead in providing the technology, which is another interesting thing between selling systems and selling components. Components, be it software, be it semiconductor solution, is driven a lot by technology, good, strong technology which can be applied to allow customers to create differentiated systems. 
Selling systems, [ as a final ] in software, is very much a relationship business, a very embedded software, where the key is service and support as opposed to technology, [ to get to that difference ].

On our core semiconductor business, touching on the first part of it, obviously networking is -- especially merchant silicon in networking has been a very strong driver. And particularly so in the latter part of '19 when enterprise spending slowed down, and it has stabilized, but it has definitely slowed down. And -- but cloud starts to recover, and the various -- the portfolio, the various positions we have -- product portfolio we have in all these areas allows us on balance to mitigate quite a bit this slowdown. And the big -- one of the biggest area that allows mitigation to any slowdown in networking, as you've seen, is compute offload. Here, this is very much a cloud spend. And the biggest area of mitigation, it continues to be AI. We ship AI chips, provides one of the biggest segment for opportunities, I should say, for compute offload business. And this is a real business now. We're shipping several hundred million dollars a year and growing of these AI chips. 
We are also starting to emerge in a few other areas as in virtualization or hypervisor, and we all typically call Smart NIC. But that, we're starting to see happen. And that's also in cloud. And in enterprise, the move towards higher bandwidth mix, performance mix, is also helping clients there. 
So there's a whole slew of things in data centers that mitigate each other. Having said that, in 2019, especially second half, broadband. We are very big in this area. The video delivery in cable in -- which are in DSL, digital subscriber line copper, or PON, fiber to the home, slowed down second half '19. We're now seeing, as we approach the end of the year, a lot of great momentum as telcos seem to recover their spending in broadband, and we're seeing a very sharp recovery. When all this mix is put together, broadband, we see as far as a market, that's very stable, go through cycles with an underlying push on WiFi access as more and more of this access gateways are now deploying WiFi, as I say, especially the next-generation WiFi 6. So that creates a little degree of growth. 
But broadband in general, stable, goes through cycles and sometimes will offset it. But the data center networking business is a secular growth area, and that's why we talked about stepping up our investment in this area. And that's the other reason we want to highlight on the call, that we are actually investing, increasing the level of investment as a percent of revenue, as an example, in this particular area. And that includes our foray into silicon photonics, which is intended to enable integration of the silicon switch, together with fiber optic interconnects as we move from 25.6-gigabit per second routing to the next gen, 2 years from now, 51-terabit per second. It's so high density, I think we need that integration, and we're preparing towards that direction."

So that's one, it's a technical one, but it matters. The other is we are increasing investment, a, couple of hundred million dollars in the semiconductor business as well. So that's another headwind. 
And then from a Symantec perspective, this is a business that was doing a couple hundred million dollars of EBITDA when we bought it. We're going to enter the year day 1 with obviously a much more elevated EBITDA figure, which we'll report on next quarter. But I think when you think about the TSA elements and some of the other restructuring items, there, you have another couple hundred million dollars that you have to get through as we look through the year. 
So I would think of it in those 3 equal parts. And then if you back that out and then you think about some of the organic growth that we're driving in core semis, we still have margin expansion. We've talked about this a lot over the years in terms of where we can take gross margins in our core semiconductor business, and the scale advantages that delivers in terms of the operating margin line. That's how we get to the 55% target over the next 3 years."

I think a lot of discussion have been a lot on 5G handset which, as Tom mentioned, especially in our RF side, RF division, we're very, very much in it.

I think a lot of discussion have been a lot on 5G handset which, as Tom mentioned, especially in our RF side, RF division, we're very, very much in it. And it's great to the point where we expect to grow 19 to 20 because of content increase. But with respect to infrastructure, we are getting a lot of traction. And I indicated in my opening remarks, and we've been very specific in the base station as a best example. I call it radio access network. It's really -- another term is base station. And the base station for 5G networks to improve latency, to improve density throughput, the architect, the operators are pushing the network, the backhaul, all the network that takes a signal from the base station, they're pushing that right to the edge, which is into the base station. In other words, ethernet is likely to be under open RAN, the open base RAN, we'll push as far as possible into the radios. And you really run the entire line end-to-end as much as you can on ethernet. 
Even CPRI, which is typically the protocol that's used between the radio -- in the radio is now being minimized and squeezed out as opposed to just running a common higher bandwidth ethernet, which is, by the way, plays right up to our switching strength, routing and switching strength. So we are very engaged now with OEMs in those -- on infrastructure side, in developing, testing and working on the key elements within the base station. That's our push very hard into 5G infrastructure, which is to no degree, part of the increased investment in core semis that Tom indicated of at least $200 million a year, not all of it, but a big part of it."
