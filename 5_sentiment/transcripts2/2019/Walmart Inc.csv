We're encouraged by our performance for the year because we believe our customers are noticing our improvements that we continue to see many ways we can serve them better. We're even more convinced they want us and expect us to bring our stores and eCommerce businesses together in a digitally connected seamless way that makes shopping easier. We experienced a favorable economic environment in the U.S. throughout the year and our associates made a lot happen to drive the strength of our results. 
Brett will go into more detail on our results shortly. I am particularly encouraged by our sales results in the quarter. In Q4, Walmart U.S. grew comp sales 4.2%, excluding fuel;  eCommerce sales increased 43% and we gained market share in key categories such as grocery and toys according to Nielsen and the NPD Group. 
Sam's Club finished the year with another strong quarter with comp sales growth of 5.3%, excluding fuel and tobacco; and international, comps were positive in a majority of our markets.  Strong top line results allow us to reiterate the FY '20 sales and profit guidance we gave in October even as we landed FY '19 ahead of where we expected. We strive to make everyday easier for busy families as we increase convenience and save them money and time. Part of our strategy is to build on our existing strengths such as having a broad assortment, including fresh and perishable foods within 10 miles of 90% of the U.S. population. Our stores and clubs are becoming more digital and we're using technology to change how we work. More customers can now access our brand through multiple channels and it's important that we engage them in different ways.  We learned that those customers who shop with us both in stores and online spend about twice as much in total and they spend more in our stores. 
Across the business, you can see examples of how we are meeting the changing needs of customers and delivering solutions that are increasing customer engagement. In the U.S., we offer grocery pickup at more than 2,100 locations and grocery delivery at nearly 800 locations, which represents about 69% and 36% of the population, respectively. Feedback from customers about the services continues to be very positive which speaks to the capabilities of our roughly 37,000 personal shoppers. 
In Mexico, we're delighting customers with new experiences such as a secure digital payment option that's available in their mobile phones and in-store kiosks that offer a broad assortment of products with flexible pickup times. In addition, through our investment in the crowd source delivery platform Daoda JD Daoja, customers in China get there merchandise in less than an hour by placing the order and it's picked from a network of more than 280 locations. 
We continue to build trust which we believe will become even more of a competitive advantage. Around the world, Walmart plays an important role in the communities we serve by using our scale for good. Whether it's our work to promote small businesses in local farmers in places like India or larger scale initiatives such as our effort to double our use of renewable energy in the U.S. by 2025, customers can feel good about Walmart, the company that starts every day with the goal of earning their business.
It's nice to be recognized for the work we're doing to promote share value. In fact, the company recently received an A- rating on the CDP's annual environmental scorecard, up from a B rating last year. And we're ranked as the survey's top-performing U.S. based food retailer.
Share value is an important concept and something that we have fully embraced as we think about how to best allocate our time and capital, deliver strong efficient growth, reduce costs and operate with discipline. Within this construct, customers, associates, communities and shareholders can win. 
Now let's move on to highlights from the year for our operating segments. Up again with Walmart U.S. where the team had a great year. Comp sales growth of 3.6% for fiscal year '19 exceeded our expectations. The work the team has done to balance inventory levels within stock rates is impressive. The team leveraged operating expenses overall even as we invested in wages, training, technology and eCommerce. Store level productivity is strong due in part to the training we're providing our associates. As the nature of work continues to change, we're innovating to empower associates to better serve customers as they develop new skills, driving their jobs and growing their careers. This coming year, we'll add new ways for associates to better manage their schedules and earn greater incentive payouts and will introduce new training options, including through advances in technology and the gamificaiton of educational experiences.
Overall, I'm pleased with what I see operationally and with our merchandising. The investments we are making our people, remodels and technology are helping to ensure that our stores are easy to navigate, fast, friendly and fun to shop. Adding a great stores or site starts with having great merchandise. In our stores you can see the quality improvements in fresh food and in apparel with our new private brands. We're also doing well in our seasonal businesses and toys.
We're making progress in eCommerce. Our focus remains on earning repeat visits and strengthening our assortment of merchandise. We're expanding our assortment, improving search, enhancing our website and executing better on the fundamentals such as product reviews, inventory mirroring and on-time delivery to accomplish this. And of course, we remain committed to providing a superior value proposition as we compete aggressively on price across a broad spectrum of products. 
Sales in eCommerce increased 40% for the year. We will continue to play off and innovate as we shape the future of omni-retail. This includes the expansion of innovative services like online grocery pickup and delivery. 
Our previous investments in fulfillment centers and systems plus our acquisitions are helping us drive strong sales. But we need to make more progress to improve profitability. Our fulfillment shipping costs for improving as we continue to enhance our assortment, repeat visits should increase and contribute to improved profitability.
We make good progress through the year to add more brands and exclusive items through new partnerships with Lord & Taylor, Ellen Degeneres, Advanced Auto, Sofia Vergara and Fanatics, to name a few. These initiatives are continuing to the improvements we see in key metrics like the customer value index as well as NPS, which is now more than 10 points ahead of last year. 
Many opportunities exist, mainly driven by data and we look to leverage our unique assets and capability better than we do today. 
At Sam's Club, the team has taken bold steps to transform the business by focusing on people, products and working in a more digital way. Excluding fuel and tobacco, comp sales for the year increased 5.7% and eCommerce sales grew 27%. When someone downloads the app, shops on SamsClub.com or uses Scan & Go, they're more likely to renew. 
We're encouraged by the trends we see in membership. As of year end, we saw improvements in sign-ups and plus penetration and membership count is essentially flat to where it was a year ago despite the closure of nearly 10% of the fleet. 
In international, 8 of our markets posted positive comp sales for the year, including the 4 major markets. And overall sales increased 2.9% in constant currency. It's been a big year for international as we run the business while shaping the portfolio.
Walmex continues to be strong. The improvements we're making are helping drive traffic and we saw improvements in NPS in each of our formats. Similar to the U.S., we're now leveraging our store base to offer same-day delivery. We recently expanded the available assortment to offer more than 5,000 general merchandise items to this service.  We continue to invest in our stores and in eCommerce to build an omnichannel experience tailored to customers in this market. 
Our business in Canada also continues to perform well. The team is moving quickly to modernize the store base and expand omnichannel capabilities with a focus on gaining greater access to urban markets. For example, we've entered into new partnerships this year in cities like Toronto and Vancouver to help expand our delivery options in grocery and general merchandise. In the U.K., Brexit and the potential implications of a hard Brexit is increasingly on the mind of everyone. No matter the situation, we will always work to keep prices as low as possible for its customers. A team were in the U.K. a few weeks ago and I'm really impressed with their performance, their attitudes and their leadership. They're amazing.
In India, we remain optimistic about the eCommerce opportunity given the size of the market, the low penetration of eCommerce in the retail channel and the pace at which it's growing. In the future, we hope to work with the government for pro-growth policies that can allow this nascent industry and the domestic manufacturers, farmers and suppliers that benefit from it to develop and prosper. In terms of the regulatory environment, we were disappointed in the recent change in law and the lack of consultation, but the team has worked to ensure we are in compliance with the new rules. We're committed to providing's sellers with a world-class platform to sell on and customers with a high quality of service. We hope for a collaborative regulatory process going forward which results in a level playing field.
Turning to China, we continue to see significant growth opportunities. Overall, we've identified provinces that are a priority for us and we're improving the value proposition through better quality of fresh items as well as with new store designs and omnichannel initiatives. Uncertainties with trade or other macro factors can make for a more challenging environment. But I like the things we're doing to position ourselves in this important market.
Across international, we are accelerating omnichannel capabilities. With a further long partnership due to partnership with JD.com, our relationship with Tencent and the investments we made on last-mile delivery. We're also accelerating on the growth in Canada, Mexico, Chile and Japan through partnerships and acquisitions. The international team has the talent and scale to deliver sustainable growth for the company and to make a difference in communities across the globe.
In closing, let me say how pleased I am about all that we've accomplished over the last year and how excited I am about what's still to come. We see the future as a frictionless experience across stores and eCommerce, but we have more work to do as customers rate their expectations. Competition persists in the omni-retail store and continues to evolve. 
We fully expect the pace of change to accelerate in the next 5 years versus the last 5 years as emerging technologies come together to transform retail even further, and we're adapting. What we once could only imagine a decade ago will increasingly become reality. We will embrace new technologies to solve problems for customers in a seamless way and equip associates with tools to make them more productive. Within our ecosystem, we will pursue and grow adjacent businesses to increase customer engagement and will leverage core capabilities to deliver services to others that could generate new revenue streams.
Our commitment to the customer is clear. We'll be there when, where and how they want to shop. Our distinctive set of assets, financial strength and innovative culture are delivering the customers new experiences that are uniquely Walmart.
Brett, you want to pick it up there?"

Walmart had a really good year and we're pleased with the fourth quarter results as well. We had momentum as we entered the new fiscal year and will continue to execute against our strategic plan which we believe is the winning formula long-term. 
I'll start this morning by highlighting some key accomplishments for the full year. Total revenue at constant currency was just over $515 billion and increased $14.8 billion or 3%. Walmart U.S. comp sales grew 3.6%, the highest annual growth rate in 10 years. Walmart U.S. eCommerce sales grew 40%, nearly doubling the sales of that business over the past 2 years. 
We made a number of strategic choices to position Walmart International for success, including the acquisition of a majority stake in Flipkart and the sale of the majority of our business in Brazil. We made progress on expenses and I'm particularly proud of the leverage in Walmart U.S. stores. 
Excluding discrete items from last year, we leverage total company expenses slightly as we expected coming into the year. 
Adjusted EPS increased 11% to $4.91. Operating cash flow was strong at $27.8 billion, and the company returned $13.5 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
We're pleased with what we accomplished but not satisfied. This year and the quarter are further proof that our financial strength gives us the ability to deliver near-term results while positioning the business for the longer term. We're leveraging our scale, unique assets and financial strength in ways others can't.
Now let's move on to the fourth quarter. We delivered strong fourth quarter top line growth that total constant currency revenue grew 3.1% to $140.5 billion, with currency having a negative effect of approximately $1.7 billion. 
Walmart U.S. comp sales growth of 4.2% was a bit better-than-expected as strong holiday results in an early release of government assistance benefited sales. International grew net sales 2.7% in constant currency led by strength at Walmex. And Sam's Club had solid comp sales growth of 5.3%, excluding fuel and tobacco.
Consolidated gross margin -- gross profit margin declined 21 basis points due primarily to the mix effect from eCommerce growth in India and the U.S. and price investments in certain markets. We had some benefit in the quarter from lapping last year's discrete items. 
SG&A leverage and operating income benefited from lapping last year's discrete items but was partially offset by dilution from Flipkart. Excluding these items, we would've leverage expenses in the quarter and operating income would've increased slightly on a constant-currency basis.
The adjusted tax rate was within our expectations for the year at 24.6%. As a reminder, the adjusted tax rate excludes the effect of the value change in our investment in JD.com, adjustments related to tax reform in the change for the divestiture of a majority stake in Walmart Brazil. 
For the fourth quarter, the adjusted tax rate was 22.8% and benefited EPS by about $0.04 per share, primarily due to the effect of numerous federal tax regulations issued late in Q4. 
Adjusted EPS increased 6% to $1.41 and GAAP EPS was $1.27. 
Now let's discuss the quarterly results for each operating segment. Walmart U.S. continued to have great sales momentum. Comp sales excluding fuel grew 4.2% in the quarter and 6.8% on a 2 year stack basis, the best result in 9 years. We started the quarter with strong Thanksgiving and holiday shopping and finished the quarter with strong winter seasonal sales. Although base sales were strong, we did experience a benefit to comp sales of about 40 basis points from early snack funding. Clearly, we're operating in a healthy consumer environment but our integrated omni-offering provided the convenience customers were looking for during the holiday season.
We had solid traffic and ticket of 0.9% and 3.3%, respectively; while eCommerce sales grew 43% and contributed approximately 100 basis -- 180 basis points of segment comp. We're encouraged by the market share gains we saw in key categories according to Nielsen and the FPD Group. 
Our strong mid-single-digit comp growth in grocery led to the best 2 year stack in 9 years. Health and wellness delivered a low single-digit comp sales gain and general merchandise comp sales were up mid-single-digit percentage, with a strong holiday performance of toys and seasonal categories. Our inventory position is good as we enter the new year.
And Walmart U.S. eCommerce would make good progress in a number of initiatives as Doug mentioned. We're still working to optimize our margin mix so that we can achieve the long-term profit profile we want. The team is working with a great sense of urgency to increase sales in key areas like home and apparel, which will help margin rates while simultaneously investing in new innovative solutions.
As we outlined in October, we expect our losses in eCommerce to increase this coming year reflecting investments in infrastructure, people, online grocery and store number initiatives. While we've made good progress against our strategy in recent years, we still have great opportunity in front of us. We remain excited about the opportunity in grocery pickup and delivery and plan to double the current number of stores that offer same-day grocery delivery in the coming year while also adding grocery pickups to another 1,000 stores. The boundaries between physical and online retail continue to blur, and we're in great position to capitalize on that.
Walmart U.S. gross margin rate declined 27 basis points due primarily to the increasing mix of eCommerce growth, pricing strategy and higher transportation expenses. Expense leverage was strong, reflecting strong sales, increased productivity and overlap from last year's discrete items. The Walmart U.S. stores team has leveraged expenses for an impressive 8 consecutive quarters, even after raising the starting wage rate earlier this year.  Operating income increased by more than 7% during the quarter. Overall, we're really pleased with the momentum we have in the Walmart U.S. business.
Moving to International, net sales in constant currency increased 2.7% but declined 2.3% on a reported basis due to the negative currency effect of approximately $1.7 billion. The deconsolidation of Brazil was a sales headwind offset by the inclusion of Flipkart sales for a full quarter.
Of our major markets we saw positive comps from Walmex, Canada and the U.K. Results in Mexico were strong again with comp sales growth of 4.6% in the quarter and we continue to grow faster than the market in key traffic driving categories, including food and staples according to [indiscernible]. 
In the U.K., as is progress of improving the value proposition growing online grocery share and expanding private-label penetration contributed to its seventh consecutive quarter of positive comps. 
In China, we saw a slightly negative comp in the quarter as the calendar shift to the Mid-Autumn Festival and a slower economic environment affected sales growth. Without the calendar shift, comp sales would have been positive.
As expected, international operating income declined 2.8% in constant currency and 9.9% on a reported basis. Factors affecting our fourth quarter comparison include the dilution from Flipkart, partially offset by the positive effect from lapping last year's discrete charges. Flipkart's results were in line with our expectations.  Overall, we're pleased with the progress being made in Walmart International. 
Sam's Club delivered solid comp sales growth of 3.3% excluding fuel and 5.3% when excluding fuel and tobacco. The transfer of sales from closed clubs to existing clubs contributed approximately half of the comp growth and eCommerce sales grew 21%. We're seeing improved membership sign-ups and NPS scores and in fact despite closing 10% of our clubs at the end of last year, overall membership counts are about flat year-over-year.
Sam's operating income increased primarily due to lapping last year's discrete charges for club closures. Excluding these items, operating income would have been flat excluding fuel at up about 9% with fuel.
I'll close today with guidance for fiscal year 2020. As always, we have several assumptions in our guidance, including the economic conditions, currency rates and the tax and regulatory landscape in our largest and most important markets remain generally consistent. 
As always, we have not included any potential change in the value of our investment in JD.com. We also continue to monitor the ongoing tariff discussions. As we mentioned in October, we will actively manage pricing and margins as warranted with our customers and shareholders in mind. 
Regarding Flipkart, with any change like this, there can be some disruption to the business. But we feel good about our ability to transition with minimal interruption. There will be some additional cost to comply with the new regulations, but we don't currently believe they will be significant enough impact to our total guidance for the year.
You'll recall we issued fiscal year 2020 earnings last October. While there's been some growing honesty in the overall macroeconomic and political environment, we're confident in our ability to operate our business and serve customers effectively in most any economic climate. 
We finished the year with good momentum. So today, we're reiterating the previous guidance provided in October which speaks to the consistency of our business. 
I'll highlight a few of the key guidance metrics and you can find a complete listing in this morning's press release. I'll start with sales guidance. We expect to deliver total net sales growth of at least 3% on a constant-currency basis in FY '20, with the back half of the year a little stronger than the first half due to some timing comparison, including the deconsolidation of Brazil and the addition of Flipkart. Keep in mind that on a reported basis we've seen increased pressure from currency as noted in our fourth quarter results. If the current spot rates were to continue into next year, there would be a currency headwind to reported sales of around $3 billion with most of that impact in the first half of the year.
For Walmart U.S., we still expect comp sales growth of 2.5% to 3% despite the more difficult comparisons. We expect the quarterly change of comp sales growth to be fairly consistent throughout the year ranging from approximately 2.5% to 3.5% at any given quarter. 
Walmart U.S. eCommerce is expected to grow sales around 35% FY '20. And we expect the quarterly growth to range from around 30% to the low 40% range.
We still expect to leverage expenses by approximately 20 basis points in FY '20. We'll continue to make progress on being more efficient and lowering costs especially in Walmart U.S. stores where we expect leverage to be even higher than the 20 basis points due to continuing strong sales and improved productivity.  On a consolidated basis, we expect to slightly lever in Q1 with leverage improving each quarter during the year. Timing of expenses can impact leverage quarter-to-quarter versus our expectations.
Turning to profitability, we continue to expect consolidated operating income dollars to decline by the low single-digit percentage, primarily due to Flipkart being included for the full year versus the partial year in fiscal 2019. We would expect operating income to increase excluding the Flipkart effects.
We expect EPS to decline by low single-digit percentage which assumes an effective tax rate of approximately 26.5% to 27.5%. Keep in mind that the increase in the rate relative to FY '19 adjusted tax rate relates to the Flipkart losses having very little tax benefit in the near term which we've mentioned previously.
Excluding the full year EPS dilution expected from Flipkart, we would expect EPS to grow by a low to mid-single-digit percentage.
As you would expect, the quarterly year-over-year change in operating income and EPS may be quite varied during the year due primarily to the impact of Flipkart only being in our results in part of Q3  and all of Q4 last year. We currently expect operating income and EPS to decrease by around 10% in Q1, decrease by a low to mid-single-digit percentage in Q2 and Q3 an increase in Q4 to achieve our full year guidance. As always, the growth quarter-to-quarter can change due to timing and other factors.
Our priorities for capital allocation remain unchanged. We'll focus first on investing in our business and growth initiatives. We also remain committed to our dividend as evidenced by the increase we announced today, so we continue with our current share repurchase program.
Before I close, I want to share a change in the communication cadence with analysts and investors. Similar to the past, we will host a question-and-answer session in Arkansas in June in conjunction with our annual shareholders meeting. However, instead of hosting an investment community meeting in October as we typically have, we plan to have an event in February 2020 in New York in conjunction with our Q4 earnings release. This meeting will be similar to the format we've typically had where you'll hear updates on our performance, guidance and strategy and interact with key leaders. But no location is closer to many of you. As always, we'll continue to assess the optimal approach to communicating with our investors and analysts.
Let me close by saying thank you for your support of our company. I'm as optimistic as I've ever been about what Walmart can become. It's a great company with a long history of transformation and we expect to win.
And with that, I'd be happy to take your questions."

We've talked a lot over the last few months about [indiscernible]  quarters expense leverage. It comes from a number of different places. We're seeing great expense leverage in the U.S., certainly good comp sales helps a lot with that. But the technology and the training that we've done in the past, technology put in place, the training we've done in the past several years is really paying dividends in the stores with our associates and how we serve our customers. So as you saw even in October, some of the technology that's coming, some things we keep doing with our stores, we expect the productivity in the U.S. stores will continue to be a big part of what we do. When you look at really around the world, we're seeing good results and leverage around the world in different pockets. As you know, with leverage it can be a lot of small things that add up. But we're doing some bigger things as well. I've talk recently about the work we're doing in church services that we're viewing that as more of a real strength to the company. This past year, we hired a cheaper, term officer for the first time for good, it's not resale so we're putting more effort toward using our scale to benefit our leverage. So I feel good about the numbers we've put out. And I think there's going to be room for us. The timing of that is always challenging to figure out. You're correct on gross margin, and that's the implication that we have. We're going to continue to invest in price for the customer which we've done. The mix of the business will continue to change which changes a bit the nature of our company. And we've always said a couple of things. One is getting our expenses right allows us to do what we need to do with gross margin perspective to remain competitive and be there for our customers. And so that's the main thing we want to do with expenses. And we have a lot of leverage to pull as a company that we can make changes throughout the year. I hope that answers your questions, Simeon."

So and that includes a lot of items they are not food items. And then over time, we just keep adding as the stores learn how to pick categories that are different in nature than food. It's a different situation to go and pick lightbulbs or go and pick some of these categories that may not have as much shelf capacity as we have in food. So we have to learn how to adjust our modulars so that you can expand the categories and the items. I do think that will help mix over time. And we may have seen that already.

You can decouple the speed of delivery in a way that helps us manage costs. So as the volume goes up and density improves we'll try to figure out how to drive the basket business that looks more like a dense route than a 1 hour or 30-minute race to deliver to somebody's house. That may be different for restaurant delivery than it is for grocery delivery. It seems like those use cases are different enough. So we got some tests going on and real-time learning here to try and do it in a way that customers want it to be done and create that optionality for them.

We're encouraged by our performance for the year because we believe our customers are noticing our improvements, but we continue to see many ways we can serve them better. We're even more convinced they want us and expect us to bring our stores and eCommerce businesses together in a digitally connected seamless way that makes shopping easier. We experienced a favorable economic environment in the U.S. for much of the year and our associates made a lot happen to drive the strength of our results.
Brett will go into more detail on our results shortly. I am particularly encouraged by our sales results in the quarter. In Q4, Walmart U.S. grew comp sales 4.2%, excluding fuel;  eCommerce sales increased 43% and we gained market share in key categories such as grocery and toys according to Nielsen and the NPD Group.
Sam's Club finished the year with another strong quarter with comp sales growth of 5.3%, excluding fuel and tobacco; and in International, comps were positive in the majority of our markets.  Strong top line results allow us to reiterate the FY '20 sales and profit guidance we gave in October even as we landed FY '19 ahead of where we expected. We strive to make everyday easier for busy families as we increase convenience and save them money and time. Part of our strategy is to build on our existing strengths such as having a broad assortment, including fresh and perishable foods within 10 miles of 90% of the U.S. population. Our stores and clubs are becoming more digital and we're using technology to change how we work. More customers can now access our brand through multiple channels and it's important that we engage them in different ways.  We learned that those customers who shop with us both in stores and online spend about twice as much in total and they spend more in our stores.
Across the business, you can see examples of how we're meeting the changing needs of customers and delivering solutions that are increasing customer engagement. In the U.S., we offer grocery pickup at more than 2,100 locations and grocery delivery at nearly 800 locations, which represents about 69% and 36% of the population, respectively. Feedback from customers about these services continues to be very positive, which speaks of the capabilities of our roughly 37,000 personal shoppers.
In Mexico, we're delighting customers with new experiences such as a secured digital payment option. It's available on their mobile phones and in-store kiosks that offer a broad assortment of products with flexible pickup times. In addition, through our investment in the crowd-sourced delivery platform Dada-JD Daojia, customers in China get their merchandise in less than an hour by placing the order and it's picked from a network of more than 280 locations.
We continue to build trust, which we believe will become even more of a competitive advantage. Around the world, Walmart plays an important role in the communities we serve by using our scale for good. Whether it's our work to promote small businesses in local farmers in places like India or larger scale initiatives such as our effort to double our use of renewable energy in the U.S. by 2025, customers can feel good about Walmart, a company that starts every day with a goal of earning their business.
It's nice to be recognized for the work we're doing to promote shared value. In fact, the company recently received an A- rating on the CDP's annual environmental scorecard, up from a B rating last year. And we're ranked as the survey's top-performing U.S.-based food retailer.
Shared value is an important concept and something that we have fully embraced as we think about how to best allocate our time and capital, deliver strong efficient growth, reduce costs and operate with discipline. Within this construct, customers, associates, communities and shareholders can win.
Now let's move on to highlights from the year for our operating segments. I'll begin with Walmart U.S. where the team had a great year. Comp sales growth of 3.6% for fiscal year '19 exceeded our expectations. The work the team has done to balance inventory levels within stock rates is impressive. The team leveraged operating expenses overall even as we invested in wages, training, technology and eCommerce. Store-level productivity is strong due in part to the training we're providing our associates. As the nature of work continues to change, we're innovating to empower associates to better serve customers as they develop new skills, driving their jobs and growing their careers. This coming year, we'll add new ways for associates to better manage their schedules and earn greater incentive payouts and will introduce new training options, including through advances in technology and the gamification of educational experiences.
Overall, I'm pleased with what I see operationally and with our merchandising. The investments we're making in our people, remodels and technology are helping to ensure that our stores are easy to navigate, fast, friendly and fun to shop. Adding a great store or site starts with having great merchandise. In our stores, you can see the quality improvements in fresh food and in apparel with our new private brands. We're also doing well in our seasonal businesses and toys.
We're making progress in eCommerce. Our focus remains on earning repeat visits and strengthening our assortment of merchandise. We're expanding our assortment, improving search, enhancing our website and executing better on the fundamentals such as product reviews, inventory mirroring and on-time delivery to accomplish this. And of course, we remain committed to providing a superior value proposition as we compete aggressively on price across a broad spectrum of products.
Sales in eCommerce increased 40% for the year. We will continue to play offence and innovate as we shape the future of omni-retail. This includes the expansion of innovative services like online grocery pickup and delivery.
Our previous investments in fulfillment centers and systems plus our acquisitions are helping us drive strong sales, but we need to make more progress to improve profitability. Our fulfillment shipping costs are improving as we continue to enhance our assortment, repeat visits should increase and contribute to improve profitability.
We made good progress during the year to add more brands and exclusive items through new partnerships with Lord & Taylor, Ellen DeGeneres, Advance Auto, Sofia Vergara and Fanatics, to name a few. These initiatives are contributing to the improvements we see in key metrics like the customer value index as well as NPS, which is now more than 10 points ahead of last year.
Many opportunities exist, mainly driven by data and we'll look to leverage our unique assets and capability better than we do today.
At Sam's Club, the team has taken bold steps to transform the business by focusing on people, products and working in a more digital way. Excluding fuel and tobacco, comp sales for the year increased 5.7% and eCommerce sales grew 27%. When someone downloads the app, shops on SamsClub.com or uses Scan & Go, they're more likely to renew.
We're encouraged by the trends we see in membership. As of year-end, we saw improvements in sign-ups and plus penetration and membership count is essentially flat to where it was a year ago despite the closure of nearly 10% of the fleet.
In International, 8 of our markets posted positive comp sales for the year, including the 4 major markets. And overall sales increased 2.9% in constant currency. It's been a big year for International as we run the business while shaping the portfolio.
Walmex continues to be strong. The improvements we're making are helping drive traffic and we saw improvements in NPS in each of our formats. Similar to the U.S., we're now leveraging our store base to offer same-day delivery. We recently expanded the available assortment to offer more than 5,000 general merchandised items to this service. We'll continue to invest in our stores and in eCommerce to build an omni-channel experience tailored to customers in this market.
Our business in Canada also continues to perform well. The team is moving quickly to modernize the store base and expand omni-channel capabilities with a focus on gaining greater access to urban markets. For example, we've entered into new partnerships this year in cities like Toronto and Vancouver to help expand our delivery options in grocery and general merchandise. In the U.K., Brexit and the potential implications of a hard Brexit is increasingly on the mind of everyone. No matter the situation, as we'll always work to keep prices as low as possible for its customers. I visited our team in the U.K. a few weeks ago and I'm really impressed with their performance, their attitudes and their leadership. They're amazing.
In India, we remain optimistic about the eCommerce opportunity given the size of the market, the low penetration of eCommerce in the retail channel and the pace at which it's growing. In the future, we hope to work with the government for pro-growth policies that can allow this nascent industry and the domestic manufacturers, farmers and suppliers that benefit from it to develop and prosper. In terms of the regulatory environment, we were disappointed in the recent change in law and the lack of consultation, but the team has worked to ensure we're in compliance with the new rules. We're committed to providing sellers with a world-class platform to sell on and customers with a high quality of service. We hope for a collaborative regulatory process going forward, which results in a level playing field.
Turning to China, we continue to see significant growth opportunities. Overall, we've identified provinces that are a priority for us and we're improving the value proposition through better quality of fresh items as well as with new store designs and omni-channel initiatives. Uncertainties with trade or other macro factors can make for a more challenging environment. But I like the things we're doing to position ourselves in this important market.
Across International, we're accelerating omni-channel capabilities with [indiscernible] along in China due to the partnership with JD.com, our relationship with Tencent and the investments we've made in last-mile delivery. We're also accelerating omni growth in Canada, Mexico, Chile and Japan through partnerships and acquisitions. The International team has the talent and scale to deliver sustainable growth for the company and to make a difference in communities across the globe.
In closing, let me say how pleased I am about all that we've accomplished over the last year and how excited I am about what's still to come. We see the future as a frictionless experience across stores and eCommerce, but we have more work to do as customers raise their expectations, competition persists and the omni-retail story continues to evolve. 
We fully expect the pace of change to accelerate in the next 5 years versus the last 5 years as emerging technologies come together to transform retail even further, and we're adapting. What we once could only imagine a decade ago will increasingly become reality. We will embrace new technologies to solve problems for customers in a seamless way and equip associates with tools to make them more productive. Within our ecosystem, we will pursue and grow adjacent businesses to increase customer engagement and will leverage core capabilities to deliver services to others that could generate new revenue streams.
Our commitment to the customer is clear. We'll be there when, where and how they want to shop. Our distinctive set of assets, financial strength and innovative culture are delivering the customers new experiences that are uniquely Walmart.
Brett, you want to pick it up there?"

Walmart had a really good year and we're pleased with the fourth quarter results as well. We have momentum as we entered the new fiscal year and will continue to execute against our strategic plan, which we believe is the winning formula long term.
I'll start this morning by highlighting some key accomplishments for the full year. Total revenue at constant currency was just over $515 billion and increased $14.8 billion or 3%. Walmart U.S. comp sales grew 3.6%, the highest annual growth rate in 10 years. Walmart U.S. eCommerce sales grew 40%, nearly doubling the sales of that business over the past 2 years.
We made a number of strategic choices to position Walmart International for success, including the acquisition of a majority stake in Flipkart and the sale of the majority of our business in Brazil. We made progress on expenses and I'm particularly proud of the leverage in Walmart U.S. stores.
Excluding discrete items from last year, we leverage total company expenses slightly as we expected coming into the year.
Adjusted EPS increased 11% to $4.91. Operating cash flow was strong at $27.8 billion, and the company returned $13.5 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
We're pleased with what we accomplished, but not satisfied. This year and quarter are further proof that our financial strength gives us the ability to deliver near-term results, while positioning the business for the longer term. We're leveraging our scale, unique assets and financial strength in ways others can't.
Now let's move on to the fourth quarter. We delivered strong fourth quarter top line growth that total constant currency revenue grew 3.1% to $140.5 billion, with currency having a negative effect of approximately $1.7 billion.
Walmart U.S. comp sales growth of 4.2% was a bit better-than-expected as strong holiday results in an early release of government assistance benefited sales. International grew net sales 2.7% in constant currency led by strength at Walmex. And Sam's Club had solid comp sales growth of 5.3%, excluding fuel and tobacco.
Consolidated gross margin -- gross profit margin declined 21 basis points due primarily to the mix effect from eCommerce growth in India and the U.S. and price investments in certain markets. We had some benefit in the quarter from lapping last year's discrete items.
SG&A leverage and operating income benefited from lapping last year's discrete items, but was partially offset by dilution from Flipkart. Excluding these items, we would have leverage expenses in the quarter and operating income would have increased slightly on a constant-currency basis.
The adjusted tax rate was within our expectations for the year at 24.6%. As a reminder, the adjusted tax rate excludes the effect of the value change in our investment in JD.com, adjustments related to tax reform and the change for the divestiture of a majority stake in Walmart Brazil.
For the fourth quarter, the adjusted tax rate was 22.8% and benefited EPS by about $0.04 per share, primarily due to the effect of numerous federal tax regulations issued late in Q4.
Adjusted EPS increased 6% to $1.41 and GAAP EPS was $1.27.
Now let's discuss the quarterly results for each operating segment. Walmart U.S. continued to have great sales momentum. Comp sales excluding fuel grew 4.2% in the quarter and 6.8% on a 2-year stack basis, the best result in 9 years. We started the quarter with strong Thanksgiving and holiday shopping and finished the quarter with strong winter seasonal sales. Although base sales were strong, we did experience a benefit to comp sales of about 40 basis points from early snack funding. Clearly, we're operating in a healthy consumer environment, but our integrated omni-offering provided the convenience customers were looking for during the holiday season.
We had solid traffic and ticket of 0.9% and 3.3%, respectively; while eCommerce sales grew 43% and contributed approximately 100 basis -- 180 basis points of the segment comp. We're encouraged by the market share gains we saw in key categories according to Nielsen and NPD Group.
Our strong mid-single-digit comp growth in grocery led to the best 2-year stack in 9 years. Health and wellness delivered a low single-digit comp sales gain, and general merchandise comp sales were up mid-single-digit percentage, with a strong holiday performance of toys and seasonal categories. Our inventory position is good as we enter the new year.
And Walmart U.S. eCommerce would make good progress on a number of initiatives as Doug mentioned. We're still working to optimize our margin mix so that we can achieve the long-term profit profile we want. The team is working with a great sense of urgency to increase sales in key areas like home and apparel, which will help margin rates while simultaneously investing in new innovative solutions.
As we outlined in October, we expect our losses in eCommerce to increase this coming year reflecting investments in infrastructure, people, online grocery and Store #8 initiatives. While we've made good progress against our strategy in recent years, we still have great opportunity in front of us. We remain excited about the opportunity in grocery pickup and delivery and plan to double the current number of stores that offer same-day grocery delivery in the coming year, while also adding grocery pickups to another 1,000 stores. The boundaries between physical and online retail continue to blur, and we're in great position to capitalize on that.
Walmart U.S. gross margin rate declined 27 basis points due primarily to the increasing mix of eCommerce growth, pricing strategy and higher transportation expenses. Expense leverage was strong, reflecting strong sales, increased productivity and overlap from last year's discrete items. The Walmart U.S. stores team has leveraged expenses for an impressive eighth consecutive quarters, even after raising the starting wage rate earlier this year.
Operating income increased by more than 7% during the quarter. Overall, we're really pleased with the momentum we have in the Walmart U.S. business.
Moving to International, net sales in constant currency increased 2.7%, but declined 2.3% on a reported basis due to the negative currency effect of approximately $1.7 billion. The deconsolidation of Brazil was a sales headwind offset by the inclusion of Flipkart sales for a full quarter.
Of our major markets we saw positive comps from Walmex, Canada and the U.K., results in Mexico were strong again with comp sales growth of 4.6% in the quarter and we continue to grow faster than the market in key traffic driving categories, including food and staples according to ANTAD.
In the U.K., as this progress on improving the value proposition growing, online grocery share and expanding private-label penetration contributed to its seventh consecutive quarter of positive comps.
In China, we saw a slightly negative comp in the quarter as the calendar shift to the Mid-Autumn Festival and a slower economic environment affected sales growth. Without the calendar shift, comp sales would have been positive.
As expected, International operating income declined 2.8% in constant currency and 9.9% on a reported basis. Factors affecting our fourth quarter comparison include the dilution from Flipkart, partially offset by the positive effect from lapping last year's discrete charges. Flipkart's results were in line with our expectations. Overall, we're pleased with the progress being made in Walmart International.
Sam's Club delivered solid comp sales growth of 3.3%, excluding fuel and 5.3% when excluding fuel and tobacco. The transfer of sales from closed clubs to existing clubs contributed approximately half of the comp growth and eCommerce sales grew 21%. We're seeing improved membership sign-ups and NPS scores and in fact despite closing 10% of our clubs at the end of last year, overall membership counts are about flat year-over-year.
Sam's operating income increased primarily due to lapping last year's discrete charges for club closures. Excluding these items, operating income would have been flat excluding fuel and up about 9% with fuel.
I'll close today with guidance for fiscal year 2020. As always, we have several assumptions in our guidance, including the economic conditions, currency rates and the tax and regulatory landscape and our largest and most important markets remain generally consistent.
As always, we have not included any potential change in the value of our investment in JD.com. We're also continuing to monitor the ongoing tariff discussions. As we mentioned in October, we will actively manage pricing and margins as warranted with our customers and shareholders in mind.
Regarding Flipkart, with any change like this, there can be some disruption to the business. But we feel good about our ability to transition with minimal interruption. There'll be some additional costs to comply with the new regulations, but we don't currently believe they will be significant enough to impact total company guidance for the year.
You'll recall we issued fiscal year 2020 guidance last October. While there's been some growing uncertainty in the overall macroeconomic and political environment, we're confident in our ability to operate our business and serve customers effectively in most any economic climate.
We finished the year with good momentum. So today, we're reiterating the previous guidance provided in October, which speaks to the consistency of our business.
I'll highlight a few of the key guidance metrics and you can find a complete listing in this morning's press release. I'll start with sales guidance. We expect to deliver total net sales growth of at least 3% on a constant-currency basis in FY '20, with the back half of the year a little stronger than the first half due to some timing comparison, including the deconsolidation of Brazil and the addition of Flipkart. Keep in mind, on a reported basis, we've seen increased pressure from currency as noted in our fourth quarter results. If the current spot rates were to continue into next year, there'd be a currency headwind to reported sales of around $3 billion with most of that impact in the first half of the year.
For Walmart U.S., we still expect comp sales growth of 2.5% to 3% despite the more difficult comparisons. We expect the quarterly cadence of comp sales growth to be fairly consistent throughout the year ranging from approximately 2.5% to 3.5% in any given quarter.
Walmart U.S. eCommerce is expected to grow sales around 35% FY '20. And we expect the quarterly growth to range from around 30% to the low 40% range.
We still expect to leverage expenses by approximately 20 basis points in FY '20. We'll continue to make progress on being more efficient and lowering costs, especially in Walmart U.S. stores where we expect leverage to be even higher than the 20 basis points due to continuing strong sales and improved productivity. On a consolidated basis, we expect to slightly lever in Q1 with leverage improving each quarter during the year. Timing of expenses can impact leverage quarter-to-quarter versus our expectations.
Turning to profitability, we continue to expect consolidated operating income dollars to decline by low single-digit percentage, primarily due to Flipkart being included for the full year versus the partial year in fiscal 2019. We would expect operating income to increase excluding the Flipkart effects.
We expect EPS to decline by low single-digit percentage, which assumes an effective tax rate of approximately 26.5% to 27.5%. Keep in mind that the increase in the rate relative to FY '19's adjusted tax rate relates to the Flipkart losses having very little tax benefit in the near term, which we've mentioned previously.
Excluding the full year EPS dilution expected from Flipkart, we would expect EPS to grow by a low to mid-single-digit percentage.
As you would expect, the quarterly year-over-year change in operating income and EPS will be quite varied during the year due primarily to the impact of Flipkart only being in our results in part of Q3  and all of Q4 last year. We currently expect operating income and EPS to decrease by around 10% in Q1, decrease by a low to mid-single-digit percentage in Q2 and Q3 and increase in Q4 to achieve our full year guidance. As always, the growth quarter-to-quarter can change due to timing and other factors.
Our priorities for capital allocation remain unchanged. We'll focus first on investing in our business and growth initiatives. We also remain committed to our dividend as evidenced by the increase we announced today, and we'll continue with our current share repurchase program.
Before I close, I want to share a change in the communication cadence with the analysts and investors. Similar to the past, we will host a question-and-answer session in Northwest Arkansas in June in conjunction with our Annual Shareholders Meeting. However, instead of hosting an investment community meeting in October as we typically have, we plan to have an event in February 2020 in New York in conjunction with our Q4 earnings release. This meeting will be similar to the format we've typically had where you'll hear updates on our performance, guidance and strategy and interact with key leaders, but in the location that's closer to many of you. As always, we'll continue to assess the optimal approach to communicating with our investors and analysts.
Let me close by saying thank you for your support of our company. I'm as optimistic as I've ever been about what Walmart can become. It's a great company with a long history of transformation and we expect to win.
And with that, I'd be happy to take your questions."

But it's the technology and the training that we've done in the past, technology put in place, the training we've done over the past several years is really paying dividends in the stores with our associates and how we serve our customers. So as you saw even in October, some of the technology that's coming, some things we keep doing with our stores, we expect the productivity in the U.S. stores will continue to be a big part of what we do. When you look at really around the world, we're seeing good results and leverage around the world in different pockets. As you know, with leverage, it can be a lot of small things that add up. But we're doing some bigger things as well. I've talked recently about the work we're doing in shared services that we're viewing that as more of a real strength to the company. This past year, we hired a Chief Procurement Officer for the first time for goods, not for resale and so we're putting more effort toward using our scale to benefit our leverage. So I feel good about the numbers we've put out. And I think there's going to be room for us. The timing of that is always challenging to figure out. You're correct on gross margin, and that's the implication that we have. We're going to continue to invest in price for the customer, which we've done. The mix of the business will continue to change, which changes a bit the nature of our company. And we've always said a couple of things: one is getting our expenses right allows us to do we need to do from a gross margin perspective to remain competitive and be there for our customers. And so that's the main thing we want to do with expenses. And we have a lot of leverage to pull as a company that we can make changes throughout the year. I hope I answered your question, Simeon."

And there are different components of that basket. There's the pick cost, the shipping cost and then just the gross margin on the products.

So I think the ramp there in terms of how comp stores will behave in addition to the rollout that we're doing for additional stores is going to continue to be strong. We have been adding assortment over time. Some of the happiest customers that I have come across are customers that can place their back-to-school order and a grocery order together and go through pickup and knockout that list of things that you need for your kids as they go back to school. So and that includes a lot of items they are not food items. And then over time, we just keep adding as the stores learn how to pick categories that are different in nature than food. It's a different situation to go and pick light bulbs or to go pick some of these categories that may not have as much shelf capacity as we have in food. So we have to learn how to adjust our modulars so that you can expand the categories and the items. And I do think that'll help mix over time. And we may have seen that already. I haven't been tracking that part of it that closely, but it makes sense that, that basket would change shape and profitability would look better."

I mean, being a merchant for so much of my career, I have so much respect for the way that they have driven in-stock levels, reduce inventory, reduce deleted inventory for quarter-after-quarter now. What happened in this case is that we saw the snap shift into the end of January. We built food inventories at the end of the quarter to make sure we were maximizing that opportunity. There's a little bit of pull forward of inventory in anticipation of what tariffs could mean in a worst-case scenario, although we certainly hope and expect that, that won't happen. So I'm not worried about the inventory level. It's high quality and there's a bit of a timing difference there, and overall that picture still looks really good."

We're encouraged by our performance for the year because we believe our customers are noticing our improvements, but we continue to see many ways we can serve them better. We're even more convinced they want us and expect us to bring our stores and eCommerce businesses together in a digitally connected seamless way that makes shopping easier. We experienced a favorable economic environment in the U.S. for much of the year and our associates made a lot happen to drive the strength of our results.
Brett will go into more detail on our results shortly. I am particularly encouraged by our sales results in the quarter. In Q4, Walmart U.S. grew comp sales 4.2%, excluding fuel;  eCommerce sales increased 43% and we gained market share in key categories such as grocery and toys, according to Nielsen and the NPD Group.
Sam's Club finished the year with another strong quarter with comp sales growth of 5.3%, excluding fuel and tobacco; and in International, comps were positive in the majority of our markets.  Strong top line results allow us to reiterate the FY '20 sales and profit guidance we gave in October even as we landed FY '19 ahead of where we expected. We strive to make everyday easier for busy families as we increase convenience and save them money and time. Part of our strategy is to build on our existing strengths such as having a broad assortment, including fresh and perishable foods within 10 miles of 90% of the U.S. population. Our stores and clubs are becoming more digital and we're using technology to change how we work. More customers can now access our brand through multiple channels and it's important that we engage them in different ways.  We learned that those customers who shop with us both in stores and online spend about twice as much in total and they spend more in our stores.
Across the business, you can see examples of how we're meeting the changing needs of customers and delivering solutions that are increasing customer engagement. In the U.S., we offer grocery pickup at more than 2,100 locations and grocery delivery at nearly 800 locations, which represents about 69% and 36% of the population, respectively. Feedback from customers about these services continues to be very positive, which speaks to the capabilities of our roughly 37,000 personal shoppers.
In Mexico, we're delighting customers with new experiences such as a secured digital payment option. It's available on their mobile phones and in-store kiosks that offer a broad assortment of products with flexible pickup times. In addition, through our investment in the crowd-sourced delivery platform Dada-JD Daojia, customers in China get their merchandise in less than an hour by placing the order and it's picked from a network of more than 280 locations.
We continue to build trust, which we believe will become even more of a competitive advantage. Around the world, Walmart plays an important role in the communities we serve by using our scale for good. Whether it's our work to promote small businesses and local farmers in places like India or larger scale initiatives such as our effort to double our use of renewable energy in the U.S. by 2025, customers can feel good about Walmart, a company that starts every day with a goal of earning their business.
It's nice to be recognized for the work we're doing to promote shared value. In fact, the company recently received an A- rating on the CDP's annual environmental scorecard, up from a B rating last year. And we're ranked as the survey's top-performing U.S.-based food retailer.
Shared value is an important concept and something that we have fully embraced as we think about how to best allocate our time and capital, deliver strong efficient growth, reduce costs and operate with discipline. Within this construct, customers, associates, communities and shareholders can win.
Now let's move on to highlights from the year for our operating segments. I'll begin with Walmart U.S. where the team had a great year. Comp sales growth of 3.6% for fiscal year '19 exceeded our expectations. The work the team has done to balance inventory levels within stock rates is impressive. The team leveraged operating expenses overall even as we invested in wages, training, technology and eCommerce. Store-level productivity is strong due in part to the training we're providing our associates. As the nature of work continues to change, we're innovating to empower associates to better serve customers as they develop new skills, driving their jobs and growing their careers. This coming year, we'll add new ways for associates to better manage their schedules and earn greater incentive payouts and will introduce new training options, including through advances in technology and the gamification of educational experiences.
Overall, I'm pleased with what I see operationally and with our merchandising. The investments we're making in our people, remodels and technology are helping to ensure that our stores are easy to navigate, fast, friendly and fun to shop. Having a great store or site starts with having great merchandise. In our stores, you can see the quality improvements in fresh food and in apparel with our new private brands. We're also doing well in our seasonal businesses and toys.
We're making progress in eCommerce. Our focus remains on earning repeat visits and strengthening our assortment of merchandise. We're expanding our assortment, improving search, enhancing our website and executing better on the fundamentals such as product reviews, inventory mirroring and on-time delivery to accomplish this. And of course, we remain committed to providing a superior value proposition as we compete aggressively on price across a broad spectrum of products.
Sales in eCommerce increased 40% for the year. We will continue to play offense and innovate as we shape the future of omni-retail. This includes the expansion of innovative services like online grocery pickup and delivery.
Our previous investments in fulfillment centers and systems, plus our acquisitions, are helping us drive strong sales, but we need to make more progress to improve profitability. Our fulfillment and shipping costs are improving as we continue to enhance our assortment, repeat visits should increase and contribute to improved profitability.
We made good progress during the year to add more brands and exclusive items through new partnerships with Lord & Taylor, Ellen DeGeneres, Advance Auto, Sofia Vergara and Fanatics, to name a few. These initiatives are contributing to the improvements we see in key metrics like the customer value index as well as NPS, which is now more than 10 points ahead of last year.
Many opportunities exist, mainly driven by data and we'll look to leverage our unique assets and capability better than we do today.
At Sam's Club, the team has taken bold steps to transform the business by focusing on people, products and working in a more digital way. Excluding fuel and tobacco, comp sales for the year increased 5.7% and eCommerce sales grew 27%. When someone downloads the app, shops on SamsClub.com or uses Scan & Go, they're more likely to renew.
We're encouraged by the trends we see in membership. As of year-end, we saw improvements in sign-ups and plus penetration and membership count is essentially flat to where it was a year ago despite the closure of nearly 10% of the fleet.
In International, 8 of our markets posted positive comp sales for the year, including the 4 major markets. And overall sales increased 2.9% in constant currency. It's been a big year for International as we run the business while shaping the portfolio.
Walmex continues to be strong. The improvements we're making are helping drive traffic and we saw improvements in NPS in each of our formats. Similar to the U.S., we're now leveraging our store base to offer same-day delivery. We recently expanded the available assortment to offer more than 5,000 general merchandise items to this service. We'll continue to invest in our stores and in eCommerce to build an omni-channel experience tailored to customers in this market.
Our business in Canada also continues to perform well. The team is moving quickly to modernize the store base and expand omni-channel capabilities with a focus on gaining greater access to urban markets. For example, we've entered into new partnerships this year in cities like Toronto and Vancouver to help expand our delivery options in grocery and general merchandise. In the U.K., Brexit and the potential implications of a hard Brexit is increasingly on the mind of everyone. No matter the situation, Asda will always work to keep prices as low as possible for its customers. I visited our team in the U.K. a few weeks ago and I'm really impressed with their performance, their attitudes and their leadership. They're amazing.
In India, we remain optimistic about the eCommerce opportunity given the size of the market, the low penetration of eCommerce in the retail channel and the pace at which it's growing. In the future, we hope to work with the government for pro-growth policies that can allow this nascent industry and the domestic manufacturers, farmers and suppliers that benefit from it to develop and prosper. In terms of the regulatory environment, we were disappointed in the recent change in law and the lack of consultation, but the team has worked to ensure we're in compliance with the new rules. We're committed to providing sellers with a world-class platform to sell on and customers with a high quality of service. We hope for a collaborative regulatory process going forward, which results in a level playing field.
Turning to China, we continue to see significant growth opportunities. Overall, we've identified provinces that are a priority for us and we're improving the value proposition through better quality of fresh items as well as with new store designs and omni-channel initiatives. Uncertainties with trade or other macro factors can make for a more challenging environment. But I like the things we're doing to position ourselves in this important market.
Across International, we're accelerating omni-channel capabilities. We are the furthest along in China due to the partnership with JD.com, our relationship with Tencent and the investments we've made in last-mile delivery. We're also accelerating omni growth in Canada, Mexico, Chile and Japan through partnerships and acquisitions. The International team has the talent and scale to deliver sustainable growth for the company and to make a difference in communities across the globe.
In closing, let me say how pleased I am about all that we've accomplished over the last year and how excited I am about what's still to come. We see the future as a frictionless experience across stores and eCommerce, but we have more work to do as customers raise their expectations, competition persists and the omni-retail story continues to evolve. 
We fully expect the pace of change to accelerate in the next 5 years versus the last 5 years as emerging technologies come together to transform retail even further, and we're adapting. What we once could only imagine a decade ago will increasingly become reality. We will embrace new technologies to solve problems for customers in a seamless way and equip associates with tools to make them more productive. Within our ecosystem, we will pursue and grow adjacent businesses to increase customer engagement and will leverage core capabilities to deliver services to others that could generate new revenue streams.
Our commitment to the customer is clear. We'll be there when, where and how they want to shop. Our distinctive set of assets, financial strength and innovative culture are delivering the customers new experiences that are uniquely Walmart.
Brett, you want to pick it up there?"

Walmart had a really good year and we're pleased with the fourth quarter results as well. We have momentum as we entered the new fiscal year and will continue to execute against our strategic plan, which we believe is the winning formula long term.
I'll start this morning by highlighting some key accomplishments for the full year. Total revenue at constant currency was just over $515 billion and increased $14.8 billion or 3%. Walmart U.S. comp sales grew 3.6%, the highest annual growth rate in 10 years. Walmart U.S. eCommerce sales grew 40%, nearly doubling the sales of that business over the past 2 years.
We made a number of strategic choices to position Walmart International for success, including the acquisition of a majority stake in Flipkart and the sale of the majority of our business in Brazil. We made progress on expenses and I'm particularly proud of the leverage in Walmart U.S. stores.
Excluding discrete items from last year, we leveraged total company expenses slightly as we expected coming into the year.
Adjusted EPS increased 11% to $4.91. Operating cash flow was strong at $27.8 billion, and the company returned $13.5 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
We're pleased with what we accomplished, but not satisfied. This year and quarter are further proof that our financial strength gives us the ability to deliver near-term results, while positioning the business for the longer term. We're leveraging our scale, unique assets and financial strength in ways others can't.
Now let's move on to the fourth quarter. We delivered strong fourth quarter top line growth and total constant currency revenue grew 3.1% to $140.5 billion, with currency having a negative effect of approximately $1.7 billion.
Walmart U.S. comp sales growth of 4.2% was a bit better-than-expected as strong holiday results and an early release of government assistance benefited sales. International grew net sales 2.7% in constant currency led by strength at Walmex. And Sam's Club had solid comp sales growth of 5.3%, excluding fuel and tobacco.
Consolidated gross margin -- gross profit margin declined 21 basis points due primarily to the mix effect from eCommerce growth in India and the U.S. and price investments in certain markets. We had some benefit in the quarter from lapping last year's discrete items.
SG&A leverage and operating income benefited from lapping last year's discrete items, but was partially offset by dilution from Flipkart. Excluding these items, we would have leveraged expenses in the quarter and operating income would have increased slightly on a constant-currency basis.
The adjusted tax rate was within our expectations for the year at 24.6%. As a reminder, the adjusted tax rate excludes the effect of the value change in our investment in JD.com, adjustments related to tax reform and the change for the divestiture of a majority stake in Walmart Brazil.
For the fourth quarter, the adjusted tax rate was 22.8% and benefited EPS by about $0.04 per share, primarily due to the effect of numerous federal tax regulations issued late in Q4.
Adjusted EPS increased 6% to $1.41 and GAAP EPS was $1.27.
Now let's discuss the quarterly results for each operating segment. Walmart U.S. continued to have great sales momentum. Comp sales excluding fuel grew 4.2% in the quarter and 6.8% on a 2-year stack basis, the best result in 9 years. We started the quarter with strong Thanksgiving and holiday shopping and finished the quarter with strong winter seasonal sales. Although base sales were strong, we did experience a benefit to comp sales of about 40 basis points from early SNAP funding. Clearly, we're operating in a healthy consumer environment, but our integrated omni-offering provided the convenience customers were looking for during the holiday season.
We had solid traffic and ticket up 0.9% and 3.3%, respectively; while eCommerce sales grew 43% and contributed approximately 100 basis -- 180 basis points of the segment comp. We're encouraged by the market share gains we saw in key categories according to Nielsen and NPD Group.
Our strong mid-single-digit comp growth in grocery led to the best 2-year stack in 9 years. Health and wellness delivered a low single-digit comp sales gain, and general merchandise comp sales were up mid-single-digit percentage, with a strong holiday performance of toys and seasonal categories. Our inventory position is good as we enter the new year.
At Walmart U.S. eCommerce, we've made good progress on a number of initiatives as Doug mentioned. We're still working to optimize our margin mix so that we can achieve the long-term profit profile we want. The team is working with a great sense of urgency to increase sales in key areas like home and apparel, which will help margin rates while simultaneously investing in new innovative solutions.
As we outlined in October, we expect our losses in eCommerce to increase this coming year reflecting investments in infrastructure, people, online grocery and Store #8 initiatives. While we've made good progress against our strategy in recent years, we still have great opportunity in front of us. We remain excited about the opportunity in grocery pickup and delivery and plan to double the current number of stores that offer same-day grocery delivery in the coming year, while also adding grocery pickups to another 1,000 stores. The boundaries between physical and online retail continue to blur, and we're in great position to capitalize on that.
Walmart U.S. gross margin rate declined 27 basis points due primarily to the increasing mix of eCommerce growth, pricing strategy and higher transportation expenses. Expense leverage was strong, reflecting strong sales, increased productivity and overlap from last year's discrete items. The Walmart U.S. stores team has leveraged expenses for an impressive eighth consecutive quarters, even after raising the starting wage rate earlier this year.
Operating income increased by more than 7% during the quarter. Overall, we're really pleased with the momentum we have in the Walmart U.S. business.
Moving to International, net sales in constant currency increased 2.7%, but declined 2.3% on a reported basis due to the negative currency effect of approximately $1.7 billion. The deconsolidation of Brazil was a sales headwind offset by the inclusion of Flipkart sales for a full quarter.
Of our major markets we saw positive comps from Walmex, Canada and the U.K., results in Mexico were strong again with comp sales growth of 4.6% in the quarter and we continue to grow faster than the market in key traffic driving categories, including food and staples according to ANTAD.
In the U.K., Asda's progress on improving the value proposition growing, online grocery share and expanding private-label penetration contributed to its seventh consecutive quarter of positive comps.
In China, we saw a slightly negative comp in the quarter as the calendar shift to the Mid-Autumn Festival and a slower economic environment affected sales growth. Without the calendar shift, comp sales would have been positive.
As expected, International operating income declined 2.8% in constant currency and 9.9% on a reported basis. Factors affecting our fourth quarter comparison include the dilution from Flipkart, partially offset by the positive effect from lapping last year's discrete charges. Flipkart's results were in line with our expectations. Overall, we're pleased with the progress being made in Walmart International.
Sam's Club delivered solid comp sales growth of 3.3%, excluding fuel and 5.3% when excluding fuel and tobacco. The transfer of sales from closed clubs to existing clubs contributed approximately half of the comp growth and eCommerce sales grew 21%. We're seeing improved membership sign-ups and NPS scores and in fact despite closing 10% of our clubs at the end of last year, overall membership counts are about flat year-over-year.
Sam's operating income increased primarily due to lapping last year's discrete charges for club closures. Excluding these items, operating income would have been flat excluding fuel and up about 9% with fuel.
I'll close today with guidance for fiscal year 2020. As always, we have several assumptions in our guidance, including the economic conditions, currency rates and the tax and regulatory landscape and our largest and most important markets remain generally consistent.
As always, we have not included any potential change in the value of our investment in JD.com. We're also continuing to monitor the ongoing tariff discussions. As we mentioned in October, we will actively manage pricing and margins as warranted with our customers and shareholders in mind.
Regarding Flipkart, with any change like this, there can be some disruption to the business. But we feel good about our ability to transition with minimal interruption. There'll be some additional costs to comply with the new regulations, but we don't currently believe they will be significant enough to impact total company guidance for the year.
You'll recall we issued fiscal year 2020 guidance last October. While there's been some growing uncertainty in the overall macroeconomic and political environment, we're confident in our ability to operate our business and serve customers effectively in most any economic climate.
We finished the year with good momentum. So today, we're reiterating the previous guidance provided in October, which speaks to the consistency of our business.
I'll highlight a few of the key guidance metrics and you can find a complete listing in this morning's press release. I'll start with sales guidance. We expect to deliver total net sales growth of at least 3% on a constant-currency basis in FY '20, with the back half of the year a little stronger than the first half due to some timing and comparison, including the deconsolidation of Brazil and the addition of Flipkart. Keep in mind, on a reported basis, we've seen increased pressure from currency as noted in our fourth quarter results. If the current spot rates were to continue into next year, there'd be a currency headwind to reported sales of around $3 billion with most of that impact in the first half of the year.
For Walmart U.S., we still expect comp sales growth of 2.5% to 3% despite the more difficult comparisons. We expect the quarterly cadence of comp sales growth to be fairly consistent throughout the year ranging from approximately 2.5% to 3.5% in any given quarter.
Walmart U.S. eCommerce is expected to grow sales around 35% FY '20. And we expect the quarterly growth to range from around 30% to the low 40% range.
We still expect to leverage expenses by approximately 20 basis points in FY '20. We'll continue to make progress on being more efficient and lowering costs, especially in Walmart U.S. stores where we expect leverage to be even higher than the 20 basis points due to continuing strong sales and improved productivity. On a consolidated basis, we expect to slightly lever in Q1 with leverage improving each quarter during the year. Timing of expenses can impact leverage quarter-to-quarter versus our expectations.
Turning to profitability, we continue to expect consolidated operating income dollars to decline by low single-digit percentage, primarily due to Flipkart being included for the full year versus the partial year in fiscal 2019. We would expect operating income to increase excluding the Flipkart effects.
We expect EPS to decline by low single-digit percentage, which assumes an effective tax rate of approximately 26.5% to 27.5%. Keep in mind that the increase in the rate relative to FY '19's adjusted tax rate relates to the Flipkart losses having very little tax benefit in the near term, which we've mentioned previously.
Excluding the full year EPS dilution expected from Flipkart, we would expect EPS to grow by a low to mid-single-digit percentage.
As you would expect, the quarterly year-over-year change in operating income and EPS will be quite varied during the year due primarily to the impact of Flipkart only being in our results in part of Q3 and all of Q4 last year. We currently expect operating income and EPS to decrease by around 10% in Q1, decrease by a low to mid-single-digit percentage in Q2 and Q3 and increase in Q4 to achieve our full year guidance. As always, the growth quarter-to-quarter can change due to timing and other factors.
Our priorities for capital allocation remain unchanged. We'll focus first on investing in our business and growth initiatives. We also remain committed to our dividend as evidenced by the increase we announced today, and we'll continue with our current share repurchase program.
Before I close, I want to share a change in the communication cadence with the analysts and investors. Similar to the past, we will host a question-and-answer session in Northwest Arkansas in June in conjunction with our Annual Shareholders Meeting. However, instead of hosting an investment community meeting in October as we typically have, we plan to have an event in February 2020 in New York in conjunction with our Q4 earnings release. This meeting will be similar to the format we've typically had where you'll hear updates on our performance, guidance and strategy and interact with key leaders, but in the location that's closer to many of you. As always, we'll continue to assess the optimal approach to communicating with our investors and analysts.
Let me close by saying thank you for your support of our company. I'm as optimistic as I've ever been about what Walmart can become. It's a great company with a long history of transformation and we expect to win.
And with that, I'd be happy to take your questions."

We've talked a lot over the last few months about -- last few quarters about expense leverage. It comes from a number of different places. We're seeing great expense leverage in the U.S., certainly good comp sales helps a lot with that. But it's the technology and the training that we've done in the past, technology put in place, the training we've done over the past several years is really paying dividends in the stores with our associates and how we serve our customers. So as you saw even in October, some of the technology that's coming, some things we keep doing with our stores, we expect the productivity in the U.S. stores will continue to be a big part of what we do. When you look at really around the world, we're seeing good results and leverage around the world in different pockets. As you know, with leverage, it can be a lot of small things that add up. But we're doing some bigger things as well. I've talked recently about the work we're doing in shared services that we're viewing that as more of a real strength to the company. This past year, we hired a Chief Procurement Officer for the first time for goods, not for resale and so we're putting more effort toward using our scale to benefit our leverage. So I feel good about the numbers we've put out. And I think there's going to be room for us. The timing of that is always challenging to figure out. You're correct on gross margin, and that's the implication that we have. We're going to continue to invest in price for the customer, which we've done. The mix of the business will continue to change, which changes a bit the nature of our company. And we've always said a couple of things: one is getting our expenses right allows us to do we need to do from a gross margin perspective to remain competitive and be there for our customers. And so that's the main thing we want to do with expenses. And we have a lot of levers to pull as a company that we can make changes throughout the year. I hope I answered your question, Simeon."

But it's the crowd-sourced delivery platforms that are really helping us achieve scale. Generally speaking, the delivery cost cover the cost. We're right now operating with something with breakeven mentalities as it relates to delivery costs. So customers are bearing that. But they really do lack the convenience. And I'm excited about figuring all this out. And the combination of great stores that can increasingly function as productive fulfillment centers, which, by the way, is helping keep pressure on in-stocks, which is what we saw from the U.K. years ago, really like that healthy pressure, together with pickup, which continues to have a high NPS score and people love it. Now with delivery and future enhancements in the future as it relates to the service end of that caused me to be really excited. It looks to me like there's a long runway here where our supercenters can double as fulfillment centers and stores and also generate a great store experience. So it looks promising."

If you just read the headlines, you might imagine things are pretty tough, but that's not really what we're seeing. I mean, if you look at our comp performance, Brett talked about the calendar change, but that aside, things have held up pretty well. And the Sam's Clubs continue to be really strong. I'm excited about the fact that we've got more of those in the pipeline and the comp performance in Sam's is great. The supercenters have been performing better and they look better. I think operationally, we've improved. And then we've been playing around with some supermarkets and may find an opportunity there, which can play a key role in last mile delivery. This relationship that we mentioned on last mile there is resulting in incredible customer experiences in terms of both the value for delivery, which is still, I think, around USD 1 and the speed with which you can get delivery given the density of the market is like incredible. So that feels okay. And I think if you look at the overall relationship, considering all the things that are happening in China, we're in pretty good shape. So I'm still -- I'm optimistic and recognize the tremendous opportunity that the market presents and we're constantly trying to think of our position in that market and how we might improve it."

And it's loud and clear to us that customers, no surprise, are really busy. And that if we can find a way to make things more convenient for them with pickup and delivery, they're all over it. So I think the ramp there in terms of how comp stores will behave in addition to the rollout that we're doing for additional stores is going to continue to be strong. We have been adding assortment over time. Some of the happiest customers that I have come across are customers that can place their back-to-school order and a grocery order together and go through pickup and knockout that list of things that you need for your kids as they go back to school. So and that includes a lot of items they are not food items. And then over time, we just keep adding as the stores learn how to pick categories that are different in nature than food. It's a different situation to go and pick light bulbs or to go pick some of these categories that may not have as much shelf capacity as we have in food. So we have to learn how to adjust our modulars so that you can expand the categories and the items. And I do think that'll help mix over time. And we may have seen that already. I haven't been tracking that part of it that closely, but it makes sense that, that basket would change shape and profitability would look better."

What happened in this case is that we saw the SNAP shift into the end of January. We built food inventories at the end of the quarter to make sure we were maximizing that opportunity. There's a little bit of pull forward of inventory in anticipation of what tariffs could mean in a worst-case scenario, although we certainly hope and expect that, that won't happen. So I'm not worried about the inventory level. It's high quality and there's a bit of a timing difference there, and overall that picture still looks really good."

There'll be families that come into stores once a week or twice a month or whatever and they'll also use pickup, they'll also use delivery and we'll have the ability to serve them in all those ways. There's an interesting opportunity if you could get to a point where customers pick their delivery window in the home or to the door unattended. You can decouple the speed of delivery in a way that helps us manage costs. So as the volume goes up and density improves, I think we'll try to figure out how to drive a basket business that looks more like a dense route than a 1-hour or 30-minute race to deliver to somebody's house. That may be different for restaurant delivery than it is for grocery delivery. It seems like those use cases are different enough. So we've got some tests going on and real-time learning here to try and do it in a way that customers want it to be done and create that optionality for them. And it's kind of one more mix opportunity for us. We grew up managing merchandise mix and still do and now we're managing a service mix. And the good news is that once customers are in your ecosystem, they use you in some way, as I mentioned earlier in the prepared remarks, you get the opportunity to expand on that relationship, and that's what we're trying to do."

We're encouraged by our performance for the year because we believe our customers are noticing our improvements, but we continue to see many ways we can serve them better. We're even more convinced they want us and expect us to bring our stores and eCommerce businesses together in a digitally connected seamless way that makes shopping easier. We experienced a favorable economic environment in the U.S. for much of the year and our associates made a lot happen to drive the strength of our results.
Brett will go into more detail on our results shortly. I am particularly encouraged by our sales results in the quarter. In Q4, Walmart U.S. grew comp sales 4.2%, excluding fuel; eCommerce sales increased 43% and we gained market share in key categories such as grocery and toys, according to Nielsen and the NPD Group.
Sam's Club finished the year with another strong quarter with comp sales growth of 5.3%, excluding fuel and tobacco; and in International, comps were positive in the majority of our markets. Strong top line results allow us to reiterate the FY '20 sales and profit guidance we gave in October even as we landed FY '19 ahead of where we expected. We strive to make everyday easier for busy families as we increase convenience and save them money and time. Part of our strategy is to build on our existing strengths such as having a broad assortment, including fresh and perishable foods within 10 miles of 90% of the U.S. population. Our stores and clubs are becoming more digital and we're using technology to change how we work. More customers can now access our brand through multiple channels and it's important that we engage them in different ways. We learned that those customers who shop with us both in stores and online spend about twice as much in total and they spend more in our stores.
Across the business, you can see examples of how we're meeting the changing needs of customers and delivering solutions that are increasing customer engagement. In the U.S., we offer grocery pickup at more than 2,100 locations and grocery delivery at nearly 800 locations, which represents about 69% and 36% of the population, respectively. Feedback from customers about these services continues to be very positive, which speaks to the capabilities of our roughly 37,000 personal shoppers.
In Mexico, we're delighting customers with new experiences such as a secured digital payment option. It's available on their mobile phones and in-store kiosks that offer a broad assortment of products with flexible pickup times. In addition, through our investment in the crowd-sourced delivery platform Dada-JD Daojia, customers in China get their merchandise in less than an hour by placing the order and it's picked from a network of more than 280 locations.
We continue to build trust, which we believe will become even more of a competitive advantage. Around the world, Walmart plays an important role in the communities we serve by using our scale for good. Whether it's our work to promote small businesses and local farmers in places like India or larger scale initiatives such as our effort to double our use of renewable energy in the U.S. by 2025, customers can feel good about Walmart, a company that starts every day with a goal of earning their business.
It's nice to be recognized for the work we're doing to promote shared value. In fact, the company recently received an A- rating on the CDP's annual environmental scorecard, up from a B rating last year. And we're ranked as the survey's top-performing U.S.-based food retailer.
Shared value is an important concept and something that we have fully embraced as we think about how to best allocate our time and capital, deliver strong efficient growth, reduce costs and operate with discipline. Within this construct, customers, associates, communities and shareholders can win.
Now let's move on to highlights from the year for our operating segments. I'll begin with Walmart U.S. where the team had a great year. Comp sales growth of 3.6% for fiscal year '19 exceeded our expectations. The work the team has done to balance inventory levels within stock rates is impressive. The team leveraged operating expenses overall even as we invested in wages, training, technology and eCommerce. Store-level productivity is strong due in part to the training we're providing our associates. As the nature of work continues to change, we're innovating to empower associates to better serve customers as they develop new skills, driving their jobs and growing their careers. This coming year, we'll add new ways for associates to better manage their schedules and earn greater incentive payouts and will introduce new training options, including through advances in technology and the gamification of educational experiences.
Overall, I'm pleased with what I see operationally and with our merchandising. The investments we're making in our people, remodels and technology are helping to ensure that our stores are easy to navigate, fast, friendly and fun to shop. Having a great store or site starts with having great merchandise. In our stores, you can see the quality improvements in fresh food and in apparel with our new private brands. We're also doing well in our seasonal businesses and toys.
We're making progress in eCommerce. Our focus remains on earning repeat visits and strengthening our assortment of merchandise. We're expanding our assortment, improving search, enhancing our website and executing better on the fundamentals such as product reviews, inventory mirroring and on-time delivery to accomplish this. And of course, we remain committed to providing a superior value proposition as we compete aggressively on price across a broad spectrum of products.
Sales in eCommerce increased 40% for the year. We will continue to play offense and innovate as we shape the future of omni-retail. This includes the expansion of innovative services like online grocery pickup and delivery.
Our previous investments in fulfillment centers and systems, plus our acquisitions, are helping us drive strong sales, but we need to make more progress to improve profitability. Our fulfillment and shipping costs are improving as we continue to enhance our assortment, repeat visits should increase and contribute to improved profitability.
We made good progress during the year to add more brands and exclusive items through new partnerships with Lord & Taylor, Ellen DeGeneres, Advance Auto, Sofia Vergara and Fanatics, to name a few. These initiatives are contributing to the improvements we see in key metrics like the customer value index as well as NPS, which is now more than 10 points ahead of last year.
Many opportunities exist, mainly driven by data and we'll look to leverage our unique assets and capability better than we do today.
At Sam's Club, the team has taken bold steps to transform the business by focusing on people, products and working in a more digital way. Excluding fuel and tobacco, comp sales for the year increased 5.7% and eCommerce sales grew 27%. When someone downloads the app, shops on SamsClub.com or uses Scan & Go, they're more likely to renew.
We're encouraged by the trends we see in membership. As of year-end, we saw improvements in sign-ups and plus penetration and membership count is essentially flat to where it was a year ago despite the closure of nearly 10% of the fleet.
In International, 8 of our markets posted positive comp sales for the year, including the 4 major markets. And overall sales increased 2.9% in constant currency. It's been a big year for International as we run the business while shaping the portfolio.
Walmex continues to be strong. The improvements we're making are helping drive traffic and we saw improvements in NPS in each of our formats. Similar to the U.S., we're now leveraging our store base to offer same-day delivery. We recently expanded the available assortment to offer more than 5,000 general merchandise items to this service. We'll continue to invest in our stores and in eCommerce to build an omni-channel experience tailored to customers in this market.
Our business in Canada also continues to perform well. The team is moving quickly to modernize the store base and expand omni-channel capabilities with a focus on gaining greater access to urban markets. For example, we've entered into new partnerships this year in cities like Toronto and Vancouver to help expand our delivery options in grocery and general merchandise. In the U.K., Brexit and the potential implications of a hard Brexit is increasingly on the mind of everyone. No matter the situation, Asda will always work to keep prices as low as possible for its customers. I visited our team in the U.K. a few weeks ago and I'm really impressed with their performance, their attitudes and their leadership. They're amazing.
In India, we remain optimistic about the eCommerce opportunity given the size of the market, the low penetration of eCommerce in the retail channel and the pace at which it's growing. In the future, we hope to work with the government for pro-growth policies that can allow this nascent industry and the domestic manufacturers, farmers and suppliers that benefit from it to develop and prosper. In terms of the regulatory environment, we were disappointed in the recent change in law and the lack of consultation, but the team has worked to ensure we're in compliance with the new rules. We're committed to providing sellers with a world-class platform to sell on and customers with a high quality of service. We hope for a collaborative regulatory process going forward, which results in a level playing field.
Turning to China, we continue to see significant growth opportunities. Overall, we've identified provinces that are a priority for us and we're improving the value proposition through better quality of fresh items as well as with new store designs and omni-channel initiatives. Uncertainties with trade or other macro factors can make for a more challenging environment. But I like the things we're doing to position ourselves in this important market.
Across International, we're accelerating omni-channel capabilities. We are the furthest along in China due to the partnership with JD.com, our relationship with Tencent and the investments we've made in last-mile delivery. We're also accelerating omni growth in Canada, Mexico, Chile and Japan through partnerships and acquisitions. The International team has the talent and scale to deliver sustainable growth for the company and to make a difference in communities across the globe.
In closing, let me say how pleased I am about all that we've accomplished over the last year and how excited I am about what's still to come. We see the future as a frictionless experience across stores and eCommerce, but we have more work to do as customers raise their expectations, competition persists and the omni-retail story continues to evolve. 
We fully expect the pace of change to accelerate in the next 5 years versus the last 5 years as emerging technologies come together to transform retail even further, and we're adapting. What we once could only imagine a decade ago will increasingly become reality. We will embrace new technologies to solve problems for customers in a seamless way and equip associates with tools to make them more productive. Within our ecosystem, we will pursue and grow adjacent businesses to increase customer engagement and will leverage core capabilities to deliver services to others that could generate new revenue streams.
Our commitment to the customer is clear. We'll be there when, where and how they want to shop. Our distinctive set of assets, financial strength and innovative culture are delivering the customers new experiences that are uniquely Walmart.
Brett, you want to pick it up there?"

Walmart had a really good year and we're pleased with the fourth quarter results as well. We have momentum as we entered the new fiscal year and will continue to execute against our strategic plan, which we believe is the winning formula long term.
I'll start this morning by highlighting some key accomplishments for the full year. Total revenue at constant currency was just over $515 billion and increased $14.8 billion or 3%. Walmart U.S. comp sales grew 3.6%, the highest annual growth rate in 10 years. Walmart U.S. eCommerce sales grew 40%, nearly doubling the sales of that business over the past 2 years.
We made a number of strategic choices to position Walmart International for success, including the acquisition of a majority stake in Flipkart and the sale of the majority of our business in Brazil. We made progress on expenses and I'm particularly proud of the leverage in Walmart U.S. stores.
Excluding discrete items from last year, we leveraged total company expenses slightly as we expected coming into the year.
Adjusted EPS increased 11% to $4.91. Operating cash flow was strong at $27.8 billion, and the company returned $13.5 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
We're pleased with what we accomplished, but not satisfied. This year and quarter are further proof that our financial strength gives us the ability to deliver near-term results, while positioning the business for the longer term. We're leveraging our scale, unique assets and financial strength in ways others can't.
Now let's move on to the fourth quarter. We delivered strong fourth quarter top line growth and total constant currency revenue grew 3.1% to $140.5 billion, with currency having a negative effect of approximately $1.7 billion.
Walmart U.S. comp sales growth of 4.2% was a bit better-than-expected as strong holiday results and an early release of government assistance benefited sales. International grew net sales 2.7% in constant currency led by strength at Walmex. And Sam's Club had solid comp sales growth of 5.3%, excluding fuel and tobacco.
Consolidated gross margin -- gross profit margin declined 21 basis points due primarily to the mix effect from eCommerce growth in India and the U.S. and price investments in certain markets. We had some benefit in the quarter from lapping last year's discrete items.
SG&A leverage and operating income benefited from lapping last year's discrete items but was partially offset by dilution from Flipkart. Excluding these items, we would have leveraged expenses in the quarter and operating income would have increased slightly on a constant-currency basis.
The adjusted tax rate was within our expectations for the year at 24.6%. As a reminder, the adjusted tax rate excludes the effect of the value change in our investment in JD.com, adjustments related to tax reform and the change for the divestiture of a majority stake in Walmart Brazil.
For the fourth quarter, the adjusted tax rate was 22.8% and benefited EPS by about $0.04 per share, primarily due to the effect of numerous federal tax regulations issued late in Q4.
Adjusted EPS increased 6% to $1.41 and GAAP EPS was $1.27.
Now let's discuss the quarterly results for each operating segment. Walmart U.S. continued to have great sales momentum. Comp sales excluding fuel grew 4.2% in the quarter and 6.8% on a 2-year stack basis, the best result in 9 years. We started the quarter with strong Thanksgiving and holiday shopping and finished the quarter with strong winter seasonal sales. Although base sales were strong, we did experience a benefit to comp sales of about 40 basis points from early SNAP funding. Clearly, we're operating in a healthy consumer environment, but our integrated omni-offering provided the convenience customers were looking for during the holiday season.
We had solid traffic and ticket up 0.9% and 3.3%, respectively; while eCommerce sales grew 43% and contributed approximately 100 basis -- 180 basis points of the segment comp. We're encouraged by the market share gains we saw in key categories according to Nielsen and NPD Group.
Our strong mid-single-digit comp growth in grocery led to the best 2-year stack in 9 years. Health and wellness delivered a low single-digit comp sales gain, and general merchandise comp sales were up mid-single-digit percentage, with a strong holiday performance of toys and seasonal categories. Our inventory position is good as we enter the new year.
At Walmart U.S. eCommerce, we've made good progress on a number of initiatives as Doug mentioned. We're still working to optimize our margin mix so that we can achieve the long-term profit profile we want. The team is working with a great sense of urgency to increase sales in key areas like home and apparel, which will help margin rates while simultaneously investing in new innovative solutions.
As we outlined in October, we expect our losses in eCommerce to increase this coming year reflecting investments in infrastructure, people, online grocery and Store #8 initiatives. While we've made good progress against our strategy in recent years, we still have great opportunity in front of us. We remain excited about the opportunity in grocery pickup and delivery and plan to double the current number of stores that offer same-day grocery delivery in the coming year, while also adding grocery pickups to another 1,000 stores. The boundaries between physical and online retail continue to blur, and we're in great position to capitalize on that.
Walmart U.S. gross margin rate declined 27 basis points due primarily to the increasing mix of eCommerce growth, pricing strategy and higher transportation expenses. Expense leverage was strong, reflecting strong sales, increased productivity and overlap from last year's discrete items. The Walmart U.S. stores team has leveraged expenses for an impressive eighth consecutive quarters, even after raising the starting wage rate earlier this year.
Operating income increased by more than 7% during the quarter. Overall, we're really pleased with the momentum we have in the Walmart U.S. business.
Moving to International, net sales in constant currency increased 2.7% but declined 2.3% on a reported basis due to the negative currency effect of approximately $1.7 billion. The deconsolidation of Brazil was a sales headwind offset by the inclusion of Flipkart sales for a full quarter.
Of our major markets we saw positive comps from Walmex, Canada and the U.K., results in Mexico were strong again with comp sales growth of 4.6% in the quarter and we continue to grow faster than the market in key traffic driving categories, including food and staples according to ANTAD.
In the U.K., Asda's progress on improving the value proposition growing, online grocery share and expanding private-label penetration contributed to its seventh consecutive quarter of positive comps.
In China, we saw a slightly negative comp in the quarter as the calendar shift to the Mid-Autumn Festival and a slower economic environment affected sales growth. Without the calendar shift, comp sales would have been positive.
As expected, International operating income declined 2.8% in constant currency and 9.9% on a reported basis. Factors affecting our fourth quarter comparison include the dilution from Flipkart, partially offset by the positive effect from lapping last year's discrete charges. Flipkart's results were in line with our expectations. Overall, we're pleased with the progress being made in Walmart International.
Sam's Club delivered solid comp sales growth of 3.3%, excluding fuel and 5.3% when excluding fuel and tobacco. The transfer of sales from closed clubs to existing clubs contributed approximately half of the comp growth and eCommerce sales grew 21%. We're seeing improved membership sign-ups and NPS scores and in fact despite closing 10% of our clubs at the end of last year, overall membership counts are about flat year-over-year.
Sam's operating income increased primarily due to lapping last year's discrete charges for club closures. Excluding these items, operating income would have been flat excluding fuel and up about 9% with fuel.
I'll close today with guidance for fiscal year 2020. As always, we have several assumptions in our guidance, including the economic conditions, currency rates and the tax and regulatory landscape and our largest and most important markets remain generally consistent.
As always, we have not included any potential change in the value of our investment in JD.com. We're also continuing to monitor the ongoing tariff discussions. As we mentioned in October, we will actively manage pricing and margins as warranted with our customers and shareholders in mind.
Regarding Flipkart, with any change like this, there can be some disruption to the business. But we feel good about our ability to transition with minimal interruption. There'll be some additional costs to comply with the new regulations, but we don't currently believe they will be significant enough to impact total company guidance for the year.
You'll recall we issued fiscal year 2020 guidance last October. While there's been some growing uncertainty in the overall macroeconomic and political environment, we're confident in our ability to operate our business and serve customers effectively in most any economic climate.
We finished the year with good momentum. So today, we're reiterating the previous guidance provided in October, which speaks to the consistency of our business.
I'll highlight a few of the key guidance metrics and you can find a complete listing in this morning's press release. I'll start with sales guidance. We expect to deliver total net sales growth of at least 3% on a constant-currency basis in FY '20, with the back half of the year a little stronger than the first half due to some timing and comparison, including the deconsolidation of Brazil and the addition of Flipkart. Keep in mind, on a reported basis, we've seen increased pressure from currency as noted in our fourth quarter results. If the current spot rates were to continue into next year, there'd be a currency headwind to reported sales of around $3 billion with most of that impact in the first half of the year.
For Walmart U.S., we still expect comp sales growth of 2.5% to 3% despite the more difficult comparisons. We expect the quarterly cadence of comp sales growth to be fairly consistent throughout the year ranging from approximately 2.5% to 3.5% in any given quarter.
Walmart U.S. eCommerce is expected to grow sales around 35% FY '20. And we expect the quarterly growth to range from around 30% to the low 40% range.
We still expect to leverage expenses by approximately 20 basis points in FY '20. We'll continue to make progress on being more efficient and lowering costs, especially in Walmart U.S. stores where we expect leverage to be even higher than the 20 basis points due to continuing strong sales and improved productivity. On a consolidated basis, we expect to slightly lever in Q1 with leverage improving each quarter during the year. Timing of expenses can impact leverage quarter-to-quarter versus our expectations.
Turning to profitability, we continue to expect consolidated operating income dollars to decline by low single-digit percentage, primarily due to Flipkart being included for the full year versus the partial year in fiscal 2019. We would expect operating income to increase excluding the Flipkart effects.
We expect EPS to decline by low single-digit percentage, which assumes an effective tax rate of approximately 26.5% to 27.5%. Keep in mind that the increase in the rate relative to FY '19's adjusted tax rate relates to the Flipkart losses having very little tax benefit in the near term, which we've mentioned previously.
Excluding the full year EPS dilution expected from Flipkart, we would expect EPS to grow by a low to mid-single-digit percentage.
As you would expect, the quarterly year-over-year change in operating income and EPS will be quite varied during the year due primarily to the impact of Flipkart only being in our results in part of Q3 and all of Q4 last year. We currently expect operating income and EPS to decrease by around 10% in Q1, decrease by a low to mid-single-digit percentage in Q2 and Q3 and increase in Q4 to achieve our full year guidance. As always, the growth quarter-to-quarter can change due to timing and other factors.
Our priorities for capital allocation remain unchanged. We'll focus first on investing in our business and growth initiatives. We also remain committed to our dividend as evidenced by the increase we announced today, and we'll continue with our current share repurchase program.
Before I close, I want to share a change in the communication cadence with the analysts and investors. Similar to the past, we will host a question-and-answer session in Northwest Arkansas in June in conjunction with our Annual Shareholders Meeting. However, instead of hosting an investment community meeting in October as we typically have, we plan to have an event in February 2020 in New York in conjunction with our Q4 earnings release. This meeting will be similar to the format we've typically had where you'll hear updates on our performance, guidance and strategy and interact with key leaders, but in the location that's closer to many of you. As always, we'll continue to assess the optimal approach to communicating with our investors and analysts.
Let me close by saying thank you for your support of our company. I'm as optimistic as I've ever been about what Walmart can become. It's a great company with a long history of transformation and we expect to win.
And with that, I'd be happy to take your questions."

We've talked a lot over the last few months about -- last few quarters about expense leverage. It comes from a number of different places. We're seeing great expense leverage in the U.S., certainly good comp sales helps a lot with that. But it's the technology and the training that we've done in the past, technology put in place, the training we've done over the past several years is really paying dividends in the stores with our associates and how we serve our customers. So as you saw even in October, some of the technology that's coming, some things we keep doing with our stores, we expect the productivity in the U.S. stores will continue to be a big part of what we do. When you look at really around the world, we're seeing good results and leverage around the world in different pockets. As you know, with leverage, it can be a lot of small things that add up. But we're doing some bigger things as well. I've talked recently about the work we're doing in shared services that we're viewing that as more of a real strength to the company. This past year, we hired a Chief Procurement Officer for the first time for goods, not for resale and so we're putting more effort toward using our scale to benefit our leverage. So I feel good about the numbers we've put out. And I think there's going to be room for us. The timing of that is always challenging to figure out. You're correct on gross margin, and that's the implication that we have. We're going to continue to invest in price for the customer, which we've done. The mix of the business will continue to change, which changes a bit the nature of our company. And we've always said a couple of things: one is getting our expenses right allows us to do we need to do from a gross margin perspective to remain competitive and be there for our customers. And so that's the main thing we want to do with expenses. And we have a lot of levers to pull as a company that we can make changes throughout the year. I hope I answered your question, Simeon."

And there are different components of that basket. There's the pick cost, the shipping cost and then just the gross margin on the products.

Because those numbers are finally getting you to that tipping point where you can see past the Flipkart dilution, I guess."

We're really seeing the productivity loop back in action in Walmart U.S. where you get the sales, and it allows you to do what you want to do on prices, allows you to lower expenses. The productivity loop is alive and well in the U.S. The mix of our business continues to change as you look at eCommerce growing in the U.S., the acquisition of Flipkart and so that does change when you look at total company. But as for leverage, I mentioned from a total company perspective, we expect to slightly lever in Q1 and that's just to get progressively better. As we get through -- go through the year and we certainly couldn't do that or couldn't make that statement if we didn't feel pretty comfortable with what we're seeing in the U.S. Again, we've assumed this kind of sales growth to get that leverage. Sales growth has helped a lot in getting that leverage, but that's how we see the year playing out."

But it's the crowd-sourced delivery platforms that are really helping us achieve scale. Generally speaking, the delivery cost cover the cost. We're right now operating with something with breakeven mentalities as it relates to delivery costs. So customers are bearing that. But they really do lack the convenience. And I'm excited about figuring all this out. And the combination of great stores that can increasingly function as productive fulfillment centers, which, by the way, is helping keep pressure on in-stocks, which is what we saw from the U.K. years ago, really like that healthy pressure, together with pickup, which continues to have a high NPS score and people love it. Now with delivery and future enhancements in the future as it relates to the service end of that caused me to be really excited. It looks to me like there's a long runway here where our supercenters can double as fulfillment centers and stores and also generate a great store experience. So it looks promising."

I'm excited about the fact that we've got more of those in the pipeline and the comp performance in Sam's is great. The supercenters have been performing better and they look better. I think operationally, we've improved. And then we've been playing around with some supermarkets and may find an opportunity there, which can play a key role in last mile delivery. This relationship that we mentioned on last mile there is resulting in incredible customer experiences in terms of both the value for delivery, which is still, I think, around USD 1 and the speed with which you can get delivery given the density of the market is like incredible. So that feels okay. And I think if you look at the overall relationship, considering all the things that are happening in China, we're in pretty good shape.

So I think the ramp there in terms of how comp stores will behave in addition to the rollout that we're doing for additional stores is going to continue to be strong. We have been adding assortment over time. Some of the happiest customers that I have come across are customers that can place their back-to-school order and a grocery order together and go through pickup and knockout that list of things that you need for your kids as they go back to school. So and that includes a lot of items they are not food items. And then over time, we just keep adding as the stores learn how to pick categories that are different in nature than food. It's a different situation to go and pick light bulbs or to go pick some of these categories that may not have as much shelf capacity as we have in food. So we have to learn how to adjust our modulars so that you can expand the categories and the items. And I do think that'll help mix over time. And we may have seen that already. I haven't been tracking that part of it that closely, but it makes sense that, that basket would change shape and profitability would look better."

There's always going to be timing of other parts of the business, they go from one quarter to another based on how expenses are flowing, but that's the biggest part of Q1 and Q2 as well because it did not come in our results until partway through Q3. There's always -- we can have things move around between quarters, $50 million here, $60 million there and it can make a difference in how that number looks from a profitability standpoint.

There'll be families that come into stores once a week or twice a month or whatever and they'll also use pickup, they'll also use delivery and we'll have the ability to serve them in all those ways. There's an interesting opportunity if you could get to a point where customers pick their delivery window in the home or to the door unattended. You can decouple the speed of delivery in a way that helps us manage costs. So as the volume goes up and density improves, I think we'll try to figure out how to drive a basket business that looks more like a dense route than a 1-hour or 30-minute race to deliver to somebody's house. That may be different for restaurant delivery than it is for grocery delivery. It seems like those use cases are different enough. So we've got some tests going on and real-time learning here to try and do it in a way that customers want it to be done and create that optionality for them. And it's kind of one more mix opportunity for us. We grew up managing merchandise mix and still do and now we're managing a service mix.
