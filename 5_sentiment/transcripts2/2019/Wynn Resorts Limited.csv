I believe that we have the best and most robust growth pipeline in our industry.
As an example, 5 months from now, we're going to be opening the very first large-scale integrated resort in a Tier 1 city, Encore Boston Harbor. The Boston Metroplex. It's 20 million tourists a year, 2 million of those are international, and we have a $2.6 billion property that we're going to be opening right in the heart of the Boston Metroplex and we'll be all alone. We're really excited about that opportunity. It provides a step change in EBITDA for our company and that's in 5 months. 
Looking here in Las Vegas. Las Vegas is now a marketer's market. You can see by the overall growth rate here on The Strip that it's pretty much in line with the economy. And so we know that we have to take share. And right now, in Las Vegas, we have a 400,000 square-foot convention facility, state of the art, under construction. It's going to open in 13 months. We know that, that's going to add 4 to 6 points of additional occupancy and a strong rate to our property in 2020 and everybody on this call knows when you get additional occupancy with a strong rate, that's straight flow through. We've also redesigned with [ Tom Bosio ] our Gulf course and it will be opening around the same time. And not only does that golf course make money on its own, but we've underestimated the impact that it has on our domestic casino business, allowing our host and our team to run special events, to run programs that will continue to enhance our casino play.
We have 3 new restaurant concepts under way here in Las Vegas that we're going to be rolling out in 2019, because our customers expect us to continue to innovate, and that's what we're doing. So we feel very good about the position -- the long-term position of our property and the ways that we're investing here in Las Vegas.
Turning to Macau. If you look at our downtown property, Wynn Macau, which has always been an outlier in terms of its performance relative to its size, we realized in the early 2018, in the first and second quarter, that Wynn Macau is doing very well, but it was making a disproportionate share of its money from second-tier junket operators. And that's not the place where we wanted to invest for the long term. We've been to that movie, we know how it ends, that is too volatile. So we began redesigning Wynn Macau, the entire original casino, and also remodeling some of the nicest suites in Macau, the Encore Tower Suites.
And we started that construction in July. And in the fourth quarter of this year, we'll be relaunching an entirely new premium mass casino experience that's open to the water, 3 new restaurants, 10,000 square feet of additional retail and a new hotel tower that wasn't just a soft refurb of the Encore tower, but it's completely redone like it's new property. 
We'll be effectively launching a new property at the end of this year for Wynn Macau that's focused squarely on the business that we believe in for the long term, and that's the Premium Mass segment. 
Moving to Wynn Palace. Wynn Palace continues to position itself as the premier property in Cotai. Ian and Linda and the team have been opening a new food and beverage outlet almost every quarter in the last 4 quarters and Ian has another one coming up in the next 6 weeks I like him to talk about, which is really exciting. And so what we see at Wynn Palace is as it continues to get into its rhythm, it's a place where the premium players like to stay and like to play.
Now what we know is we don't have enough hotel rooms. It's 1,700 hotel rooms. So we are actively designing what I think will be the top tourist destination in Macau with the Crystal Pavilion, something that I've spoken with a couple of times on these calls, along with a phase I hotel tower of 670 rooms and a phase 2 hotel tower that's roughly the same size.
So our growth pipeline is quite impressive if we just take a look at where we are right now and where we are going to be in the next 12, 24 and 36 months.
Turning to the fourth quarter results. In Macau, we generated $394 million of EBITDA. It was above our range that we gave in the third quarter. I would like to point out that we've spent the vast majority of October and November inside the range that we provided in the third quarter. And the inherent volatility of Macau makes predicting the market revenues, given everything that's going on with the head -- the global headwinds, potentially slowing global growth, things that companies now all over the world are talking about, not just us, does it make it more difficult. As an example, Wynn Palace in October and November revenues were down slightly to fourth quarter 2014, October and November. But in December, they increased 50%. On the VIP side, that was mainly hold, but on the mass side, it was up 40% in mass play in December. Clearly, that's not a number that we would extrapolate. It's not something that we would say is a trend, but what it shows is the inherent volatility in Macau exist. There are peaks and there are valleys. But the way that we positioned our properties, we will be there to capture the premium customers when they come to town. 
Looking at Las Vegas. We made about $105 million of EBITDA this quarter. In the third quarter, we had a setback in our baccarat volumes. We had lost some market share, but we recovered. We've made a few changes in the marketing and the way that we're looking with our mission. We recovered in the fourth quarter and I feel good about Las Vegas considering everything that we have going on here that I mentioned earlier in the call, with the convention center, the Gulf course, the restaurants, Maryland stewardship driving this property every day. I think that the Las Vegas best days are yet to come. And with that, I'm going to turn over to Craig for a little more detail in the quarter."

As noted in our release, our Macau operations delivered $394.1 million of adjusted property EBITDA on $1.294 billion of operating revenues. After experiencing a normalized average of $3.6 million a day from October 8, the day after Golden week through November 30, results improved in December on the back of increased VIP turnover in Wynn Macau and higher mass win at Wynn Palace. Overall, for the quarter, combined property mass table win was a particular standout, increasing almost 14% year-over-year. Comparable to Q3, over 70% of our departmental EBITDA in the quarter was generated in mass tables, slots and nongaming. Our results in Macau were positively impacted by VIP holds, increasing EBITDA from our Macau operations by almost $15 million from a normalized level. Bad debt expense in Macau was $3 million in the quarter compared to a $1 million credit in the prior year quarter.
Our Las Vegas operations delivered $105.2 million of adjusted property EBITDA in the quarter on net revenues of $393.6 million, driven by growth in table drops, slot volumes and RevPAR. Table volumes were strong, but hold was low, negatively impacting EBITDA by about $5 million. RevPAR in the quarter was also strong, bolstered by a healthy group calendar and more high ADR casino room nights. RevPAR was also aided by relatively easy comps, given the tragic events of October 2017.
Bad debt expense in Las Vegas was $1 million compared to a $1.1 million credit in the prior year quarter. Compared to the prior year quarter, EBITDA margin in Las Vegas was negatively impacted by low hold and the year-over-year swing in bad debt. We spent $52.4 million in CapEx on the additional group space at Wynn Las Vegas, taking our spend to date to $124.3 million.
In Boston, we incurred $197.3 million in total project cost during the quarter, taking the total spend to date to $2 billion. The property remains on track to open in June of 2019, as Matt mentioned.
We ended the quarter with total debt of $9.4  billion in total cash and investments of $2.2 billion, including $1.2 billion in Wynn Macau. In December, we completed the amendment an extension of our Macau credit facility, both reducing amortization payments and extending the maturity of the facility.
During the quarter, we returned approximately $237 million to shareholders through the payment of our recurring quarterly dividend and the repurchase of $156.7 million of stock. We repurchased just under 1.5 million shares at an average price of just under $106 per share and our quarterly dividend for the final quarter of 2018 is $0.75 per share, returning over $80 million to shareholders.
Consistent with our sharp focus on capital returns, we will consider adjustments to our dividend in due course. With that, we'll now move to Q&A."

There is no stronger growth employee team, management team in all of gaming. And so I'm delighted to lead this team. I think we have operating opportunities, really with all of our assets. And specifically in casino, we can drive more from our casino block, get more off of our floor. So that's where we focus going forward."

I was flying out to Vegas yesterday. I took a car from Wynn Palace and I was checking in with Cathay Pacific in an hour and 2 minutes from leaving Wynn Palace. That's remarkable. It's a huge boom for people that want to arrive in Hong Kong Airport. Hong Kong Airport has 3.5x the number of daily flights from the PRC than Macau Airport does. So it an offense for us and it not also international travel in general. Long term, that's a significant archery linked to what Matt was discussing about the Greater Bay area. So we feel it's a huge relevant piece of infrastructure that's going to benefit the city over the coming years. On the smoking ban, it's still early days, but we're delighted because it levels the playing field. We've been at a disadvantage, particularly in Cotai, with these grandfathered in mass area tables that have smoking allowed. Now everybody is operating from the same template, and we believe it's a big advantage for us in Cotai in particular.

I believe that we have the best and most robust growth pipeline in our industry.
As an example, 5 months from now, we're going to be opening the very first, large-scale, integrated resort in a Tier 1 city, Encore Boston Harbor. The Boston Metroplex, it's 20 million tourists a year, 2 million of those are international, and we have a $2.6 billion property that we're going to be opening right in the heart of the Boston Metroplex, and we'll be all alone. We're really excited about that opportunity. It provides a step change in EBITDA for our company, and that's in 5 months. 
Looking here in Las Vegas. Las Vegas is now a marketer's market. You can see by the overall growth rates here, on The Strip, that it's pretty much in line with the economy. And so we know that we have to take share. And right now, in Las Vegas, we have a 400,000 square-foot convention facility, state of the art, under construction. It's going to open in 13 months. We know that, that's going to add 4 to 6 points of additional occupancy, at a strong rate, to our property in 2020. And everybody on this call knows, when you get additional occupancy at a strong rate, that's straight flow through. 
We've also redesigned with Tom Fazio our golf course, and it will be opening around the same time. And not only does that golf course make money on its own, but we've underestimated the impact that it has on our domestic casino business, allowing our host and our team to run special events, to run programs, that will continue to enhance our casino play.
We have 3 new restaurant concepts underway here in Las Vegas that we're going to be rolling out in 2019, because our customers expect us to continue to innovate, and that's what we're doing. So I feel very good about the position -- the long-term position of our property, and the ways that we're investing here in Las Vegas.
Turning to Macau. If you look at our downtown property, Wynn Macau, which has always been an outlier in terms of its performance relative to its size, we realized, in the early 2018, in the first and second quarter, that Wynn Macau is doing very well, but it was making a disproportionate share of its money from second-tier junket operators. And that's not a place where we wanted to invest for the long term. We've been to that movie. We know how it ends. That is too volatile. So we began redesigning Wynn Macau, the entire original casino, and also remodeling some of the nicest suites in Macau, the Encore Tower Suites.
And we started that construction in July. And in the fourth quarter of this year, we'll be relaunching an entirely new premium mass casino experience that's open to the water, 3 new restaurants, 10,000 square feet of additional retail, and a new hotel tower that wasn't just a soft refurb, the Encore Tower, but is completely redone like it's new property.
We'll be effectively launching a new property at the end of this year for Wynn Macau that's focused squarely on the business that we believe in for the long term, and that's the Premium Mass segment. 
Moving to Wynn Palace. Wynn Palace continues to position itself as the premier property at Cotai. Ian, and Linda, and the team, have been opening a new food and beverage outlet almost every quarter over the last 4 quarters, and he has another one coming up in the next 6 weeks I'd like for him to talk about, which is really exciting. And so what we see at Wynn Palace is as it continues to get into its rhythm, it's the place where the premium players like to stay and like to play.
Now what we know is we don't have enough hotel rooms. It's 1,700 hotel rooms. So we are actively designing what I think will be the top tourist destination in Macau with the Crystal Pavilion, something that I've spoken about a couple of times on these calls, along with a Phase 1 hotel tower of 670 rooms, and a Phase 2 hotel tower that's roughly the same size. So our growth pipeline is quite impressive if you just take a look at where we are right now, and where we're going to be in the next 12, 24, and 36 months.
Turning to the fourth quarter results. In Macau, we generated $394 million of EBITDA. It was above our range that we gave in the third quarter. I would like to point out that we've spent the vast majority of October and November inside the range that we provided in the third quarter. And the inherent volatility of Macau makes predicting the market revenues, given everything that's going on with the head -- the global headwinds, potentially slowing global growth, things that companies now all over the world are talking about, not just us, does make it more difficult. 
As an example, Wynn Palace, in October and November revenues, were down slightly to fourth quarter 2014, October and November. But in December, they increased 50%, 5-0. On the VIP side, that was mainly hold, but on the mass side, it was up 40% in mass play in December. Clearly, that's not a number we would extrapolate. It's not something that we would say is a trend, but what it shows is the inherent volatility in Macau exist. There are peaks and there are valleys. But the way that we positioned our properties, we will be there to capture the premium customers when they come to town. 
Looking at Las Vegas. We made about $105 million of EBITDA this quarter. In the third quarter, we had a setback in our baccarat volumes. We had lost some market share, but we recovered. We've made a few changes in marketing and the way that we're looking with our mission. We recovered in the fourth quarter, and I feel good about Las Vegas, considering everything that we have going on here that I mentioned earlier in the call, with the convention center, the golf course, the restaurants, Marilyn's stewardship driving this property every day. I think that Las Vegas' best days are yet to come. 
And with that, I'm going to turn it over to Craig, for a little more detail in the quarter."

As noted in our release, our Macau operations delivered $394.1 million of adjusted property EBITDA on $1.294 billion of operating revenues. After experiencing a normalized average of $3.6 million a day from October 8, the day after Golden Week, through November 30, results improved in December on the back of increased VIP turnover at Wynn Macau and higher mass win at Wynn Palace.
Overall, for the quarter, combined property mass table win was a particular standout, increasing almost 14% year-over-year. Comparable to Q3, over 70% of our departmental EBITDA in the quarter was generated in mass tables, slots and non-gaming. Our results in Macau were positively impacted by VIP holds, increasing EBITDA from our Macau operations by almost $15 million from a normalized level. Bad debt expense in Macau was $3 million in the quarter compared to a $1 million credit in the prior year quarter.
Our Las Vegas operations delivered $105.2 million of adjusted property EBITDA in the quarter on net revenues of $393.6 million, driven by growth in table drops, slot volumes and RevPAR. Table volumes were strong, but hold was low, negatively impacting EBITDA by about $5 million. RevPAR in the quarter was also strong, bolstered by a healthy group calendar and more high ADR casino room nights. RevPAR was also aided by relatively easy comps, given the tragic events of October 2017.
Bad debt expense in Las Vegas was $1 million compared to a $1.1 million credit in the prior year quarter. Compared to the prior year quarter, EBITDA margin in Las Vegas was negatively impacted by low hold and the year-over-year swing in bad debt. We spent $52.4 million in CapEx on the additional group space at Wynn Las Vegas, taking our spend-to-date to $124.3 million.
In Boston, we incurred $197.3 million in total project cost during the quarter, taking the total spend-to-date to $2 billion. The property remains on track to open in June of 2019, as Matt mentioned.
We ended the quarter with total debt of $9.4  billion in total cash and investments of $2.2 billion, including $1.2 billion at Wynn Macau. In December, we completed the amendment and extension of our Macau credit facilities, both reducing amortization payments and extending the maturity of the facility.
During the quarter, we returned approximately $237 million to shareholders through the payment of our recurring quarterly dividend and the repurchase of $156.7 million of stock. We repurchased just under 1.5 million shares at an average price of just under $106 per share, and our quarterly dividend for the final quarter of 2018 is $0.75 per share, returning over $80 million to shareholders.
Consistent with our sharp focus on capital returns, we will consider adjustments to our dividend in due course.

I believe that we have the best and most robust growth pipeline in our industry.
As an example, 5 months from now, we're going to be opening the very first, large-scale, integrated resort in a Tier 1 city, Encore Boston Harbor. The Boston Metroplex gets 20 million tourists a year, 2 million of those are international, and we have a $2.6 billion property that we're going to be opening right in the heart of the Boston Metroplex, and we'll be all alone. We're really excited about that opportunity. It provides a step change in EBITDA for our company, and that's in 5 months. 
Looking here in Las Vegas. Las Vegas is now a marketer's market. You can see by the overall growth rates here, on The Strip, that it's pretty much in line with the economy. And so we know that we have to take share. And right now, in Las Vegas, we have a 400,000 square-foot convention facility, state of the art, under construction. It's going to open in 13 months. We know that, that's going to add 4 to 6 points of additional occupancy, at a strong rate, to our property in 2020. And everybody on this call knows, when you get additional occupancy at a strong rate, that's straight flow through. 
We've also redesigned with Tom Fazio our golf course, and it will be opening around the same time. And not only does that golf course make money on its own, but we've underestimated the impact that it has on our domestic casino business, allowing our host and our team to run special events, to run programs, that will continue to enhance our casino play.
We have 3 new restaurant concepts underway here in Las Vegas that we're going to be rolling out in 2019, because our customers expect us to continue to innovate, and that's what we're doing. So I feel very good about the position -- the long-term position of our property, and the ways that we're investing here in Las Vegas.
Turning to Macau. If you look at our downtown property, Wynn Macau, which has always been an outlier in terms of its performance relative to its size, we realized, in the early 2018, in the first and second quarter, that Wynn Macau was doing very well, but it was making a disproportionate share of its money from second-tier junket operators. And that's not a place where we wanted to invest for the long term. We've been to that movie. We know how it ends. That is too volatile. So we began redesigning Wynn Macau, the entire original casino, and also remodeling some of the nicest suites in Macau, the Encore Tower Suites.
And we started that construction in July. And in the fourth quarter of this year, we'll be relaunching an entirely new premium mass casino experience that's open to the water, 3 new restaurants, 10,000 square feet of additional retail, and a new hotel tower that wasn't just a soft refurb, the Encore Tower, but is completely redone like it's new property.
We'll be effectively launching a new property at the end of this year for Wynn Macau that's focused squarely on the business that we believe in for the long term, and that's the Premium Mass segment. 
Moving to Wynn Palace. Wynn Palace continues to position itself as the premier property at Cotai. Ian, and Linda, and the team, have been opening a new food and beverage outlet almost every quarter over the last 4 quarters, and he has another one coming up in the next 6 weeks I'd like for him to talk about, which is really exciting. And so what we see at Wynn Palace is as it continues to get into its rhythm, it's the place where the premium players like to stay and like to play.
Now what we know is we don't have enough hotel rooms. It's 1,700 hotel rooms. So we are actively designing what I think will be the top tourist destination in Macau with the Crystal Pavilion, something that I've spoken about a couple of times on these calls, along with a Phase 1 hotel tower of 670 rooms, and a Phase 2 hotel tower that's roughly the same size. So our growth pipeline is quite impressive if you just take a look at where we are right now, and where we're going to be in the next 12, 24, and 36 months.
Turning to the fourth quarter results. In Macau, we generated $394 million of EBITDA. It was above our range that we gave in the third quarter. I would like to point out that we spent the vast majority of October and November inside the range that we provided in the third quarter. And the inherent volatility of Macau makes predicting the market revenues, given everything that's going on with the head -- the global headwinds, potentially slowing global growth, things that companies now all over the world are talking about, not just us, does make it more difficult. 
As an example, Wynn Palace, in October and November revenues were down slightly to fourth quarter 2014, October and November. But in December, they increased 50%, 5-0. On the VIP side, that was mainly hold, but on the mass side, it was up 40% in mass play in December. Clearly, that's not a number we would extrapolate. It's not something that we would say is a trend, but what it shows is the inherent volatility in Macau exists. There are peaks and there are valleys. But the way that we positioned our properties, we will be there to capture the premium customers when they come to town. 
Looking at Las Vegas. We made about $105 million of EBITDA this quarter. In the third quarter, we had a setback in our baccarat volumes. We had lost some market share, but we recovered. We made a few changes in marketing and the way that we were looking at the business. We recovered in the fourth quarter, and I feel good about Las Vegas, considering everything that we have going on here that I mentioned earlier in the call, with the convention center, the golf course, the restaurants, Marilyn's stewardship driving this property every day. I think that Las Vegas' best days are yet to come. 
And with that, I'm going to turn it over to Craig, for a little more detail on the quarter."

After experiencing a normalized average of $3.6 million a day from October 8, the day after Golden We",463,"Thanks, Matt. As noted in our release, our Macau operations delivered $394.1 million of adjusted property EBITDA on $1.294 billion of operating revenues. After experiencing a normalized average of $3.6 million a day from October 8, the day after Golden Week, through November 30, results improved in December on the back of increased VIP turnover at Wynn Macau and higher mass win at Wynn Palace.
Overall, for the quarter, combined property mass table win was a particular standout, increasing almost 14% year-over-year. Comparable to Q3, over 70% of our departmental EBITDA in the quarter was generated in mass tables, slots and non-gaming. Our results in Macau were positively impacted by VIP holds, increasing EBITDA from our Macau operations by almost $15 million from a normalized level. Bad debt expense in Macau was $3 million in the quarter compared to a $1 million credit in the prior year quarter.
Our Las Vegas operations delivered $105.2 million of adjusted property EBITDA in the quarter on net revenues of $393.6 million, driven by growth in table drops, slot volumes and RevPAR. Table volumes were strong, but hold was low, negatively impacting EBITDA by about $5 million. RevPAR in the quarter was also strong, bolstered by a healthy group calendar and more high ADR casino room nights. RevPAR was also aided by relatively easy comps, given the tragic events of October 2017.
Bad debt expense in Las Vegas was $1 million compared to a $1.1 million credit in the prior year quarter. Compared to the prior year quarter, EBITDA margin in Las Vegas was negatively impacted by low hold and the year-over-year swing in bad debt. We spent $52.4 million in CapEx on the additional group space at Wynn Las Vegas, taking our spend-to-date to $124.3 million.
In Boston, we incurred $197.3 million in total project cost during the quarter, taking the total spend-to-date to $2 billion. The property remains on track to open in June of 2019, as Matt mentioned.
We ended the quarter with total debt of $9.4  billion in total cash and investments of $2.2 billion, including $1.2 billion at Wynn Macau. In December, we completed the amendment and extension of our Macau credit facilities, both reducing amortization payments and extending the maturity of the facility.
During the quarter, we returned approximately $237 million to shareholders through the payment of our recurring quarterly dividend and the repurchase of $156.7 million of stock. We repurchased just under 1.5 million shares at an average price just under $106 per share, and our quarterly dividend for the final quarter of 2018 is $0.75 per share, returning over $80 million to shareholders.
Consistent with our sharp focus on capital returns, we will consider adjustments to our dividend in due course. 
With that, we'll now move to Q&A. Operator?"

And how we do that as we focus on the premium customer that's making the decisions about where they want to go and where they want to stay? And that's what we're doing at Wynn Macau."

On the bridge, it's only been open a few months, but there's already a distinct benefit for premium mass and VIP players. I'll just give you my own personal example. I was flying out to Vegas yesterday. I took a car from Wynn Palace and I was checking in with Cathay Pacific in an hour and 2 minutes from leaving Wynn Palace. That's remarkable. It's a huge boon for people that want to arrive in Hong Kong Airport. Hong Kong Airport has 3.5x the number of daily flights from the PRC than Macau Airport does. So it opens that up for us, and also just international travel in general. Long term, it's a significant artery linked to what Matt was discussing about the Greater Bay area. So we feel it's a huge relevant piece of infrastructure that's going to benefit the city over the coming years. On the smoking ban, it's still early days, but we're delighted because it levels the playing field. We've been at a disadvantage, particularly in Cotai, with these grandfathered in, mass-area tables that had smoking allowed. Now everybody is operating from the same template, and we believe it's a big advantage for us in Cotai in particular. Too early to really judge if it's affected the speed of play, et cetera, but right now, we're happy to have the ban in place and everybody operating with the same rules."

I believe that we have the best and most robust growth pipeline in our industry.
As an example, 5 months from now, we're going to be opening the very first, large-scale, integrated resort in a Tier 1 city, Encore Boston Harbor. The Boston Metroplex gets 20 million tourists a year, 2 million of those are international, and we have a $2.6 billion property that we're going to be opening right in the heart of the Boston Metroplex, and we'll be all alone. We're really excited about that opportunity. It provides a step change in EBITDA for our company, and that's in 5 months. 
Looking here in Las Vegas. Las Vegas is now a marketer's market. You can see by the overall growth rates here, on The Strip, that it's pretty much in line with the economy. And so we know that we have to take share. And right now, in Las Vegas, we have a 400,000 square-foot convention facility, state of the art, under construction. It's going to open in 13 months. We know that, that's going to add 4 to 6 points of additional occupancy, at a strong rate, to our property in 2020. And everybody on this call knows, when you get additional occupancy at a strong rate, that's straight flow through. 
We've also redesigned with Tom Fazio our golf course, and it will be opening around the same time. And not only does that golf course make money on its own, but we've underestimated the impact that it has on our domestic casino business, allowing our host and our team to run special events, to run programs, that will continue to enhance our casino play.
We have 3 new restaurant concepts underway here in Las Vegas that we're going to be rolling out in 2019, because our customers expect us to continue to innovate, and that's what we're doing. So I feel very good about the position -- the long-term position of our property, and the ways that we're investing here in Las Vegas.
Turning to Macau. If you look at our downtown property, Wynn Macau, which has always been an outlier in terms of its performance relative to its size, we realized, in the early 2018, in the first and second quarter, that Wynn Macau was doing very well, but it was making a disproportionate share of its money from second-tier junket operators. And that's not a place where we wanted to invest for the long term. We've been to that movie. We know how it ends. That is too volatile. So we began redesigning Wynn Macau, the entire original casino, and also remodeling some of the nicest suites in Macau, the Encore Tower Suites.
And we started that construction in July. And in the fourth quarter of this year, we'll be relaunching an entirely new premium mass casino experience that's open to the water, 3 new restaurants, 10,000 square feet of additional retail, and a new hotel tower that wasn't just a soft refurb, the Encore Tower, but is completely redone like it's new property.
We'll be effectively launching a new property at the end of this year for Wynn Macau that's focused squarely on the business that we believe in for the long term, and that's the Premium Mass segment. 
Moving to Wynn Palace. Wynn Palace continues to position itself as the premier property at Cotai. Ian, and Linda, and the team, have been opening a new food and beverage outlet almost every quarter over the last 4 quarters, and he has another one coming up in the next 6 weeks I'd like for him to talk about, which is really exciting. And so what we see at Wynn Palace is as it continues to get into its rhythm, it's the place where the premium players like to stay and like to play.
Now what we know is we don't have enough hotel rooms. It's 1,700 hotel rooms. So we are actively designing what I think will be the top tourist destination in Macau with the Crystal Pavilion, something that I've spoken about a couple of times on these calls, along with a Phase 1 hotel tower of 670 rooms, and a Phase 2 hotel tower that's roughly the same size. So our growth pipeline is quite impressive if you just take a look at where we are right now, and where we're going to be in the next 12, 24, and 36 months.
Turning to the fourth quarter results. In Macau, we generated $394 million of EBITDA. It was above our range that we gave in the third quarter. I would like to point out that we spent the vast majority of October and November inside the range that we provided in the third quarter. And the inherent volatility of Macau makes predicting the market revenues, given everything that's going on with the head -- the global headwinds, potentially slowing global growth, things that companies now all over the world are talking about, not just us, does make it more difficult. 
As an example, Wynn Palace, in October and November revenues were down slightly to fourth quarter 2014, October and November. But in December, they increased 50%, 5-0. On the VIP side, that was mainly hold, but on the mass side, it was up 40% in mass play in December. Clearly, that's not a number we would extrapolate. It's not something that we would say is a trend, but what it shows is the inherent volatility in Macau exists. There are peaks and there are valleys. But the way that we positioned our properties, we will be there to capture the premium customers when they come to town. 
Looking at Las Vegas. We made about $105 million of EBITDA this quarter. In the third quarter, we had a setback in our baccarat volumes. We had lost some market share, but we recovered. We made a few changes in marketing and the way that we were looking at the business. We recovered in the fourth quarter, and I feel good about Las Vegas, considering everything that we have going on here that I mentioned earlier in the call, with the convention center, the golf course, the restaurants, Marilyn's stewardship driving this property every day. I think that Las Vegas' best days are yet to come. 
And with that, I'm going to turn it over to Craig, for a little more detail on the quarter."

As noted in our release, our Macau operations delivered $394.1 million of adjusted property EBITDA on $1.294 billion of operating revenues.

As noted in our release, our Macau operations delivered $394.1 million of adjusted property EBITDA on $1.294 billion of operating revenues. After experiencing a normalized average of $3.6 million a day from October 8, the day after Golden Week, through November 30, results improved in December on the back of increased VIP turnover at Wynn Macau and higher mass win at Wynn Palace.
Overall, for the quarter, combined property mass table win was a particular standout, increasing almost 14% year-over-year. Comparable to Q3, over 70% of our departmental EBITDA in the quarter was generated in mass tables, slots and non-gaming. Our results in Macau were positively impacted by VIP holds, increasing EBITDA from our Macau operations by almost $15 million from a normalized level. Bad debt expense in Macau was $3 million in the quarter compared to a $1 million credit in the prior year quarter.
Our Las Vegas operations delivered $105.2 million of adjusted property EBITDA in the quarter on net revenues of $393.6 million, driven by growth in table drops, slot volumes and RevPAR. Table volumes were strong, but hold was low, negatively impacting EBITDA by about $5 million. RevPAR in the quarter was also strong, bolstered by a healthy group calendar and more high ADR casino room nights. RevPAR was also aided by relatively easy comps, given the tragic events of October 2017.
Bad debt expense in Las Vegas was $1 million compared to a $1.1 million credit in the prior year quarter. Compared to the prior year quarter, EBITDA margin in Las Vegas was negatively impacted by low hold and the year-over-year swing in bad debt. We spent $52.4 million in CapEx on the additional group space at Wynn Las Vegas, taking our spend-to-date to $124.3 million.
In Boston, we incurred $197.3 million in total project cost during the quarter, taking the total spend-to-date to $2 billion. The property remains on track to open in June of 2019, as Matt mentioned.
We ended the quarter with total debt of $9.4  billion in total cash and investments of $2.2 billion, including $1.2 billion at Wynn Macau. In December, we completed the amendment and extension of our Macau credit facilities, both reducing amortization payments and extending the maturity of the facility.
During the quarter, we returned approximately $237 million to shareholders through the payment of our recurring quarterly dividend and the repurchase of $156.7 million of stock. We repurchased just under 1.5 million shares at an average price just under $106 per share, and our quarterly dividend for the final quarter of 2018 is $0.75 per share, returning over $80 million to shareholders.
Consistent with our sharp focus on capital returns, we will consider adjustments to our dividend in due course.

The quarter was pretty much in line with our expectations and I think I just like to jump right in and talk about the Macau. So in Macau, we generated $386 million of property EBITDA and as we've discussed in previous quarters, VIP was down and the premium area continues to be choppy. However, what we saw was we saw real strength in Encore mass. In fact, our core mass increased over 13%, year-over-year. and what that shows is that our strategy is working. We've built five new restaurants in Waynn palace, over the last 24 months, our visitation continues to increase. And what's interesting in March, of this year Wynn palace achieved its highest normalized EBITDA on record. And 78% of that EBITDA was from the mass business and non-gaming. If you look at Wynn Macau, downtown, we're continuing to perform in line exactly with our expectations as we're renovating that property. The encore tower, which are probably the nicest rooms in all of Macau, the average size of the room there is 900 square feet, is in a full renovation now. Not just a soft goods renovation but a full renovation and that will be complete by the end of the year. We also look at the success of Encore casino in Macau, and those approximately 30 games are one of the most productive casino floor plans on the planet. And we thought how -- what can we do to replicate that in half of our casino, our  original casino, what we call the test. And so we begin a project about nine months ago that should wrap up at the end of this year, that will take our original casino, that's right now chopped up with various junked rooms and the energy has been suppressed, and it will turn it into I think will be the nicest premium mass destination in downtown. With new 7000 square feet of retail entering this area, two restaurants flanking the new casino and this should all be finished by the end of the year. So Wynn Macau's best days are ahead of it, 2020 should be a great year for Wynn Macau. 
In Las Vegas, everything was pretty much in line, except for baccarat. And I think it's also no surprise as people in this call baccarat is always down for us, quite significantly, just as it was for the market. So all of our competitors felt it, baccarat was definitely soft in the first quarter. what I have been impressed by is Marilyn coming in and her team understanding that baccarat is in a temporary decline have focused on the non-baccarat casino business. And for the first time, in a long time, our cable drop excluding baccarat on the first quarter, actually increased 10% over the last year. And I give a lot of credit to Marilyn and her team and the new marketing people that she has brought on to focus on areas where we have not focused as carefully in the past and I think it's an area of growth for us in the future. There's been a lot of discussion about new jurisdictions opening up in Asia and around the world and it may be baccarat's best day's are behind it in Las Vegas or that Macau can continue to see some cannibalization, and what I would say to that is I totally disagree. We've experienced gaming expansion in the United States for decades. And we're experiencing it now in Asia. But what always happen is customer will go try out the new product. they'll go to a place where they're getting free money and big discounts, but that never lasts. Customers with money and choice always go to the place that they enjoy the most. And you cannot replicate Las Vegas or Macau anywhere else on the planet. The number of hotel rooms, the entertainment options, the infrastructure, the service levels can be replicated. And so our company and our growth profile are properly situated to bet on the future growth of the two best gaming jurisdictions in the world. Las Vegas and Macau. And I am a very firm believer that our product is positioned perfectly in both of those markets. 
In Massachusetts, we received that the decision from [ MJC ] regarding their investigation last week. Importantly, there was no impact on suitability of the company or its key employees to hold the gaming license in the state, and we are ready to move forward with the opening of Encore Boston Harbor. However, we are still reviewing the decision as it relates to some of the secondary and tertiary conditions imposed by the commission. We do not believe, if we choose to appeal that, that will impact our ability to open the project at the end of June. So the regulatory process has consumed a great deal of resecures at both the company and with the regulators. We are focused on opening this property within weeks, and we feel very confident that it will be the nicest integrated resort on the East Coast. 
But before I turn it over to Greg, just want to remind everyone everybody about why I'm such a big believer in this company. We've been through a significant transition, and there's been some turmoil over the last 15 months. But that is now behind us. And if you look it our future and you look at our company and our growth profile, I believe it's unparalleled in this business. In Macau, we have 1300 rooms, 700-plus in phase I, plus the crystal Pavilion that we've made significant progress on on for Wynn palace and that project is needed for us to continue to grow, and we're really excited about it. We're about to open Encore Boston Harbor, which is a step change in our EBITDA in weeks. 
During Las Vegas, we have a new convention center opening, doubling the amount of convention square footage we have, over the next six months. Most of new restaurants coming to the property and a fresh look in at the way we think about over casino business. So our growth profile is quite strong and I am big believer and we're all big believers that Macau and Las Vegas, best days are ahead of it. 
With that, I'm going to turn it over to Craig to get into some of the details."

As noted in our release, our Macau operations delivered $386.5 million of adjusted property EBITDA on $1.25 billion operating revenues. As Matt noted, the quarter was characterized by continued choppiness in VIP and premium mass offset by meaningful growth in the main floor core mass was combined property win in that core mass segment up 13.1% year-over-year. 
March was particularly strong with Palace experiencing its best months ever in mass drop, mass win and EBITDA. Our results in Macau were positively impacted by VIP hold, increasing EBITDA at Wynn palace by approximately $25 million from a normalized level. 
bad debt expense in Macau was $1.8 million in the quarter, compared to $300,000 in the prior year. 
Our Las Vegas operations delivered $108.3 million of adjusted property EBITDA in the quarter, on net revenues of $401 million, with year-over-year growth in non-baccarat table drop and slot volumes. As discussed on our Fourth Quarter 2018 call, a large group shift from Q1 to Q2 this year, negatively impacted RevPAR growth and food and beverage revenues in the quarter. 
We expect offsetting outperformance in RevPAR in the second quarter. Consistent with the broader Las Vegas market and our commentary on the fourth quarter call, baccarat volumes declined year-over-year and such declines with the primary driver of the year-over-year EBITDA decrease. 
The property held high, adding a little over $5 million to EBITDA. Bad debt expense in Las Vegas was $3.6 million compared to $400,000 in the prior year quarters. Compared to the prior year quarter, EBITDA margin in Las Vegas was negatively impacted by the swing in bad debt and operating deleverage from Parker. We spent $48.8 million in CapEx on the additional group space at Wynn Las Vegas, taking our spend to-date to $181.5 million. 
In Boston, we incurred $233.4 million in total project cost during the quarter, taking the total spend to-date to $2.26 billion. We ended the quarter with total debt of $9.2 billion and total cash and investments at $1.8 billion, including approximately $900 million at Wynn Macau. 
During the first quarter, we returned approximately $81 million to shareholders through our quarterly dividend payment and today, we are pleased to announce $0.25 or 33% increase to that recurring quarterly dividends. Our recurring dividend is now $1 per share returning over $100 million per quarter to our shareholders. Consistent with our sharp focus on capital allocation, we will continually evaluate periodic increases to our dividend as well as opportunistic share repurchases as valuations and broader capital allocation priorities warrants.

The quarter was pretty much in line with our expectations and I think I'd just like to jump right in and talk about Macau. So in Macau, we generated $386 million of property EBITDA and, as we've discussed in previous quarters, VIP was down and the premium area continues to be choppy. However, what we saw was we saw real strength in core mass. In fact, our core mass increased over 13%, year-over-year, and what that shows is that our strategy is working. We've built five new restaurants at Wynn palace, over the last 24 months, our visitation continues to increase. And what's interesting, in March of this year Wynn palace achieved its highest normalized EBITDA on record. And 78% of that EBITDA was from the mass business and non-gaming. If you look at Wynn Macau, downtown, we're continuing to perform in line exactly with our expectations as we're renovating that property. The Encore Tower, which are probably the nicest rooms in all of Macau, the average size of the room there is 900 square feet, is in a full renovation now. Not just a soft goods renovation, but a full renovation and that will be complete by the end of the year. We also looked at the success of Encore casino in Macau, and those approximately 30 games are one of the most productive casino floor plans on the planet. And we thought how -- what can we do to replicate that in half of our casino, our original casino, what we call the west. And so we begin a project about nine months ago that should wrap up at the end of this year, that will take our original casino, that's right now chopped up with various junket rooms and the energy has been suppressed, and it will turn it into what, I think, will be the nicest premium mass destination in downtown. We'll have 7,000 new square feet of retail entering this area, two restaurants flanking the new casino and this should all be finished by the end of the year. So Wynn Macau's best days are ahead of it, 2020 should be a great year for Wynn Macau. 
In Las Vegas, everything was pretty much in line, except for baccarat. And I think it's also no surprise to the people on this call baccarat was down for us, quite significantly, just as it was for the market. So all of our competitors felt it, baccarat was definitely soft in the first quarter. What I have been impressed by is Marilyn coming in and her team, understanding that baccarat is in a temporary decline, have focused on the non-baccarat casino business. And for the first time, in a long time, our table drop excluding baccarat in the first quarter, actually increased 10% over last year. And I give a lot of credit to Marilyn and her team and the new marketing people that she has brought on to focus on areas where we have not focused as carefully in the past and I think it's an area of growth for us in the future. 
There's been a lot of discussion about new jurisdictions opening up in Asia and around the world and that may be baccarat's best days are behind it in Las Vegas or that Macau can continue to see some cannibalization, and what I would say to that is I totally disagree. We've experienced gaming expansion in the United States for decades. And we're experiencing it now in Asia. But what always happens is customer will go try out the new product, they'll go to a place where they're getting free money and big discounts, but that never lasts. Customers with money and choice always go to the place that they enjoy the most. And you cannot replicate Las Vegas or Macau anywhere else on the planet. The number of hotel rooms, the entertainment options, the infrastructure, the service levels can't be replicated. And so our company and our growth profile are properly situated to bet on the future growth of the two best gaming jurisdictions in the world. Las Vegas and Macau. And I am a very firm believer that our product is positioned perfectly in both of those markets. 
In Massachusetts, we received a decision from MGC regarding their investigation last week. Importantly, there was no impact on suitability of the company or its key employees to hold the gaming license in the state, and we are ready to move forward with the opening of Encore Boston Harbor. However, we are still reviewing the decision as it relates to some of the secondary and tertiary conditions imposed by the commission. We do not believe, if we choose to appeal that, that will impact our ability to open the project at the end of June. So the regulatory process has consumed a great deal of resources at both the company and with the regulators. We are focused on opening this property within weeks, and we feel very confident that it will be the nicest integrated resort on the East Coast. 
But before I turn it over to Craig, I'd just like to remind everybody about why I'm such a big believer in this company. We've been through a significant transition, and there's been some turmoil over the last 15 months. But that is now behind us. And if you look at our future and you look at our company and our growth profile, I believe it's unparalleled in this business. In Macau, we have 1,300 rooms, 700-plus in phase I, plus the Crystal Pavilion that we've made significant progress on for Wynn Palace and that project is needed for Wynn Palace to continue to grow, and we're really excited about it. We're about to open Encore Boston Harbor, which is a step change in our EBITDA, in weeks. 
Here in Las Vegas, we have a new convention center opening, doubling the amount of convention square footage we have, over the next six months. Multiple new restaurants coming into the property and a fresh look in at the way we think about our casino business. So our growth profile is quite strong and I am a big believer and we're all big believers that Macau and Las Vegas, best days are ahead of it. 
With that, I'm going to turn it over to Craig to get into some of the details."

As noted in our release, our Macau operations delivered $386.5 million of adjusted property EBITDA on $1.25 billion operating revenues. As Matt noted, the quarter was characterized by continued choppiness in VIP and premium mass offset by meaningful growth in the main floor core mass with combined property Wynn in that core mass segment up 13.1% year-over-year. 
March was particularly strong with Palace experiencing its best month ever in mass drop, mass win and EBITDA. Our results in Macau were positively impacted by VIP hold, increasing EBITDA at Wynn palace by approximately $25 million from a normalized level. 
Bad debt expense in Macau was $1.8 million in the quarter, compared to $300,000 in the prior year. 
Our Las Vegas operations delivered $108.3 million of adjusted property EBITDA in the quarter, on net revenues of $401 million, with year-over-year growth in non-baccarat table drop and slot volumes. As discussed on our Fourth Quarter 2018 call, a large group shift from Q1 to Q2 this year, negatively impacted RevPAR growth and food and beverage revenues in the quarter. 
We expect offsetting outperformance in RevPAR in the second quarter. Consistent with the broader Las Vegas market and our commentary on the fourth quarter call, baccarat volumes declined year-over-year and such declines were the primary driver of the year-over-year EBITDA decrease. 
The property held high, adding a little over $5 million to EBITDA. Bad debt expense in Las Vegas was $3.6 million compared to $400,000 in the prior year quarter. Compared to the prior year quarter, EBITDA margin in Las Vegas was negatively impacted by the swing in bad debt and operating deleverage from baccarat. We spent $48.8 million in CapEx on the additional group space at Wynn Las Vegas, taking our spend to date to $181.5 million. 
In Boston, we incurred $233.4 million in total project costs during the quarter, taking the total spend to date to $2.26 billion. We ended the quarter with total debt of $9.2 billion and total cash and investments at $1.8 billion, including approximately $900 million at Wynn Macau. 
During the first quarter, we returned approximately $81 million to shareholders through our quarterly dividend payment and today, we are pleased to announce $0.25 or 33% increase to that recurring quarterly dividends. Our recurring dividend is now $1 per share returning over $100 million per quarter to our shareholders. Consistent with our sharp focus on capital allocation, we will continually evaluate periodic increases to our dividend as well as opportunistic share repurchases as valuation and broader capital allocation priorities warrants. With that, operator, we will now open up the call to Q&A."

But our strategy is working and it shows that Wynn Palace and Wynn Macau can really compete in any market. And Felicia, you've been watching this on for a long time. People get really focused on core mass because that business is always there. Premium and VIP get compressed temporarily. And then, the growth happens.

The quarter was pretty much in line with our expectations and I think I'd just like to jump right in and talk about Macau. So in Macau, we generated $386 million of property EBITDA and, as we've discussed in previous quarters, VIP was down and the premium area continues to be choppy. However, what we saw was, we saw real strength in our core mass. In fact, our core mass increased over 13% year-over-year, and what that shows is that our strategy is working. We've built 5 new restaurants at Wynn Palace over the last 24 months. Our visitation continues to increase. And what's interesting, in March of this year, Wynn Palace achieved its highest normalized EBITDA on record. And 78% of that EBITDA was from the mass business and non-gaming. If you look at Wynn Macau downtown, we're continuing to perform in line exactly with our expectations as we're renovating that property. The Encore Tower, which are probably the nicest rooms in all of Macau, the average size of the room there is 900 square feet, is in a full renovation now. Not just a soft goods renovation, but a full renovation, and that will be complete by the end of the year. We also looked at the success of our Encore casino in Macau, and those approximately 30 games are one of the most productive casino floor plans on the planet. And we thought how -- what can we do to replicate that in half of our casino, our original casino, what we call the West. And so we begin a project about 9 months ago that should wrap up at the end of this year, that will take our original casino that's right now chopped up with various junket rooms and the energy has been suppressed, and it will turn it into what I think will be the nicest premium mass destination in downtown. We'll have 7,000 new square feet of retail entering this area, 2 restaurants flanking the new casino and this should all be finished by the end of the year. So Wynn Macau's best days are ahead of it. 2020 should be a great year for Wynn Macau. 
In Las Vegas, everything was pretty much in line except for baccarat. And I think it's no surprise to the people on this call, baccarat was down for us quite significantly, just as it was for the market. So all of our competitors felt it, baccarat was definitely soft in the first quarter. What I have been impressed by is Marilyn coming in and her team, understanding that baccarat is in a temporary decline, have focused on the non-baccarat casino business. And for the first time in a long time, our table drop, excluding baccarat, in the first quarter actually increased 10% over last year. And I give a lot of credit to Marilyn and her team and the new marketing people that she has brought on to focus on areas where we have not focused as carefully in the past, and I think it's an area of growth for us in the future. 
There's been a lot of discussion about new jurisdictions opening up in Asia and around the world, and that maybe baccarat's best days are behind it in Las Vegas or that Macau can continue to see some cannibalization, and what I would say to that is I totally disagree. We've experienced gaming expansion in the United States for decades. And we're experiencing it now in Asia. But what always happens is customers will go try out the new product, they'll go to a place where they're getting free money and big discounts, but that never lasts. Customers with money and choice always go to the place that they enjoy the most. And you cannot replicate Las Vegas or Macau anywhere else on the planet. The number of hotel rooms, the entertainment options, the infrastructure, the service levels can't be replicated. And so our company and our growth profile are properly situated to bet on the future growth of the 2 best gaming jurisdictions in the world. Las Vegas and Macau. And I am a very firm believer that our product is positioned perfectly in both of those markets. 
In Massachusetts, we received a decision from the MGC regarding their investigation last week. Importantly, there was no impact on the suitability of the company or its key employees to hold the gaming license in the state, and we are ready to move forward with the opening of Encore Boston Harbor. However, we are still reviewing the decision as it relates to some of the secondary and tertiary conditions imposed by the commission. We do not believe, if we choose to appeal that, that will impact our ability to open the project at the end of June. So the regulatory process has consumed a great deal of resources at both the company and with the regulators. We are focused on opening this property within weeks, and we feel very confident that it will be the nicest integrated resort on the East Coast. 
But before I turn it over to Craig, I'd just like to remind everybody about why I'm such a big believer in this company. We've been through a significant transition, and there's been some turmoil over the last 15 months. But that is now behind us. And if you look at our future and you look at our company and our growth profile, I believe it's unparalleled in this business. In Macau, we have 1,300 rooms, 700-plus in phase one, plus the Crystal Pavilion that we've made significant progress on for Wynn Palace, and that project is needed for Wynn Palace to continue to grow, and we're really excited about it. We're about to open Encore Boston Harbor, which is a step change in our EBITDA, in weeks. 
Here in Las Vegas, we have a new convention center opening, doubling the amount of convention square footage we have over the next 6 months, multiple new restaurants coming into the property and a fresh look at the way we think about our casino business. So our growth profile is quite strong and I am a big believer and we're all big believers that Macau and Las Vegas, best days are ahead of it.
With that, I'm going to turn it over to Craig to get into some of the details."

As noted in our release, our Macau operations delivered $386.5 million of adjusted property EBITDA on $1.25 billion of operating revenues. As Matt noted, the quarter was characterized by continued choppiness in VIP and premium mass offset by meaningful growth in main floor core mass, with combined property win in that core mass segment up 13.1% year-over-year. 
March was particularly strong with Palace experiencing its best month ever in mass drop, mass win and EBITDA. Our results in Macau were positively impacted by VIP hold, increasing EBITDA at Wynn Palace by approximately $25 million from a normalized level. 
Bad debt expense in Macau was $1.8 million in the quarter compared to $300,000 in the prior year. 
Our Las Vegas operations delivered $108.3 million of adjusted property EBITDA in the quarter on net revenues of $401 million, with year-over-year growth in non-baccarat table drop and slot volumes. As discussed on our fourth quarter 2018 call, a large group shift from Q1 to Q2 this year negatively impacted RevPAR growth and food and beverage revenues in the quarter. 
We expect offsetting outperformance in RevPAR in the second quarter. Consistent with the broader Las Vegas market and our commentary on the fourth quarter call, baccarat volumes declined year-over-year and such declines were the primary driver of the year-over-year EBITDA decrease. 
The property held high, adding a little over $5 million to EBITDA. Bad debt expense in Las Vegas was $3.6 million compared to $400,000 in the prior year quarter. Compared to the prior year quarter, EBITDA margin in Las Vegas was negatively impacted by the swing in bad debt and operating deleverage from baccarat. We spent $48.8 million in CapEx on the additional group space at Wynn Las Vegas, taking our spend to date to $181.5 million. 
In Boston, we incurred $233.4 million in total project costs during the quarter, taking the total spend to date to $2.26 billion. We ended the quarter with total debt of $9.2 billion and total cash and investments at $1.8 billion, including approximately $900 million at Wynn Macau. 
During the first quarter, we returned approximately $81 million to shareholders through our quarterly dividend payment, and today we are pleased to announce a $0.25 or 33% increase to that recurring quarterly dividends. Our recurring dividend is now $1 per share, returning over $100 million per quarter to our shareholders. Consistent with our sharp focus on capital allocation, we will continually evaluate periodic increases to our dividend as well as opportunistic share repurchases as valuation and broader capital allocation priorities warrants. With that, operator, we will now open up the call to Q&A."

But our strategy is working and it shows that Wynn Palace and Wynn Macau can really compete in any market. And Felicia, you've been watching this for a long time.

The quarter was pretty much in line with our expectations and I think I'd just like to jump right in and talk about Macau. So in Macau, we generated $386 million of property EBITDA and, as we've discussed in previous quarters, VIP was down and the premium area continues to be choppy. However, what we saw was, we saw real strength in our core mass. In fact, our core mass increased over 13% year-over-year, and what that shows is that our strategy is working. We've built 5 new restaurants at Wynn Palace over the last 24 months. Our visitation continues to increase. 
And what's interesting, in March of this year, Wynn Palace achieved its highest normalized EBITDA on record. And 78% of that EBITDA was from the mass business and non-gaming. If you look at Wynn Macau downtown, we're continuing to perform in line exactly with our expectations as we're renovating that property. The Encore Tower, which are probably the nicest rooms in all of Macau, the average size of the room there is 900 square feet, is in a full renovation now. Not just a soft goods renovation, but a full renovation, and that will be complete by the end of the year. We also looked at the success of our Encore casino in Macau, and those approximately 30 games are one of the most productive casino floor plans on the planet. 
And we thought how -- what can we do to replicate that in half of our casino, our original casino, what we call the West. And so we begin a project about 9 months ago that should wrap up at the end of this year, that will take our original casino that's right now chopped up with various junket rooms and the energy has been suppressed, and it will turn it into what I think will be the nicest premium mass destination in downtown. We'll have 7,000 new square feet of retail entering this area, 2 restaurants flanking the new casino and this should all be finished by the end of the year. So Wynn Macau's best days are ahead of it. 2020 should be a great year for Wynn Macau. 
In Las Vegas, everything was pretty much in line except for baccarat. And I think it's no surprise to the people on this call, baccarat was down for us quite significantly, just as it was for the market. So all of our competitors felt it, baccarat was definitely soft in the first quarter. What I have been impressed by is Marilyn coming in and her team, understanding that baccarat is in a temporary decline, have focused on the non-baccarat casino business. And for the first time in a long time, our table drop, excluding baccarat, in the first quarter actually increased 10% over last year. And I give a lot of credit to Marilyn and her team and the new marketing people that she has brought on to focus on areas where we have not focused as carefully in the past, and I think it's an area of growth for us in the future. 
There's been a lot of discussion about new jurisdictions opening up in Asia and around the world, and that maybe baccarat's best days are behind it in Las Vegas or that Macau can continue to see some cannibalization, and what I would say to that is I totally disagree. We've experienced gaming expansion in the United States for decades. And we're experiencing it now in Asia. But what always happens is customers will go try out the new product, they'll go to a place where they're getting free money and big discounts, but that never lasts. Customers with money and choice always go to the place that they enjoy the most. And you cannot replicate Las Vegas or Macau anywhere else on the planet. The number of hotel rooms, the entertainment options, the infrastructure, the service levels can't be replicated. And so our company and our growth profile are properly situated to bet on the future growth of the 2 best gaming jurisdictions in the world. Las Vegas and Macau. And I am a very firm believer that our product is positioned perfectly in both of those markets. 
In Massachusetts, we received a decision from the MGC regarding their investigation last week. Importantly, there was no impact on the suitability of the company or its key employees to hold the gaming license in the state, and we are ready to move forward with the opening of Encore Boston Harbor. However, we are still reviewing the decision as it relates to some of the secondary and tertiary conditions imposed by the commission. We do not believe, if we choose to appeal that, that will impact our ability to open the project at the end of June. So the regulatory process has consumed a great deal of resources at both the company and with the regulators. We are focused on opening this property within weeks, and we feel very confident that it will be the nicest integrated resort on the East Coast. 
But before I turn it over to Craig, I'd just like to remind everybody about why I'm such a big believer in this company. We've been through a significant transition, and there's been some turmoil over the last 15 months. But that is now behind us. And if you look at our future and you look at our company and our growth profile, I believe it's unparalleled in this business. In Macau, we have 1,300 rooms, 700-plus in Phase 1, plus the Crystal Pavilion that we've made significant progress on for Wynn Palace, and that project is needed for Wynn Palace to continue to grow, and we're really excited about it. We're about to open Encore Boston Harbor, which is a step change in our EBITDA, in weeks. 
Here in Las Vegas, we have a new convention center opening, doubling the amount of convention square footage we have over the next 6 months, multiple new restaurants coming into the property and a fresh look at the way we think about our casino business. So our growth profile is quite strong and I am a big believer and we're all big believers that Macau and Las Vegas, best days are ahead of it.
With that, I'm going to turn it over to Craig to get into some of the details."

As noted in our release, our Macau operations delivered $386.5 million of adjusted property EBITDA on $1.25 billion of operating revenues. As Matt noted, the quarter was characterized by continued choppiness in VIP and premium mass offset by meaningful growth in main floor core mass, with combined property win in that core mass segment up 13.1% year-over-year. 
March was particularly strong with Palace experiencing its best month ever in mass drop, mass win and EBITDA. Our results in Macau were positively impacted by VIP hold, increasing EBITDA at Wynn Palace by approximately $25 million from a normalized level. Bad debt expense in Macau was $1.8 million in the quarter compared to $300,000 in the prior year. 
Our Las Vegas operations delivered $108.3 million of adjusted property EBITDA in the quarter on net revenues of $401 million, with year-over-year growth in non-baccarat table drop and slot volumes. As discussed on our fourth quarter 2018 call, a large group shift from Q1 to Q2 this year negatively impacted RevPAR growth and food and beverage revenues in the quarter. 
We expect offsetting outperformance in RevPAR in the second quarter. Consistent with the broader Las Vegas market and our commentary on the fourth quarter call, baccarat volumes declined year-over-year and such declines were the primary driver of the year-over-year EBITDA decrease. 
The property held high, adding a little over $5 million to EBITDA. Bad debt expense in Las Vegas was $3.6 million compared to $400,000 in the prior year quarter. Compared to the prior year quarter, EBITDA margin in Las Vegas was negatively impacted by the swing in bad debt and operating deleverage from baccarat. We spent $48.8 million in CapEx on the additional group space at Wynn Las Vegas, taking our spend to date to $181.5 million. 
In Boston, we incurred $233.4 million in total project costs during the quarter, taking the total spend to date to $2.26 billion. We ended the quarter with total debt of $9.2 billion and total cash and investments at $1.8 billion, including approximately $900 million at Wynn Macau. 
During the first quarter, we returned approximately $81 million to shareholders through our quarterly dividend payment, and today we are pleased to announce a $0.25 or 33% increase to that recurring quarterly dividends. Our recurring dividend is now $1 per share, returning over $100 million per quarter to our shareholders. Consistent with our sharp focus on capital allocation, we will continually evaluate periodic increases to our dividend as well as opportunistic share repurchases as valuation and broader capital allocation priorities warrants. 
With that, operator, we will now open up the call to Q&A."

But our strategy is working and it shows that Wynn Palace and Wynn Macau can really compete in any market. And Felicia, you've been watching this for a long time.

As we look back in the second quarter, I'd like to start with congratulating the 5,000 new team members that we have in Massachusetts for opening Encore Boston Harbor. The property opened on June 23. To",1105,"Thanks, Craig, and thank you all for joining today. As we look back in the second quarter, I'd like to start with congratulating the 5,000 new team members that we have in Massachusetts for opening Encore Boston Harbor. The property opened on June 23. To much fanfare, thousands and thousands of visitors coming in and the property has not disappointed. The reviews have been terrific. People really appreciate the quality and our service levels are beginning to ramp to Wynn standards.
We've seen some really positive impact on the -- in the casino on the table games side and in Boston right now, table games are performing well. Our hotel is beginning to ramp, and we are working on various offers and promotions to really understand the highly competitive slot market in the Northeast and believe that with our property's location, with our management team and with our product, that we will continue to ramp that property and take share in the Northeast. And we look forward to sharing more results as we have more days under our belt after our third quarter.
Moving on to Macau. We generated $343 million of EBITDA this quarter. Macau is currently a really core mass market driven market right now. Our core mass was up over 22% compared to last year, that compares to core mass of 13% in the first quarter. We're continuing to see some choppiness in the premium market and in the VIP market. As an example, April EBITDA, on a combined basis, was down 21% over last year, yet May and June were up over 7% and our VIP turnover in May and June were essentially flat with last year. So really, what that tells us is you can't look at 1 month as a trend, as an example, the July numbers were recently put out by the DICJ, and it was pretty clear that there was some softness in the VIP sector. We do not look at that as a trend, we look at it as a data point. And fully believe in our premium market focus as we continue to take share in the core mass.
Looking at the property specifically. At Wynn Macau, we saw mass revenues grow over 10% and that validates our strategy as we reposition Wynn Macau last year to turn it from a largely VIP junket house by reconfiguring the West Casino, remodeling the Encore Hotel tower, building 3 new restaurants and an additional 8,000 square feet of retail, all of which will be completed by the end of this year, positioning Wynn Macau as a market share taker on The Peninsula for 2020.
Looking at Wynn Palace. Mass revenues were up approximately 6%, which was led by core mass up in the high -- in double digits, offset by softness on the premium mass side. Wynn Palace continues to be the leader in quality and in luxury in the Macau market. It's clear that we need more rooms at Wynn Palace and at our Investor Day, we laid out our program for the Crystal Pavillion, which includes 1,300 new rooms, 650 rooms in phase 1, plus the Crystal Pavillion itself, which is a nongaming development that has a new theater concept, a collaboration with the museum that's going to have one of the largest collections of Chinese art on the planet as well as 14 new food and beverage outlets. The Crystal Pavillion, coupled with the rooms, will make Wynn Palace the must-see destination in Macau.
Moving to Wynn Las Vegas. I have to congratulate Maryland and the team in Wynn Las Vegas for an extraordinary quarter and executing our strategy. It was the first time in over 5 years where our REVPAR increased by more than 9.5%, but what I find much more interesting was our focus on the casino, which could last 5 to 6 years, have largely been ignored. As an example, our domestic table games business was up 12% this quarter when the overall Las Vegas Strip was down 6%. Our slot revenues were up 12% this quarter when the overall Las Vegas Strip was only up 7%.
Our baccarat revenues increased 5x faster than the market. Clearly, we had some high hold. But even on the drop basis, our Baccarat drop was up 16% this quarter, while the market was only up 11%. So it's quite an extraordinary result, which was a strategic change in focusing on the casino and driving additional visits and more play.
Another thing that I was really part of the team is our Net Promoter Score at Wynn Las Vegas was the highest in the company's history. And Net Promoter Score is a simple question that we ask all of our hotel guests and over 40,000 people responded this year, which is similar as the years past, which is, “Would you recommend Wynn Las Vegas to your friends and family?” This year, we outpaced the luxury hotel benchmark by over 15% and had the highest score in 2019 in our company's history. So through the cultural shift that occurred in Las Vegas, I think that, that single fact, coupled with the numbers, said a lot about this management team and what we've been able to achieve.
If you take the strong operational prowess and combine that with all of the capital improvements that we launched last year, a 400,000 square-foot convention center that's going to open in 6 months, Thomas Keller, the renowned chef, will be opening his first fine dining restaurant in Las Vegas in 2020 here at Wynn Las Vegas. [indiscernible], the top Mexican chef in North America, has 2 of the top 50 restaurants in the World's best, will be opening his first restaurant in Las Vegas at Wynn Las Vegas in 2020. And we also opened a new separate club of Delilah that I think will be the next evolution of nightlife in Las Vegas.
So you combine all of these new projects with what our operations team has been able to deliver, and I believe that Wynn Las Vegas will continue to be market-share takers here in Las Vegas. Our vision is clear: we're going to continue to take market share in Las Vegas, we're going to on the premium market in Macau and we're going to ramp Encore Boston Harbor to be the top grossing casino in the Northeast.
We're very confident in our strategy and what that's going to do to produce significant cash flow for our company and for our investors. With that, I'm going to turn it over to Craig to get into more of the numbers."

As noted in our release, our Macau operations delivered $343 million of adjusted property EBITDA on $1.18 billion of operating revenues.

As noted in our release, our Macau operations delivered $343 million of adjusted property EBITDA on $1.18 billion of operating revenues. As Matt noted, the quarter was characterized by strength in main floor core mass with combined property win in that core mass segment of 22% year-over-year.
Our results in Macau were positively impacted by VIP hold, increasing EBITDA at Wynn Macau by approximately $8 million from a normalized level. Bad debt expense at Wynn Macau was comparable year-over-year, while at Wynn Palace, a swing from the $2.6 million credit in last year's quarter to a $2 million expansion this year's quarter cost us nearly $5 million in year-over-year comparable EBITDA.
During the quarter, we spent $23.5 million on the West Casino refurbishment and Encore room refresh, taking our spend to date to approximately $42 million. Our Las Vegas operation delivered $137.4 million of adjusted property EBITDA in the quarter on operating revenue of $464.1 million, with year-over-year growth in both Baccarat and non-Baccarat table drop as well as slot table. On the hotel side, REVPAR increased 9.5% year-over-year to $300, driving $127.6 million of hotel revenue, which is a property record. The property held high, adding approximately $12 million to EBITDA. Bad debt expense in Las Vegas was $2.4 million compared to $1.7 million in the prior year quarter. 
We expect $58 million in project cost and the additional group space at Wynn Las Vegas taking hours spent to date to $246.6 million. In Boston, we incurred $187.6 million in total project costs during the quarter, taking our total spent of data $2.45 billion. The remaining CapEx  and construction retention of approximately $150 million will be paid over the coming quarters. We ended the quarter with total debt of $9.15 billion and total cash and investments of $1.15 billion, including approximately $804.3 million at Wynn Macau.
During the second quarter, we returned to over $100 million to shareholders through our quarterly dividend payment. We will continue to look closely at capital allocation alternatives, including periodic increases to our dividend as well as opportunistic share repurchases.
With that, we will now open up the call to Q&A."

As we look back at second quarter, I'd like to start with congratulating the 5,000 new team members that we have in Massachusetts for opening Encore Boston Harbor. The property opened on June 23",1101,"Thanks, Craig, and thank you all for joining our call today. As we look back at second quarter, I'd like to start with congratulating the 5,000 new team members that we have in Massachusetts for opening Encore Boston Harbor. The property opened on June 23 to much fanfare, thousands and thousands of visitors coming in and the property has not disappointed. The reviews have been terrific. People really appreciate the quality and our service levels are beginning to ramp to Wynn standards.
We've seen some really positive impact in the casino on the table games side in Boston right now. Table games are performing well. Our hotel is beginning to ramp, and we are working on various offers and promotions to really understand the highly competitive slot market in the Northeast and believe that with our property's location, with our management team and with our product that we will continue to ramp that property and take share in the Northeast. And we look forward to sharing more results as we have more days under our belt after our third quarter.
Moving on to Macau. We generated $343 million of EBITDA this quarter. Macau is currently a really core mass market-driven market right now. Our core mass was up over 22% compared to last year. That compares to core mass up 13% in the first quarter. We're continuing to see some choppiness in the premium market and in the VIP market. As an example, April EBITDA on a combined basis was down 21% over last year, yet May and June were up over 7%, and our VIP turnover in May and June were essentially flat with last year. So really, what that tells us is you can't look at 1 month as a trend. As an example, the July numbers were recently put out by the DICJ, and it was pretty clear that there was some softness in the VIP segment. We do not look at that as a trend, we look at it as a data point and fully believe in our premium market focus as we continue to take share in the core mass.
Looking at the property specifically. At Wynn Macau, we saw mass revenues grow over 10%. And that validates our strategy as we repositioned Wynn Macau last year to turn it from a largely VIP junket house by reconfiguring the West Casino, remodeling the Encore Hotel Tower, building 3 new restaurants and an additional 8,000 square feet of retail, all of which will be completed by the end of this year, positioning Wynn Macau as a market share taker on the peninsula for 2020.
Looking at Wynn Palace. Mass revenues were up approximately 6%, which was led by core mass up in double digits, offset by softness on the premium mass side. Wynn Palace continues to be the leader in quality and in luxury in the Macau market. It's clear that we need more rooms at Wynn Palace. And at our Investor Day, we laid out our program for the Crystal Pavilion, which includes 1,300 new rooms, 650 rooms in Phase 1, plus the Crystal Pavilion itself, which is a nongaming development that has a new theater concept, a collaboration with a museum that's going to have one of the largest collections of Chinese art on the planet as well as 14 new food and beverage outlets. The Crystal Pavilion, coupled with the rooms, will make Wynn Palace the must-see destination in Macau.
Moving to Wynn Las Vegas. I have to congratulate Marilyn and the team in Wynn Las Vegas for an extraordinary quarter in executing our strategy. It was the first time in over 5 years where our REVPAR increased by more than 9.5%, but what I find much more interesting was our focus on the casino, which for the last 5 to 6 years had largely been ignored. As an example, our domestic table games business was up 12% this quarter when the overall Las Vegas Strip was down 6%. Our slot revenues were up 12% this quarter when the overall Las Vegas Strip was only up 7%. Our baccarat revenues increased 5x faster than the market. Clearly, we had some high hold. But even on a drop basis, our baccarat drop was up 16% this quarter while the market was only up 11%. So it's quite an extraordinary result, which was a strategic change in focusing on the casino and driving additional visits and more play.
Another thing that I was really proud of the team is our Net Promoter Score at Wynn Las Vegas was the highest in the company's history. A Net Promoter Score is a simple question that we ask all of our hotel guests and over 40,000 people responded this year, which is similar as to years past, which is, would you recommend Wynn Las Vegas to your friends and family? This year, we outpaced the luxury hotel benchmark by over 15% and had the highest score in 2019 in our company's history. So through the cultural shift that's occurred in Las Vegas, I think that, that single fact, coupled with the numbers, says a lot about this management team and what we've been able to achieve.
You take the strong operational prowess and combine that with all of the capital improvements that we launched last year, a 400,000 square-foot convention center that's going to open in 6 months. Thomas Keller, the renowned chef, will be opening his first fine dining restaurant in Las Vegas in 2020 here at Wynn Las Vegas. Enrique Olvera, the top Mexican chef in North America, has 2 of the top 50 restaurants on the World's Best, will be opening his first restaurant in Las Vegas at Wynn Las Vegas in 2020. And we'll be also opening a new separate club called Delilah that I think will be the next evolution of nightlife in Las Vegas.
So you combine all of these new projects with what our operations team has been able to deliver, and I believe that Wynn Las Vegas will continue to be market share takers here in Las Vegas. Our vision is clear. We're going to continue to take market share in Las Vegas, we're going to own the premium market in Macau and we're going to ramp Encore Boston Harbor to be the top grossing casino in the Northeast. We're very confident in our strategy and what that's going to do is produce significant free cash flow for our company and for our investors.
With that, I'm going to turn it over to Craig to get into more of the numbers."

As Matt noted, the quarter was characterized by strength in main floor core mass with combined property win in that core mass segment up 22% year-over-year.
Our results in Macau were positively impacted by VIP hold, increasing EBITDA at Wynn Macau by approximately $8 million from a normalized level. Bad debt expense at Wynn Macau was comparable year-over-year, while at Wynn Palace, a swing from a $2.6 million credit in last year's quarter to a $2 million expense in this year's quarter cost us nearly $5 million in year-over-year comparable EBITDA. During the quarter, we spent $23.5 million on the West Casino refurbishment and Encore room refresh, taking our spend to date to approximately $42 million.
Our Las Vegas Operations delivered $137.4 million of adjusted property EBITDA in the quarter on operating revenue of $464.1 million, with year-over-year growth in both baccarat and non-baccarat table drop as well as slot handle. On the hotel side, REVPAR increased 9.5% year-over-year to $300, driving $127.6 million of hotel revenue, which is a property record. The property held high, adding approximately $12 million to EBITDA. Bad debt expense in Las Vegas was $2.4 million compared to $1.7 million in the prior year quarter. We expect $58 million in project cost on the additional group space at Wynn Las Vegas, taking our spend to date to $246.6 million.
In Boston, we incurred $187.6 million in total project cost during the quarter, taking our total spend to date to $2.45 billion. The remaining CapEx and construction retention of approximately $150 million will be paid over the coming quarters.
We ended the quarter with total debt of $9.15 billion and total cash and investments of $1.51 billion, including approximately $804.3 million at Wynn Macau.
During the second quarter, we returned over $100 million to shareholders through our quarterly dividend payment. We will continue to look closely at capital allocation alternatives, including periodic increases to our dividend as well as opportunistic share repurchases.
With that, we will now open up the call to Q&A."

As we look back at second quarter, I'd like to start with congratulating the 5,000 new team members that we have in Massachusetts for opening Encore Boston Harbor. The property opened on June 23",1101,"Thanks, Craig, and thank you all for joining our call today. As we look back at second quarter, I'd like to start with congratulating the 5,000 new team members that we have in Massachusetts for opening Encore Boston Harbor. The property opened on June 23 to much fanfare, thousands and thousands of visitors coming in and the property has not disappointed. The reviews have been terrific. People really appreciate the quality and our service levels are beginning to ramp to Wynn standards.
We've seen some really positive impact in the casino on the table games side in Boston right now. Table games are performing well. Our hotel is beginning to ramp, and we are working on various offers and promotions to really understand the highly competitive slot market in the Northeast and believe that with our property's location, with our management team and with our product that we will continue to ramp that property and take share in the Northeast. And we look forward to sharing more results as we have more days under our belt after our third quarter.
Moving on to Macau. We generated $343 million of EBITDA this quarter. Macau is currently a really core mass market-driven market right now. Our core mass was up over 22% compared to last year. That compares to core mass up 13% in the first quarter. We're continuing to see some choppiness in the premium market and in the VIP market. As an example, April EBITDA on a combined basis was down 21% over last year, yet May and June were up over 7%, and our VIP turnover in May and June were essentially flat with last year. So really, what that tells us is you can't look at 1 month as a trend. As an example, the July numbers were recently put out by the DICJ, and it was pretty clear that there was some softness in the VIP segment. We do not look at that as a trend, we look at it as a data point and fully believe in our premium market focus as we continue to take share in the core mass.
Looking at the property specifically. At Wynn Macau, we saw mass revenues grow over 10%. And that validates our strategy as we repositioned Wynn Macau last year to turn it from a largely VIP junket house by reconfiguring the West Casino, remodeling the Encore Hotel Tower, building 3 new restaurants and an additional 8,000 square feet of retail, all of which will be completed by the end of this year, positioning Wynn Macau as a market share taker on the peninsula for 2020.
Looking at Wynn Palace. Mass revenues were up approximately 6%, which was led by core mass up in double digits, offset by softness on the premium mass side. Wynn Palace continues to be the leader in quality and in luxury in the Macau market. It's clear that we need more rooms at Wynn Palace. And at our Investor Day, we laid out our program for the Crystal Pavilion, which includes 1,300 new rooms, 650 rooms in Phase 1, plus the Crystal Pavilion itself, which is a nongaming development that has a new theater concept, a collaboration with a museum that's going to have one of the largest collections of Chinese art on the planet as well as 14 new food and beverage outlets. The Crystal Pavilion, coupled with the rooms, will make Wynn Palace the must-see destination in Macau.
Moving to Wynn Las Vegas. I have to congratulate Marilyn and the team in Wynn Las Vegas for an extraordinary quarter in executing our strategy. It was the first time in over 5 years where our REVPAR increased by more than 9.5%, but what I find much more interesting was our focus on the casino, which for the last 5 to 6 years had largely been ignored. As an example, our domestic table games business was up 12% this quarter when the overall Las Vegas Strip was down 6%. Our slot revenues were up 12% this quarter when the overall Las Vegas Strip was only up 7%. Our baccarat revenues increased 5x faster than the market. Clearly, we had some high hold. But even on a drop basis, our baccarat drop was up 16% this quarter while the market was only up 11%. So it's quite an extraordinary result, which was a strategic change in focusing on the casino and driving additional visits and more play.
Another thing that I was really proud of the team is our Net Promoter Score at Wynn Las Vegas was the highest in the company's history. A Net Promoter Score is a simple question that we ask all of our hotel guests and over 40,000 people responded this year, which is similar as to years past, which is, would you recommend Wynn Las Vegas to your friends and family? This year, we outpaced the luxury hotel benchmark by over 15% and had the highest score in 2019 in our company's history. So through the cultural shift that's occurred in Las Vegas, I think that, that single fact, coupled with the numbers, says a lot about this management team and what we've been able to achieve.
You take the strong operational prowess and combine that with all of the capital improvements that we launched last year, a 400,000 square-foot convention center that's going to open in 6 months. Thomas Keller, the renowned chef, will be opening his first fine dining restaurant in Las Vegas in 2020 here at Wynn Las Vegas. Enrique Olvera, the top Mexican chef in North America, has 2 of the top 50 restaurants on the World's Best, will be opening his first restaurant in Las Vegas at Wynn Las Vegas in 2020. And we'll be also opening a new separate club called Delilah that I think will be the next evolution of nightlife in Las Vegas.
So you combine all of these new projects with what our operations team has been able to deliver, and I believe that Wynn Las Vegas will continue to be market share takers here in Las Vegas. Our vision is clear. We're going to continue to take market share in Las Vegas, we're going to own the premium market in Macau and we're going to ramp Encore Boston Harbor to be the top grossing casino in the Northeast. We're very confident in our strategy and what that's going to do is produce significant free cash flow for our company and for our investors.
With that, I'm going to turn it over to Craig to get into more of the numbers."

As Matt noted, the quarter was characterized by strength in main floor core mass with combined property win in that core mass segment up 22% year-over-year.
Our results in Macau were positively impacted by VIP hold, increasing EBITDA at Wynn Macau by approximately $8 million from a normalized level. Bad debt expense at Wynn Macau was comparable year-over-year, while at Wynn Palace, a swing from a $2.6 million credit in last year's quarter to a $2 million expense in this year's quarter cost us nearly $5 million in year-over-year comparable EBITDA. During the quarter, we spent $23.5 million on the West Casino refurbishment and Encore room refresh, taking our spend to date to approximately $42 million.
Our Las Vegas Operations delivered $137.4 million of adjusted property EBITDA in the quarter on operating revenue of $464.1 million, with year-over-year growth in both baccarat and non-baccarat table drop as well as slot handle. On the hotel side, REVPAR increased 9.5% year-over-year to $300, driving $127.6 million of hotel revenue, which is a property record. The property held high, adding approximately $12 million to EBITDA. Bad debt expense in Las Vegas was $2.4 million compared to $1.7 million in the prior year quarter. We expect $58 million in project cost on the additional group space at Wynn Las Vegas, taking our spend to date to $246.6 million.
In Boston, we incurred $187.6 million in total project cost during the quarter, taking our total spend to date to $2.45 billion. The remaining CapEx and construction retention of approximately $150 million will be paid over the coming quarters.
We ended the quarter with total debt of $9.15 billion and total cash and investments of $1.51 billion, including approximately $804.3 million at Wynn Macau.
During the second quarter, we returned over $100 million to shareholders through our quarterly dividend payment. We will continue to look closely at capital allocation alternatives, including periodic increases to our dividend as well as opportunistic share repurchases.
With that, we will now open up the call to Q&A."

As we look back at second quarter, I'd like to start with congratulating the 5,000 new team members that we have in Massachusetts for opening Encore Boston Harbor. The property opened on June 23",1101,"Thanks, Craig, and thank you all for joining our call today. As we look back at second quarter, I'd like to start with congratulating the 5,000 new team members that we have in Massachusetts for opening Encore Boston Harbor. The property opened on June 23 to much fanfare, thousands and thousands of visitors coming in and the property has not disappointed. The reviews have been terrific. People really appreciate the quality and our service levels are beginning to ramp to Wynn standards.
We've seen some really positive impact in the casino on the table games side in Boston right now. Table games are performing well. Our hotel is beginning to ramp, and we are working on various offers and promotions to really understand the highly competitive slot market in the Northeast and believe that with our property's location, with our management team and with our product that we will continue to ramp that property and take share in the Northeast. And we look forward to sharing more results as we have more days under our belt after our third quarter.
Moving on to Macau. We generated $343 million of EBITDA this quarter. Macau is currently a really core mass market-driven market right now. Our core mass was up over 22% compared to last year. That compares to core mass up 13% in the first quarter. We're continuing to see some choppiness in the premium market and in the VIP market. As an example, April EBITDA on a combined basis was down 21% over last year, yet May and June were up over 7%, and our VIP turnover in May and June were essentially flat with last year. So really, what that tells us is you can't look at 1 month as a trend. As an example, the July numbers were recently put out by the DICJ, and it was pretty clear that there was some softness in the VIP segment. We do not look at that as a trend, we look at it as a data point and fully believe in our premium market focus as we continue to take share in the core mass.
Looking at the property specifically. At Wynn Macau, we saw mass revenues grow over 10%. And that validates our strategy as we repositioned Wynn Macau last year to turn it from a largely VIP junket house by reconfiguring the West Casino, remodeling the Encore Hotel Tower, building 3 new restaurants and an additional 8,000 square feet of retail, all of which will be completed by the end of this year, positioning Wynn Macau as a market share taker on the peninsula for 2020.
Looking at Wynn Palace. Mass revenues were up approximately 6%, which was led by core mass up in double digits, offset by softness on the premium mass side. Wynn Palace continues to be the leader in quality and in luxury in the Macau market. It's clear that we need more rooms at Wynn Palace. And at our Investor Day, we laid out our program for the Crystal Pavilion, which includes 1,300 new rooms, 650 rooms in Phase 1, plus the Crystal Pavilion itself, which is a nongaming development that has a new theater concept, a collaboration with a museum that's going to have one of the largest collections of Chinese art on the planet as well as 14 new food and beverage outlets. The Crystal Pavilion, coupled with the rooms, will make Wynn Palace the must-see destination in Macau.
Moving to Wynn Las Vegas. I have to congratulate Marilyn and the team in Wynn Las Vegas for an extraordinary quarter in executing our strategy. It was the first time in over 5 years where our REVPAR increased by more than 9.5%, but what I find much more interesting was our focus on the casino, which for the last 5 to 6 years had largely been ignored. As an example, our domestic table games business was up 12% this quarter when the overall Las Vegas Strip was down 6%. Our slot revenues were up 12% this quarter when the overall Las Vegas Strip was only up 7%. Our baccarat revenues increased 5x faster than the market. Clearly, we had some high hold. But even on a drop basis, our baccarat drop was up 16% this quarter while the market was only up 11%. So it's quite an extraordinary result, which was a strategic change in focusing on the casino and driving additional visits and more play.
Another thing that I was really proud of the team is our Net Promoter Score at Wynn Las Vegas was the highest in the company's history. A Net Promoter Score is a simple question that we ask all of our hotel guests and over 40,000 people responded this year, which is similar as to years past, which is, would you recommend Wynn Las Vegas to your friends and family? This year, we outpaced the luxury hotel benchmark by over 15% and had the highest score in 2019 in our company's history. So through the cultural shift that's occurred in Las Vegas, I think that, that single fact, coupled with the numbers, says a lot about this management team and what we've been able to achieve.
You take the strong operational prowess and combine that with all of the capital improvements that we launched last year, a 400,000 square-foot convention center that's going to open in 6 months. Thomas Keller, the renowned chef, will be opening his first fine dining restaurant in Las Vegas in 2020 here at Wynn Las Vegas. Enrique Olvera, the top Mexican chef in North America, has 2 of the top 50 restaurants on the World's Best, will be opening his first restaurant in Las Vegas at Wynn Las Vegas in 2020. And we'll be also opening a new separate club called Delilah that I think will be the next evolution of nightlife in Las Vegas.
So you combine all of these new projects with what our operations team has been able to deliver, and I believe that Wynn Las Vegas will continue to be market share takers here in Las Vegas. Our vision is clear. We're going to continue to take market share in Las Vegas, we're going to own the premium market in Macau and we're going to ramp Encore Boston Harbor to be the top grossing casino in the Northeast. We're very confident in our strategy and what that's going to do is produce significant free cash flow for our company and for our investors.
With that, I'm going to turn it over to Craig to get into more of the numbers."

As Matt noted, the quarter was characterized by strength in main floor core mass with combined property win in that core mass segment up 22% year-over-year.
Our results in Macau were positively impacted by VIP hold, increasing EBITDA at Wynn Macau by approximately $8 million from a normalized level. Bad debt expense at Wynn Macau was comparable year-over-year, while at Wynn Palace, a swing from a $2.6 million credit in last year's quarter to a $2 million expense in this year's quarter cost us nearly $5 million in year-over-year comparable EBITDA. During the quarter, we spent $23.5 million on the West Casino refurbishment and Encore room refresh, taking our spend to date to approximately $42 million.
Our Las Vegas Operations delivered $137.4 million of adjusted property EBITDA in the quarter on operating revenue of $464.1 million, with year-over-year growth in both baccarat and non-baccarat table drop as well as slot handle. On the hotel side, REVPAR increased 9.5% year-over-year to $300, driving $127.6 million of hotel revenue, which is a property record. The property held high, adding approximately $12 million to EBITDA. Bad debt expense in Las Vegas was $2.4 million compared to $1.7 million in the prior year quarter. We expect $58 million in project cost on the additional group space at Wynn Las Vegas, taking our spend to date to $246.6 million.
In Boston, we incurred $187.6 million in total project cost during the quarter, taking our total spend to date to $2.45 billion. The remaining CapEx and construction retention of approximately $150 million will be paid over the coming quarters.
We ended the quarter with total debt of $9.15 billion and total cash and investments of $1.51 billion, including approximately $804.3 million at Wynn Macau.
During the second quarter, we returned over $100 million to shareholders through our quarterly dividend payment. We will continue to look closely at capital allocation alternatives, including periodic increases to our dividend as well as opportunistic share repurchases.
With that, we will now open up the call to Q&A."

And if one junket might be experiencing volume declines, how would that kind of impact the business in the aggregate? And then just a follow-up to Carlos' question about the margins at Wynn Palace. If we were to normalize for those hold impacts in, say, the 2Q and 1Q at Wynn Palace, what would be a normalized hold EBITDA margin in the 2Q and 1Q, just to sort of better understand that dynamic and that's it for me."

That, coupled with the multigenerational travel that exist in Asia, much different than really anywhere else in the world, the Crystal Pavilion is going to attract lots of customers, but also as we see out at Cotai, families travel with customers.

And I just like to again remind everybody, the premium business is not going away. We've all seen this over many, many years, in 2016, in 2012, when it artificially contracts for a very short period of time and people focus on core and then it expands quite rapidly. So what we're not going to do is change who we are. We are the premium operator and we will continue to be the premium operator.

As we look back at second quarter, I'd like to start with congratulating the 5,000 new team members that we have in Massachusetts for opening Encore Boston Harbor. The property opened on June 23",1101,"Thanks, Craig, and thank you all for joining our call today. As we look back at second quarter, I'd like to start with congratulating the 5,000 new team members that we have in Massachusetts for opening Encore Boston Harbor. The property opened on June 23 to much fanfare, thousands and thousands of visitors coming in and the property has not disappointed. The reviews have been terrific. People really appreciate the quality and our service levels are beginning to ramp to Wynn standards.
We've seen some really positive impact in the casino on the table games side in Boston right now. Table games are performing well. Our hotel is beginning to ramp, and we are working on various offers and promotions to really understand the highly competitive slot market in the Northeast and believe that with our property's location, with our management team and with our product that we will continue to ramp that property and take share in the Northeast. And we look forward to sharing more results as we have more days under our belt after our third quarter.
Moving on to Macau. We generated $343 million of EBITDA this quarter. Macau is currently a really core mass market-driven market right now. Our core mass was up over 22% compared to last year. That compares to core mass up 13% in the first quarter. We're continuing to see some choppiness in the premium market and in the VIP market. As an example, April EBITDA on a combined basis was down 21% over last year, yet May and June were up over 7%, and our VIP turnover in May and June were essentially flat with last year. So really, what that tells us is you can't look at 1 month as a trend. As an example, the July numbers were recently put out by the DICJ, and it was pretty clear that there was some softness in the VIP segment. We do not look at that as a trend, we look at it as a data point and fully believe in our premium market focus as we continue to take share in the core mass.
Looking at the property specifically. At Wynn Macau, we saw mass revenues grow over 10%. And that validates our strategy as we repositioned Wynn Macau last year to turn it from a largely VIP junket house by reconfiguring the West Casino, remodeling the Encore Hotel Tower, building 3 new restaurants and an additional 8,000 square feet of retail, all of which will be completed by the end of this year, positioning Wynn Macau as a market share taker on the peninsula for 2020.
Looking at Wynn Palace. Mass revenues were up approximately 6%, which was led by core mass up in double digits, offset by softness on the premium mass side. Wynn Palace continues to be the leader in quality and in luxury in the Macau market. It's clear that we need more rooms at Wynn Palace. And at our Investor Day, we laid out our program for the Crystal Pavilion, which includes 1,300 new rooms, 650 rooms in Phase 1, plus the Crystal Pavilion itself, which is a nongaming development that has a new theater concept, a collaboration with a museum that's going to have one of the largest collections of Chinese art on the planet as well as 14 new food and beverage outlets. The Crystal Pavilion, coupled with the rooms, will make Wynn Palace the must-see destination in Macau.
Moving to Wynn Las Vegas. I have to congratulate Marilyn and the team in Wynn Las Vegas for an extraordinary quarter in executing our strategy. It was the first time in over 5 years where our REVPAR increased by more than 9.5%, but what I find much more interesting was our focus on the casino, which for the last 5 to 6 years had largely been ignored. As an example, our domestic table games business was up 12% this quarter when the overall Las Vegas Strip was down 6%. Our slot revenues were up 12% this quarter when the overall Las Vegas Strip was only up 7%. Our baccarat revenues increased 5x faster than the market. Clearly, we had some high hold. But even on a drop basis, our baccarat drop was up 16% this quarter while the market was only up 11%. So it's quite an extraordinary result, which was a strategic change in focusing on the casino and driving additional visits and more play.
Another thing that I was really proud of the team is our Net Promoter Score at Wynn Las Vegas was the highest in the company's history. A Net Promoter Score is a simple question that we ask all of our hotel guests and over 40,000 people responded this year, which is similar as to years past, which is, would you recommend Wynn Las Vegas to your friends and family? This year, we outpaced the luxury hotel benchmark by over 15% and had the highest score in 2019 in our company's history. So through the cultural shift that's occurred in Las Vegas, I think that, that single fact, coupled with the numbers, says a lot about this management team and what we've been able to achieve.
You take the strong operational prowess and combine that with all of the capital improvements that we launched last year, a 400,000 square-foot convention center that's going to open in 6 months. Thomas Keller, the renowned chef, will be opening his first fine dining restaurant in Las Vegas in 2020 here at Wynn Las Vegas. Enrique Olvera, the top Mexican chef in North America, has 2 of the top 50 restaurants on the World's Best, will be opening his first restaurant in Las Vegas at Wynn Las Vegas in 2020. And we'll be also opening a new separate club called Delilah that I think will be the next evolution of nightlife in Las Vegas.
So you combine all of these new projects with what our operations team has been able to deliver, and I believe that Wynn Las Vegas will continue to be market share takers here in Las Vegas. Our vision is clear. We're going to continue to take market share in Las Vegas, we're going to own the premium market in Macau and we're going to ramp Encore Boston Harbor to be the top grossing casino in the Northeast. We're very confident in our strategy and what that's going to do is produce significant free cash flow for our company and for our investors.
With that, I'm going to turn it over to Craig to get into more of the numbers."

As Matt noted, the quarter was characterized by strength in main floor core mass with combined property win in that core mass segment up 22% year-over-year.
Our results in Macau were positively impacted by VIP hold, increasing EBITDA at Wynn Macau by approximately $8 million from a normalized level. Bad debt expense at Wynn Macau was comparable year-over-year, while at Wynn Palace, a swing from a $2.6 million credit in last year's quarter to a $2 million expense in this year's quarter cost us nearly $5 million in year-over-year comparable EBITDA. During the quarter, we spent $23.5 million on the West Casino refurbishment and Encore room refresh, taking our spend to date to approximately $42 million.
Our Las Vegas Operations delivered $137.4 million of adjusted property EBITDA in the quarter on operating revenue of $464.1 million, with year-over-year growth in both baccarat and non-baccarat table drop as well as slot handle. On the hotel side, REVPAR increased 9.5% year-over-year to $300, driving $127.6 million of hotel revenue, which is a property record. The property held high, adding approximately $12 million to EBITDA. Bad debt expense in Las Vegas was $2.4 million compared to $1.7 million in the prior year quarter. We expect $58 million in project cost on the additional group space at Wynn Las Vegas, taking our spend to date to $246.6 million.
In Boston, we incurred $187.6 million in total project cost during the quarter, taking our total spend to date to $2.45 billion. The remaining CapEx and construction retention of approximately $150 million will be paid over the coming quarters.
We ended the quarter with total debt of $9.15 billion and total cash and investments of $1.51 billion, including approximately $804.3 million at Wynn Macau.
During the second quarter, we returned over $100 million to shareholders through our quarterly dividend payment. We will continue to look closely at capital allocation alternatives, including periodic increases to our dividend as well as opportunistic share repurchases.
With that, we will now open up the call to Q&A."

Our hotel is full and on the weekends, we're turning away customers that we do not want to be turning away. And we know that they will spend more time and more money with us if they're staying with us. That, coupled with the multigenerational travel that exist in Asia, much different than really anywhere else in the world, the Crystal Pavilion is going to attract lots of customers, but also as we see out at Cotai, families travel with customers. So we think that the Crystal Pavilion entertainment -- the Crystal Pavilion project will be attractive to a much broader audience. And we've estimated that we expect over 10 million visits to that on an annual basis. So the premium mass will be in the hotel and we think that we'll get significant incremental visitation from the core mass with the project."

So Wynn Macau will be perfectly positioned to continue to take additional share in core mass starting in 2020 as we finish that program.
And I just like to again remind everybody, the premium business is not going away. We've all seen this over many, many years, in 2016, in 2012, when it artificially contracts for a very short period of time and people focus on core and then it expands quite rapidly. So what we're not going to do is change who we are. We are the premium operator and we will continue to be the premium operator.

I'd like to get started talking about Macau. In the third quarter, in Macau, we generated $301 million of EBITDA. However, we had a hold impact from our",1188,"Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for our third quarter conference call. 
I'd like to get started talking about Macau. In the third quarter, in Macau, we generated $301 million of EBITDA. However, we had a hold impact from our direct business of approximately $22 million. We held negative 1% at Wynn Palace in our direct program and 1.2% in our direct program in Wynn Macau. The way the direct programs are structured, you pay commission on turnover, not on win loss. So when you have abnormally low hold, that revenue mix significantly impacts EBITDA, and that was a $22 million impact in Macau. 
VIP continued to compress, and we did see some customer trial out at Cotai, with some of the newer products at both City of Dreams and MGM. But I believe and we all believe that, that is quite temporary. Mass continued to grow. We maintained our share in mass market and slots at 14%. And I'm pleased to say that while the VIP trends and the mass trends continued into October, we generated over $4 million a day of EBITDA during the month of October, driven largely by an 8% growth in our mass drop during that month. 
Moving on to Las Vegas. We've continued to see the positive momentum that we experienced in the first quarter. We had a $13 million impact in hold in our Baccarat business in Las Vegas. But if you take a look at the strategy, and the way that we made the pivot to focus on taking market share in the domestic business, casino business and in slots, it is working. And Marilyn and the team are doing a great job. 
We had 9% growth in our domestic table games drop and as well as 9% growth in slot handles during the quarter. Our hotel revenues grew by 5% during the quarter and retail is continuing to really gain traction as it was up over double digits in revenue growth during the quarter. The Las Vegas strategy is working, and we are really excited about 2020. 
Moving on to Boston, at Encore Boston Harbor. First, I'd like to congratulate Brian Goldbrands as the new property president. He's been with us for over a decade, and I know and we all know that he is the exact right person to lead that project. We've been open for 136 days in Boston, and we're learning each and every day how to become more local. We've been tweaking our food and beverage product to make sure we're giving the customers what they want. We've been working on our messaging, and we now have new messaging out to the market. 
We are going to the first time in our company's history in North America, launch a loyalty card, tiered card program, and that will be launching in Boston in the first quarter. And I'm sure as all of you that are very familiar with our business now, a Tier Card program is essential in a regional marketing -- in a regional property. 
Our Table Games business in Boston and our hotel business has actually been quite encouraging. And we always knew the slots would take time to ramp. If you think about it, when we opened our doors in our local database, we had 0 customers. Fast forward 136 days, we have 250,000 people in our database, which is significant growth. In order to compete in a high-frequency market where people are coming multiple times a month, a robust database is necessary because you need to message to the customers what it is you're doing each week and why they need to come into the property. 
We are on the path to growth there. And I think that we have the right team in place. So that's really the wrap on the third quarter. But what I'm excited about is 2020. And the reason is we began a transition with this company in 2018. We reallocated capital to Macau, we thought about Las Vegas differently. We focused on opening Encore Boston Harbor. And if you look at where we are today, I was in Macau 2 weeks ago, walking Wynn Macau, our new property downtown with Ian and Ciaran, who runs the property and Linda, looking at what's about to open in 60 days. We've taken everything that we know about compression of energy and space and what works in food and beverage in new hotel rooms, and we've invested in Wynn Macau to make what we think will be the best premium mass product on the Peninsula. And it will continue to gain share. We have 7,000 square feet of new retail that will be opening, 2 new restaurants, the new casino and the fully remodeled Encore Tower. All of that opens at the end of this year and in early 2020 and will position Wynn Macau as a market share taker in the very near future. 
Wynn Palace remains as the high-quality environment that is really going to continue to be the aspirational property at Cotai. So it's not just our product that I'm excited about. When I was there, and we were talking not just internally, but to our peers in the market. People are quite sanguine about Macau in 2020. There's a new government that's coming and the people are very excited about in December. A lot of the infrastructure projects that have been talked about and underway for years and years and years in Hanshin Island are starting to complete. 
Visitation in Macau has been up double digits for the last 3 quarters. So 2020 feels like Macau is well positioned for growth and that we are well positioned to capture our share of that growth. 
If you look at Las Vegas, we actually have more products coming online in 2020 and than we have since we opened Encore in 2008. We have a 430,000 square foot convention center that's opening in 90 days. This convention center is on our golf course and has a 390-foot promenade with 2-story glass walls overlooking the golf course, leading to an 83,000 square foot ballroom. That's almost 2 acres. And when we walk -- when we walk event planners into that space, their jaws drop and they ask, ""Where do we sign?"" That will be opening in 90 days. 
On top of that, we have 3 new restaurants that will be opening in 2020, creating an entirely different segment of social dining at Wynn Las Vegas, and we are very excited about where we are positioned and how we're positioned against our competitors for 2020. 
And if you think about Boston, we're at the beginning of the ramp. We're not at the end. So each quarter, we're going to be tweaking our marketing. We're going to be focusing on growing our database, working on controlling expenses and growing revenues and EBITDA each quarter. So I'm very excited about the transition that we've been through in the future of this company as we move forward into 2020. 
With that, I'm going to turn it over to Craig."

As noted in our release, our Macau operations delivered adjusted EBITDA of $301.2 million on $1.1 billion of operating revenues.

As noted in our release, our Macau operations delivered adjusted EBITDA of $301.2 million on $1.1 billion of operating revenues. The quarter was characterized by strength in both main floor core mass and premium mass, with combined property win in the Mass segment, up 7% year-over-year. Our results in Macau were negatively impacted by a low direct VIP hold percentage, as Matt mentioned, which decreased EBITDA by approximately $22 million from a normalized level with the hold impact weighted slightly more heavily to Palace at $13 million. Also, you'll recall that we received $11 million of insurance proceeds in the prior year quarter, impacting the year-over-year EBITDA comparison.
The team in Macau did a great job in the quarter of controlling costs at both properties without negatively impacting the guest experience. At Wynn Palace, our operating expenses, excluding taxes, were flat year-over-year and down sequentially, which helped drive a 200 basis point increase in normalized EBITDA margin compared to Q2 despite top line pressure. 
At Wynn Macau, OpEx increased slightly year-over-year and was down sequentially despite some incremental payroll expense as we begin to staff up for the West Casino opening. We are well prepared to drive strong operating leverage when the top line environment improves. 
Our Las Vegas operations produced adjusted property EBITDA of $88 million in the third quarter on operating revenue of $399.5 million, with year-over-year growth in both Baccarat and non-Baccarat table drop and slot handle. On the hotel side, REVPAR increased approximately [ 8% ] year-over-year to $269, driving $116.1 million of hotel revenue. We held low in Las Vegas, which negatively impacted EBITDA by approximately $13 million. 
Bad debt expense in Las Vegas was $4.5 million compared to $500,000 in the prior year quarter, costing us $4 million in comparable EBITDA. We spent just under $60 million in project costs on group space expansion at Wynn Las Vegas, taking our spend to date to $302.7 million. This expansion is slated to open in the first quarter of 2020. We ended the quarter with total debt of $9.54 billion and total cash and investments of $1.68 billion, including approximately $947 million at Wynn Macau. 
During the quarter, we returned over $100 million to shareholders through our quarterly dividend payment. We will continue to look closely at our capital allocation alternatives, including periodic increases to our dividend and opportunistic share repurchases. 
Finally, during the quarter, we completed a refinancing of our U.S. capital structure, which extended our maturities, streamlined our U.S. restricted group and simplified our collateral package for the U.S. and corporate entities. We believe the simplification of our U.S. capital structure will make it easier to understand and ultimately lower our cost of debt capital over time. 
With that, we will now turn it over to questions."

Right now, it's expensive to build in Las Vegas. The trades have more jobs than they have manpower. So what we want to do is watch and see how the Las Vegas market expands with this new product projects coming on board, and then we can determine what will make the most sense to increase shareholder value on that 36 acres."

I'd like to get started talking about Macau. In the third quarter, in Macau, we generated $301 million of EBITDA. However, we had a hold impact from our",1184,"Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for our third quarter conference call. 
I'd like to get started talking about Macau. In the third quarter, in Macau, we generated $301 million of EBITDA. However, we had a hold impact from our direct business of approximately $22 million. We held negative 1% at Wynn Palace in our direct program and 1.2% in our direct program at Wynn Macau. The way the direct programs are structured, you pay commission on turnover, not on win loss. So when you have abnormally low hold, that revenue mix significantly impacts EBITDA, and that was a $22 million impact in Macau. 
VIP continued to compress, and we did see some customer trial out at Cotai, with some of the newer products at both City of Dreams and MGM. But I believe, and we all believe that, that is quite temporary. 
Mass continued to grow. We maintained our share in mass market and slots at 14%. And I'm pleased to say that while the VIP trends and the mass trends continued into October, we generated over $4 million a day of EBITDA during the month of October driven largely by an 8% growth in our mass drop during that month. 
Moving on to Las Vegas. We've continued to see the positive momentum that we experienced in the first quarter. We had a $13 million impact in hold in our baccarat business in Las Vegas. But if you take a look at the strategy and the way that we made the pivot to focus on taking market share in the domestic business, casino business and in slots, it is working. And Marilyn and the team are doing a great job. 
We had 9% growth in our domestic table games drop and as well as 9% growth in slot handles during the quarter. Our hotel revenues grew by 5% during the quarter, and retail is continuing to really gain traction as it was up over double digits in revenue growth during the quarter. The Las Vegas strategy is working, and we are really excited about 2020. 
Moving on to Boston, at Encore Boston Harbor. First, I'd like to congratulate Brian Gullbrants as the new property President. He's been with us for over a decade, and I know, and we all know, that he is the exact right person to lead that project. We've been open for 136 days in Boston, and we're learning each and every day how to become more local. We've been tweaking our food and beverage product to make sure we're giving the customers what they want. We've been working on our messaging, and we now have new messaging out to the market. 
We are going to, the first time in our company's history in North America, launch a loyalty card, tiered card program, and that will be launching in Boston in the first quarter. And I'm sure as all of you that are very familiar with our business, know a tier card program is essential in a regional marketing -- in a regional property. 
Our Table Games business in Boston and our hotel business have actually been quite encouraging. And we always knew the slots would take time to ramp. If you think about it when we opened our doors in our local database, we had 0 customers. Fast forward 136 days, we have 250,000 people in our database, which is significant growth. 
In order to compete in a high-frequency market where people are coming multiple times a month, a robust database is necessary because you need to message to the customers what it is you're doing each week and why they need to come into the property.  We are on the path to growth there, and I think that we have the right team in place. 
So that's really the wrap on the third quarter. But what I'm excited about is 2020, and the reason is we began a transition with this company in 2018. We reallocated capital to Macau. We thought about Las Vegas differently. We focused on opening Encore Boston Harbor. And if you look at where we are today, I was in Macau 2 weeks ago, walking in Wynn Macau, our new property downtown with Ian and Ciarán, who runs the property, and Linda, looking at what's about to open in 60 days. We've taken everything that we know about compression of energy and space and what works in food and beverage in new hotel rooms. And we've invested in Wynn Macau to make what we think will be the best premium mass product on the Peninsula. And it will continue to gain share. We have 7,000 square feet of new retail that will be opening, 2 new restaurants, the new casino and the fully remodeled Encore Tower. All of that opens at the end of this year and in early 2020 and will position Wynn Macau as a market share taker in the very near future. 
Wynn Palace remains as the high-quality environment that is really going to continue to be the aspirational property at Cotai. So it's not just our product that I'm excited about. When I was there and we were talking not just internally, but to our peers in the market, people are quite sanguine about Macau in 2020. There's a new government that's coming and the people are very excited about in December. A lot of the infrastructure projects that have been talked about and underway for years and years and years in Hengqin Island are starting to complete. Visitation in Macau has been up double digits for the last 3 quarters. So 2020 feels like Macau is well positioned for growth and that we are well positioned to capture our share of that growth. 
If you look at Las Vegas, we actually have more products coming online in 2020 than we have since we opened Encore in 2008. We have a 430,000 square foot convention center that's opening in 90 days. This convention center is on our golf course and has a 390-foot promenade with 2-story glass walls overlooking the golf course, leading to an 83,000 square foot ballroom. That's almost 2 acres. And when we walk event planners into that space, their jaws drop and they ask, ""Where do we sign?"" That will be opening in 90 days. 
On top of that, we have 3 new restaurants that will be opening in 2020, creating an entirely different segment of social dining at Wynn Las Vegas. And we are very excited about where we are positioned and how we're positioned against our competitors for 2020. 
And if you think about Boston, we're at the beginning of the ramp. We're not at the end. So each quarter, we're going to be tweaking our marketing. We're going to be focusing on growing our database, working on controlling expenses and growing revenues and EBITDA each quarter. So I'm very excited about the transition that we've been through and the future of this company as we move forward into 2020. 
With that, I'm going to turn it over to Craig."

As noted in our release, our Macau operations delivered adjusted EBITDA of $301.2 million on $1.1 billion of operating revenues.

As noted in our release, our Macau operations delivered adjusted EBITDA of $301.2 million on $1.1 billion of operating revenues. The quarter was characterized by a strength in both main floor core mass and premium mass, with combined property win in the Mass segment, up 7% year-over-year. 
Our results in Macau were negatively impacted by a low direct VIP hold percentage, as Matt mentioned, which decreased EBITDA by approximately $22 million from a normalized level, with the hold impact weighted slightly more heavily to Palace at $13 million. Also, you'll recall that we received $11 million of insurance proceeds in the prior year quarter, impacting the year-over-year EBITDA comparison. 
The team in Macau did a great job in the quarter of controlling costs at both properties without negatively impacting the guest experience. At Wynn Palace, our operating expenses, excluding taxes, were flat year-over-year and down sequentially, which helped drive a 200 basis point increase in normalized EBITDA margin compared to Q2 despite top line pressure. 
At Wynn Macau, OpEx increased slightly year-over-year and was down sequentially despite some incremental payroll expenses we began to staff up for the West Casino opening. We are well prepared to drive strong operating leverage when the top line environment improves. 
Our Las Vegas operations produced adjusted property EBITDA of $88 million in the third quarter on operating revenue of $399.5 million, with year-over-year growth in both baccarat and non-baccarat table drop and slot handle. 
On the hotel side, REVPAR increased approximately 4% year-over-year to $269, driving $116.1 million of hotel revenue. We held low in Las Vegas, which negatively impacted EBITDA by approximately $13 million. 
Bad debt expense in Las Vegas was $4.5 million compared to $500,000 in the prior year quarter, costing us $4 million in comparable EBITDA. We spent just under $60 million in project costs on group space expansion at Wynn Las Vegas, taking our spend to date to $302.7 million. This expansion is slated to open in the first quarter of 2020. 
We ended the quarter with total debt of $9.54 billion and total cash and investments of $1.68 billion, including approximately $947 million at Wynn Macau. 
During the quarter, we returned over $100 million to shareholders through our quarterly dividend payment. We will continue to look closely at our capital allocation alternatives, including periodic increases to our dividend and opportunistic share repurchases. 
Finally, during the quarter, we completed a refinancing of our U.S. capital structure, which extended our maturities, streamlined our U.S. restricted group and simplified our collateral package for the U.S. and corporate entities. We believe the simplification of our U.S. capital structure will make it easier to understand and, ultimately, lower our cost of debt capital over time. 
With that, we will now turn it over to questions."

And Joe, if  know the property well, the new gaming floor feels very similar to Encore in Macau, but it's anchored by 2 restaurants and has 2 entrances to the boardwalk that go between MGM Wynn and SJM, which is very heavily trafficked.

We often have more demand than we have supply for the number of players coming to the course. So we feel really great about that. 2020, of course, February is the launch of the convention center, and we will see good growth in the convention center. But during the Investor Day, you'll recall that we talked about the room remodel. And so the room remodel is going to hit in June, and it's going to mostly take up that time with leisure rooms. But we haven't refreshed our rooms at Wynn for 8 years, and it is time to do so. So that will be factored into 2020 also.  But as we think about 2020, the convention business being solid, the casino business continuing to grow, and then we plan on good FIT business and -- leisure business that will fill in the gap."

I'd like to get started talking about Macau. In the third quarter, in Macau, we generated $301 million of EBITDA. However, we had a hold impact from our",1184,"Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for our third quarter conference call. 
I'd like to get started talking about Macau. In the third quarter, in Macau, we generated $301 million of EBITDA. However, we had a hold impact from our direct business of approximately $22 million. We held negative 1% at Wynn Palace in our direct program and 1.2% in our direct program at Wynn Macau. The way the direct programs are structured, you pay commission on turnover, not on win loss. So when you have abnormally low hold, that revenue mix significantly impacts EBITDA, and that was a $22 million impact in Macau. 
VIP continued to compress, and we did see some customer trial out at Cotai, with some of the newer products at both City of Dreams and MGM. But I believe, and we all believe that, that is quite temporary. 
Mass continued to grow. We maintained our share in mass market and slots at 14%. And I'm pleased to say that while the VIP trends and the mass trends continued into October, we generated over $4 million a day of EBITDA during the month of October driven largely by an 8% growth in our mass drop during that month. 
Moving on to Las Vegas. We've continued to see the positive momentum that we experienced in the first quarter. We had a $13 million impact in hold in our baccarat business in Las Vegas. But if you take a look at the strategy and the way that we made the pivot to focus on taking market share in the domestic business, casino business and in slots, it is working. And Marilyn and the team are doing a great job. 
We had 9% growth in our domestic table games drop and as well as 9% growth in slot handles during the quarter. Our hotel revenues grew by 5% during the quarter, and retail is continuing to really gain traction as it was up over double digits in revenue growth during the quarter. The Las Vegas strategy is working, and we are really excited about 2020. 
Moving on to Boston, at Encore Boston Harbor. First, I'd like to congratulate Brian Gullbrants as the new property President. He's been with us for over a decade, and I know, and we all know, that he is the exact right person to lead that project. We've been open for 136 days in Boston, and we're learning each and every day how to become more local. We've been tweaking our food and beverage product to make sure we're giving the customers what they want. We've been working on our messaging, and we now have new messaging out to the market. 
We are going to, the first time in our company's history in North America, launch a loyalty card, tiered card program, and that will be launching in Boston in the first quarter. And I'm sure as all of you that are very familiar with our business, know a tier card program is essential in a regional marketing -- in a regional property. 
Our Table Games business in Boston and our hotel business have actually been quite encouraging. And we always knew the slots would take time to ramp. If you think about it when we opened our doors in our local database, we had 0 customers. Fast forward 136 days, we have 250,000 people in our database, which is significant growth. 
In order to compete in a high-frequency market where people are coming multiple times a month, a robust database is necessary because you need to message to the customers what it is you're doing each week and why they need to come into the property.  We are on the path to growth there, and I think that we have the right team in place. 
So that's really the wrap on the third quarter. But what I'm excited about is 2020, and the reason is we began a transition with this company in 2018. We reallocated capital to Macau. We thought about Las Vegas differently. We focused on opening Encore Boston Harbor. And if you look at where we are today, I was in Macau 2 weeks ago, walking in Wynn Macau, our new property downtown with Ian and Ciarán, who runs the property, and Linda, looking at what's about to open in 60 days. We've taken everything that we know about compression of energy and space and what works in food and beverage in new hotel rooms. And we've invested in Wynn Macau to make what we think will be the best premium mass product on the Peninsula. And it will continue to gain share. We have 7,000 square feet of new retail that will be opening, 2 new restaurants, the new casino and the fully remodeled Encore Tower. All of that opens at the end of this year and in early 2020 and will position Wynn Macau as a market share taker in the very near future. 
Wynn Palace remains as the high-quality environment that is really going to continue to be the aspirational property at Cotai. So it's not just our product that I'm excited about. When I was there and we were talking not just internally, but to our peers in the market, people are quite sanguine about Macau in 2020. There's a new government that's coming and the people are very excited about in December. A lot of the infrastructure projects that have been talked about and underway for years and years and years in Hengqin Island are starting to complete. Visitation in Macau has been up double digits for the last 3 quarters. So 2020 feels like Macau is well positioned for growth and that we are well positioned to capture our share of that growth. 
If you look at Las Vegas, we actually have more products coming online in 2020 than we have since we opened Encore in 2008. We have a 430,000 square foot convention center that's opening in 90 days. This convention center is on our golf course and has a 390-foot promenade with 2-story glass walls overlooking the golf course, leading to an 83,000 square foot ballroom. That's almost 2 acres. And when we walk event planners into that space, their jaws drop and they ask, ""Where do we sign?"" That will be opening in 90 days. 
On top of that, we have 3 new restaurants that will be opening in 2020, creating an entirely different segment of social dining at Wynn Las Vegas. And we are very excited about where we are positioned and how we're positioned against our competitors for 2020. 
And if you think about Boston, we're at the beginning of the ramp. We're not at the end. So each quarter, we're going to be tweaking our marketing. We're going to be focusing on growing our database, working on controlling expenses and growing revenues and EBITDA each quarter. So I'm very excited about the transition that we've been through and the future of this company as we move forward into 2020. 
With that, I'm going to turn it over to Craig."

As noted in our release, our Macau operations delivered adjusted EBITDA of $301.2 million on $1.1 billion of operating revenues. The quarter was characterized by a strength in both main floor core mass and premium mass, with combined property win in the Mass segment, up 7% year-over-year. 
Our results in Macau were negatively impacted by a low direct VIP hold percentage, as Matt mentioned, which decreased EBITDA by approximately $22 million from a normalized level, with the hold impact weighted slightly more heavily to Palace at $13 million. Also, you'll recall that we received $11 million of insurance proceeds in the prior year quarter, impacting the year-over-year EBITDA comparison. 
The team in Macau did a great job in the quarter of controlling costs at both properties without negatively impacting the guest experience. At Wynn Palace, our operating expenses, excluding taxes, were flat year-over-year and down sequentially, which helped drive a 200 basis point increase in normalized EBITDA margin compared to Q2 despite top line pressure. 
At Wynn Macau, OpEx increased slightly year-over-year and was down sequentially despite some incremental payroll expenses we began to staff up for the West Casino opening. We are well prepared to drive strong operating leverage when the top line environment improves. 
Our Las Vegas operations produced adjusted property EBITDA of $88 million in the third quarter on operating revenue of $399.5 million, with year-over-year growth in both baccarat and non-baccarat table drop and slot handle. 
On the hotel side, REVPAR increased approximately 4% year-over-year to $269, driving $116.1 million of hotel revenue. We held low in Las Vegas, which negatively impacted EBITDA by approximately $13 million. 
Bad debt expense in Las Vegas was $4.5 million compared to $500,000 in the prior year quarter, costing us $4 million in comparable EBITDA. We spent just under $60 million in project costs on group space expansion at Wynn Las Vegas, taking our spend to date to $302.7 million. This expansion is slated to open in the first quarter of 2020. 
We ended the quarter with total debt of $9.54 billion and total cash and investments of $1.68 billion, including approximately $947 million at Wynn Macau. 
During the quarter, we returned over $100 million to shareholders through our quarterly dividend payment. We will continue to look closely at our capital allocation alternatives, including periodic increases to our dividend and opportunistic share repurchases. 
Finally, during the quarter, we completed refinancing of our U.S. capital structure, which extended our maturities, streamlined our U.S. restricted group and simplified our collateral package for the U.S. and corporate entities. We believe the simplification of our U.S. capital structure will make it easier to understand and, ultimately, lower our cost of debt capital over time. 
With that, we will now turn it over to questions."

I'd like to get started talking about Macau. In the third quarter, in Macau, we generated $301 million of EBITDA. However, we had a hold impact from our",1184,"Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for our third quarter conference call. 
I'd like to get started talking about Macau. In the third quarter, in Macau, we generated $301 million of EBITDA. However, we had a hold impact from our direct business of approximately $22 million. We held negative 1% at Wynn Palace in our direct program and 1.2% in our direct program at Wynn Macau. The way the direct programs are structured, you pay commission on turnover, not on win loss. So when you have abnormally low hold, that revenue mix significantly impacts EBITDA, and that was a $22 million impact in Macau. 
VIP continued to compress, and we did see some customer trial out at Cotai, with some of the newer products at both City of Dreams and MGM. But I believe, and we all believe that, that is quite temporary. 
Mass continued to grow. We maintained our share in mass market and slots at 14%. And I'm pleased to say that while the VIP trends and the mass trends continued into October, we generated over $4 million a day of EBITDA during the month of October driven largely by an 8% growth in our mass drop during that month. 
Moving on to Las Vegas. We've continued to see the positive momentum that we experienced in the first quarter. We had a $13 million impact in hold in our baccarat business in Las Vegas. But if you take a look at the strategy and the way that we made the pivot to focus on taking market share in the domestic business, casino business and in slots, it is working. And Marilyn and the team are doing a great job. 
We had 9% growth in our domestic table games drop and as well as 9% growth in slot handles during the quarter. Our hotel revenues grew by 5% during the quarter, and retail is continuing to really gain traction as it was up over double digits in revenue growth during the quarter. The Las Vegas strategy is working, and we are really excited about 2020. 
Moving on to Boston, at Encore Boston Harbor. First, I'd like to congratulate Brian Gullbrants as the new property President. He's been with us for over a decade, and I know, and we all know, that he is the exact right person to lead that project. We've been open for 136 days in Boston, and we're learning each and every day how to become more local. We've been tweaking our food and beverage product to make sure we're giving the customers what they want. We've been working on our messaging, and we now have new messaging out to the market. 
We are going to, the first time in our company's history in North America, launch a loyalty card, tiered card program, and that will be launching in Boston in the first quarter. And I'm sure as all of you that are very familiar with our business, know a tier card program is essential in a regional marketing -- in a regional property. 
Our Table Games business in Boston and our hotel business have actually been quite encouraging. And we always knew the slots would take time to ramp. If you think about it when we opened our doors in our local database, we had 0 customers. Fast forward 136 days, we have 250,000 people in our database, which is significant growth. 
In order to compete in a high-frequency market where people are coming multiple times a month, a robust database is necessary because you need to message to the customers what it is you're doing each week and why they need to come into the property. We are on the path to growth there, and I think that we have the right team in place. 
So that's really the wrap on the third quarter. But what I'm excited about is 2020, and the reason is we began a transition with this company in 2018. We reallocated capital to Macau. We thought about Las Vegas differently. We focused on opening Encore Boston Harbor. And if you look at where we are today, I was in Macau 2 weeks ago, walking in Wynn Macau, our new property downtown with Ian and Ciarán, who runs the property, and Linda, looking at what's about to open in 60 days. 
We've taken everything that we know about compression of energy and space and what works in food and beverage in new hotel rooms. And we've invested in Wynn Macau to make what we think will be the best premium mass product on the Peninsula. And it will continue to gain share. We have 7,000 square feet of new retail that will be opening, 2 new restaurants, the new casino and the fully remodeled Encore Tower. All of that opens at the end of this year and in early 2020 and will position Wynn Macau as a market share taker in the very near future. 
Wynn Palace remains as the high-quality environment that is really going to continue to be the aspirational property at Cotai. So it's not just our product that I'm excited about. When I was there and we were talking not just internally, but to our peers in the market, people are quite sanguine about Macau in 2020. There's a new government that's coming and the people are very excited about in December. A lot of the infrastructure projects that have been talked about and underway for years and years and years in Hengqin Island are starting to complete. Visitation in Macau has been up double digits for the last 3 quarters. So 2020 feels like Macau is well positioned for growth and that we are well positioned to capture our share of that growth. 
If you look at Las Vegas, we actually have more products coming online in 2020 than we have since we opened Encore in 2008. We have a 430,000 square foot convention center that's opening in 90 days. This convention center is on our golf course and has a 390-foot promenade with 2-story glass walls overlooking the golf course, leading to an 83,000 square foot ballroom. That's almost 2 acres. And when we walk event planners into that space, their jaws drop and they ask, ""Where do we sign?"" That will be opening in 90 days. 
On top of that, we have 3 new restaurants that will be opening in 2020, creating an entirely different segment of social dining at Wynn Las Vegas. And we are very excited about where we are positioned and how we're positioned against our competitors for 2020. 
And if you think about Boston, we're at the beginning of the ramp. We're not at the end. So each quarter, we're going to be tweaking our marketing. We're going to be focusing on growing our database, working on controlling expenses and growing revenues and EBITDA each quarter. So I'm very excited about the transition that we've been through and the future of this company as we move forward into 2020. 
With that, I'm going to turn it over to Craig."

As noted in our release, our Macau operations delivered adjusted EBITDA of $301.2 million on $1.1 billion of operating revenues.

As noted in our release, our Macau operations delivered adjusted EBITDA of $301.2 million on $1.1 billion of operating revenues. The quarter was characterized by a strength in both main floor core mass and premium mass, with combined property win in the Mass segment, up 7% year-over-year. 
Our results in Macau were negatively impacted by a low direct VIP hold percentage, as Matt mentioned, which decreased EBITDA by approximately $22 million from a normalized level, with the hold impact weighted slightly more heavily to Palace at $13 million. Also you'll recall that we received $11 million of insurance proceeds in the prior year quarter, impacting the year-over-year EBITDA comparison. 
The team in Macau did a great job in the quarter of controlling costs at both properties without negatively impacting the guest experience. At Wynn Palace, our operating expenses, excluding taxes, were flat year-over-year and down sequentially, which helped drive a 200 basis point increase in normalized EBITDA margin compared to Q2 despite top line pressure. 
At Wynn Macau, OpEx increased slightly year-over-year and was down sequentially despite some incremental payroll expenses we began to staff up for the West Casino opening. We are well prepared to drive strong operating leverage when the top line environment improves. 
Our Las Vegas operations produced adjusted property EBITDA of $88 million in the third quarter on operating revenue of $399.5 million, with year-over-year growth in both baccarat and nonbaccarat table drop and slot handle. 
On the hotel side, REVPAR increased approximately 4% year-over-year to $269, driving $116.1 million of hotel revenue. We held low in Las Vegas, which negatively impacted EBITDA by approximately $13 million. 
Bad debt expense in Las Vegas was $4.5 million compared to $500,000 in the prior year quarter, costing us $4 million in comparable EBITDA. We spent just under $60 million in project costs on group space expansion at Wynn Las Vegas, taking our spend to date to $302.7 million. This expansion is slated to open in the first quarter of 2020. 
We ended the quarter with total debt of $9.54 billion and total cash and investments of $1.68 billion, including approximately $947 million at Wynn Macau. 
During the quarter, we returned over $100 million to shareholders through our quarterly dividend payment. We will continue to look closely at our capital allocation alternatives, including periodic increases to our dividend and opportunistic share repurchases. 
Finally, during the quarter, we completed refinancing of our U.S. capital structure, which extended our maturities, streamlined our U.S. restricted group and simplified our collateral package for the U.S. and corporate entities. We believe the simplification of our U.S. capital structure will make it easier to understand and, ultimately, lower our cost of debt capital over time. 
With that, we will now turn it over to questions."

I'd like to get started talking about Macau. In the third quarter, in Macau, we generated $301 million of EBITDA. However, we had a hold impact from our",1184,"Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for our third quarter conference call. 
I'd like to get started talking about Macau. In the third quarter, in Macau, we generated $301 million of EBITDA. However, we had a hold impact from our direct business of approximately $22 million. We held negative 1% at Wynn Palace in our direct program and 1.2% in our direct program at Wynn Macau. The way the direct programs are structured, you pay commission on turnover, not on win loss. So when you have abnormally low hold, that revenue mix significantly impacts EBITDA, and that was a $22 million impact in Macau. 
VIP continued to compress, and we did see some customer trial out at Cotai, with some of the newer products at both City of Dreams and MGM. But I believe, and we all believe that, that is quite temporary. 
Mass continued to grow. We maintained our share in mass market and slots at 14%. And I'm pleased to say that while the VIP trends and the mass trends continued into October, we generated over $4 million a day of EBITDA during the month of October driven largely by an 8% growth in our mass drop during that month. 
Moving on to Las Vegas. We've continued to see the positive momentum that we experienced in the first quarter. We had a $13 million impact in hold in our baccarat business in Las Vegas. But if you take a look at the strategy and the way that we made the pivot to focus on taking market share in the domestic business, casino business and in slots, it is working. And Marilyn and the team are doing a great job. 
We had 9% growth in our domestic table games drop and as well as 9% growth in slot handles during the quarter. Our hotel revenues grew by 5% during the quarter, and retail is continuing to really gain traction as it was up over double digits in revenue growth during the quarter. The Las Vegas strategy is working, and we are really excited about 2020. 
Moving on to Boston, at Encore Boston Harbor. First, I'd like to congratulate Brian Gullbrants as the new property President. He's been with us for over a decade, and I know, and we all know, that he is the exact right person to lead that project. We've been open for 136 days in Boston, and we're learning each and every day how to become more local. We've been tweaking our food and beverage product to make sure we're giving the customers what they want. We've been working on our messaging, and we now have new messaging out to the market. 
We are going to, the first time in our company's history in North America, launch a loyalty card, tiered card program, and that will be launching in Boston in the first quarter. And I'm sure as all of you that are very familiar with our business, know a tier card program is essential in a regional marketing -- in a regional property. 
Our Table Games business in Boston and our hotel business have actually been quite encouraging. And we always knew the slots would take time to ramp. If you think about it when we opened our doors in our local database, we had 0 customers. Fast forward 136 days, we have 250,000 people in our database, which is significant growth. 
In order to compete in a high-frequency market where people are coming multiple times a month, a robust database is necessary because you need to message to the customers what it is you're doing each week and why they need to come into the property. We are on the path to growth there, and I think that we have the right team in place. 
So that's really the wrap on the third quarter. But what I'm excited about is 2020, and the reason is we began a transition with this company in 2018. We reallocated capital to Macau. We thought about Las Vegas differently. We focused on opening Encore Boston Harbor. And if you look at where we are today, I was in Macau 2 weeks ago, walking in Wynn Macau, our new property downtown with Ian and Ciarán, who runs the property, and Linda, looking at what's about to open in 60 days. 
We've taken everything that we know about compression of energy and space and what works in food and beverage in new hotel rooms. And we've invested in Wynn Macau to make what we think will be the best premium mass product on the Peninsula. And it will continue to gain share. We have 7,000 square feet of new retail that will be opening, 2 new restaurants, the new casino and the fully remodeled Encore Tower. All of that opens at the end of this year and in early 2020 and will position Wynn Macau as a market share taker in the very near future. 
Wynn Palace remains as the high-quality environment that is really going to continue to be the aspirational property at Cotai. So it's not just our product that I'm excited about. When I was there and we were talking not just internally, but to our peers in the market, people are quite sanguine about Macau in 2020. There's a new government that's coming and the people are very excited about in December. A lot of the infrastructure projects that have been talked about and underway for years and years and years in Hengqin Island are starting to complete. Visitation in Macau has been up double digits for the last 3 quarters. So 2020 feels like Macau is well positioned for growth and that we are well positioned to capture our share of that growth. 
If you look at Las Vegas, we actually have more products coming online in 2020 than we have since we opened Encore in 2008. We have a 430,000 square foot convention center that's opening in 90 days. This convention center is on our golf course and has a 390-foot promenade with 2-story glass walls overlooking the golf course, leading to an 83,000 square foot ballroom. That's almost 2 acres. And when we walk event planners into that space, their jaws drop and they ask, ""Where do we sign?"" That will be opening in 90 days. 
On top of that, we have 3 new restaurants that will be opening in 2020, creating an entirely different segment of social dining at Wynn Las Vegas. And we are very excited about where we are positioned and how we're positioned against our competitors for 2020. 
And if you think about Boston, we're at the beginning of the ramp. We're not at the end. So each quarter, we're going to be tweaking our marketing. We're going to be focusing on growing our database, working on controlling expenses and growing revenues and EBITDA each quarter. So I'm very excited about the transition that we've been through and the future of this company as we move forward into 2020. 
With that, I'm going to turn it over to Craig."

As noted in our release, our Macau operations delivered adjusted EBITDA of $301.2 million on $1.1 billion of operating revenues.

As noted in our release, our Macau operations delivered adjusted EBITDA of $301.2 million on $1.1 billion of operating revenues. The quarter was characterized by a strength in both main floor core mass and premium mass, with combined property win in the Mass segment, up 7% year-over-year. 
Our results in Macau were negatively impacted by a low direct VIP hold percentage, as Matt mentioned, which decreased EBITDA by approximately $22 million from a normalized level, with the hold impact weighted slightly more heavily to Palace at $13 million. Also you'll recall that we received $11 million of insurance proceeds in the prior year quarter, impacting the year-over-year EBITDA comparison. 
The team in Macau did a great job in the quarter of controlling costs at both properties without negatively impacting the guest experience. At Wynn Palace, our operating expenses, excluding taxes, were flat year-over-year and down sequentially, which helped drive a 200 basis point increase in normalized EBITDA margin compared to Q2 despite top line pressure. 
At Wynn Macau, OpEx increased slightly year-over-year and was down sequentially despite some incremental payroll expenses we began to staff up for the West Casino opening. We are well prepared to drive strong operating leverage when the top line environment improves. 
Our Las Vegas operations produced adjusted property EBITDA of $88 million in the third quarter on operating revenue of $399.5 million, with year-over-year growth in both baccarat and nonbaccarat table drop and slot handle. 
On the hotel side, REVPAR increased approximately 4% year-over-year to $269, driving $116.1 million of hotel revenue. We held low in Las Vegas, which negatively impacted EBITDA by approximately $13 million. 
Bad debt expense in Las Vegas was $4.5 million compared to $500,000 in the prior year quarter, costing us $4 million in comparable EBITDA. We spent just under $60 million in project costs on group space expansion at Wynn Las Vegas, taking our spend to date to $302.7 million. This expansion is slated to open in the first quarter of 2020. 
We ended the quarter with total debt of $9.54 billion and total cash and investments of $1.68 billion, including approximately $947 million at Wynn Macau. 
During the quarter, we returned over $100 million to shareholders through our quarterly dividend payment. We will continue to look closely at our capital allocation alternatives, including periodic increases to our dividend and opportunistic share repurchases. 
Finally, during the quarter, we completed refinancing of our U.S. capital structure, which extended our maturities, streamlined our U.S. restricted group and simplified our collateral package for the U.S. and corporate entities. We believe the simplification of our U.S. capital structure will make it easier to understand and, ultimately, lower our cost of debt capital over time. 
With that, we will now turn it over to questions."

Again, just walking the property 2 weeks ago, it's hard to quantify because we're not seeing large drops in volumes coming in the door. But about half the building is behind construction walls, the podium level. So there's definitely some disruption. And I think we're just going to see what the impact is going to be when we open our new facility in about 60 days. What -- it's really targeted for the premium mass customer. And Joe, if you know the property well, the new gaming floor feels very similar to Encore in Macau, but it's anchored by 2 restaurants and has 2 entrances to the boardwalk that go between MGM Wynn and SJM, which is very heavily trafficked. And before, it had no entrances. So we feel really confident that the way we've repositioned this property away from smaller mid-tier junket operators and to the premium mass market is going to work."

The market may be growing along with the economy, but we'll be capturing share."

Right now, it's expensive to build in Las Vegas. The trades have more jobs than they have manpower.
