GAAP earnings for the quarter were $0.97 per share, which includes",1374,"Good morning, Dominion Energy reported operating earnings of $0.89 per share for the fourth quarter of 2018, which is above the midpoint of our guidance range of $0.80 to $0.95 per share. GAAP earnings for the quarter were $0.97 per share, which includes gains on the sales of noncore assets. For the full year, we reported operating earnings of $4.05 per share, which is also above the midpoint of our guidance range of $3.95 to $4.10 per share.
Drivers relative to our guidance include lower O&M, income tax and depreciation expense as well as favorable weather, partially offset by longer commissioning process for the process -- projects during the first quarter and higher strong restoration expense in the third and fourth quarters. We are pleased that despite a challenging year, we achieved annual operating earnings per share growth of 12.5%. Operating segment performance for the fourth quarter and the full year are shown on Slide 4. GAAP earnings for the year were $3.74 per share. Differences between operating and reported earnings included gains on sale of noncore assets, unrealized losses on nuclear decommissioning trust fund and onetime rated credits issued to customers under Virginia legislation passed in March.
A reconciliation of operating earnings to reported earnings can be found on Schedule 2 of the Earnings Release Kit. 
Before we turn the page completely on 2018, we want to briefly highlight some of the important initiatives that we successfully executed during the year and we believe position us for success in 2019.
As mentioned, we achieved annual operating earnings per share growth of more than 10% despite a number of headwinds, including dramatically altered financing plan. We grew dividend per share by 10% year-over-year, consistent with the commitment we had previously made to shareholders and slightly lower than annual operating earnings per share growth. We non-core merchant assets at attractive valuation, improving our business risk profile and generating over $2.5 billion of sales proceeds, which will be used to retire parent level debt.
We placed both the Cove Point Liquefaction project and Greeville power station into commercial service, collectively representing over $5 billion of investor capital. I'm pleased to report that Cove Point continues to operate at or above designed capacity and successfully completed the same-day loading of an export cargo and unloading of an import cargo during the fourth quarter, which we believe may be a first for the domestic LNG industry. Greensville is also operating as designed. We took meaningful steps to improve our credit profile, including reducing parent level debt by about $8 billion through proceeds from equity issuance, noncore asset sales and a Cove Point asset level financing. As a result of these efforts, we achieved our parent level leverage targets 2 years ahead of schedule. We also materially improved our cash flow coverage metric as measured by Moody's. These achievements in combination with the improved business risk profile due to asset sales and the addition of SCANA's high-quality regulated businesses resulted in affirmation of our existing credit ratings and the lowering of our credit metric thresholds.
In Virginia, we worked with legislators, governor, customer groups and other important stakeholders to support the Grid Transformation and Security Act, the law that provides a path to sustainable and unreliable energy future in the Commonwealth. And finally we came all the required regulatory approvals and subsequently closed our merger with SCANA, which we expect to provide near-term earnings of approximately $0.10 per share per year. Tom will talk more about this a little later, but we were pleased to able to offer significant value to SCANA customers, protections to SCANA employees and preserve transaction economics where shareholders and credit providers expected. 
Moving now to 2019 earnings guidance. Operating earnings per share for 2019 are expected to be between $4.05 and $4.40 per share. This guidance range of $0.35 is narrower in recent years reflecting the increasingly regulated nature of our operation. The midpoint of this range represents 5.6% growth relative to 2018's weather normalized results. 
As usual, our guidance assumes normal weather variations from which could cause results to opt or the bottom of this narrower guidance range. Positive factors as compared to last year included an additional quarter of commercial operations of the Cove Point Liquefaction project, the addition of the Southeast Energy Group operating segment, which includes all former SCANA operations and growth from regulated investment. Negative factors as compared to last year include the loss of earnings from 2018 asset sales, higher share count, higher pension expense and a return to normal weather. The midpoint of our 2019 guidance range assumes ACP construction recommences during the third quarter of this year, which Tom will address more materially. It excludes any contribution associated with the Blue Racer earn out, which could be zero, as well as any contribution associated with the resolution of the outstanding zero carbon energy procurement process in Connecticut, which Tom will also address.
Our operating earnings guidance for the first quarter of this year is $1.05 to $1.25 per share compared to $1.14 per share in the first quarter of 2018. Positive factors relative to Q1 2018 include the contribution from the Cove Point Liquefaction project and the addition of the Southeast Energy Group. Negative factors include timing of contributions from farmout, the loss of earnings from asset sales and higher share count. While we are not providing formal 2020 operating earnings guidance on today's call, we do expect approximately 5% growth from 2019 to 2020, which aligns with achieving our most recent guidance regarding our 2017 to 2020, 6% to 8% compounded annual growth rate. This 2020 expectation also excludes an impact of any Blue Racer earn out and the contribution from the resolution in Connecticut. 
Finally, we expect dividend per share growth in 2019 of 10%. Please note that all dividend declarations are subject to Board approval. Major elements of our 2019 financing plan are included on Slide 8. In addition to a fairly standard debt financing program, we intend to replace and possibly increase the size of the mandatory convertible security that's issued to 3 years ago in which converts in the third quarter. Despite firm ratings and lower credit metric downgrade thresholds, we will continue to take steps to support our credit profile. 
Turning to Dominion Energy Midstream Partners. The merger of DM into Dominion Energy was completed earlier this week. We issued approximately 22 million shares in exchange for all outstanding Dominion Midstream common and preferred units. The merged assets now reside to subsidiaries of our parent company, though we intend for certain assets to migrate to Dominion Energy Gas Holdings during the year. 
Finally, we plan to make 2 distinct presentations for investors on March 25. The first presentation targeting the general investor community will include a number of informational updates, such as asset profiles -- asset profile updates, including for the newly added Southeast Energy Group, capital investment programs, opportunities under the grid transformation and the security act in Virginia, O&M initiatives and long-term dividend growth in capital structure objectives. We believe that this brief presentation will provide reference information and insights to help investors to better understand Dominion Energy's expanded operational footprint as well as drivers behind our expectation for 5% plus growth in operating earnings per share beyond 2020. 
We're pleased to announce that in a second and separate presentation on that day, we will provide an update that will focus exclusively on our accomplishments and efforts on environmental, social and governance matters and how those efforts underpin our long-term strategy and position us to be -- become an industry leader in sustainability. To our knowledge, this is the first instance for the major company from the energy infrastructure industry or otherwise to host an investor session dedicated exclusively to these matters. The target audience for the second presentation members of the financial community with special focus on ESG topics. Both on these presentations will be webcast live on our Investor Relations website with opportunities to submit questions electronically so that capacity constraints at our New York City venue all investors will be able to speak. We'll be providing additional information regarding these investor updates in the near future.
I will now turn the call over to Tom."

For the second straight year, we have set a company record for the lowest reportable incident rate in our history, 0.55, which is an 8% improvement what was a record-setting performance in 2017. This achievement is equall",1849,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning. For the second straight year, we have set a company record for the lowest reportable incident rate in our history, 0.55, which is an 8% improvement what was a record-setting performance in 2017. This achievement is equally impressive when compared to a peer average that is nearly twice as high. Safety does not just happen. These results represent years of focus on making sure that every employee returns home in the same condition in which they arrived at work that day. We're going to get continue to improve until we achieve the only exceptable safety statistic zero injuries. 
Now to our business updates. I will begin by addressing our merger with SCANA, which closed at the beginning of this year. Our new operating segment, the Southeast Energy Group, comprises all of the former SCANA operations. One of our most experienced utility operators now leave the segment. He is working among the over 5,000 and dedicated colleagues that now comprise the Southeast Energy Group. The Group's high quality businesses and our colleagues who operate them enhance Dominion's best-in-class portfolio or State regulated utility operations. For example, customer growth at SAGE electrical and gas utilities were 1.7% and 2.8%, respectively during 2018. North and South Carolina, despite the challenges related to new nuclear development in the latter, are considered to be among the most constructive regulatory jurisdictions in the country. In 2020, we will file a rate case South Carolina with subject to commission approval will reflect recovery of traditional electric utility capital investment that is not currently being recovered in rates. Those new rates, subject to approval, will become effective on January 1, 2021. Over the coming months, we will continue to build trust with customers, employees, regulators and policymakers by keeping our commitments and being a transparent and responsible corporate citizen. We look forward to discuss in the Southeast Energy Group in greater detail in our investor meeting in March. 
Next, I'll turn it to updates related to Grid Transformation and Security Act that adopted last year in Virginia. In less than a year, we have filed for and received Virginia State Corporation Commission approval for products representing over $1 billion of capital investment. We expect that number to grow significantly over the next several years as we continue to invest to make our system increasingly sustainable and reliable for our customers. First, we received approval from the SEC for approximately $300 million offshore wind projects, which will be completed under a fixed cost construction agreement. This pilot has and Virginia's general assembly, and will provide important early learning that we believe that foundation for commercial scale offshore wind for Virginia's clean energy future. Construction of the project is expected to begin this second quarter with a commercial in-service date in late 2020. Second, we received approval from the SEC for phases 2 and 3 of our strategic underground program representing a capital investment of about $240 million. This effort improves the reliability of our system and substantially reduces the duration of restoration times following severe weather events. Third, we received an order granting our certificate of public necessity and convenience for our U.S. 3 utility scale solar Farms, representing 240 megawatts at a capital cost of around $410 million. We remain committed to advancing our goal of having 3,000 megawatts of additional renewable generating capacity in service or under development by 2022, and we expect to make regular filings under the with the commission for additional projects in the future.
Next, we received partial approval from the SEC for our initial grid transformation application. The commission approved nearly $100 million of capital over 3 years associated with important physical and cybersecurity investments. The commission asked for more information to support capital investment associated with other aspects of our grid mode strategy, including smart meters, intelligent grid devices and an enhanced customer information platform that allows more sophisticated and convenient customer experience. We will provide that data when we refile our application later this summer. A decision on reified application will be expected 6 months after.
I want to offer a few remarks related to recently legislation supported by Governor legislative leadership that establishes a path for addressing our coal. We support the policymakers desire to resolve this issue permanently through annual recovery. The legislation will provide for full cost recovery of operating expense and capital investment associated with a recycling of coal ash for beneficial use and the construction of on-site lined landfills for disposal of the residual coal ash. We believe the bet legislation provides a fair balance between Dominion Energy's customers and its shareholders, and allocates the cost of this program equitably among large and small users of electricity. 
I'll now address and the Atlantic Coast Pipeline. With regard to Millstone, it's important to recognize the extent of the progress that has been made to date on ensuring the long-term viability of this critically important resource to Connecticut. We began engaging in the legislative process 3 years ago. We have diligently followed the law and the requirements established by both DEEP and, and each agency has determined Millstone is an at-risk resource. Former governor made an announcement in late December awarding Millstone a 10-year agreement for 9 million megawatt hours per year. The award for the first 3 years of the contract is approximately equal to the on the wholesale power price.
That is not an acceptable result for the company in our 1,500 Millstone colleagues who work safely every day to provide half of the power and 90% of zero carbon power to the State of Connecticut. In order to ensure the plant viability, we must our pricing that recognizes energy security, environmental and economic benefits. We have and we will continue to engage constructively with team and seeking the solution, the region, our company and our employees. We are confident that these issues will be resolved in a manner that provides a long-term financial assurance required for Millstone's continued operation. As Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Supply Header projects. We remain highly confident in the successful and timely resolution, outstanding permit issues as well as the ultimate completion of the entire project for the following reasons. First, our customers critically need this project to heat and electrify homes, businesses and industries, assist in the transition coal-fired power generation; support economic and renewable energy development; and reduce reliance on single source. Our customers state regulatory commissions and have all attested independently to the need for this project. Second, we have followed the established rules with regard to permitting environmental protections. Years of surveying, data collection and scientific analysis stand behind all of our permit application. In fact, most of our permits are setting new national standards in minimizing environmental impact. Without speaking for the permitting entities, these professionals have followed the letter in the spirit of rules, regulations and established that guide their action on permit application. Third, we are actively pursuing multiple path to resolve all outstanding permit issues, including judicial, legislative and administrative evidence. We are not alone in these positions. We have a support of the agencies, our customers and varied industry interests. Our current expectation is that full construction to restart in the third quarter. This reflects our belief that the biological opinion issue in any of impediments Appalachian Trail should be resolved no later than this fall. Based on this schedule, key segments of the project, including from Buckingham County located in Central Virginia to the presently planned in Eastern Virginia, and in Lumberton in Southeastern North Carolina. Commercial service by the end of 2020 with the balance of the project being delivered in early 2021. The cost of the project based on this schedule is expected to be $7 billion to $7.5 billion, excluding financing costs and increase of approximately $500 million since the update we provided in November. Similarly, we expect that the Supply Header project will enter commercial service in late 2020, with a project cost of $650 million to $700 million. While we believe that the Appalachian issue should be resolved in time to recommence construction along the entire route during the third quarter, we intended to continue to build 2 segments that will deliver partial service to our customers by the end of 2020. The completion of the remaining section, which could involve would complement the first base of service by the end of 2021. Under this alternative, total project cost will increase an additional $250 million, resulting in total project cost of $7.25 billion to $7.75 billion, excluding financing costs. In either case, we're currently working with customers to set rates that balance customer needs with preserving a fair project return. It's important to understand that the average base differentiatal over the last 5 years has been $1.79 per dekatherm, which is significantly exceeds the rates of this project. And of course, cost is not the only factor driving our customers demand. Additional and diversified supply is critical given that they are forced to turn away new customers due to the lack of infrastructure. When extreme weather occurs, such as the existing Polar in the Midwest or that affected in Mid-Atlantic in both 2016 and 2018, the concept of reliable and redundant energy supply assumes a new and much more serious meaning. Policymakers understand the gravity of the situation. Disruptions for the region's limited supply of existing gas Infrastructure and whether-driven demands by and will continue to result in higher prices, forced curtailments and lower reliability for customers until the project is complete. 
To be clear, we believe that there are multiple paths that will allow us to complete the entire 600 mile project. As was the case regarding the challenges we faced in the development of the Cove Point Liquefaction project and the closing of our merger with SCANA, large projects require transparency and determination. We have an abundance of both. We will continue to accrue equity earnings and expect ACP to contribute to our operating earnings in 2019, 2020 and for decades to come.
In summary, during 2018, we set a new company.
 record for safety performance for the second consecutive year. We delivered 2018 operating earnings per share that exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range and initiated 2019 guidance that implies over 5% annual growth due to 2018 weather normalized results. Our 2019 dividends per share are expected to grow 10% subject to Board approval. We successfully executed several major initiatives, including merchant asset sales, $8 billion of parent level debt reduction, by end of Dominion Energy Midstream Partners and the commercial in-service of the Cove Point Liquefaction project and Millstone Power station that supports our earnings and credit objectives continue to deliver visible, diversified and regulated growth in the future. We completed the SCANA merger at an exciting new businesses to our best-in-class regulated portfolio. We continue to progress to our successful resolution for both Millstone and ACP. And we were asked capital programs that will help to support 5%-plus earnings growth into the next decade. With that, we're happy to take your questions."

But we said in 2017 that looking forward, we had a very robust MLP market. We had Cove Point expectations coming online, et cetera. Because of the unique nature of the take-or-pay contracts at Cove Point, a very significant cash flow is flowing out of that, the recapture of the capital costs that we would see into the MLP that we would grow the dividend 10% a year in '18, '19 and '20. And then when we got to '21, we have to see what the landscape look like at that time. After the FERC ruling in March last year that destroyed the of the MLP market, over time we said not too long after that day, remember the we said something along the lines tath we're going to keep 10% in '18, we except to keep 10% in '19. And depending upon consider, we didn't know what exactly was going to happen that it could go from 6% to 10% depending upon what happened with MLPs. I think we have since said the obviously MLP market is no longer there, so you start already at the bottom of that. But we recognized that is not going to be 10% in '20, highly unlikely. And that over time, we will bring the dividend growth rate, not going to be a cut in our dividend that's not even in, but we will bring our growth rate of our dividends more in line with our peers, after this year.

Dominion Energy reported operating earnings of $0.89 per share for the fourth quarter of 2018, which is above the midpoint of our guidance range of $0.80 to $0.95 per share. GAAP earnings for the quarter were $0.97 per share, which includes gains on the sales of noncore assets. For the full year, we reported operating earnings of $4.05 per share, which is also above the midpoint of our guidance range of $3.95 to $4.10 per share.
Drivers relative to our guidance include lower O&M, income tax and depreciation expense as well as favorable weather, partially offset by a longer commissioning process for the Cove Point Liquefaction Process -- Projects during the first quarter and higher storm restoration expense in the third and fourth quarters. We are pleased that despite a challenging year, we achieved annual operating earnings per share growth of 12.5%. Operating segment performance for the fourth quarter and the full year are shown on Slide 4. GAAP earnings for the year were $3.74 per share. Differences between operating and reported earnings included gains on sale of noncore assets, unrealized losses on nuclear decommissioning trust funds and onetime rated credits issued to customers under Virginia legislation passed in March.
A reconciliation of operating earnings to reported earnings can be found on Schedule 2 of the earnings release kit. 
Before we turn the page completely on 2018, we want to briefly highlight some of the important initiatives that we successfully executed during the year and we believe will position us for success in 2019.
As mentioned, we achieved annual operating earnings per share growth of more than 10% despite a number of headwinds, including the dramatically altered financing plan. We grew dividend per share by 10% year-over-year, consistent with the commitment we had previously made to shareholders and slightly lower than annual operating earnings per share growth. We sold noncore merchant assets at attractive valuation, improving our business risk profile and generating over $2.5 billion of sale proceeds, which we used to retire parent-level debt.
We placed both the Cove Point Liquefaction Project and Greensville Power Station into commercial service, collectively representing over $5 billion of invested capital. I'm pleased to report that Cove Point continues to operate at or above designed capacity and successfully completed the same-day loading of an export cargo and unloading of an import cargo during the fourth quarter, which we believe may be a first for the domestic LNG industry. Greensville is also operating as designed. 
We took meaningful steps to improve our credit profile, including reducing parent-level debt by about $8 billion through proceeds from equity issuance, noncore asset sales and a Cove Point asset level financing. As a result of these efforts, we achieved our parent-level leverage targets 2 years ahead of schedule. We also materially improved our cash flow coverage metric as measured by Moody's. These achievements in combination with the improved business risk profile due to asset sales and the addition of SCANA's high-quality regulated businesses resulted in the affirmation of our existing credit ratings and the lowering of our credit metric thresholds.
In Virginia, we worked with legislators, the Governor, customer groups and other important stakeholders to support the Grid Transformation & Security Act, a bipartisan law that provides a path to a sustainable and reliable energy future in the Commonwealth. And finally, we obtained all required regulatory approvals and subsequently closed our merger with SCANA, which we expect to provide near-term earnings of approximately $0.10 per share per year. Tom will talk more about this a little later, but we are pleased that we were able to offer significant value to SCANA customers, protections to SCANA employees and preserve transaction economics that our shareholders and credit providers expected.
Moving now to 2019 earnings guidance. Operating earnings per share for 2019 are expected to be between $4.05 and $4.40 per share. This guidance range of $0.35 is narrower than in recent years reflecting the increasingly regulated nature of our operation. The midpoint of this range represents 5.6% growth relative to 2018's weather-normalized results.
As usual, our guidance assumes normal weather, variations from which could cause results to be toward the top or the bottom of this narrower guidance range. Positive factors as compared to last year included an additional quarter of commercial operations of the Cove Point Liquefaction project, the addition of the Southeast Energy Group operating segment, which includes all former SCANA operations and growth from regulated investment. Negative factors as compared to last year include the loss of earnings from 2018 asset sales, higher share count, higher pension expense and a return to normal weather. The midpoint of our 2019 guidance range assumes that ACP construction recommences during the third quarter of this year, which Tom will address momentarily. It excludes any contribution associated with the Blue Racer earn out, which could be zero, as well as any contribution associated with the resolution of the outstanding zero carbon energy procurement process in Connecticut, which Tom will also address.
Our operating earnings guidance for the first quarter of this year is $1.05 to $1.25 per share compared to $1.14 per share in the first quarter of 2018. Positive factors relative to Q1 2018 include the contribution from the Cove Point Liquefaction project and the addition of the Southeast Energy Group. Negative factors include timing of contributions from farmout, the loss of earnings from asset sales and a higher share count. While we are not providing formal 2020 operating earnings guidance on today's call, we do expect approximately 5% growth from 2019 to 2020, which aligns with achieving our most recent guidance regarding our 2017 to 2020, 6% to 8% compounded annual growth rate. This 2020 expectation also excludes impact of any Blue Racer earn out and the contribution from a resolution in Connecticut.
Finally, we expect dividend per share growth in 2019 of 10%. Please note that all dividend declarations are subject to board approval. Major elements of our 2019 financing plan are included on Slide 8. In addition to a fairly standard debt financing program, we intend to replace and possibly increase the size of the mandatory convertible security that's issued to 3 years ago and which converts in the third quarter. Despite affirmed ratings and lower credit metric downgrade thresholds, we will continue to take steps to support our credit profile.
Turning to Dominion Energy Midstream Partners. The merger of DM into Dominion Energy was completed earlier this week. We issued approximately 22 million shares in exchange for all outstanding Dominion Midstream common and preferred units. The merged assets now reside at subsidiaries of our parent company, though we intend for certain assets to migrate to Dominion Energy Gas Holdings during the year.
Finally, we plan to make 2 distinct presentations for investors on March 25. The first presentation targeting the general investor community will include a number of informational updates, such as asset profiles -- asset profile updates, including for the newly added Southeast Energy Group, capital investment programs, opportunities under the Grid Transformation & Security Act in Virginia, O&M initiatives and long-term dividend growth and capital structure objectives. We believe that this brief presentation will provide reference information and insights that will help investors to better understand Dominion Energy's expanded operational footprint as well as drivers behind our expectation for 5%-plus growth in operating earnings per share beyond 2020.
We're pleased to announce that in a second and separate presentation on that day, we will provide an update that will focus exclusively on our accomplishments and efforts on environmental, social and governance matters and how those efforts underpin our long-term strategy and position us to be -- to become an industry leader in sustainability. To our knowledge, this is the first instance of a major company from the energy infrastructure industry or otherwise to host an investor session dedicated exclusively to these matters. The target audience for this second presentation is members of the financial community with special focus on ESG topics. Both of these presentations will be webcast live on our Investor Relations website with an opportunity to submit questions electronically so that in the event of capacity constraints at our New York City venue, all investors will be able to participate. We'll be providing additional information regarding these investor updates in the near future.
I will now turn the call over to Tom."

For the second straight year, we have set a company record for the lowest OSHA recordable incident rate in our history, 0.55, which is an 8% improvement over what was a record-setting performance in 2017. This achievement",1908,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning. For the second straight year, we have set a company record for the lowest OSHA recordable incident rate in our history, 0.55, which is an 8% improvement over what was a record-setting performance in 2017. This achievement is equally impressive when compared to a peer average that is nearly twice as high. Safety does not just happen. These results represent years of focus on making sure that every employee returns home in the same condition in which they arrived at work that day. We're going to get -- continue to improve until we achieve the only acceptable safety statistic, zero injuries.
Now to our business updates. I will begin by addressing our merger with SCANA, which closed at the beginning of this year. Our new operating segment, the Southeast Energy Group, comprises all of the former SCANA operations. Rodney Blevins, one of our most experienced utility operators now leads the segment. He is working among the over 5,000 able and dedicated colleagues that now comprise the Southeast Energy Group. The group's high quality businesses and our colleagues who operate them enhance Dominion's best-in-class portfolio of state-regulated utility operations. For example, customer growth at SEG's electric and gas utilities were 1.7% and 2.8%, respectively, during 2018. North and South Carolina, despite the challenges related to new nuclear development in the latter, are considered to be among the most constructive regulatory jurisdictions in the country. In 2020, we will file a rate case in South Carolina that, subject to commission approval, will reflect recovery of traditional electric utility capital investment that is not currently being recovered in rates. Those new rates, subject to approval, will become effective on January 1, 2021. Over the coming months, we will continue to build trust with customers, employees, regulators and policymakers by keeping our commitments and being a transparent and responsible corporate citizen. We look forward to discussing the Southeast Energy Group in greater detail in our investor meeting in March.
Next, I'll turn to updates related to the Grid Transformation & Security Act adopted last year in Virginia. In less than a year, we have filed for and received Virginia State Corporation Commission approval for projects representing over $1 billion of capital investment. We expect that number to grow significantly over the next several years as we continue to invest to make our system increasingly sustainable and reliable for our customers. First, we received approval from the SCC for approximately $300 million offshore wind projects, which will be completed under a fixed cost construction agreement. This pilot has the support of Governor Northam and Virginia's General Assembly, and will provide important early learning that we believe will lay the foundation for commercial scale offshore wind for Virginia's clean energy future. Construction of the project is expected to begin this second quarter with a commercial in-service date in late 2020. Second, we received approval from the SCC for phases 2 and 3 of our strategic undergrounding program representing a capital investment of about $240 million. This effort improves the reliability of our system and substantially reduces the duration of restoration times following severe weather events. Third, we received an order granting our certificate of public necessity and convenience for our U.S. 3 utility-scale solar farms, representing 240 megawatts at a capital cost of around $410 million. We remain committed to advancing our goal of having 3,000 megawatts of additional renewable generating capacity in-service or under development by 2022, and we expect to make regular filings under the GTSA with the commission for additional projects in the future.
Next, we received partial approval from the SCC for our initial grid transformation application. The commission approved nearly $100 million of capital over 3 years associated with important physical and cybersecurity investments. The commission asked for more information to support capital investment associated with other aspects of our grid mod strategy, including smart meters, intelligent grid devices and an enhanced customer information platform that allows more sophisticated and convenient customer experience. We will provide that data when we refile our application later this summer. A decision on the refiled application would be expected 6 months after.
I want to offer a few remarks related to recently proposed legislation supported by Governor Northam and bipartisan legislative leadership that establishes a path for addressing our coal ash empanelments. We support the policymakers' desire to resolve this issue permanently through annual rider recovery. The legislation would provide for full cost recovery of operating expense and capital investment associated with the recycling of coal ash for beneficial use and the construction of on-site lined landfills for disposal of the residual coal ash. We believe the bent legislation provides a fair balance between Dominion Energy's customers and its shareholders, and allocates the cost of this program equitably among large and small users of electricity.
I'll now address Millstone and the Atlantic Coast Pipeline. With regard to Millstone, it's important to recognize the extent of the progress that has been made to date on ensuring the long-term viability of this critically important resource to Connecticut. We began engaging in the legislative process 3 years ago. We have diligently followed the law and the requirements established by both DEEP and PURA, and each agency has determined Millstone is an at-risk resource. Former Governor Malloy made an announcement in late December awarding Millstone a 10-year agreement for 9 million megawatt hours per year. The awarded price for the first 3 years of the contract is approximately equal to the New England wholesale power price.
That is not an acceptable result for the company and our 1,500 Millstone colleagues who work safely every day to provide half of the power and 90% of zero carbon power to the State of Connecticut. In order to ensure the plant's viability, we must have pricing that recognizes energy security, environmental and economic benefits. We have and will continue to engage constructively with Governor Lamont's team in seeking a solution work for the state, the region, our company and our employees. We are confident that these issues will be resolved in a manner that provides the long-term financial assurance required for Millstone's continued operation. 
As to the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Supply Header projects, we remain highly confident in the successful and timely resolution of all outstanding permit issues as well as the ultimate completion of the entire project for the following reasons. First, our customers critically need this project to heat and electrify homes, businesses and industries; assist in the transition away from coal-fired power generation; support economic and renewable energy development; and reduce reliance on a single source of gas delivery. Our customers, state regulatory commissions and FERC have all attested independently to the need for this project. Second, we have followed the established rules with regard to permitting environmental protections. Years of painstaking surveying, data collection and scientific analysis stand behind all of our permit applications. In fact, most of our permits are setting new national standards in minimizing environmental impact. Without speaking for the permitting agencies, these professionals have followed the letter in the spirit of rules, regulations and established precedence that guide their action on our permit applications. Third, we are actively pursuing multiple paths to resolve all outstanding permit issues, including judicial, legislative and administrative avenues. We are not alone in these positions. We have the support of the agencies, our customers and varied industry interests. Our current expectation is that full construction could restart in the third quarter. This reflects our belief that the biological opinion issue and any impediments with crossing the Appalachian Trail should be resolved no later than this fall. Based on this schedule, key segments of the project, including from Buckingham County located in Central Virginia to the presently planned terminus in Hampton Roads in Eastern Virginia, and in Lumberton in Southeastern North Carolina would enter commercial service by the end of 2020 with the balance of the project being delivered in early 2021. The cost of the project based on this schedule is expected to be $7 billion to $7.5 billion, excluding financing costs, an increase of approximately $500 million since the update we provided in November.
Similarly, we expect that the Supply Header project would enter commercial service in late 2020, with a project cost of $650 million to $700 million. While we believe that the Appalachian Trial crossing issue should be resolved in time to recommence construction along the entire route during the third quarter, we intended to continue to build key segments that will deliver partial service to our customers by the end of 2020. The completion of the remaining section, which could involve an appeal in Supreme Court would complement the first phase of service by the end of 2021. Under this alternative, total project cost would increase an additional $250 million, resulting in total project cost of $7.25 billion to $7.75 billion, excluding financing costs. In either case, we're currently working with customers to set rates that balance customer needs with preserving a fair project return. It's important to understand that the average basis differential over the last 5 years has been $1.79 per dekatherm, which significantly exceeds the rates of this project. And of course, cost is not the only factor driving our customers' demand. Additional and diversified supply is critical, given that they are forced to turn away new customers due to the lack of infrastructure. When extreme weather occurs, such as the existing polar vortex in the Midwest or the bitter cold that affected the Mid-Atlantic in both 2016 and 2018, the concept of reliable and redundant energy supply assumes a new and much more serious meaning. Policymakers understand the gravity of the situation. Disruptions to the region's limited supply of existing gas delivery infrastructure and weather-driven demands might have and will continue to result in higher prices, forced curtailments and lower reliability for customers until the project is complete.
To be clear, we believe that there are multiple paths that will allow us to complete the entire 600-mile project. As was the case regarding the challenges we faced in the development of the Cove Point Liquefaction project and the closing of our merger with SCANA, large projects require transparency and determination. We have an abundance of both. We will continue to accrue AFUDC equity earnings and expect ACP to contribute to our operating earnings in 2019, 2020 and for decades to come.
In summary, during 2018, we set a new company record for safety performance for the second consecutive year. We delivered 2018 operating earnings per share that exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range and initiated 2019 guidance that implies over 5% annual growth to 2018 weather-normalized results. Our 2019 dividends per share are expected to grow 10% subject to board approval. We successfully executed several major initiatives, including merchant asset sales, $8 billion of parent-level debt reduction, the buy-in of Dominion Energy Midstream Partners and the commercial in-service of the Cove Point Liquefaction project and Greensville Power station that support our earnings and credit objectives and position the business to continue to deliver visible, diversified and regulated growth in the future. We completed the SCANA merger, adding exciting new businesses to our best-in-class regulated portfolio. We continued progress towards successful resolution for both Millstone and ACP. And we advanced capital programs that will help to support 5%-plus earnings growth into the next decade. With that, we're happy to take your questions."

There are 50 pipelines that go underneath the Appalachian Trail today, about 50, that are now all in question. We have significant support from a variety of folks. I think you'll see 10 or more friends of the court file brief -- a brief or briefs some time late next week. The Department of Justice will weigh in before February 11 on the importance of this. But that's -- we'll see what happens. There is other avenues, as I mentioned, there. You can always appeal to Supreme Court, obviously. And there is legislative efforts underway. And there are other potential administrative avenues we're looking at that we haven't been able to pursue very thoroughly because of the government shutdown. So the en banc is an important milestone, but it's not by any stretch the only avenue to make sure we finish this pipe, which we are highly confident."

Of course, they are all subject, as you all know, each quarter to the board approval. But we said in 2017 that looking forward, we had a very robust MLP market. We had Cove Point expectations coming online, et cetera. Because of the unique nature of the take-or-pay contracts at Cove Point, the very significant cash flows flowing out of that, the recapture of the capital costs that we would see to drop into the MLP that we would grow the dividend 10% a year in '18, '19 and '20. And then when we got to '21, we have to see what the landscape looked like at that time. After the FERC ruling in March of last year that destroyed the viability of the MLP market over time, we said not too long after that day, I don't remember the exact date, Rose-Lynn. We said something along the lines of we're going to keep 10% in '18, we except to keep 10% in '19. And depending upon what happens, we are going to ask FERC to reconsider, we didn't know what exactly was going to happen, that it could go from 6% to 10% depending upon what happened with MLPs. I think we have since said that the expectation -- obviously, MLP market is no longer there, so you start already at the bottom of that. But we recognize that it's not going to be 10% in '20, highly unlikely. And that over time, we will bring the dividend growth rate, not going to be a cut in our dividend, that's not even in contemplation, but no issues, we will bring our growth rate of our dividends more in line with our peers after this year. So starting in 2020, some -- we'll talk more about that in March, but there will be some effort to bring them more in line with our peer group.

Dominion Energy reported operating earnings of $0.89 per share for the fourth quarter of 2018, which is above the midpoint of our guidance range of $0.80 to $0.95 per share.

Dominion Energy reported operating earnings of $0.89 per share for the fourth quarter of 2018, which is above the midpoint of our guidance range of $0.80 to $0.95 per share. GAAP earnings for the quarter were $0.97 per share, which includes gains on the sales of noncore assets. For the full year, we reported operating earnings of $4.05 per share, which is also above the midpoint of our guidance range of $3.95 to $4.10 per share.
Drivers relative to our guidance include lower O&M, income tax and depreciation expense as well as favorable weather, partially offset by a longer commissioning process for the Cove Point Liquefaction process -- projects during the first quarter and higher storm restoration expense in the third and fourth quarters. We are pleased that despite a challenging year, we achieved annual operating earnings per share growth of 12.5%. Operating segment performance for the fourth quarter and the full year are shown on Slide 4. GAAP earnings for the year were $3.74 per share. Differences between operating and reported earnings included gains on sale of noncore assets, unrealized losses on nuclear decommissioning trust funds and onetime rate credits issued to customers under Virginia legislation passed in March.
A reconciliation of operating earnings to reported earnings can be found on Schedule 2 of the earnings release kit. 
Before we turn the page completely on 2018, we want to briefly highlight some of the important initiatives that we successfully executed during the year and that we believe will position us for success in 2019.
As mentioned, we achieved annual operating earnings per share growth of more than 10% despite a number of headwinds, including the dramatically altered financing plan. We grew the dividend per share by 10% year-over-year, consistent with the commitment we had previously made to shareholders and slightly lower than annual operating earnings per share growth. We sold noncore merchant assets at attractive valuation, improving our business risk profile and generating over $2.5 billion of sale proceeds, which we used to retire parent-level debt.
We placed both the Cove Point Liquefaction project and Greensville Power Station into commercial service, collectively representing over $5 billion of invested capital. I'm pleased to report that Cove Point continues to operate at or above designed capacity and successfully completed the same-day loading of an export cargo and unloading of an import cargo during the fourth quarter, which we believe may be a first for the domestic LNG industry. Greensville is also operating as designed. 
We took meaningful steps to improve our credit profile, including reducing parent-level debt by about $8 billion through proceeds from equity issuance, noncore asset sales and a Cove Point asset level financing. As a result of these efforts, we achieved our parent-level leverage targets 2 years ahead of schedule. We also materially improved our cash flow coverage metric as measured by Moody's. These achievements in combination with the improved business risk profile due to asset sales and the addition of SCANA's high-quality regulated businesses resulted in the affirmation of our existing credit ratings and the lowering of our credit metric thresholds.
In Virginia, we worked with legislators, the Governor, customer groups and other important stakeholders to support the Grid Transformation & Security Act, a bipartisan law that provides a path to a sustainable and reliable energy future in the Commonwealth. And finally, we obtained all required regulatory approvals and subsequently closed our merger with SCANA, which we expect to provide near-term earnings of approximately $0.10 per share per year. Tom will talk more about this a little later, but we are pleased that we were able to offer significant value to SCANA customers, protections to SCANA employees and preserve transaction economics that our shareholders and credit providers expected.
Moving now to 2019 earnings guidance. Operating earnings per share for 2019 are expected to be between $4.05 and $4.40 per share. This guidance range of $0.35 is narrower than in recent years reflecting the increasingly regulated nature of our operation. The midpoint of this range represents 5.6% growth relative to 2018's weather-normalized results.
As usual, our guidance assumes normal weather, variations from which could cause results to be toward the top or the bottom of this narrower guidance range. Positive factors as compared to last year include an additional quarter of commercial operations of the Cove Point Liquefaction project, the addition of the Southeast Energy Group operating segment, which includes all former SCANA operations and growth from regulated investment. Negative factors as compared to last year include the loss of earnings from 2018 asset sales, higher share count, higher pension expense and a return to normal weather. The midpoint of our 2019 guidance range assumes that ACP construction recommences during the third quarter of this year, which Tom will address momentarily. It excludes any contribution associated with the Blue Racer earnout, which could be 0, as well as any contribution associated with the resolution of the outstanding zero carbon energy procurement process in Connecticut, which Tom will also address.
Our operating earnings guidance for the first quarter of this year is $1.05 to $1.25 per share compared to $1.14 per share in the first quarter of 2018. Positive factors relative to Q1 2018 include the contribution from the Cove Point Liquefaction project and the addition of the Southeast Energy Group. Negative factors include timing of contributions from farmout, the loss of earnings from asset sales and a higher share count. While we are not providing formal 2020 operating earnings guidance on today's call, we do expect approximately 5% growth from 2019 to 2020, which aligns with achieving our most recent guidance regarding our 2017 to 2020, 6% to 8% compounded annual growth rate. This 2020 expectation also excludes impact of any Blue Racer earnout and the contribution from a resolution in Connecticut.
Finally, we expect dividend per share growth in 2019 of 10%. Please note that all dividend declarations are subject to board approval. Major elements of our 2019 financing plan are included on Slide 8. In addition to a fairly standard debt financing program, we intend to replace and possibly increase the size of the mandatory convertible security that was issued to 3 years ago and which converts in the third quarter. Despite affirmed ratings and lower credit metric downgrade thresholds, we will continue to take steps to support our credit profile.
Turning to Dominion Energy Midstream Partners. The merger of DM into Dominion Energy was completed earlier this week. We issued approximately 22 million shares in exchange for all outstanding Dominion Midstream common and preferred units. The merged assets now reside at subsidiaries of our parent company, though we intend for certain assets to migrate to Dominion Energy Gas Holdings during the year.
Finally, we plan to make 2 distinct presentations for investors on March 25. The first presentation targeting the general investor community will include a number of informational updates, such as asset profiles -- asset profile updates, including for the newly added Southeast Energy Group, capital investment programs, opportunities under the Grid Transformation & Security Act in Virginia, O&M initiatives and long-term dividend growth and capital structure objectives. We believe that this brief presentation will provide reference information and insights that will help investors to better understand Dominion Energy's expanded operational footprint as well as drivers behind our expectation for 5%-plus growth in operating earnings per share beyond 2020.
We're pleased to announce that in a second and separate presentation on that day, we will provide an update that will focus exclusively on our accomplishments and efforts on environmental, social and governance matters and how those efforts underpin our long-term strategy and position us to be -- to become an industry leader in sustainability. To our knowledge, this is the first instance of a major company from the energy infrastructure industry or otherwise to host an investor session dedicated exclusively to these matters. The target audience for this second presentation is members of the financial community with special focus on ESG topics. Both of these presentations will be webcast live on our Investor Relations website with an opportunity to submit questions electronically so that, in the event of capacity constraints at our New York City venue, all investors will be able to participate. We'll be providing additional information regarding these investor updates in the near future.
I will now turn the call over to Tom."

For the second straight year, we have set a company record for the lowest OSHA recordable incident rate in our history, 0.55, which is an 8% improvement over what was a record-setting performance in 2017. This achievement",1908,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning. For the second straight year, we have set a company record for the lowest OSHA recordable incident rate in our history, 0.55, which is an 8% improvement over what was a record-setting performance in 2017. This achievement is equally impressive when compared to a peer average that is nearly twice as high. Safety does not just happen. These results represent years of focus on making sure that every employee returns home in the same condition in which they arrived at work that day. We're going to get to continue to improve until we achieve the only acceptable safety statistic, 0 injuries.
Now to our business updates. I will begin by addressing our merger with SCANA, which closed at the beginning of this year. Our new operating segment, the Southeast Energy Group, comprises all of the former SCANA operations. Rodney Blevins, one of our most experienced utility operators now leads the segment. He is working among the over 5,000 able and dedicated colleagues that now comprise the Southeast Energy Group. The group's high-quality businesses and our colleagues who operate them enhance Dominion's best-in-class portfolio of state-regulated utility operations. For example, customer growth at SEG's electric and gas utilities were 1.7% and 2.8% respectively, during 2018. North and South Carolina, despite the challenges related to new nuclear development in the latter, are considered to be among the most constructive regulatory jurisdictions in the country. In 2020, we will file a rate case in South Carolina that, subject to commission approval, will reflect recovery of traditional electric utility capital investment that is not currently being recovered in rates. Those new rates, subject to approval, will become effective on January 1, 2021. Over the coming months, we will continue to build trust with customers, employees, regulators and policymakers by keeping our commitments and being a transparent and responsible corporate citizen. We look forward to discussing the Southeast Energy Group in greater detail in our investor meeting in March. 
Next, I'll turn to updates related to the Grid Transformation & Security Act adopted last year in Virginia. In less than a year, we have filed for and received Virginia State Corporation Commission approval for projects representing over $1 billion of capital investment. We expect that number to grow significantly over the next several years as we continue to invest to make our system increasingly sustainable and reliable for our customers. First, we received approval from the SCC for approximately $300 million offshore wind projects, which will be completed under a fixed cost construction agreement. This pilot has the support of Governor Northam and Virginia's General Assembly, and will provide important early learning that we believe will lay the foundation for commercial-scale offshore wind for Virginia's clean energy future. Construction of the project is expected to begin this second quarter with a commercial in-service date in late 2020. Second, we received approval from the SCC for phases 2 and 3 of our strategic undergrounding program representing a capital investment of about $240 million. This effort improves the reliability of our system and substantially reduces the duration of restoration times following severe weather events. Third, we received an order granting our certificate of public necessity and convenience for our U.S. 3 utility-scale solar farms, representing 240 megawatts at a capital cost of around $410 million. We remain committed to advancing our goal of having 3,000 megawatts of additional renewable generating capacity in-service or under development by 2022, and we expect to make regular filings under the GTSA with the commission for additional projects in the future.
Next, we received partial approval from the SCC for our initial grid transformation application. The commission approved nearly $100 million of capital over 3 years associated with important physical and cybersecurity investments. The commission asked for more information to support capital investment associated with other aspects of our grid mod strategy, including smart meters, intelligent grid devices and an enhanced customer information platform that allows more sophisticated and convenient customer experience. We will provide that data when we refile our application later this summer. A decision on the refiled application would be expected 6 months after.
I want to offer a few remarks related to recently proposed legislation supported by Governor Northam and bipartisan legislative leadership that establishes a path for addressing our coal ash empanelments. We support the policymakers' desire to resolve this issue permanently through annual rider recovery. The legislation would provide for full cost recovery of operating expense and capital investment associated with the recycling of coal ash for beneficial use and the construction of on-site lined landfills for disposal of the residual coal ash. We believe that, that legislation provides a fair balance between Dominion Energy's customers and its shareholders, and allocates the cost of this program equitably among large and small users of electricity.
I'll now address Millstone and the Atlantic Coast Pipeline. With regard to Millstone, it's important to recognize the extent of the progress that has been made to date on ensuring the long-term viability of this critically important resource to Connecticut. We began engaging in the legislative process 3 years ago. We have diligently followed the law and the requirements established by both DEEP and PURA, and each agency has determined Millstone is an at-risk resource. Former Governor Malloy made an announcement in late December awarding Millstone a 10-year agreement for 9 million megawatt hours per year. The awarded price for the first 3 years of the contract is approximately equal to the New England wholesale power price.
That is not an acceptable result for the company and our 1,500 Millstone colleagues who work safely every day to provide half of the power and 90% of zero carbon power to the State of Connecticut. In order to ensure the plant's viability, we must have pricing that recognizes energy security, environmental and economic benefits. We have and will continue to engage constructively with Governor Lamont's team in seeking a solution work for the state, the region, our company and our employees. We are confident that these issues will be resolved in a manner that provides the long-term financial assurance required for Millstone's continued operation. 
As to the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Supply Header projects, we remain highly confident in the successful and timely resolution of all outstanding permit issues as well as the ultimate completion of the entire project for the following reasons. First, our customers critically need this project to heat and electrify homes, businesses and industries; assist in the transition away from coal-fired power generation; support economic and renewable energy development; and reduce reliance on a single source of gas delivery. Our customers, state regulatory commissions and FERC have all attested independently to the need for this project. Second, we have followed the established rules with regard to permitting environmental protections. Years of painstaking surveying, data collection and scientific analysis stand behind all of our permit applications. In fact, most of our permits are setting new national standards in minimizing environmental impact. Without speaking for the permitting agencies, these professionals have followed the letter in the spirit of the rules, regulations and established precedents that guide their action on our permit applications. Third, we are actively pursuing multiple paths to resolve all outstanding permit issues, including judicial, legislative and administrative avenues. We are not alone in these positions. We have the support of the agencies, our customers and varied industry interests. Our current expectation is that full construction could restart in the third quarter. This reflects our belief that the biological opinion issue and any impediments with the crossing the Appalachian Trail should be resolved no later than this fall. Based on this schedule, key segments of the project, including from Buckingham County located in Central Virginia to the presently planned terminus in Hampton Roads in Eastern Virginia, and in Lumberton in Southeastern North Carolina would enter commercial service by the end of 2020 with the balance of the project being delivered in early 2021. The cost of the project based on this schedule is expected to be $7 billion to $7.5 billion, excluding financing costs, an increase of approximately $500 million since the update we provided in November.
Similarly, we expect that the Supply Header project would enter commercial service in late 2020, with a project cost of $650 million to $700 million. While we believe that the Appalachian Trial crossing issue should be resolved in time to recommence construction along the entire route during the third quarter, we intended to continue to build key segments that will deliver partial service to our customers by the end of 2020. The completion of the remaining section, which could involve an appeal in Supreme Court would complement the first phase of service by the end of 2021. Under this alternative, total project cost would increase an additional $250 million, resulting in total project cost of $7.25 billion to $7.75 billion, excluding financing costs. In either case, we're currently working with customers to set rates that balance customer needs with preserving a fair project return. It's important to understand that the average basis differential over the last 5 years has been $1.79 per dekatherm, which significantly exceeds the rate of this project. 
And of course, cost is not the only factor driving our customers' demand. Additional and diversified supply is critical, given that they are forced to turn away new customers due to the lack of infrastructure. When extreme weather occurs, such as the existing polar vortex in the Midwest or the bitter cold that affected the Mid-Atlantic in both 2016 and 2018, the concept of reliable and redundant energy supply assumes a new and much more serious meaning. Policymakers understand the gravity of the situation. Disruptions to the region's limited supply of existing gas delivery infrastructure and weather-driven demand spikes have and will continue to result in higher prices, forced curtailments and lower reliability for customers until the project is complete.
To be clear, we believe that there are multiple paths that will allow us to complete the entire 600-mile project. As was the case regarding the challenges we faced in the development of the Cove Point Liquefaction project and the closing of our merger with SCANA, large projects require transparency and determination. We have an abundance of both. We will continue to accrue AFUDC equity earnings and expect ACP to contribute to our operating earnings in 2019, 2020 and for decades to come.
In summary, during 2018, we set a new company record for safety performance for the second consecutive year. We delivered 2018 operating earnings per share that exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range and initiated 2019 guidance that implies over 5% annual growth to 2018 weather-normalized results. Our 2019 dividends per share are expected to grow 10% subject to board approval. We successfully executed several major initiatives, including merchant asset sales, $8 billion of parent-level debt reduction, the buy-in of Dominion Energy Midstream Partners and the commercial in-service of the Cove Point Liquefaction project and Greensville Power station that support our earnings and credit objectives and position the business to continue to deliver visible, diversified and regulated growth in the future. We completed the SCANA merger, adding exciting new businesses to our best-in-class regulated portfolio. We continued progress towards successful resolution for both Millstone and ACP. And we advanced capital programs that will help to support 5%-plus earnings growth into the next decade. With that, we're happy to take your questions."

So we're hopeful that there will be a contract for that period, the value of these other attributes we've talked about for Millstone. So if that comes into place, the contribution from such a contract for the relevant period would be an adder to our guidance -- earnings guidance. Doesn't necessarily mean it would change our growth rate, but it will be an adder to the existing guidance. So that's what we mean by that, that's excluded. There will be a potential for an adder for the time period in which a federal contract comes into place."

You're quite right, en banc proceedings are -- they don't happen every day of the week, they don't happen every month. This case, I don't know if you've had a chance to read the brief that was filed on behalf of ACP last week, but I think it sets the story out pretty well. There are 50 pipelines that go underneath the Appalachian Trail today, about 50, that are now all in question. We have significant support from a variety of folks. I think you'll see 10 or more friends of the court file brief -- a brief or briefs some time late next week. The Department of Justice will weigh in before February 11 on the importance of this. But that's -- we'll see what happens. There is other avenues, as I've mentioned. There -- you can always appeal to Supreme Court, obviously. And there is legislative efforts underway, and there are other potential administrative avenues we're looking at that we haven't been able to pursue very thoroughly because of the government shutdown. So the en banc is an important milestone, but it's not by any stretch the only avenue to make sure we finish this pipe, in which we are highly confident."

Of course, they are all subject, as you all know, each quarter to board approval. But we said in 2017 that looking forward, we had a very robust MLP market. We had Cove Point expectations coming online, et cetera. But because of the unique nature of the take-or-pay contracts at Cove Point, the very significant cash flows flowing out of that, the recapture of the capital costs that we would see through drops into the MLP that we would grow the dividend 10% a year in '18, '19 and '20. And then when we got to '21, we'd have to see what the landscape looked like at that time. After the FERC ruling in March of last year that destroyed the viability of the MLP market over time, we said not too long after that day, I don't remember the exact date, Rose-Lynn, we said something along the lines of we're going to keep 10% in '18, we expect to keep 10% in '19. And depending upon what happens, we are going to ask FERC to reconsider, we didn't know what exactly was going to happen, that it could go from 6% to 10% depending upon what happened with MLPs. I think we have since said that the expectation -- obviously, the MLP market is no longer there, so you start already at the bottom of that. But we recognize that it's not going to be 10% in '20, highly unlikely. And that over time, we will bring the dividend growth rate, not going to be a cut in our dividend, that's not even in contemplation, but the notion is we will bring our growth rate of our dividends more in line with our peers after this year. So starting in 2020, some -- we'll talk more about that in March, but there will be some effort to bring them more in line with our peer group.

Dominion Energy reported operating earnings of $0.89 per share for the fourth quarter of 2018, which is above the midpoint of our guidance range of $0.80 to $0.95 per share.

Dominion Energy reported operating earnings of $0.89 per share for the fourth quarter of 2018, which is above the midpoint of our guidance range of $0.80 to $0.95 per share. GAAP earnings for the quarter were $0.97 per share, which includes gains on the sales of noncore assets. For the full year, we reported operating earnings of $4.05 per share, which is also above the midpoint of our guidance range of $3.95 to $4.10 per share.
Drivers relative to our guidance include lower O&M, income tax and depreciation expense as well as favorable weather, partially offset by a longer commissioning process for the Cove Point Liquefaction process -- projects during the first quarter and higher storm restoration expense in the third and fourth quarters. We are pleased that despite a challenging year, we achieved annual operating earnings per share growth of 12.5%. Operating segment performance for the fourth quarter and the full year are shown on Slide 4. GAAP earnings for the year were $3.74 per share. Differences between operating and reported earnings included gains on sale of noncore assets, unrealized losses on nuclear decommissioning trust funds and onetime rate credits issued to customers under Virginia legislation passed in March.
A reconciliation of operating earnings to reported earnings can be found on Schedule 2 of the earnings release kit. 
Before we turn the page completely on 2018, we want to briefly highlight some of the important initiatives that we successfully executed during the year and that we believe will position us for success in 2019.
As mentioned, we achieved annual operating earnings per share growth of more than 10% despite a number of headwinds, including the dramatically altered financing plan. We grew the dividend per share by 10% year-over-year, consistent with the commitment we had previously made to shareholders and slightly lower than annual operating earnings per share growth. We sold noncore merchant assets at attractive valuation, improving our business risk profile and generating over $2.5 billion of sale proceeds, which we used to retire parent-level debt.
We placed both the Cove Point Liquefaction project and Greensville Power Station into commercial service, collectively representing over $5 billion of invested capital. I'm pleased to report that Cove Point continues to operate at or above designed capacity and successfully completed the same-day loading of an export cargo and unloading of an import cargo during the fourth quarter, which we believe may be a first for the domestic LNG industry. Greensville is also operating as designed. 
We took meaningful steps to improve our credit profile, including reducing parent-level debt by about $8 billion through proceeds from equity issuance, noncore asset sales and a Cove Point asset level financing. As a result of these efforts, we achieved our parent-level leverage targets 2 years ahead of schedule. We also materially improved our cash flow coverage metric as measured by Moody's. These achievements in combination with the improved business risk profile due to asset sales and the addition of SCANA's high-quality regulated businesses resulted in the affirmation of our existing credit ratings and the lowering of our credit metric thresholds.
In Virginia, we worked with legislators, the Governor, customer groups and other important stakeholders to support the Grid Transformation & Security Act, a bipartisan law that provides a path to a sustainable and reliable energy future in the Commonwealth. And finally, we obtained all required regulatory approvals and subsequently closed our merger with SCANA, which we expect to provide near-term earnings of approximately $0.10 per share per year. Tom will talk more about this a little later, but we are pleased that we were able to offer significant value to SCANA customers, protections to SCANA employees and preserve transaction economics that our shareholders and credit providers expected.
Moving now to 2019 earnings guidance. Operating earnings per share for 2019 are expected to be between $4.05 and $4.40 per share. This guidance range of $0.35 is narrower than in recent years reflecting the increasingly regulated nature of our operation. The midpoint of this range represents 5.6% growth relative to 2018's weather-normalized results.
As usual, our guidance assumes normal weather, variations from which could cause results to be toward the top or the bottom of this narrower guidance range. Positive factors as compared to last year include an additional quarter of commercial operations of the Cove Point Liquefaction project, the addition of the Southeast Energy Group operating segment, which includes all former SCANA operations and growth from regulated investment. Negative factors as compared to last year include the loss of earnings from 2018 asset sales, higher share count, higher pension expense and a return to normal weather. The midpoint of our 2019 guidance range assumes that ACP construction recommences during the third quarter of this year, which Tom will address momentarily. It excludes any contribution associated with the Blue Racer earnout, which could be 0, as well as any contribution associated with the resolution of the outstanding zero carbon energy procurement process in Connecticut, which Tom will also address.
Our operating earnings guidance for the first quarter of this year is $1.05 to $1.25 per share compared to $1.14 per share in the first quarter of 2018. Positive factors relative to Q1 2018 include the contribution from the Cove Point Liquefaction project and the addition of the Southeast Energy Group. Negative factors include timing of contributions from farmout, the loss of earnings from asset sales and a higher share count. While we are not providing formal 2020 operating earnings guidance on today's call, we do expect approximately 5% growth from 2019 to 2020, which aligns with achieving our most recent guidance regarding our 2017 to 2020, 6% to 8% compounded annual growth rate. This 2020 expectation also excludes impact of any Blue Racer earnout and the contribution from a resolution in Connecticut.
Finally, we expect dividend per share growth in 2019 of 10%. Please note that all dividend declarations are subject to board approval. Major elements of our 2019 financing plan are included on Slide 8. In addition to a fairly standard debt financing program, we intend to replace and possibly increase the size of the mandatory convertible security that was issued to 3 years ago and which converts in the third quarter. Despite affirmed ratings and lower credit metric downgrade thresholds, we will continue to take steps to support our credit profile.
Turning to Dominion Energy Midstream Partners. The merger of DM into Dominion Energy was completed earlier this week. We issued approximately 22 million shares in exchange for all outstanding Dominion Midstream common and preferred units. The merged assets now reside at subsidiaries of our parent company, though we intend for certain assets to migrate to Dominion Energy Gas Holdings during the year.
Finally, we plan to make 2 distinct presentations for investors on March 25. The first presentation targeting the general investor community will include a number of informational updates, such as asset profiles -- asset profile updates, including for the newly added Southeast Energy Group, capital investment programs, opportunities under the Grid Transformation & Security Act in Virginia, O&M initiatives and long-term dividend growth and capital structure objectives. We believe that this brief presentation will provide reference information and insights that will help investors to better understand Dominion Energy's expanded operational footprint as well as drivers behind our expectation for 5%-plus growth in operating earnings per share beyond 2020.
We're pleased to announce that in a second and separate presentation on that day, we will provide an update that will focus exclusively on our accomplishments and efforts on environmental, social and governance matters and how those efforts underpin our long-term strategy and position us to be -- to become an industry leader in sustainability. To our knowledge, this is the first instance of a major company from the energy infrastructure industry or otherwise to host an investor session dedicated exclusively to these matters. The target audience for this second presentation is members of the financial community with special focus on ESG topics. Both of these presentations will be webcast live on our Investor Relations website with an opportunity to submit questions electronically so that, in the event of capacity constraints at our New York City venue, all investors will be able to participate. We'll be providing additional information regarding these investor updates in the near future.
I will now turn the call over to Tom."

For the second straight year, we have set a company record for the lowest OSHA recordable incident rate in our history, 0.55, which is an 8% improvement over what was a record-setting performance in 2017. This achievement",1908,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning. For the second straight year, we have set a company record for the lowest OSHA recordable incident rate in our history, 0.55, which is an 8% improvement over what was a record-setting performance in 2017. This achievement is equally impressive when compared to a peer average that is nearly twice as high. Safety does not just happen. These results represent years of focus on making sure that every employee returns home in the same condition in which they arrived at work that day. We're going to get to continue to improve until we achieve the only acceptable safety statistic, 0 injuries.
Now to our business updates. I will begin by addressing our merger with SCANA, which closed at the beginning of this year. Our new operating segment, the Southeast Energy Group, comprises all of the former SCANA operations. Rodney Blevins, one of our most experienced utility operators now leads the segment. He is working among the over 5,000 able and dedicated colleagues that now comprise the Southeast Energy Group. The group's high-quality businesses and our colleagues who operate them enhance Dominion's best-in-class portfolio of state-regulated utility operations. For example, customer growth at SEG's electric and gas utilities were 1.7% and 2.8% respectively, during 2018. North and South Carolina, despite the challenges related to new nuclear development in the latter, are considered to be among the most constructive regulatory jurisdictions in the country. In 2020, we will file a rate case in South Carolina that, subject to commission approval, will reflect recovery of traditional electric utility capital investment that is not currently being recovered in rates. Those new rates, subject to approval, will become effective on January 1, 2021. Over the coming months, we will continue to build trust with customers, employees, regulators and policymakers by keeping our commitments and being a transparent and responsible corporate citizen. We look forward to discussing the Southeast Energy Group in greater detail in our investor meeting in March. 
Next, I'll turn to updates related to the Grid Transformation & Security Act adopted last year in Virginia. In less than a year, we have filed for and received Virginia State Corporation Commission approval for projects representing over $1 billion of capital investment. We expect that number to grow significantly over the next several years as we continue to invest to make our system increasingly sustainable and reliable for our customers. First, we received approval from the SCC for approximately $300 million offshore wind projects, which will be completed under a fixed cost construction agreement. This pilot has the support of Governor Northam and Virginia's General Assembly, and will provide important early learning that we believe will lay the foundation for commercial-scale offshore wind for Virginia's clean energy future. Construction of the project is expected to begin this second quarter with a commercial in-service date in late 2020. Second, we received approval from the SCC for phases 2 and 3 of our strategic undergrounding program representing a capital investment of about $240 million. This effort improves the reliability of our system and substantially reduces the duration of restoration times following severe weather events. Third, we received an order granting our certificate of public necessity and convenience for our U.S. 3 utility-scale solar farms, representing 240 megawatts at a capital cost of around $410 million. We remain committed to advancing our goal of having 3,000 megawatts of additional renewable generating capacity in-service or under development by 2022, and we expect to make regular filings under the GTSA with the commission for additional projects in the future.
Next, we received partial approval from the SCC for our initial grid transformation application. The commission approved nearly $100 million of capital over 3 years associated with important physical and cybersecurity investments. The commission asked for more information to support capital investment associated with other aspects of our grid mod strategy, including smart meters, intelligent grid devices and an enhanced customer information platform that allows more sophisticated and convenient customer experience. We will provide that data when we refile our application later this summer. A decision on the refiled application would be expected 6 months after.
I want to offer a few remarks related to recently proposed legislation supported by Governor Northam and bipartisan legislative leadership that establishes a path for addressing our coal ash empanelments. We support the policymakers' desire to resolve this issue permanently through annual rider recovery. The legislation would provide for full cost recovery of operating expense and capital investment associated with the recycling of coal ash for beneficial use and the construction of on-site lined landfills for disposal of the residual coal ash. We believe that, that legislation provides a fair balance between Dominion Energy's customers and its shareholders, and allocates the cost of this program equitably among large and small users of electricity.
I'll now address Millstone and the Atlantic Coast Pipeline. With regard to Millstone, it's important to recognize the extent of the progress that has been made to date on ensuring the long-term viability of this critically important resource to Connecticut. We began engaging in the legislative process 3 years ago. We have diligently followed the law and the requirements established by both DEEP and PURA, and each agency has determined Millstone is an at-risk resource. Former Governor Malloy made an announcement in late December awarding Millstone a 10-year agreement for 9 million megawatt hours per year. The awarded price for the first 3 years of the contract is approximately equal to the New England wholesale power price.
That is not an acceptable result for the company and our 1,500 Millstone colleagues who work safely every day to provide half of the power and 90% of zero carbon power to the State of Connecticut. In order to ensure the plant's viability, we must have pricing that recognizes energy security, environmental and economic benefits. We have and will continue to engage constructively with Governor Lamont's team in seeking a solution work for the state, the region, our company and our employees. We are confident that these issues will be resolved in a manner that provides the long-term financial assurance required for Millstone's continued operation. 
As to the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Supply Header projects, we remain highly confident in the successful and timely resolution of all outstanding permit issues as well as the ultimate completion of the entire project for the following reasons. First, our customers critically need this project to heat and electrify homes, businesses and industries; assist in the transition away from coal-fired power generation; support economic and renewable energy development; and reduce reliance on a single source of gas delivery. Our customers, state regulatory commissions and FERC have all attested independently to the need for this project. Second, we have followed the established rules with regard to permitting environmental protections. Years of painstaking surveying, data collection and scientific analysis stand behind all of our permit applications. In fact, most of our permits are setting new national standards in minimizing environmental impact. Without speaking for the permitting agencies, these professionals have followed the letter in the spirit of the rules, regulations and established precedents that guide their action on our permit applications. Third, we are actively pursuing multiple paths to resolve all outstanding permit issues, including judicial, legislative and administrative avenues. We are not alone in these positions. We have the support of the agencies, our customers and varied industry interests. Our current expectation is that full construction could restart in the third quarter. This reflects our belief that the biological opinion issue and any impediments with the crossing the Appalachian Trail should be resolved no later than this fall. Based on this schedule, key segments of the project, including from Buckingham County located in Central Virginia to the presently planned terminus in Hampton Roads in Eastern Virginia, and in Lumberton in Southeastern North Carolina would enter commercial service by the end of 2020 with the balance of the project being delivered in early 2021. The cost of the project based on this schedule is expected to be $7 billion to $7.5 billion, excluding financing costs, an increase of approximately $500 million since the update we provided in November.
Similarly, we expect that the Supply Header project would enter commercial service in late 2020, with a project cost of $650 million to $700 million. While we believe that the Appalachian Trial crossing issue should be resolved in time to recommence construction along the entire route during the third quarter, we intended to continue to build key segments that will deliver partial service to our customers by the end of 2020. The completion of the remaining section, which could involve an appeal in Supreme Court would complement the first phase of service by the end of 2021. Under this alternative, total project cost would increase an additional $250 million, resulting in total project cost of $7.25 billion to $7.75 billion, excluding financing costs. In either case, we're currently working with customers to set rates that balance customer needs with preserving a fair project return. It's important to understand that the average basis differential over the last 5 years has been $1.79 per dekatherm, which significantly exceeds the rate of this project. 
And of course, cost is not the only factor driving our customers' demand. Additional and diversified supply is critical, given that they are forced to turn away new customers due to the lack of infrastructure. When extreme weather occurs, such as the existing polar vortex in the Midwest or the bitter cold that affected the Mid-Atlantic in both 2016 and 2018, the concept of reliable and redundant energy supply assumes a new and much more serious meaning. Policymakers understand the gravity of the situation. Disruptions to the region's limited supply of existing gas delivery infrastructure and weather-driven demand spikes have and will continue to result in higher prices, forced curtailments and lower reliability for customers until the project is complete.
To be clear, we believe that there are multiple paths that will allow us to complete the entire 600-mile project. As was the case regarding the challenges we faced in the development of the Cove Point Liquefaction project and the closing of our merger with SCANA, large projects require transparency and determination. We have an abundance of both. We will continue to accrue AFUDC equity earnings and expect ACP to contribute to our operating earnings in 2019, 2020 and for decades to come.
In summary, during 2018, we set a new company record for safety performance for the second consecutive year. We delivered 2018 operating earnings per share that exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range and initiated 2019 guidance that implies over 5% annual growth to 2018 weather-normalized results. Our 2019 dividends per share are expected to grow 10% subject to board approval. We successfully executed several major initiatives, including merchant asset sales, $8 billion of parent-level debt reduction, the buy-in of Dominion Energy Midstream Partners and the commercial in-service of the Cove Point Liquefaction project and Greensville Power station that support our earnings and credit objectives and position the business to continue to deliver visible, diversified and regulated growth in the future. We completed the SCANA merger, adding exciting new businesses to our best-in-class regulated portfolio. We continued progress towards successful resolution for both Millstone and ACP. And we advanced capital programs that will help to support 5%-plus earnings growth into the next decade. With that, we're happy to take your questions."

So we're hopeful that there will be a contract for that period, the value of these other attributes we've talked about for Millstone. So if that comes into place, the contribution from such a contract for the relevant period would be an adder to our guidance -- earnings guidance.

There are 50 pipelines that go underneath the Appalachian Trail today, about 50, that are now all in question. We have significant support from a variety of folks. I think you'll see 10 or more friends of the court file brief -- a brief or briefs sometime late next week. The Department of Justice will weigh in before February 11 on the importance of this. But that's -- we'll see what happens. There is other avenues, as I've mentioned. There -- you can always appeal to Supreme Court, obviously. And there is legislative efforts underway, and there are other potential administrative avenues we're looking at that we haven't been able to pursue very thoroughly because of the government shutdown. So the en banc is an important milestone, but it's not by any stretch the only avenue to make sure we finish this pipe, in which we are highly confident."

Of course, they are all subject, as you all know, each quarter to board approval. But we said in 2017 that looking forward, we had a very robust MLP market. We had Cove Point expectations coming online, et cetera. But because of the unique nature of the take-or-pay contracts at Cove Point, the very significant cash flows flowing out of that, the recapture of the capital costs that we would see through drops into the MLP that we would grow the dividend 10% a year in '18, '19 and '20. And then when we got to '21, we'd have to see what the landscape looked like at that time. After the FERC ruling in March of last year that destroyed the viability of the MLP market over time, we said not too long after that day, I don't remember the exact date, Rose-Lynn, we said something along the lines of we're going to keep 10% in '18, we expect to keep 10% in '19. And depending upon what happens, we are going to ask FERC to reconsider, we didn't know what exactly was going to happen, that it could go from 6% to 10% depending upon what happened with MLPs. I think we have since said that the expectation -- obviously, the MLP market is no longer there, so you start already at the bottom of that. But we recognize that it's not going to be 10% in '20, highly unlikely. And that over time, we will bring the dividend growth rate, not going to be a cut in our dividend, that's not even in contemplation, but the notion is we will bring our growth rate of our dividends more in line with our peers after this year. So starting in 2020, some -- we'll talk more about that in March, but there will be some effort to bring them more in line with our peer group.

Dominion Energy reported first quarter 2019 operating earnings of $1.10 per share compared to our guidance range of $1.05 to $1.25 per share. 
Otherwise strong performance across our businesses was impacted by initially mild weather in Virginia and South Carolina, which reduced utility earnings by about $0.06 per share. 
As a general indicator, heating degree days were 5% and 19% below normal in Virginia and South Carolina, respectively. 
Various initiatives, primarily in power delivery and power generation, was successful offsetting some of these headwinds and when adjusted for the utility weather of $0.06, operating only for the quarter were $1.16 per share, which is above the midpoint from our guidance range. 
Operating segment performance for the first quarter is shown on Slide 4. GAAP earnings for the quarter are negative $0.86 per share, which were driven primarily by the expected charges related to SCANA merger commitments and the early retirement of certain cold reserve Virginia utility-degenerating units. 
Slide 5 highlights the pretax drivers of adjustments to reported earnings. A reconciliation of operating earnings to reported earnings can be found on schedule 2 of the Earnings Release Kit. 
On March 25, we held 2 sessions for investors that provided an update on capital investment, earnings and dividend growth outlook, financing plan, expense control initiatives as well as the first of its kind, sustainability and ESG focus session, highlights of which are shown on Slide 6. 
It is worth noting that we continue to have full confidence in the earnings growth and other targets we've highlighted during those meetings. We are very happy with the in-person and online attendance and thank all of those who are able to participate and provide feedback following the event. Please note that the meeting materials, including the webcast replay, continue to be available on our website. We encourage all to review thoroughly. 
Also during this quarter, we continue to be engaged across a number of important public initiatives as follows: First, as announced at our Investor Day, we are preparing to restructure our reporting segments, a meaningful change to the way we manage our businesses and report their financial performance. We continue to forecast that this transition will take until late 2019 to complete. The Alternate Breakdown Structure, or ABS, provides a preliminary view of our future intended reported segment results and will be posted shortly after this call to our Investor Relations website. 
The ABS, which is not reflective of how we currently manage our business, is not intended to replace Dominion Energy's current operating segment disclosures; second, progress is being made on our flat O&M and Voluntary Retirement program initiatives discussed at the end of March. 
We are very intentionally combing through each of our segments, all of our assets in every location to identify opportunities to embrace technology, increase efficiency and improve business processes and enhance the customer experience. 
Results of the Voluntary Retirement program discussed in our Investor Day, including response rate from eligible employees and assessment of backfill needs and financial impacts are still being quantified. Although, I would note that preliminary response rate was robust. 
We expect to be able to quantify these results on next quarter's call. 
Moving out to operating earnings guidance on Slide 7. As usual, our operating's earnings guidance ranges assume normal weather. Variations from which could cause results to be towards the top or the bottom of these guidance ranges. 
For the second quarter, we are initiating guidance of $0.70 to $0.80 per share. Positive factors, as compared to last year, include growth from regular did investment across electric and gas utility programs as well as the contribution from the Southeast Energy Group. Negative factors, as compare to last year, include stone refueling outage timing; the impact of 2018 asset sales; share issuances; and a return to normal weather. 
We are also affirming our expectation for full year 2019 operating earnings per share between $4.05 and $4.40. 
Positive 2019 full year drivers relative to last year, include growth from regulated investment across electric and gas utility programs, contribution from Southeast Energy Group, a full year of Cove Point Liquefaction operation at run rate production levels, and expense control initiatives. 
Negative drivers relative to last year are expected to include, the impact of the 2018 noncore assets sales, share issuances and a return to normal weather. 
Finally, we also reiterate our long-term EPS growth expectations of approximately 5% per year through 2020 and 5% plus thereafter. I'll now turn the call over to Tom."

On April 10, we were tragically reminded of the everyday risks our colleagues face when a fellow employee was fatally injured as a result of the gas line rupture caused by unrelated third-party contractor installing fiber",1008,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning. On April 10, we were tragically reminded of the everyday risks our colleagues face when a fellow employee was fatally injured as a result of the gas line rupture caused by unrelated third-party contractor installing fiber in Durham, North Carolina. We are deeply saddened by the loss of this dedicated employee. Our thoughts and prayers continue to go out to all who are impacted, including the family of the store owner, who also perished in the incident. 
Turning to business updates. We provided a competitive update at our recent Investor Day meetings, so my remarks are brief. 
First, a reminder that safety is our core value. It is at the heart of our corporate culture, and we will continue to improve until we achieve the only acceptable safety statistic, 0 injuries. 
Turning now to Slide 8. As highlighted at our Investor Day, we operate premium state-regulated utilities that are centered on 5 key states, which account for 65% to 70% Dominion Energy's operating income. 
During the first quarter, we saw continued development of positive utility fundamentals across each jurisdiction. 
In Virginia, we set a company record for new data center connects and had the most total new customer connections in the first quarter since 2012. 
In South Carolina, a quarter-over-quarter customer growth was 1.7% for electric operations, which is the highest quarterly growth rate since 2008. 
Gas customer growth was 3.1%, which is in line with prerecession levels of growth. 
Gas distribution utilities in Utah and North Carolina reported strong customer growth of around 2.5% each. And in Ohio, we saw 1.3% growth in throughput levels driven in part by the lowest unemployment rate in Ohio in the last 18 years. The summary metric highlights -- the summary metrics highlight opportunities we have for capital and regulated programs that allows to provide best-in-class customer service across our regulated footprint. 
I will now review recent developments across the company. Last month, Virginia State Corporation Commission approve Rider recovery under U.S. 3 application, which represents 240 megawatts costs-of-service sold with $410 million capital investment through 2020. 
We also announced our partnership with Facebook that includes 6 solar projects, totaling 350 megawatts and approximately $600 million of investment, also through 2020. 
In coming weeks, we will begin construction on the $300 million Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project, which was approved by the commission last November. These developments support the commitment we have made to have 3,000 megawatts solar or Wind Resource and Operation or underdevelopment in the state of Virginia by 2022. 
On April 9, we celebrated the 1-year anniversary for commercial service of the Cove Point Liquefaction facility. 
In its first year, the plant liquefied over 200 billion cubic feet of natural gas and met over 90% of customer nominations. That success rate improved to 100% during the first quarter of this year. 
In addition to an extra quarter of operation, Cove Point's record of sustained strong operational performance will contribute to our 2019 financial results, relative to last year. 
With regard to Millstone, 2 weeks ago, we hosted Governor Lujan and his team at the plant to celebrate 10-year agreement signed on March 15 to provide critical zero-carbon power to the state and region. 
We expect regulatory approval of the agreement later this year and the contract to become effective shortly thereafter. 
We will resume the prices to provide hedging information for Millstone once the contract is approved and effective. 
We are entering our fifth month of integrating the Southeast Energy Group. Our team members are working diligently across geographies to socialize best practices and introduce common systems where needed. While these integrations are major undertakings, we are advantaged by a lessons learned from our Questar integration. 
We remain focused on ensuring that throughout the process, we provide safe and reliable customer experience. 
Turning now to Slide 10. At our investor meeting in March, we announced that we are permanently retarding several generating units, most of which are been placed in the cold reserve. 
Many of these units were designed to consume coal, and this step will help us achieve our originally updated company-wide admission targets shown here. Revenue targets include a 55% and 80% reduction in gross carbon emissions from our electric generation fleet by 2030 and 2050, respectively. We also have an ambitious methane reduction goal that calls for a 50% reduction in gross omissions from gas infrastructure business by 2030. 
These represent meaningful progress beyond our company's already impressive achievements over the last decade. On a related note, we're pleased that earlier this week, the FTC approved all 11 of our proposed demand-side mansion programs, targeting the Grid Transformation & Security Act support for those programs. 
As a reminder, these programs costs, including a margin, are recoverable. Additional ESG information is included in the appendix for your review. 
And file, with regard to Atlantic Coast Pipeline supplier. As shown on Slide 11, an appeals Supreme Court with regard to Appalachian trail crossing will be filed before the end of the second quarter. We believe that solicitor General of the United States will join that appeal. We continue to pursue legislative and administrative functions as well. 
[ 4 ] arguments on the biological pending case are scheduled for next week with a decision expected within 90 days. 
We expect to recommence construction on the project in the third quarter. 
There has not been any change to expect the timeline or costs since our last earnings call or Investor Day meeting. 
In summary, we achieved whether-normalized operating earnings per share above the midpoint of our guidance range. 
We are affirming our full year operating earnings per share guidance. 
We continue to see strong growth fundamentals in our state-regulated utility footprints. We continue to make progress across our capital investment programs to the benefit our customers. And we have a strong environmental social and governance story, and we will continue to increase our engagement with customers, shareholders and other stakeholders on those topics. With that, we would be happy to answer your questions."

That's why the policymakers in North Carolina ask for additional gas infrastructure to be built in the North Carolina that is not Transco. It's in addition to Transco's lines. We have full confidence in the biological opinion case. The 4 service follow the guidelines that were given to them by the court and completed that the reissuing of the Biological opinion. And so we'll see what happens, but we believe will be under construction third quarter. Diane, you can answer additional points on the timing."

We do report in providing more update in the second quarter, in particular as it relates to our Voluntary Retirement Program, which we announced at our Investor Day on March 25. But they're really 2 parts of this. One is a continuation that what we've been talking about since the last call, which is flat O&M initiative, and which is across our business segments. And that really relates to a large number of small improvements across, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, every segment, every location, every asset. 
Leaning in on technology opportunities, finding better business processes, et cetera. That flat O&M is on a normalized basis. And by that, I mean, that some of the savings will fall to the bottom line and some of that, in particular as it relates to the Rider O&M, for example, accretes to that of the customer. But we do expect slide oh and I'm to be a driver for the foreseeable future on the bottom line basis for our earnings per share of growth. 
For the Voluntary Retirement plan, there was a lot of moving parts there. As I mentioned, we had a robust response from our employees the option we provided them. 
I mentioned at the Analyst Day that in the last iteration of this kind of program at Dominion, which is long ago, 2010, we had a roughly 10% acceptance rate from all of our employees. 
So what we've done this time, we've offered the same type of program to union and nonunion employees where they have the ability to retire and receive their accrued retirement benefits whatever if they may be, in addition to severance, which is in line with policy, which could be, in various cases, up to 12 months of severance. 
So the way that will work is the severance payment will likely be treated as a onetime item but the resulting savings in lower O&M cost from the CRP will began to be recognized in our operating earnings, starting soon after the second quarter."

We committed to the Governor lasted to develop 3,000 megawatts to have that either in-service or development by 2022. The Grid Transformation & Security Act also calls on us to purchase 25% of that amount from third parties. So the way we think about it, 75% of the 3,000 megawatts that we've committed will be Dominion Energy owned. Now that will be a combination of the rate base solar like U.S. 3 that was just approved by the commission, and it will include bilateral agreements with customers, such as Facebook or others. 
So it will be a combination of those 2. I would expect that you would see somewhere around the order of 250 to 500 megawatts for the year for it to develop, and that will allow us to achieve our commitment to the Governor."

Let me address that and will more generally to the script into our expected earnings through the year. We do expect positive impacts again we haven't baked the numbers yet on the VMT but some positive impact this year to our operating earnings from our O&M initiatives, including our voluntary retirement program. The pension headwind was really something we highlighted short term change between EI versus the year with that, modest impact which was about $0.04 change change based on market activity in that short time period. That has been baked into our expectations for the year and is unchanged. Those pictures option for drive the accounting are revisited as you know basically every December 31. So no change before the clock turns and of this year. While Amy gave a little more guidance on little more granular detail on the sculpting of our earnings for the year. And I gave Greg somewhat pork response that we still target and expect the midpoint of our range for the year. But admittedly, our earnings profile is back and dated and that's not something new to us I know we've just released our second quarter earnings guidance this morning but this is as we expected other than the impact of the $0.06 of the weather headwind in the first quarter. We just off to that little more than you have but Q1 $1.10, the midpoint of our Q2 guidance range [ $0.70 to $0.80 ] is [ $0.75 so a $1.85 ] adding impacts of whether you get to $1.91. So comparing it to last year $1.91 is $0.09 less to $2 which is where we were the first 2 quarters of last year. So clearly, there earnings growth for the year even aside from the weather headwind is in the second half and are few reasons that your actually there a number of reasons for that this year. One is the timing of the no stone outage which are still within 3Q, this year is in 2Q, that's one thing that pushed up our second half contribution this year versus last year there is a full year of Cove Point contribution at run rate production levels, which means without some of the ramp and cost that last year we had budgeted, and experience, in the last 3 quarters, there's some improvement that this year versus last not only the first quarter. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, that's growth in regulated investment across electric and gas utilities through the year, which agrees there some timing of ITC and farmers to the year this year versus last. And then last thing is where there's more to come and will provide some more guidance on the second quarter call is what you mentioned the operating expense initiatives the continuation of flat O&M but also the impacts to operating earnings of our voluntary retirement program. So overall we are on track but certainly, heavier in the second half of this year versus the first half and particular as compared to 2018."

Dominion Energy reported first quarter 2019 operating earnings of $1.10 per share compared to our guidance range of $1.05 to $1.25 per share. Otherwise, strong performance across our businesses was impacted by unusually mild weather in Virginia and South Carolina, which reduced utility earnings by about $0.06 per share. As a general indicator, heating degree days were 5% and 19% below normal in Virginia and South Carolina, respectively. Various initiatives, primarily in power delivery and power generation, were successful in offsetting some of this headwind and when adjusted for utility, weather, of $0.06, operating earnings for the quarter were $1.16 per share, which is above the midpoint of our guidance range. 
Operating segment performance for the first quarter is shown on Slide 4. GAAP earnings for the quarter are negative $0.86 per share, which were driven primarily by the expected charges related to SCANA merger commitments and the early retirement of certain cold reserve Virginia utility-generating units. 
Slide 5 highlights the pretax drivers of adjustments to reported earnings. A reconciliation of operating earnings to reported earnings can be found on schedule 2 of the earnings release kit. 
On March 25, we held 2 sessions for investors that provided updates on capital investment, earnings and dividend growth outlook, financing plans, expense control initiatives as well as the first-of-its-kind sustainability and ESG-focused sessions, highlights of which are shown on Slide 6. It is worth noting that we continue to have full confidence in the earnings growth and other targets we've highlighted during those meetings. We are very happy with the in-person and online attendance and thank all of those who were able to participate and provided feedback following the event. Please note that the meeting materials, including the webcast replay, continue to be available on our website, which we encourage all to review thoroughly. 
Also during this quarter, we continue to be engaged across a number of important though less public initiatives as follows. First, as announced at our Investor Day, we are preparing to restructure our reporting segments, a meaningful change to the way we manage our businesses and report their financial performance. We continue to forecast that this transition will take until late 2019 to complete. The Alternate Breakdown Structure, or ABS, provides a preliminary view of our future intended reporting segment results and will be posted shortly after this call to our Investor Relations website. The ABS, which is not reflective of how we currently manage our business, is not intended to replace Dominion Energy's current operating segment disclosures. 
Second, progress is being made on our flat O&M and voluntary retirement program initiatives discussed at the end of March. We're very intentionally combing through each of our segments, all of our assets in every location to identify opportunities to embrace technology, increase efficiency, improve business processes and enhance the customer experience. Results of the voluntary retirement program discussed at our Investor Day including response rates from eligible employees, an assessment of backfill needs and financial impacts are still being quantified, although I would note that preliminary response rate was robust. We expect to be able to quantify these results on the next quarter's call. 
Moving now to operating earnings guidance on Slide 7. As usual, our operating earnings guidance ranges assume normal weather, variations from which could cause results to be towards the top or the bottom of these guidance ranges. 
For the second quarter, we are initiating guidance of $0.70 to $0.80 per share. Positive factors as compared to last year include growth from regulated investment across electric and gas utility programs as well as a contribution from the Southeast Energy Group. Negative factors as compared to last year include Millstone refueling outage timing, the impact of 2018 asset sales, share issuances and a return to normal weather. We're also affirming our expectation for full year 2019 operating earnings per share between $4.05 and $4.40. 
Positive 2019 full year drivers relative to last year include the growth from regulated investment across electric and gas utility programs, contribution from the Southeast Energy Group, a full year of Cove Point Liquefaction operations at run-rate production levels and expense control initiatives. Negative drivers relative to last year are expected to include the impact of the 2018 noncore assets sales, share issuances and a return to normal weather. 
Finally, we also reiterate our long-term EPS growth expectations of approximately 5% per year through 2020 and 5% plus thereafter. I'll now turn the call over to Tom."

On April 10, we were tragically reminded of the everyday risks our colleagues face when a fellow employee was fatally injured as a result of a gas line rupture caused by an unrelated third-party contractor installing fiber in Durham, North Carolina. We are deeply saddened by the loss of this dedicated employee. Our thoughts and prayers continue to go out to all who were impacted, including the family of the store owner, who also perished in the incident. 
Turning to business updates. We've provided a comprehensive update at our recent Investor Day meetings, so my remarks are brief. 
First, a reminder that safety is our core value. It is at the heart of our corporate culture, and we will continue to improve until we achieve the only acceptable safety statistic: 0 injuries. 
Turning now to Slide 8. As highlighted at our Investor Day, we operate premium state-regulated utilities that sit around 5 key states, which account for 65% to 70% Dominion Energy's projected operating income. 
During the first quarter, we saw a continued development of positive utility fundamentals across each jurisdiction. In Virginia, we set a company record for new data center connects and had the most total new customer connections in the first quarter since 2012. 
In South Carolina, our quarter-over-quarter customer growth was 1.7% for electric operations, which is the highest quarterly growth rate since 2008. Gas customer growth was 3.1%, which is in line with prerecession levels of growth. 
Gas distribution utilities in Utah and North Carolina reported strong customer growth of around 2.5% each. And in Ohio, we saw 1.3% growth in throughput levels driven in part by the lowest unemployment rate in Ohio in the last 18 years. These summary metric highlights -- the summary metrics highlight opportunities we have for capital in regulated programs that allow us to provide best-in-class customer service across our regulated footprint. 
I will now review recent developments across the company. Last month, the Virginia State Corporation Commission approved rider recovery under US-3 application, which represents 240 megawatts cost of service sold with a $410 million capital investment through 2020. 
We also announced a partnership with Facebook that includes 6 solar projects totaling 350 megawatts and approximately $600 million of investment also through 2020. In coming weeks, we will begin construction on the $300 million Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project, which was approved by the Commission last November. These developments support the commitment we have made to have 3,000 megawatts solar or wind resource in operation or under development in the state of Virginia by 2022. 
On April 9, we celebrated the 1-year anniversary for commercial service of the Cove Point Liquefaction facility. In its first year, the plant liquefied over 200 billion cubic feet of natural gas and met over 90% of customer nominations. That success rate improved to 100% during the first quarter of this year. In addition to an extra quarter of operation, Cove Point's record of sustained strong operational performance will contribute to our 2019 financial results relative to last year. 
With regard to Millstone, 2 weeks ago, we hosted Governor Lamont and his team at the plant to celebrate the 10-year agreement signed on March 15 to provide critical 0-carbon power to the state and region. We expect regulatory approval of the agreement later this year and the contract to become effective shortly thereafter. We will resume the practice of providing hedging information for Millstone once the contract is approved and effective. 
We are entering our fifth month of integrating the Southeast Energy Group. Our team members are working diligently across geographies to socialize best practices and introduce common systems where needed. While these integrations are major undertakings, we are advantaged by lessons learned from our Questar integration. We remain focused on ensuring that throughout the process, we provide a safe and reliable customer experience. 
Turning now to Slide 10. At our investor meeting in March, we announced that we are permanently retiring several generating units, most of which have been placed into cold reserve. Many of these units were designed to consume coal, and this step will help us achieve our recently updated company-wide emissions targets shown here. 
Our new targets include a 55% and 80% reduction in gross carbon emissions from our electric generation fleet by 2030 and 2050, respectively. We also have an ambitious methane reduction goal that calls for a 50% reduction in gross emissions from our gas infrastructure business by 2030. These represent meaningful progress beyond our company's already impressive achievements over the last decade. 
On a related note, we're pleased that earlier this week, the SCC approved all 11 of our proposed demand-side management programs, citing the Grid Transformation & Security Act support for those programs. As a reminder, these program costs, including a margin, are recoverable. Additional ESG information is included in the appendix for your review. 
And finally, with regard to Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Supply Header. As shown on Slide 11, an appeal to the Supreme Court with regard to the Appalachian Trail crossing will be filed before the end of the second quarter. We believe that the Solicitor General of the United States will join that appeal. We continue to pursue legislative and administrative options as well. 
Oral arguments on the biological opinion case are scheduled for next week with a decision expected within 90 days. We expect to recommence construction on the project in the third quarter. There has not been any change to expect the time line or costs since our last earnings call or Investor Day meeting. 
In summary, we achieved weather-normalized operating earnings per share above the midpoint of our guidance range. We are affirming our full year operating earnings per share guidance.  
We continue to see strong growth fundamentals in our state-regulated utility footprints. We continue to make progress across our capital investment programs to the benefit our customers, and we have a strong environmental social and governance story. And we will continue to increase our engagement with customers, shareholders and other stakeholders on those topics. With that, we will be happy to answer your questions."

The Transco backhaul solution is not a solution, does not meet our customers' needs on any kind of long-term basis. Our customers need infrastructure from a different supply basin. For example, the state of North Carolina has exactly one pipeline that serves the entire state, Transco. That's why the policy-makers in North Carolina ask for additional gas infrastructure to be built into North Carolina that is not Transco. It's in addition to Transco's lines. 
We have full confidence in the biological opinion case. The Forest Service follow the guidelines that were given to them by the court and completed that, reissuing of the biological opinion. And so we'll see what happens, but we believe we'll be under construction in the third quarter. Diane, you can answer additional points on the timing."

We do look forward to providing more update on the second quarter in particular as it relates to our voluntary retirement program, which we announced at our Investor Day on March 25. But there really are 2 parts of this. One is a continuation that what we've been talking about since the last call, which is a flat O&M initiative and which is across our business segments. And that really relates to a large number of small improvements across, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, every segment, every location, every asset: leaning in on technology opportunities, finding better business processes, et cetera. That flat O&M is on a normalized basis. And by that, I mean that some of the savings will fall to the bottom line. And some of that, in particular as it relates to the rider O&M for example, accretes to the benefit of the customer. But we do expect flat O&M to be a driver for the foreseeable future on a bottom line basis for our earnings per share growth. 
For the voluntary retirement plan, there are a lot of moving parts there. As I mentioned, we had a robust response from our employees to the option we provided them. I mentioned at Analyst Day that in the last iteration of this kind of program at Dominion, which was long ago, 2010, we had roughly a 10% acceptance rate from all of our employees. 
So what we've done this time is we've offered the same type of program to union and nonunion employees where they have the ability to retire and receive their accrued retirement benefits whatever they may be in addition to severance, which is in line with policy, which could be, in various cases, up to 12 months of severance. So the way that will work is the severance payment will likely be treated as a onetime item, but the resulting savings in lower O&M cost from the VRP will begin to be recognized in our operating earnings starting soon after the second quarter."

Yes, there's no material change to our plans for our financing for the year. As we mentioned on our fourth quarter call, we do plan to replace the maturing -- converting existing $1.4 billion mandatory convert that we'll issue in 2016. Those plans are on track for the year, and we're going to be opportunistic based on market conditions kind of through the summer period. Based on that, knowing the exact timing of that but also the exact size, what we've said is around the size of the one that's converting which is $1.4 billion which is still is our expectation, again, depending on market conditions. 
On Cove, we have lots of time there. So as you know, late last year, we put in place $3 billion of basically pre-vanilla nonrecourse bank debt. So the cost of that is attractive. It's below 4% right now. It's nonamortizing. It's prepayable at any time, and there are 2.5 years roughly left on the tenor. So we have lots of options on how to refinance that, but we also have lots of time. So no specific guidance on that activity but plenty of flexibility based on what we did late last year."

Let me address that and then more generally, the sculpting of our expected earnings through the year.

Let me address that and then more generally, the sculpting of our expected earnings through the year. We do expect positive impacts -- again, we haven't baked the numbers yet on the VRP element but some positive impact this year to our operating earnings from our O&M initiatives including our voluntary retirement program. 
The pension headwind was really something we highlighted as a short-term change between basically EEI [ and first of the year ]. But that modest impact which was about $0.04 change based on market activity in that short time period, that has been baked into our expectations for the year and is unchanged. Those pension assumptions that drive the accounting are revisited, as you know, basically every December 31. So no change before the clock turns at the end of this year. 
But let me give a little more guidance on -- a little more granular detail on the sculpting of our earnings through the year, and I gave Greg a somewhat curt response that we do still target and expect the midpoint of our range for the year. But admittedly, our earnings profile is back-end dated. And that's not something new to us. 
I know we've just released our second quarter earnings guidance this morning, but this is as we expected other than the impact of the $0.06 of the weather headwind in the first quarter. So just to walk you through that, it's a little more than you asked. But Q1, $1.10. The midpoint of our Q2 guidance range, $0.70 to $0.80, is $0.75, so $1.85. Add in $0.06 of weather, you get to $1.91. So comparing it to last year, $1.91 is $0.09 less than $2, which is where we were during the first 2 quarters of last year. 
So clearly, the earnings growth for the year even aside from the weather headwind is in the second half, and there are few reasons for that. Actually, there a number of reasons for that this year. One is the timing of the Millstone outage which last year was in 3Q. This year's in 2Q. That's one thing that kind of pushes up our second half contribution this year versus last. There's a full year of Cove Point contribution at run rate production levels, which means without some of the ramp-up costs that last year we had budgeted and experienced in the last 3 quarters. There's still some improvement that this year versus last, not only the first quarter. 
As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, there's growth in regulated investment across electric and gas utilities through the year, which accretes. There some timing of ITC and farm-outs to the year, this year versus last. And then last thing is if we're -- there's more to come, then we'll provide some more guidance on the second quarter call as what you mentioned, the operating expense initiatives: the continuation of flat O&M but also the impact to operating earnings of our voluntary retirement program. So overall, we're on track but certainly, heavier in the second half of this year versus the first half in particular as compared to 2018."

Dominion Energy reported first quarter 2019 operating earnings of $1.10 per share compared to our guidance range of $1.05 to $1.25 per share. Otherwise strong performance across our businesses was impacted by unusually mild weather in Virginia and South Carolina, which reduced utility earnings by about $0.06 per share. As a general indicator, heating degree days were 5% and 19% below normal in Virginia and South Carolina, respectively. Various initiatives, primarily in Power Delivery and Power Generation, were successful in offsetting some of this headwind, and when adjusted for utility weather of $0.06, operating earnings for the quarter were $1.16 per share, which is above the midpoint of our guidance range. 
Operating segment performance for the first quarter is shown on Slide 4. GAAP earnings for the quarter are negative $0.86 per share, which were driven primarily by the expected charges related to SCANA merger commitments and the early retirement of certain cold reserve Virginia utility-generating units. 
Slide 5 highlights the pretax drivers of adjustments to reported earnings. A reconciliation of operating earnings to reported earnings can be found on Schedule 2 of the earnings release kit. 
On March 25, we held 2 sessions for investors that provided updates on capital investment, earnings and dividend growth outlook, financing plans, expense control initiatives as well as a first-of-its-kind sustainability and ESG-focused session, highlights of which are shown on Slide 6. It is worth noting that we continue to have full confidence in the earnings growth and other targets we've highlighted during those meetings. We are very happy with the in-person and online attendance and thank all of those who were able to participate and provided feedback following the event. Please note that the meeting materials, including the webcast replay, continue to be available on our website, which we encourage all to review thoroughly. 
Also during this quarter, we continue to be engaged across a number of important though less public initiatives as follows. First, as announced at our Investor Day, we are preparing to restructure our reporting segments, a meaningful change to the way we manage our businesses and report their financial performance. We continue to forecast that this transition will take until late 2019 to complete. The Alternate Breakdown Structure, or ABS, provides a preliminary view of our future intended reporting segment results and will be posted shortly after this call to our Investor Relations website. The ABS, which is not reflective of how we currently manage our business, is not intended to replace Dominion Energy's current operating segment disclosures. 
Second, progress is being made on our flat O&M and voluntary retirement program initiatives discussed at the end of March. We're very intentionally combing through each of our segments, all of our assets and every location to identify opportunities to embrace technology, increase efficiency, improve business processes and enhance the customer experience. Results of the voluntary retirement program discussed at our Investor Day, including response rates from eligible employees, an assessment of backfill needs and financial impacts, are still being quantified, although I would note that the preliminary response rate was robust. We expect to be able to quantify these results on the next quarter's call. 
Moving now to operating earnings guidance on Slide 7. As usual, our operating earnings guidance ranges assume normal weather, variations from which could cause results to be towards the top or the bottom of these guidance ranges. 
For the second quarter, we are initiating guidance of $0.70 to $0.80 per share. Positive factors as compared to last year include growth from regulated investment across electric and gas utility programs as well as a contribution from the Southeast Energy Group. Negative factors as compared to last year include Millstone refueling outage timing, the impact of 2018 asset sales, share issuances and a return to normal weather. We're also affirming our expectation for full year 2019 operating earnings per share between $4.05 and $4.40. 
Positive 2019 full year drivers relative to last year include the growth from regulated investment across electric and gas utility programs, contribution from the Southeast Energy Group, a full year of Cove Point Liquefaction operations at run-rate production levels and expense control initiatives. Negative drivers relative to last year are expected to include the impact of the 2018 noncore asset sales, share issuances and a return to normal weather. 
Finally, we also reiterate our long-term EPS growth expectations of approximately 5% per year through 2020 and 5% plus thereafter. I'll now turn the call over to Tom."

On April 10, we were tragically reminded of the everyday risks our colleagues face when a fellow employee was fatally injured as a result of a gas line rupture caused by an unrelated third-party contractor installing fiber in Durham, North Carolina. We are deeply saddened by the loss of this dedicated employee. Our thoughts and prayers continue to go out to all who were impacted, including the family of the store owner, who also perished in the incident. 
Turning to business updates. We've provided a comprehensive update at our recent Investor Day meetings, so my remarks are brief. 
First, a reminder that safety is our core value. It is at the heart of our corporate culture, and we will continue to improve until we achieve the only acceptable safety statistic: 0 injuries. 
Turning now to Slide 8. As highlighted at our Investor Day, we operate premium state-regulated utilities that center around 5 key states, which account for 65% to 70% of Dominion Energy's projected operating income. 
During the first quarter, we saw a continued development of positive utility fundamentals across each jurisdiction. In Virginia, we set a company record for new data center connects and had the most total new customer connections in the first quarter since 2012. 
In South Carolina, our quarter-over-quarter customer growth was 1.7% for electric operations, which is the highest quarterly growth rate since 2008. Gas customer growth was 3.1%, which is in line with prerecession levels of growth. 
Gas distribution utilities in Utah and North Carolina reported strong customer growth of around 2.5% each. And in Ohio, we saw 1.3% growth in throughput levels driven in part by the lowest unemployment rate in Ohio in the last 18 years. These summary metric highlights -- these summary metrics highlight the opportunities we have to deploy capital in regulated programs that allow us to provide best-in-class customer service across our regulated footprint. 
I will now review recent developments across the company. Last month, the Virginia State Corporation Commission approved rider recovery under US-3 application, which represents 240 megawatts of cost-of-service solar with a $410 million capital investment through 2020. 
We also announced a partnership with Facebook that includes 6 solar projects totaling 350 megawatts and approximately $600 million of investment also through 2020. In coming weeks, we will begin construction on the $300 million Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project, which was approved by the Commission last November. These developments support the commitment we have made to have 3,000 megawatts of solar or wind resource in operation or under development in the state of Virginia by 2022. 
On April 9, we celebrated the 1-year anniversary for commercial service of the Cove Point Liquefaction facility. In its first year, the plant liquefied over 200 billion cubic feet of natural gas and met over 90% of customer nominations. That success rate improved to 100% during the first quarter of this year. In addition to an extra quarter of operation, Cove Point's record of sustained strong operational performance will contribute to our 2019 financial results relative to last year. 
With regard to Millstone, 2 weeks ago, we hosted Governor Lamont and his team at the plant to celebrate the 10-year agreement signed on March 15 to provide critical 0-carbon power to the state and region. We expect regulatory approval of the agreement later this year and the contract to become effective shortly thereafter. We will resume the practice of providing hedging information for Millstone once the contract is approved and effective. 
We are entering our fifth month of integrating the Southeast Energy Group. Our team members are working diligently across geographies to socialize best practices and introduce common systems where needed. While these integrations are major undertakings, we are advantaged by lessons learned from our Questar integration. We remain focused on ensuring that throughout the process, we provide a safe and reliable customer experience. 
Turning now to Slide 10. At our investor meeting in March, we announced that we are permanently retiring several generating units, most of which have been placed into cold reserve. Many of these units were designed to consume coal, and this step will help us achieve our recently updated company-wide emissions targets shown here. 
Our new targets include a 55% and 80% reduction in gross carbon emissions from our electric generation fleet by 2030 and 2050, respectively. We also have an ambitious methane reduction goal that calls for a 50% reduction in gross emissions from our gas infrastructure business by 2030. These represent meaningful progress beyond our company's already impressive achievements over the last decade. 
On a related note, we're pleased that earlier this week, the SCC approved all 11 of our proposed demand-side management programs, citing the Grid Transformation & Security Act support for those programs. As a reminder, these program's costs, including a margin, are recoverable. Additional ESG information is included in the appendix for your review. 
And finally, with regard to Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Supply Header. As shown on Slide 11, an appeal to the Supreme Court with regard to the Appalachian Trail crossing will be filed before the end of the second quarter. We believe that the Solicitor General of the United States will join that appeal. We continue to pursue legislative and administrative options as well. 
Oral arguments on the biological opinion case are scheduled for next week, with a decision expected within 90 days. We expect to recommence construction on the project in the third quarter. There has not been any change to expected time line or costs since our last earnings call or Investor Day meeting. 
In summary, we achieved weather-normalized operating earnings per share above the midpoint of our guidance range. We are affirming our full year operating earnings per share guidance.  
We continue to see strong growth fundamentals in our state-regulated utility footprints. We continue to make progress across our capital investment programs to the benefit of our customers. We have a strong environmental social and governance story, and we will continue to increase our engagement with customers, shareholders and other stakeholders on those topics. With that, we will be happy to answer your questions."

That's why the policy-makers in North Carolina asked for additional gas infrastructure to be built into North Carolina that is not Transco. It's in addition to Transco's lines. 
We have full confidence in the biological opinion case. The Forest Service follow the guidelines that were given to them by the court and completed that reissuing of the biological opinion. And so we'll see what happens, but we believe we'll be under construction in the third quarter. Diane, you can answer additional points on the timing."

We do look forward to providing more update on the second quarter, in particular as it relates to our voluntary retirement program, which we announced at our Investor Day on March 25. But there really are 2 parts of this. One is a continuation of what we've been talking about since the last call, which is a flat O&M initiative and which is across our business segments. And that really relates to a large number of small improvements across, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, every segment, every location, every asset: leaning in on technology opportunities, finding better business processes, et cetera. That flat O&M is on a normalized basis. And by that, I mean that some of the savings will fall to the bottom line. And some of that, in particular as it relates to rider O&M, for example, accretes to the benefit of the customer. But we do expect flat O&M to be a driver for the foreseeable future on a bottom line basis for our earnings per share growth. 
For the voluntary retirement plan, there are a lot of moving parts there. As I mentioned, we had a robust response from our employees to the option we provided them. I mentioned at Analyst Day that in the last iteration of this kind of program at Dominion, which was long ago, 2010, we had roughly a 10% acceptance rate from all of our employees. 
So what we've done this time is we've offered the same type of program to union and nonunion employees, where they have the ability to retire and receive their accrued retirement benefits, whatever they may be, in addition to severance which is in line with policy, which could be, in various cases, up to 12 months of severance. So the way that will work is the severance payment will likely be treated as a onetime item, but the resulting savings in lower O&M cost from the VRP will begin to be recognized in our operating earnings starting soon after the second quarter."

Our 27 million metric tons is small compared to Duke and small compared to others. So we believe that we have a good solution for the local communities. It's something that is supported by the legislation and supported by the executive branch. So we look forward to getting that work started as soon as the bill takes effect on July 1.

Yes, there's no material change to our plans for our financing for the year.

What we've said is around the size of the one that's converting which is $1.4 billion, which is still is our expectation, again, depending on market conditions. 
On Cove, we have lots of time there. So as you know, late last year, we put in place $3 billion of basically pretty vanilla nonrecourse bank debt. So the cost of that is attractive. It's below 4% right now. It's nonamortizing. It's prepayable at any time, and there are 2.5 years roughly left on the tenor.

Let me address that and then more generally, the sculpting of our expected earnings through the year. We do expect some positive impacts -- again, we haven't baked the numbers yet on the VRP element,, but some positive impact this year to our operating earnings from our O&M initiatives, including our voluntary retirement program. 
The pension headwind was really something we highlighted as a short-term change between basically [ EEI ] and the first of the year. But that modest impact, which was about $0.04 change based on market activity in that short time period, that has been baked into our expectations for the year and is unchanged. Those pension assumptions that drive the accounting are revisited, as you know, basically every December 31. So no change before the clock turns at the end of this year. 
But let me give a little more guidance on -- a little more granular detail on the sculpting of our earnings through the year, and I gave Greg a somewhat [ curt ] response that we do still target and expect the midpoint of our range for the year. But admittedly, our earnings profile is back-end dated. And that's not something new to us. 
I know we've just released our second quarter earnings guidance this morning, but this is as we expected other than the impact of the $0.06 of the weather headwind in the first quarter. So just to walk you through that, it's a little more than you asked. But Q1, $1.10. The midpoint of our Q2 guidance range, $0.70 to $0.80, is $0.75, so $1.85. Add in $0.06 of weather, you get to $1.91. So comparing it to last year, $1.91 is $0.09 less than $2, which is where we were during the first 2 quarters of last year. 
So clearly, the earnings growth for this year, even aside from the weather headwind, is in the second half, and there are a few reasons for that. Actually, there a number of reasons for that this year. One is the timing of the Millstone outage, which last year was in 3Q, this year's in 2Q. That's one thing that kind of pushes up our second half contribution this year versus last. There's a full year of Cove Point contribution at run-rate production levels, which means without some of the ramp-up costs that last year we had budgeted and experienced in the last 3 quarters. There's still some improvement that this year versus last, not only the first quarter. 
As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, there's growth in regulated investment across electric and gas utilities through the year, which accretes. There some timing of ITC and farm-outs through the year, this year versus last. And then last thing is -- there's more to come, and we'll provide some more guidance on the second quarter call, is what you mentioned, the operating expense initiatives: the continuation of flat O&M but also the impact to operating earnings of our voluntary retirement program. So overall, we're on track, but certainly heavier in the second half of this year versus the first half, in particular as compared to 2018."

Dominion Energy reported first quarter 2019 operating earnings of $1.10 per share compared to our guidance range of $1.05 to $1.25 per share.

Dominion Energy reported first quarter 2019 operating earnings of $1.10 per share compared to our guidance range of $1.05 to $1.25 per share. Otherwise strong performance across our businesses was impacted by unusually mild weather in Virginia and South Carolina, which reduced utility earnings by about $0.06 per share. As a general indicator, heating degree days were 5% and 19% below normal in Virginia and South Carolina, respectively. Various initiatives, primarily in Power Delivery and Power Generation, were successful in offsetting some of this headwind, and when adjusted for utility weather of $0.06, operating earnings for the quarter were $1.16 per share, which is above the midpoint of our guidance range. 
Operating segment performance for the first quarter is shown on Slide 4. GAAP earnings for the quarter are negative $0.86 per share, which were driven primarily by the expected charges related to SCANA merger commitments and the early retirement of certain cold reserve Virginia utility-generating units. 
Slide 5 highlights the pretax drivers of adjustments to reported earnings. A reconciliation of operating earnings to reported earnings can be found on Schedule 2 of the earnings release kit. 
On March 25, we held 2 sessions for investors that provided updates on capital investment, earnings and dividend growth outlook, financing plans, expense control initiatives as well as a first-of-its-kind sustainability and ESG-focused session, highlights of which are shown on Slide 6. It is worth noting that we continue to have full confidence in the earnings growth and other targets we've highlighted during those meetings. We are very happy with the in-person and online attendance and thank all of those who were able to participate and provided feedback following the event. Please note that the meeting materials, including the webcast replay, continue to be available on our website, which we encourage all to review thoroughly. 
Also during this quarter, we continue to be engaged across a number of important though less public initiatives as follows. First, as announced at our Investor Day, we are preparing to restructure our reporting segments, a meaningful change to the way we manage our businesses and report their financial performance. We continue to forecast that this transition will take until late 2019 to complete. The Alternate Breakdown Structure, or ABS, provides a preliminary view of our future intended reporting segment results and will be posted shortly after this call to our Investor Relations website. The ABS, which is not reflective of how we currently manage our business, is not intended to replace Dominion Energy's current operating segment disclosures. 
Second, progress is being made on our flat O&M and voluntary retirement program initiatives discussed at the end of March. We're very intentionally combing through each of our segments, all of our assets and every location to identify opportunities to embrace technology, increase efficiency, improve business processes and enhance the customer experience. Results of the voluntary retirement program discussed at our Investor Day including response rates from eligible employees, an assessment of backfill needs and financial impacts are still being quantified, although I would note that the preliminary response rate was robust. We expect to be able to quantify these results on the next quarter's call. 
Moving now to operating earnings guidance on Slide 7. As usual, our operating earnings guidance ranges assume normal weather, variations from which could cause results to be towards the top or the bottom of these guidance ranges. 
For the second quarter, we are initiating guidance of $0.70 to $0.80 per share. Positive factors as compared to last year include growth from regulated investment across electric and gas utility programs as well as a contribution from the Southeast Energy Group. Negative factors as compared to last year include Millstone refueling outage timing, the impact of 2018 asset sales, share issuances and a return to normal weather. We're also affirming our expectation for full year 2019 operating earnings per share between $4.05 and $4.40. 
Positive 2019 full year drivers relative to last year include the growth from regulated investment across electric and gas utility programs, contribution from the Southeast Energy Group, a full year of Cove Point Liquefaction operations at run-rate production levels and expense control initiatives. Negative drivers relative to last year are expected to include the impact of the 2018 noncore asset sales, share issuances and a return to normal weather. 
Finally, we also reiterate our long-term EPS growth expectations of approximately 5% per year through 2020 and 5% plus thereafter. I'll now turn the call over to Tom."

On April 10, we were tragically reminded of the everyday risks our colleagues face when a fellow employee was fatally injured as a result of a gas line rupture caused by an unrelated third-party contractor installing fiber in Durham, North Carolina. We are deeply saddened by the loss of this dedicated employee. Our thoughts and prayers continue to go out to all who were impacted, including the family of the store owner, who also perished in the incident. 
Turning to business updates. We've provided a comprehensive update at our recent Investor Day meetings, so my remarks are brief. 
First, a reminder that safety is our core value. It is at the heart of our corporate culture, and we will continue to improve until we achieve the only acceptable safety statistic: 0 injuries. 
Turning now to Slide 8. As highlighted at our Investor Day, we operate premium state-regulated utilities that center around 5 key states, which account for 65% to 70% of Dominion Energy's projected operating income. 
During the first quarter, we saw a continued development of positive utility fundamentals across each jurisdiction. In Virginia, we set a company record for new data center connects and had the most total new customer connections in the first quarter since 2012. 
In South Carolina, our quarter-over-quarter customer growth was 1.7% for electric operations, which is the highest quarterly growth rate since 2008. Gas customer growth was 3.1%, which is in line with prerecession levels of growth. 
Gas distribution utilities in Utah and North Carolina reported strong customer growth of around 2.5% each. And in Ohio, we saw 1.3% growth in throughput levels driven in part by the lowest unemployment rate in Ohio in the last 18 years. These summary metric highlights -- these summary metrics highlight the opportunities we have to deploy capital in regulated programs that allow us to provide best-in-class customer service across our regulated footprint. 
I will now review recent developments across the company. Last month, the Virginia State Corporation Commission approved rider recovery under US-3 application, which represents 240 megawatts of cost-of-service solar with a $410 million capital investment through 2020. 
We also announced a partnership with Facebook that includes 6 solar projects totaling 350 megawatts and approximately $600 million of investment also through 2020. In coming weeks, we will begin construction on the $300 million Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project, which was approved by the Commission last November. These developments support the commitment we have made to have 3,000 megawatts of solar or wind resource in operation or under development in the state of Virginia by 2022. 
On April 9, we celebrated the 1-year anniversary for commercial service of the Cove Point Liquefaction facility. In its first year, the plant liquefied over 200 billion cubic feet of natural gas and met over 90% of customer nominations. That success rate improved to 100% during the first quarter of this year. In addition to an extra quarter of operation, Cove Point's record of sustained strong operational performance will contribute to our 2019 financial results relative to last year. 
With regard to Millstone, 2 weeks ago, we hosted Governor Lamont and his team at the plant to celebrate the 10-year agreement signed on March 15 to provide critical 0-carbon power to the state and region. We expect regulatory approval of the agreement later this year and the contract to become effective shortly thereafter. We will resume the practice of providing hedging information for Millstone once the contract is approved and effective. 
We are entering our fifth month of integrating the Southeast Energy Group. Our team members are working diligently across geographies to socialize best practices and introduce common systems where needed. While these integrations are major undertakings, we are advantaged by lessons learned from our Questar integration. We remain focused on ensuring that throughout the process, we provide a safe and reliable customer experience. 
Turning now to Slide 10. At our investor meeting in March, we announced that we are permanently retiring several generating units, most of which have been placed into cold reserve. Many of these units were designed to consume coal, and this step will help us achieve our recently updated company-wide emissions targets shown here. 
Our new targets include a 55% and 80% reduction in gross carbon emissions from our electric generation fleet by 2030 and 2050, respectively. We also have an ambitious methane reduction goal that calls for a 50% reduction in gross emissions from our gas infrastructure business by 2030. These represent meaningful progress beyond our company's already impressive achievements over the last decade. 
On a related note, we're pleased that earlier this week, the SCC approved all 11 of our proposed demand-side management programs, citing the Grid Transformation & Security Act support for those programs. As a reminder, these program's costs, including a margin, are recoverable. Additional ESG information is included in the appendix for your review. 
And finally, with regard to Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Supply Header. As shown on Slide 11, an appeal to the Supreme Court with regard to the Appalachian Trail crossing will be filed before the end of the second quarter. We believe that the Solicitor General of the United States will join that appeal. We continue to pursue legislative and administrative options as well. 
Oral arguments on the biological opinion case are scheduled for next week with a decision expected within 90 days. We expect to recommence construction on the project in the third quarter. There has not been any change to expected time line or costs since our last earnings call or Investor Day meeting. 
In summary, we achieved weather-normalized operating earnings per share above the midpoint of our guidance range. We are affirming our full year operating earnings per share guidance. 
We continue to see strong growth fundamentals in our state-regulated utility footprints. We continue to make progress across our capital investment programs to the benefit of our customers. We have a strong environmental social and governance story, and we will continue to increase our engagement with customers, shareholders and other stakeholders on those topics. With that, we will be happy to answer your questions."

The Transco backhaul solution is not a solution, does not meet our customers' needs on any kind of long-term basis. Our customers need infrastructure from a different supply basin. For example, the state of North Carolina has exactly one pipeline that serves the entire state, Transco. That's why the policy-makers in North Carolina asked for additional gas infrastructure to be built into North Carolina that is not Transco. It's in addition to Transco's lines. 
We have full confidence in the biological opinion case. The Forest Service follow the guidelines that were given to them by the court and completed that reissuing of the biological opinion. And so we'll see what happens, but we believe we'll be under construction in the third quarter. Diane, you can answer additional points on the timing."

We do look forward to providing more update on the second quarter, in particular as it relates to our voluntary retirement program, which we announced at our Investor Day on March 25. But there really are 2 parts of this. One is a continuation of what we've been talking about since the last call, which is a flat O&M initiative and which is across our business segments. And that really relates to a large number of small improvements across, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, every segment, every location, every asset: leaning in on technology opportunities, finding better business processes, et cetera. That flat O&M is on a normalized basis. And by that, I mean that some of the savings will fall to the bottom line. And some of that, in particular as it relates to rider O&M, for example, accretes to the benefit of the customer. But we do expect flat O&M to be a driver for the foreseeable future on a bottom line basis for our earnings per share growth. 
For the voluntary retirement plan, there are a lot of moving parts there. As I mentioned, we had a robust response from our employees to the option we provided them. I mentioned at Analyst Day that in the last iteration of this kind of program at Dominion, which was long ago, 2010, we had roughly a 10% acceptance rate from all of our employees. 
So what we've done this time is we've offered the same type of program to union and nonunion employees where they have the ability to retire and receive their accrued retirement benefits, whatever they may be, in addition to severance which is in line with policy, which could be, in various cases, up to 12 months of severance. So the way that will work is the severance payment will likely be treated as a onetime item, but the resulting savings in lower O&M cost from the VRP will begin to be recognized in our operating earnings starting soon after the second quarter."

Our 27 million metric tons is small compared to Duke and small compared to others. So we believe that we have a good solution for the local communities.

Yes, there's no material change to our plans for our financing for the year.

What we've said is around the size of the one that's converting which is $1.4 billion, which is still is our expectation, again, depending on market conditions. 
On Cove, we have lots of time there. So as you know, late last year, we put in place $3 billion of basically pretty vanilla nonrecourse bank debt. So the cost of that is attractive. It's below 4% right now. It's nonamortizing. It's prepayable at any time, and there are 2.5 years roughly left on the tenor. So we have lots of options on how to refinance that, but we also have lots of time. So no specific guidance on that activity but plenty of flexibility based on what we did late last year."

Let me address that and then more generally, the sculpting of our expected earnings through the year. We do expect some positive impacts -- again, we haven't baked the numbers yet on the VRP element but some positive",533,"Yes, let me address that. This is Jim. Let me address that and then more generally, the sculpting of our expected earnings through the year. We do expect some positive impacts -- again, we haven't baked the numbers yet on the VRP element but some positive impact this year to our operating earnings from our O&M initiatives including our voluntary retirement program. 
The pension headwind was really something we highlighted as a short-term change between basically [ EEI ] and the first of the year. But that modest impact which was about $0.04 change based on market activity in that short time period, that has been baked into our expectations for the year and is unchanged. Those pension assumptions that drive the accounting are revisited, as you know, basically every December 31. So no change before the clock turns at the end of this year. 
But let me give a little more guidance on -- a little more granular detail on the sculpting of our earnings through the year, and I gave Greg a somewhat [ curt ] response that we do still target and expect the midpoint of our range for the year. But admittedly, our earnings profile is back-end dated. And that's not something new to us. 
I know we've just released our second quarter earnings guidance this morning, but this is as we expected other than the impact of the $0.06 of the weather headwind in the first quarter. So just to walk you through that, it's a little more than you asked. But Q1, $1.10. The midpoint of our Q2 guidance range, $0.70 to $0.80, is $0.75, so $1.85. Add in $0.06 of weather, you get to $1.91. So comparing it to last year, $1.91 is $0.09 less than $2, which is where we were during the first 2 quarters of last year. 
So clearly, the earnings growth for this year, even aside from the weather headwind, is in the second half, and there are a few reasons for that. Actually, there a number of reasons for that this year. One is the timing of the Millstone outage, which last year was in 3Q, this year's in 2Q. That's one thing that kind of pushes up our second half contribution this year versus last. There's a full year of Cove Point contribution at run rate production levels, which means without some of the ramp-up costs that last year we had budgeted and experienced in the last 3 quarters. There's still some improvement that this year versus last, not only the first quarter. 
As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, there's growth in regulated investment across electric and gas utilities through the year, which accretes. There some timing of ITC and farm-outs through the year, this year versus last. And then last thing is -- there's more to come, and we'll provide some more guidance on the second quarter call, is what you mentioned, the operating expense initiatives: the continuation of flat O&M but also the impact to operating earnings of our voluntary retirement program. So overall, we're on track but certainly heavier in the second half of this year versus the first half in particular as compared to 2018."

Dominion Energy reported second quarter 2019 operating earnings of $0.77 per share compared to our guidance range of $0.70 to $0.80 per share. Performance across our businesses was aided by better-than-normal weather, which increased utility",1100,"Good morning. Dominion Energy reported second quarter 2019 operating earnings of $0.77 per share compared to our guidance range of $0.70 to $0.80 per share. Performance across our businesses was aided by better-than-normal weather, which increased utility earnings by about $0.02 per share. Adjusted for normal weather, operating earnings for the fourth quarter were $0.75 per share, which is also the midpoint of our guidance range. Operating segment performance for the second quarter is shown on Slide 4.
GAAP earnings for the quarter are $0.05 per share, which were driven primarily by charges related to the SCANA integration and the voluntary retirement program, which I will discuss in a moment. A reconciliation of operating earnings to reported earnings can be found on Schedule 2 of the Earnings Release Kit. I will now provide updates on several ongoing initiatives.
Turning to Slide 5. As announced at our Investor Day in March, we continue to work towards completing the restructuring of our reporting segments. During our fourth quarter earnings call early next year, we expect to provide our 2019 full year results as well as our 2020 guidance in conformity with these updated segments. As discussed previously, we believe that this new reporting structure will make our company more transparent to all stakeholders and will highlight the premium nature of each of our distinct businesses.
Similar to last quarter, the Alternate Breakdown Structure or ABS will be posted to our Investor Relations website shortly after this call. This document provides a preliminary view of our future intended reporting segment results. The ABS, which is not reflective of how we currently manage our businesses, is not intended to replace Dominion Energy's current operating segment disclosures.
Turning to Slide 6. We have concluded the previously announced voluntary retirement program or VRP. Though some retirements will become effective only in the coming months, most of our colleagues who elected to participate have already begun to enjoy their retirement. Roughly 12% of our total workforce elected to participate, which compares to an average annual retirement rate over the last 5 years of just over 3%. We, of course, wish them all the best in retirement and also thank them for their many years of dedicated service.
We expect this VRP to be impactful to our company and our workforce in a number of ways, in particular as we embark on industry-leading innovation initiatives highlighted by Tom and other members of our senior management team at our Investor Day in March. 
As it relates to thinking about the potential financial impact of the program, I would ask that you note the following: first, while the VRP's financial impacts are incremental to our previously announced Flat O&M initiative, I reiterate my comments from the first quarter call that these savings should not be considered [ passive ] to existing earnings guidance. Rather the savings from the VRP are available to overcome potential unexpected challenges and de-risk the execution of our earnings growth plan. We view this approach as supportive of our objective to consistently and predictively deliver results in line with our guidance, which we expect will be a driver of premium equity valuation.
Second, the bottom line impact of this program will be influenced by near-term backfilling of up to 1/3 of the vacated positions, given operational and safety requirement. Further, O&M savings in our regulated businesses accrue to our customers immediately, in the case of the rider programs, and over longer time frames via rate proceedings. Finally, VRP savings in our Southeast Energy Group are supportive of the expected transaction accretion of approximately $0.10 per share in each of the first 2 years following merger closing.
Turning to financing. In June, we successfully placed approximately $1.6 billion in equity-linked units, consistent with our financing plan guidance. Due to a high-quality order book that was many times oversubscribed, we were able to achieve record pricing in terms of spread to common yield for security of this type. As a reminder, this transaction does not result in any near-term common stock issuance, and the financial impacts of this issuance were already contemplated in our existing earnings guidance.
As discussed during our Investor Day, over the next several years, on average, we continue to expect nonmarketed equity issuance via DRIP of about $300 million per year and via aftermarket program of some $300 million to $500 million per year to help prudently fund our sizable regulated capital investment program.
Moving now to operating earnings guidance on Slide 7. As usual, our operating earnings guidance ranges assume normal weather, variations from which could cause results to be towards the top or the bottom of these ranges. For the third quarter, we are initiating guidance of $1 to $1.20 per share. Positive factors as compared to last year include growth from regulated investment across electric and gas utility programs, the contribution from the Southeast Energy Group and the impact of O&M initiatives. Negative factors as compared to last year include the impact of 2018 asset sales, share issuances, timing of a farm-out and return to normal weather.
As you evaluate the cadence of our quarterly earnings as compared to last year, particularly as it relates to the second half of the year, please keep in mind the following factors, some of which have been quantified on the right-hand side of Slide 7: the timing of the millstone refueling outage, which occurred in spring this year as compared to the fall last year; the favorable net impact of PJM capacity prices, including our new Greensville power station's participation in the capacity market for the first time since it's in service late last year; the contribution of the Southeast Energy Group; earnings growth from continued regulated investment across electric and gas businesses; higher realized prices at our Millstone Power Station, driven primarily by an expected October 1 effective date for the 10-year, 9 million megawatt-hour 0 carbon contract with Connecticut utilities; and finally, the continuation of our Flat O&M and other expense control initiatives.
We expect that savings from the VRP, net of the just discussed, will be between $0.05 and $0.06 per share during the second half of this year. These savings are available to address unplanned challenges that may arise, for example, items like the $0.04 of negative weather experienced so far this year. We are also affirming our expectations for full year 2019 operating earnings per share between $4.05 and $4.40. Similarly, we also reiterate our long-term EPS growth expectation of approximately 5% per year through next year and 5%-plus thereafter.
I will now turn the call over to Tom."

Of particular note, the Southeast Energy Group overall safety performance has improved from what was already solid results, overcoming a loss of a colleague in the tragic event in Durham on April 10 from a third-party contractor and avoiding distractions from merger activities. I want to commend the women and men of the Southeast Energy Group who have responded so positively, providing safe, reliable and efficient delivery of energy to customers who are experiencing lower bills and seeing increased community giving, just as we committed prior to completion of the merger.
Turning to Slide 9. Earlier this month, CNBC released their 2019 Update to America's Top States for Business. We were pleased, though not surprised, to see 4 of our 5 primary state-regulated jurisdictions ranked in the top 10 of the list, including Virginia, which was recognized as the nation's #1 state for business. You might recall from our Investor Day that 65% to 70% of our company's expected 2020 operating earnings are from state-regulated operations centered around these 5 key states, including 40% to 45% attributable to our Virginia phased utility. This is just one more validation of the theme we have highlighted regarding the differentiated nature of our high-quality regulated operations.
Another topic we regularly highlight to all Dominion Energy stakeholders is our ongoing ESG efforts. We're continuously enhancing our strategy in this area and increasing our communications regarding the progress we have made and will continue to make. For example, to our knowledge, we were the first utility company, and we believe the only U.S. company in any sector, to hold a dedicated ESG-focused Investor Day meeting. We created a new Board-level sustainability and corporate responsibility committee that oversees our approach to these matters. We have updated our emissions reduction goals to be more aggressive. We have improved our disclosures across the board, including inclusion of comparable ESG metrics. They are included in the appendix of these earnings call materials.
We have directly engaged with our largest institutional investors outside of proxy season in discussions about Dominion's industry-leading positions on these issues. And we are only 1 of 3 utility companies that have implemented an environmental justice policy, which ensures that all stakeholders including local communities have a voice in decisions on infrastructure investments. We believe that as investors become increasingly discerning around ESG criteria, Dominion's industry-leading efforts will be rewarded with a differentiated positive investment outlook.
I'll turn now to recent updates related to our major investment initiatives. Earlier this month, we began construction of our $300 million offshore wind pilot project. The project was approved by Virginia regulators in November of last year and is a critical initial step in what has the potential to become a multiyear, multi-billion dollar capital deployment in 0 carbon offshore wind energy. Recall that our Virginia offshore lease should accommodate over 2 gigawatts of generation capacity based on expected technology advancements, which is significantly more than what we have accounted for over our 5-year planning horizon. We continue to make progress on the $2 billion to $3 billion new pump storage facility. It would be an excellent complement to the intermittency of the increased wind and solar resources across our system.
During the second quarter, we narrowed the search for a potential location, and we'll spend the remainder of this year and part of next conducting more extensive surveys. The Virginia General Assembly has found the construction of such a facility to be in the public interest.
Next, relicensing of our existing regulated nuclear units in Virginia is an up to $4 billion capital program that supports safe, reliable and affordable energy for customers and is an important source of 0 carbon electricity production. During the second quarter, our nuclear station in Surry County generated its 500 billionth kilowatt-hour of 0 carbon electricity. Put that into context, 500 billion kilowatt-hours would power the entire state of Virginia for 5.5 years in a carbon-free manner.
Later this week, we will file our first battery pilot program. We will pair batteries with solar facilities to begin the integration of peak shifting and clipping as well as test of reliability benefits of batteries on our distribution grid.
On Slide 12, we have charted positive trends across 2 significant growth drivers for our power delivery business. On the left side, you can see the growth in electric transmission rate base, which will continue as we execute on the 5-year, $4.3 billion capital plan we shared at our Investor Day in March. These transmission investments improve system reliability to the benefit of our customers. On the right side, you see the impressive growth in data center capacity, which we also expect to continue for years to come. Our capital plan calls for $1.7 billion of investment associated with customer growth, including data centers over the next 5 years.
And finally, with regard to the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Supply Header. Our customers continue to meet this project's capacity to serve their existing customers, move toward low-carbon future and enable new economic development. It is noteworthy that natural gas prices in the region that will be served by the project remain among the highest in the country. We are pleased that the Solicitor General filed an appeal to the Supreme Court of the Fourth Circuit [indiscernible] decision as it relates to ACP's crossing underneath the Appalachian Trail. To date, 16 states, the AGA, INGA, the Chamber of Commerce, several unions, the National Association of Manufacturers, Mountain Valley pipeline have all filed amicus briefs. 
History indicates cases appealed by the Solicitor General have an approximately 70% chance of being considered. We expect that in October or November, the Supreme Court will schedule arguments to occur in the spring of next year with a final decision no later than June 2020. We are confident that the Fourth Circuit's ruling will be overturned. And though at present, we are not publicly discussing potential administrative or legislative alternatives, the options that have been described are the developers of the Mountain Valley pipeline should be expected to be applicable to the Atlantic Coast Pipeline.
We are disappointed that last week, the Fourth Circuit vacated the project's biologic Over recent months, we have been taking steps to bolster the official record of the case in the event the court ruled negatively. These steps include the additional surveying of the rusty patched bumble bee along the project corridor, which has been underway since mid-June. There's nothing in the court's opinion on the poor species that we expect would prevent the biological opinion from being reissued in time to recommence construction by year-end and complete critical path tree filling during the November through March window.
We have included in the appendix a list of select outstanding regulatory reauthorizations, including resolution timing expectations. Based on the assumptions, our current project cost and in-service timing expectations remain consistent with the guidance we provided earlier this year on our fourth quarter earnings call.
Before I complete my remarks, I would like to add my personal thanks and well wishes to our colleagues who have opted to retire on an accelerated time line. Your legacy of leading our core values will leave a lasting impression at Dominion Energy and you will be missed.
With that, I will summarize today's release as follows: we are on track to achieve full year safety results that are consistent with the record-setting performances of recent years. We are actively engaged throughout the company on initiatives that are focused on creating shareholder, customer and other stakeholder value by making Dominion Energy more efficient, sustainable and transparent. 
We achieved operating earnings per share above, or on a weather-normalized basis, at the midpoint of our guidance range. We are affirming our full year operating earnings per share guidance and our long-term growth rates. Our key regulated jurisdictions stand apart as premium locations in which to do business. We are making progress across our capital investment programs to the benefit of our customers. And we have a strong environmental, social and governance track record and strategy, and we will continue to increase our engagement with customers, shareholders and other stakeholders on those topics.
We will now be happy to answer your questions."

What I would do is say that part of the reason that we divested Blue Racer is that really wasn't core to us. When we look at our gas infrastructure, our high focus in those our existing customers and our growth project has been in end-use markets, and end-use markets actually benefit from the low gas prices that you see. So while we understand the Appalachian gas prices are quite low, what that's done is it's driven a higher industrial growth in that region and more end use and PowerGen customers. So as Tom talked about in the Analyst Day back in March, a lot of our focus is towards the end use rather than the producers."

So we mentioned -- I mentioned, and we have on the slide here that the net impact, none of the mitigants I described, for this year in the $0.05 to $0.06 range for the second half of the year. So you could easily annualize that for a year in the coming years. Of course, over time, that's given back to our customers through rate [indiscernible]. 
For 2020, fair enough, think about double that amount so $0.10 to $0.12. So let's just put that in context. So $0.04 of weather hurt this year 6 months, we don't know what that will be the rest of the year. Or of course in 2020 that kind of thing stands ready to offset. When it comes to ACP, as a reminder, our guidance on the contribution from ACP in 2018 last year was $0.07. This year, it's $0.11. Next year, we have a little more visibility but not on an basis yet regarding the exact timing of recommencement and the sculpting of capital spend through 2020. So what the contribution in 2020 is, we don't yet know exactly but call it mid-teens to high teens, at best, contribution.

So we're always considering ways to create shareholder value, to derisk our plan, to take our exposure to regulated and regulated-like businesses which now 95%, take it up towards 100%. So last year in 2018, we made a lot of progress in that respect, as you know. 
And this year, that continued but on a totally different scale. We're really focusing on that last 5%, for the most part, of things that are not core or not regulated or regulated-like. For example, we divested a 15-megawatt fuel cell asset we had in Connecticut as [indiscernible] for $35 million this year. We also divested our stake in Power, the wind facility in West Virginia. The amount wasn't disclosed but is modest. 
We're also fielding and thinking about what to do with another wind asset we own in Indiana, which is [indiscernible] no decisions there yet, early days. So that kind of thing, we're always thinking about it but it's very modest. Now I say that to put in context for retail, which is your question. So there are press reports about potential sales of our [indiscernible] and also, we've been fielding inbound inquiries on all of it, on the part that is in Georgia that was formerly SCANA business, on Legacy Dominion business. And we're thinking through that certainly no decision. 
Importantly, we're thinking about what to do generally, so it's not so focused on the process. Should we keep it [indiscernible] how can we grow it? Could there be ways to grow through JV, for example, are some other structure. thinking along the lines as opposed to let's sell those, we're probably not going to do that if it's not accretive.

I know it's a little bit funny to talk about that savings as being kind of available for unforeseen headwinds, weather it's the most prevalent. We always talk about the potentially material impact of weather now in Virginia and South Carolina on our earnings guidance ranges and where we end up. So it's hard to point any one thing because we feel pretty good about where we are at this stage, given what's to come in the next 2 quarters. 
And let me address that a little more. So last year, as we sat here on our second quarter call and we looked at kind of what was remaining, what we needed to do after our first 2 quarters to get to the midpoint of our guidance range, we needed $2.03. So this year, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the cadence is different. We have a back-end loaded profile to our EPS accrual through the second half of the year. So last year was $2.03. This year, it's $2.36, so bigger company, more earnings, but we also need have a little bit of catch-up back-end loaded. 
The reasons for that and the reasons we are comfortable with that are these things that are generally set out in the right-hand side of Page 7 in our deck. So the Millstone outage, $0.08 to $0.10. Last year was in fourth quarter, for the most part. This year, done in spring. The net capacity expansion, PJM with Greensville in the next now starting in June, $0.06 to $0.08. The VRP also in the mix, $0.05 to $0.06. Southeast Energy Group didn't have it last year, it's $0.04 to $0.06. 
And then another basket of things are smaller but regulated investment across our utility business for the next 6 months. And the Millstone PPA we mentioned, assuming that comes into place October 1, and then the continued impact of O&M to the next 6 months. So in our minds, we don't really have one thing that the VRP will offset. It's just there and available. So we anticipate Julien that a question, which was what if nothing comes up this year or next year? And there also, we're saying I've said that it's not additive to our guidance. 
So if nothing comes up and we're in the lucky position of not having any headwinds that aren't expected or such event, what I would do is identify areas in O&M to advance spending in order to use that VRP savings to derisk our guidance, our earnings guidance for a longer period of time. So not a very direct answer to your question but that's the way we think about the VRP savings and what it will potentially help us with over the next period."

Of course, we're under construction on the 2 offshore wind turbines now, doing the onshore construction next summer will complete the 2 test turbines. In terms of the offshore wind economics, we've been watching very closely what's been happening throughout New England. I would say that the live cycle cost equivalent, LCOE, in those markets have been call it $85 and potentially higher. There's some speculation what may happen with production tax credits for offshore wind. Might they be renewed or not? We don't know. 
In Virginia, we're looking at the need to get the life cycle cost equivalent down closer to maybe the $80 range, which means we need to see about a 15% to 20% capital cost improvement. We think that those costs can move in that direction once we stand up the U.S. supply chain. That's been a real benefit that they've seen in Europe is being able to scale up the supply chain. 
And we also think that the development of larger turbines, 11 megawatt and greater will drop those costs down closer to what we think we need in order to really see the buildout in Virginia. So we're watching all of that very closely. We think the time frame that we have in mind, which is '23, '24 and kind of beyond, we think that those cost reductions are achievable.

Dominion Energy reported second quarter 2019 operating earnings of $0.77 per share compared to our guidance range of $0.70 to $0.80 per share. Performance across our businesses was aided by better-than-normal weather, which increased utility",1098,"Good morning. Dominion Energy reported second quarter 2019 operating earnings of $0.77 per share compared to our guidance range of $0.70 to $0.80 per share. Performance across our businesses was aided by better-than-normal weather, which increased utility earnings by about $0.02 per share. Adjusted for normal weather, operating earnings for the fourth quarter were $0.75 per share, which is also the midpoint of our guidance range. Operating segment performance for the second quarter is shown on Slide 4.  
GAAP earnings for the quarter are $0.05 per share, which were driven primarily by charges related to the SCANA integration and the voluntary retirement program, which I will discuss in a moment. A reconciliation of operating earnings to reported earnings can be found on Schedule 2 of the Earnings Release Kit. I will now provide updates on several ongoing initiatives.
Turning to Slide 5. As announced at our Investor Day in March, we continue to work towards completing the restructuring of our reporting segments. During our fourth quarter earnings call early next year, we expect to provide our 2019 full year results as well as our 2020 guidance in conformity with these updated segments. As discussed previously, we believe that this new reporting structure will make our company more transparent to all stakeholders and will highlight the premium nature of each of our distinct businesses.
Similar to last quarter, the Alternate Breakdown Structure or ABS will be posted to our Investor Relations website shortly after this call. This document provides a preliminary view of our future intended reporting segment results. The ABS, which is not reflective of how we currently manage our businesses, is not intended to replace Dominion Energy's current operating segment disclosures.
Turning to Slide 6. We have concluded the previously announced voluntary retirement program or VRP. Though some retirements will become effective only in the coming months, most of our colleagues who elected to participate have already begun to enjoy their retirement. Roughly 12% of our total workforce elected to participate, which compares to an average annual retirement rate over the last 5 years of just over 3%. We, of course, wish them all the best in retirement and also thank them for their many years of dedicated service.
We expect this VRP to be impactful to our company and our workforce in a number of ways, in particular as we embark on industry-leading innovation initiatives highlighted by Tom and other members of our senior management team at our Investor Day in March. 
As it relates to thinking about the potential financial impact of the program, I would ask that you note the following: first, while the VRP's financial impacts are incremental to our previously announced Flat O&M initiative, I reiterate my comments from the first quarter call that these savings should not be considered passive to existing earnings guidance. Rather the savings from the VRP are available to overcome potential unexpected challenges and derisk the execution of our earnings growth plan. We view this approach as supportive of our objective to consistently and predictively deliver results in line with our guidance, which we expect would be a driver of premium equity valuation.
Second, the bottom line impact of this program will be influenced by near-term backfilling of up to 1/3 of the vacated positions given operational and safety requirement. Further, O&M savings in our regulated businesses accrue to our customers immediately, in the case of rider programs and over longer time frames via rate proceedings. Finally, VRP savings in our Southeast Energy Group are supportive of the expected transaction accretion of approximately $0.10 per share in each of the first 2 years following merger closing.
Turning to financing. In June, we successfully placed approximately $1.6 billion in equity-linked units, consistent with our financing plan guidance. Due to a high-quality order book that was many times oversubscribed, we were able to achieve record pricing in terms of spread to common yield for security of this type. As a reminder, this transaction does not result in any near-term common stock issuance, and the financial impacts of this issuance were already contemplated in our existing earnings guidance.  
As discussed during our Investor Day, over the next several years, on average, we continue to expect nonmarketed equity issuance via DRIP of about $300 million per year and via our aftermarket program of some $300 million to $500 million per year to help prudently fund our sizable regulated capital investment program.
Moving now to operating earnings guidance on Slide 7. As usual, our operating earnings guidance ranges assume normal weather, variations from which could cause results to be towards the top or the bottom of these ranges. For the third quarter, we are initiating guidance of $1 to $1.20 per share. Positive factors as compared to last year include growth from regulated investment across electric and gas utility programs, the contribution from the Southeast Energy Group and the impact of O&M initiatives. Negative factors as compared to last year include the impact of 2018 asset sales, share issuances, timing of a farm-out and return to normal weather.
As you evaluate the cadence of our quarterly earnings as compared to last year, particularly as it relates to the second half of the year, please keep in mind the following factors, some of which have been quantified on the right-hand side of Slide 7: the timing of the Millstone refueling outage, which occurred in spring this year as compared to the fall last year; the favorable net impact of PJM capacity prices, including our new Greensville power station's participation in the capacity market for the first time since it's in service late last year; the contribution of the Southeast Energy Group; earnings growth from continued regulated investment across electric and gas businesses; higher realized prices at our Millstone Power Station driven primarily by an expected October 1 effective date for the 10-year, 9 million megawatt-hour, zero-carbon contract with Connecticut utilities; and finally, the continuation of our Flat O&M and other expense control initiatives.
We expect that savings from the VRP, net of the mitigates just discussed will be between $0.05 and $0.06 per share during the second half of this year. These savings are available to address unplanned challenges that may arise, for example, items like the $0.04 of negative weather experienced so far this year. We are also affirming our expectations for full year 2019 operating earnings per share between $4.05 and $4.40. Similarly, we also reiterate our long-term EPS growth expectation of approximately 5% per year through next year and 5%-plus thereafter.
I will now turn the call over to Tom."

Those 6 months remain, year-to-date safety results are consistent with the record-setting results we have achieved in the last few years. 
Of particular note, the Southeast Energy Group overall safety performance has improved from what was already solid results, overcoming a loss of a colleague in the tragic event in Durham on April 10 from a third-party contractor and avoiding distractions from merger activities. I want to commend the women and men of the Southeast Energy Group who have responded so positively, providing safe, reliable and efficient delivery of energy to customers who are experiencing lower bills and seeing increased community giving, just as we committed prior to completion of the merger.
Turning to Slide 9. Earlier this month, CNBC released their 2019 update to America's Top States for Business. We were pleased, though not surprised, to see 4 of our 5 primary state-regulated jurisdictions ranked in the top 10 of the list, including Virginia, which was recognized as the nation's #1 state for business. You might recall from our Investor Day that 65% to 70% of our company's expected 2020 operating earnings are from state-regulated operations centered around these 5 key states, including 40% to 45% attributable to our Virginia-phased utility. This is just one more validation of the theme we have highlighted regarding the differentiated nature of our high-quality regulated operations.
Another topic we regularly highlight to all Dominion Energy stakeholders is our ongoing ESG efforts. We're continuously enhancing our strategy in this area and increasing our communications regarding the progress we have made and will continue to make. For example, to our knowledge, we were the first utility company, and we believe the only U.S. company in any sector, to hold a dedicated ESG-focused Investor Day meeting. We created a new Board-level Sustainability and Corporate Responsibility Committee that oversees our approach to these matters. We have updated our emissions reduction goals to be more aggressive. We have improved our disclosures across-the-board, including inclusion of comparable ESG metrics. They are included in the appendix of these earnings call materials.
We have directly engaged with our largest institutional investors outside of proxy season in discussions about Dominion's industry-leading positions on these issues. And we are only 1 of 3 utility companies that have implemented an environmental justice policy, which ensures that all stakeholders including local communities have a voice in decisions on infrastructure investments. We believe that as investors become increasingly discerning around ESG criteria, Dominion's industry-leading efforts will be rewarded with a differentiated positive investment outlook.
I will turn now to recent updates related to our major investment initiatives. Earlier this month, we began construction of our $300 million offshore wind pilot project. The project was approved by Virginia regulators in November of last year and is a critical initial step in what has the potential to become a multiyear, multibillion dollar capital deployment in zero-carbon offshore wind energy. Recall that our Virginia offshore lease should accommodate over 2 gigawatts of generation capacity based on expected technology advancements, which is significantly more than what we have accounted for over our 5-year planning horizon. We continue to make progress on the $2 billion to $3 billion new pump storage facility. It would be an excellent complement to the intermittency of the increased wind and solar resources across our system.
During the second quarter, we narrowed the search for a potential location, and we'll spend the remainder of this year and part of next conducting more extensive surveys. The Virginia General Assembly has found the construction of such a facility to be in the public interest.
Next, relicensing of our existing regulated nuclear units in Virginia is an up to $4 billion capital program that supports safe, reliable and affordable energy for customers and is an important source of zero-carbon electricity production. During the second quarter, our nuclear station in Surry County generated its 500 billionth kilowatt-hour of zero-carbon electricity. Put that into context, 500 billion kilowatt-hours would power the entire state of Virginia for 5.5 years in a carbon-free manner.
Later this week, we will file our first battery pilot program. We will pair batteries with solar facilities to begin the integration of peak shifting and clipping as well as test of reliability benefits of batteries on our distribution grid.
On Slide 12, we have charted positive trends across 2 significant growth drivers for our power delivery business. On the left side, you can see the growth in electric transmission rate base, which will continue as we execute on the 5-year, $4.3 billion capital plan we shared at our Investor Day in March. These transmission investments improve system reliability to the benefit of our customers. On the right side, you see the impressive growth in data center capacity, which we also expect to continue for years to come. Our capital planning calls for $1.7 billion of investment associated with customer growth, including data centers over the next 5 years.
And finally, with regard to the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Supply Header. Our customers continue to meet this project's capacity to serve their existing customers, move toward a low-carbon future and enable new economic development. It is noteworthy that natural gas prices in the region that will be served by the project remain among the highest in the country. We are pleased that the Solicitor General filed an appeal to the Supreme Court of the Fourth Circuit Cowpasture decision as it relates to ACP's crossing underneath the Appalachian Trail. To date, 16 states, the AGA, INGA, the Chamber of Commerce, several unions, the National Association of Manufacturers, Mountain Valley Pipeline have all filed amicus briefs. 
History indicates cases appealed by the Solicitor General have an approximately 70% chance of being considered. We expect that in October or November, the Supreme Court will schedule arguments to occur in the spring of next year with a final decision no later than June 2020. We are confident that the Fourth Circuit's ruling will be overturned. And though at present, we are not publicly discussing potential administrative or legislative alternatives, the options that have been described by the developers of the Mountain Valley Pipeline should be expected to be applicable to the Atlantic Coast Pipeline.
We are disappointed that last week, the Fourth Circuit vacated the project's biological opinion. Over recent months, we have been taking steps to bolster the official record of the case in the event the court ruled negatively. These steps include the additional surveying of the rusty patched bumble bee along the Project corridor, which has been underway since mid-June. There's nothing in the court's opinion on the poor species that we expect would prevent the biological opinion from being reissued in time to recommence construction by year-end and complete critical path tree filling during the November through March window.
We have included in the appendix a list of select outstanding regulatory reauthorizations, including resolution timing expectations. Based on the assumptions, our current project cost and in-service timing expectations remain consistent with the guidance we provided earlier this year on our fourth quarter earnings call.
Before I complete my remarks, I would like to add my personal thanks and well wishes to our colleagues who have opted to retire on an accelerated time line. Your legacy of living our core values will leave a lasting impression at Dominion Energy and you will be missed.
With that, I will summarize today's release as follows: we are on track to achieve full year safety results that are consistent with the record-setting performances of recent years. We are actively engaged throughout the company on initiatives that are focused on creating shareholder, customer and other stakeholder value by making Dominion Energy more efficient, sustainable and transparent. 
We achieved operating earnings per share above, or on a weather-normalized basis, at the midpoint of our guidance range. We are affirming our full year operating earnings per share guidance and our long-term growth rates. Our key regulated jurisdictions stand apart as premium locations in which to do business. We are making progress across our capital investment programs to the benefit of our customers. And we have a strong environmental, social and governance track record and strategy, and we will continue to increase our engagement with customers, shareholders and other stakeholders on those topics.
We will now be happy to answer your questions."

What I would do is say that part of the reason that we divested a Blue Racer is that really wasn't core to us.

So while we understand the Appalachian gas prices are quite low, what that's done is it's driven a higher industrial growth in that region and more end use and PowerGen customers. So as Tom talked about in the Analyst Day back in March, a lot of our focus is towards the end use rather than the producers."

So we mentioned -- I mentioned, and we have on the slide there that the net impact, none of the mitigants I described, for this year in the $0.05 to $0.06 range for the second half of the year. So you could easily annualize that for a year in the coming years. Of course, over time, that's given back to our customers through to rates [ speedy beam light ]. 
For 2020, fair enough, think about double that amount so $0.10 to $0.12. So let's just put that in context. So $0.04 of weather hurt this year 6 months, we don't know what that will be the rest of the year. Or, of course, in 2020 that kind of thing stands ready to offset. When it comes to ACP, as a reminder, our guidance on the contribution from ACP in 2018 last year was $0.07. This year, it's $0.11. Next year, we have a little more visibility but not on a granular basis yet regarding the exact timing of recommencement and the sculpting of capital spend through 2020. So what the contribution in 2020 is, we don't yet know exactly but call it mid-teens to high teens, at best, contribution. So the $0.10 to $0.12 stands available to offset various unforeseen challenges, but that kind of puts it in context versus ACP, which you're asking about, smaller."

And obviously, for the norm, we don't really comment on material M&A. But I'm using color on the way we think about this. So we're always considering ways to create shareholder value to derisk our plan, to take our exposure to regulated and regulated-like businesses which now 95%, take it up towards 100%. So last year in 2018, obviously we made a lot of progress in that respect, as you know. 
And this year, that continued but on a totally different scale. We're really focusing on that last 5%, for the most part, of things that are not core or not regulated or regulated-like. For example, we divested a 15-megawatt fuel cell asset we had in Connecticut in Bridgeport for $35 million this year. We also divested our stake in NedPower, the wind facility in West Virginia. The amount wasn't disclosed but is modest. 
We're also fielding and thinking about what to do with another wind asset we own in Indiana, which is Fowler Ridge, no decisions there yet, early days. So that kind of thing, we're always thinking about it but it's very modest. Now I say that to put in context for retail, which is your question. So there are press reports about potential sales of our retail gas and -- there also, we've been fielding inbound inquiries on all of it, on the part that is in Georgia that was formerly SCANA business, on the legacy Dominion business. And we're thinking through that. There's certainly no decision. 
But importantly, we're thinking about what to do generally, so it's not so focused on the process. Should we keep it as well? How can we grow it? Could there be ways to grow through JV, for example, or some other structure? So it's more thinking along the lines as opposed to, ""Let's sell this thing,"" because we're probably not going to do that. It's not accretive. So no decisions, lots of thought processes. But no, nothing to share and not sure there will be."

The other half is just the total and the other half comes pro rata from the equity contributions from the sponsors worth 48% of that. So $3.4 billion is the total. The -- as I mentioned, we don't have available, at this time, granular guidance on the capital spend for the end of this year or the sculpting of it through 2020, but it assumes recommencement of construction by the tree clearing season in the fourth quarter this year."

I know it's a little bit funny to talk about that savings as being kind of available for unforeseen headwinds, weather it's the most prevalent. We always talk about the potentially material impact of weather now",470,"Okay. Let me talk about that a little bit. I know it's a little bit funny to talk about that savings as being kind of available for unforeseen headwinds, weather it's the most prevalent. We always talk about the potentially material impact of weather now in Virginia and South Carolina on our earnings guidance ranges and where we end up. So it's hard to point any one thing because we feel pretty good about where we are at this stage, given what's to come in the next 2 quarters. 
And let me address that a little more. So last year, as we sat here on our second quarter call and we looked at kind of what was remaining, what we needed to do after our first 2 quarters to get to the midpoint of our guidance range, we needed $2.03. So this year, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the cadence is different. We have a back-end loaded profile to our EPS accrual through the second half of the year. So last year was $2.03. This year, it's $2.36, so bigger company, more earnings, but we also need have a little bit of catch-up, it's back-end loaded. 
The reasons for that and the reasons we are comfortable with that are these things that are generally set out in that right-hand side of Page 7 in our deck. So the Millstone outage, $0.08 to $0.10. Last year was in fourth quarter, and for the most part, this year, done in spring. The net capacity expansion, PJM with Greensville in the next now starting in June, $0.06 to $0.08. The VRP also in the mix, $0.05 to $0.06. Southeast Energy Group didn't have it last year, $0.04 to $0.06. 
And then another basket of things are smaller but regulated investment across our utility business for the next 6 months: the Millstone PPA we mentioned, assuming that comes into place October 1; and then the continued impact of O&M to the next 6 months. So in our minds, we don't really have one thing that the VRP will offset. It's just there and available. So we anticipate Julien that a question, which was what if nothing comes up this year or next year? And there also, we're saying, I've said that it's not additive to our guidance. 
So if nothing comes up and we're in the lucky position of not having any headwinds that aren't expected or such event, what I would do is identify areas in O&M to advance spending in order to use that VRP savings to derisk our guidance, our earnings guidance for a longer period of time. So not a very direct answer to your question but that's the way we think about the VRP savings and what it will potentially help us with over the next period."

Of course, we're under construction on the 2 offshore wind turbines now, doing the onshore construction next summer will complete the 2 test turbines. In terms of the offshore wind economics, we've been watching very closely what's been happening throughout New England. I would say that the life cycle cost equivalent, LCOE, in those markets have been, call it, $85 and potentially higher. There's some speculation what may happen with production tax credits for offshore wind. Might they be renewed or not? We don't know. 
In Virginia, we're looking at the need to get the life cycle cost equivalent down closer to maybe the $80 range, which means we need to see about a 15% to 20% capital cost improvement. We think that those costs can move in that direction once we stand up the U.S. supply chain. That's been a real benefit that they've seen in Europe is being able to scale up the supply chain. 
And we also think that the development of larger turbines, 11 megawatt and greater, will drop those costs down closer to what we think we need in order to really see the build-out in Virginia. So we're watching all of that very closely. We think the time frame that we have in mind, which is '23, '24 and kind of beyond, we think that those cost reductions are achievable.

Dominion Energy reported second quarter 2019 operating earnings of $0.77 per share compared to our guidance range of $0.70 to $0.80 per share. Performance across our businesses was aided by better-than-normal weather, which increased utility",1099,"Good morning. Dominion Energy reported second quarter 2019 operating earnings of $0.77 per share compared to our guidance range of $0.70 to $0.80 per share. Performance across our businesses was aided by better-than-normal weather, which increased utility earnings by about $0.02 per share. Adjusted for normal weather, operating earnings for the fourth quarter were $0.75 per share, which is also the midpoint of our guidance range. Operating segment performance for the second quarter is shown on Slide 4.  
GAAP earnings for the quarter are $0.05 per share, which were driven primarily by charges related to the SCANA integration and the voluntary retirement program, which I will discuss in a moment. A reconciliation of operating earnings to reported earnings can be found on Schedule 2 of the Earnings Release Kit. I will now provide updates on several ongoing initiatives.
Turning to Slide 5. As announced at our Investor Day in March, we continue to work towards completing the restructuring of our reporting segments. During our fourth quarter earnings call early next year, we expect to provide our 2019 full year results as well as our 2020 guidance in conformity with these updated segments. As discussed previously, we believe that this new reporting structure will make our company more transparent to all stakeholders and will highlight the premium nature of each of our distinct businesses.
Similar to last quarter, the Alternate Breakdown Structure or ABS will be posted to our Investor Relations website shortly after this call. This document provides a preliminary view of our future intended reporting segment results. The ABS, which is not reflective of how we currently manage our businesses, is not intended to replace Dominion Energy's current operating segment disclosures.
Turning to Slide 6. We have concluded the previously announced voluntary retirement program or VRP. Though some retirements will become effective only in the coming months, most of our colleagues who elected to participate have already begun to enjoy their retirement. Roughly 12% of our total workforce elected to participate, which compares to an average annual retirement rate over the last 5 years of just over 3%. We, of course, wish them all the best in retirement and also thank them for their many years of dedicated service.
We expect this VRP to be impactful to our company and our workforce in a number of ways, in particular as we embark on industry-leading innovation initiatives highlighted by Tom and other members of our senior management team at our Investor Day in March. 
As it relates to thinking about the potential financial impact of the program, I would ask that you note the following: first, while the VRP's financial impacts are incremental to our previously announced Flat O&M initiative, I reiterate my comments from the first quarter call that these savings should not be considered additive to existing earnings guidance. Rather the savings from the VRP are available to overcome potential unexpected challenges and derisk the execution of our earnings growth plan. We view this approach as supportive of our objective to consistently and predictively deliver results in line with our guidance, which we expect would be a driver of premium equity valuation.
Second, the bottom line impact of this program will be influenced by near-term backfilling of up to 1/3 of the vacated positions given operational and safety requirement. Further, O&M savings in our regulated businesses accrue to our customers immediately, in the case of rider programs and over longer time frames via rate proceedings. Finally, VRP savings in our Southeast Energy Group are supportive of the expected transaction accretion of approximately $0.10 per share in each of the first 2 years following merger closing.
Turning to financing. In June, we successfully placed approximately $1.6 billion in equity-linked unit, consistent with our financing plan guidance. Due to a high-quality order book that was many times oversubscribed, we were able to achieve record pricing in terms of spread to common yield for security of this type. As a reminder, this transaction does not result in any near-term common stock issuance, and the financial impacts of this issuance were already contemplated in our existing earnings guidance.  
As discussed during our Investor Day, over the next several years, on average, we continue to expect nonmarketed equity issuance via DRIP of about $300 million per year and via our aftermarket program of some $300 million to $500 million per year to help prudently fund our sizable regulated capital investment program.
Moving now to operating earnings guidance on Slide 7. As usual, our operating earnings guidance ranges assume normal weather variations from which could cause results to be towards the top or the bottom of these ranges. For the third quarter, we are initiating guidance of $1 to $1.20 per share. Positive factors as compared to last year include growth from regulated investment across electric and gas utility programs, the contribution from the Southeast Energy Group and the impact of O&M initiatives. Negative factors as compared to last year include the impact of 2018 asset sales, share issuances, timing of a farmout and return to normal weather.
As you evaluate the cadence of our quarterly earnings as compared to last year, particularly as it relates to the second half of the year, please keep in mind the following factors, some of which have been quantified on the right-hand side of Slide 7: the timing of the Millstone refueling outage, which occurred in the spring this year as compared to the fall last year; the favorable net impact of PJM capacity prices, including our new Greensville power station's participation in the capacity market for the first time since it's in service late last year; the contribution of the Southeast Energy Group; earnings growth from continued regulated investment across electric and gas businesses; higher realized prices at our Millstone Power Station driven primarily by an expected October 1 effective date for the 10-year, 9 million megawatt-hour, zero-carbon contract with Connecticut utilities; and finally, the continuation of our Flat O&M and other expense control initiatives.
We expect that savings from the VRP, net of the mitigates just discussed will be between $0.05 and $0.06 per share during the second half of this year. These savings are available to address unplanned challenges that may arise, for example, items like the $0.04 of negative weather experienced so far this year. We are also affirming our expectations for full year 2019 operating earnings per share between $4.05 and $4.40. Similarly, we also reiterate our long-term EPS growth expectation of approximately 5% per year through next year and 5%-plus thereafter.
I will now turn the call over to Tom."

It is at the heart of our corporate culture, and we will continue to improve until we achieve the only acceptable safety statistic, 0 injuries. Those 6 months remain, year-to-date safety results are consistent with the record-setting results we have achieved in the last few years. 
Of particular note, the Southeast Energy Group overall safety performance has improved from what was already solid results, overcoming a loss of a colleague in the tragic event in Durham on April 10 from a third-party contractor and avoiding distractions from merger activities. I want to commend the women and men of the Southeast Energy Group who have responded so positively, providing safe, reliable and efficient delivery of energy to customers who are experiencing lower bills and seeing increased community giving, just as we committed prior to completion of the merger.
Turning to Slide 9. Earlier this month, CNBC released their 2019 update to America's Top States for Business. We were pleased, though not surprised, to see 4 of our 5 primary state-regulated jurisdictions ranked in the top 10 of the list, including Virginia, which was recognized as the nation's #1 state for business. You might recall from our Investor Day that 65% to 70% of our company's expected 2020 operating earnings are from state-regulated operations centered around these 5 key states, including 40% to 45% attributable to our Virginia-based utility. This is just one more validation of the theme we have highlighted regarding the differentiated nature of our high-quality regulated operations.
Another topic we regularly highlight to all Dominion Energy stakeholders is our ongoing ESG efforts. We're continuously enhancing our strategy in this area and increasing our communications regarding the progress we have made and will continue to make. For example, to our knowledge, we were the first utility company, and we believe the only U.S. company in any sector, to hold a dedicated ESG-focused Investor Day meeting. We created a new Board-level Sustainability and Corporate Responsibility Committee that oversees our approach to these matters. We have updated our emissions reduction goals to be more aggressive. We have improved our disclosures across-the-board, including inclusion of comparable ESG metrics. They are included in the appendix of these earnings call materials.
We have directly engaged with our largest institutional investors outside of proxy season in discussions about Dominion's industry-leading positions on these issues. And we are only 1 of 3 utility companies that have implemented an environmental justice policy, which ensures that all stakeholders including local communities have a voice in decisions on infrastructure investments. We believe that as investors become increasingly discerning around ESG criteria, Dominion's industry-leading efforts will be rewarded with a differentiated positive investment outlook.
I will turn now to recent updates related to our major investment initiatives. Earlier this month, we began construction of our $300 million offshore wind pilot project. The project was approved by Virginia regulators in November of last year and is a critical initial step in what has the potential to become a multiyear, multibillion dollar capital deployment in zero-carbon offshore wind energy. Recall that our Virginia offshore lease should accommodate over 2 gigawatts of generation capacity based on expected technology advancements, which is significantly more than what we have accounted for over our 5-year planning horizon. We continue to make progress on the $2 billion to $3 billion new pump storage facility. It would be an excellent complement to the intermittency of the increased wind and solar resources across our system.
During the second quarter, we narrowed the search for a potential location, and we'll spend the remainder of this year and part of next conducting more extensive surveys. The Virginia General Assembly has found the construction of such a facility to be in the public interest.
Next, relicensing of our existing regulated nuclear units in Virginia is an up to $4 billion capital program that supports safe, reliable and affordable energy for customers and is an important source of zero-carbon electricity production. During the second quarter, our nuclear station in Surry County generated its 500 billionth kilowatt-hour of zero-carbon electricity. Put that into context, 500 billion kilowatt-hours would power the entire state of Virginia for 5.5 years in a carbon-free manner.
Later this week, we will file our first battery pilot program. We will pair batteries with solar facilities to begin the integration of peak shifting and clipping as well as test of reliability benefits of batteries on our distribution grid.
On Slide 12, we have charted positive trends across 2 significant growth drivers for our power delivery business. On the left side, you can see the growth in electric transmission rate base, which will continue as we execute on the 5-year, $4.3 billion capital plan we shared at our Investor Day in March. These transmission investments improve system reliability to the benefit of our customers. On the right side, you see the impressive growth in data center capacity, which we also expect to continue for years to come. Our capital planning calls for $1.7 billion of investment associated with customer growth, including data centers over the next 5 years.
And finally, with regard to the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Supply Header. Our customers continue to need these project's capacity to serve their existing customers, move toward a low-carbon future and enable new economic development. It is noteworthy that natural gas prices in the region that will be served by the project remain among the highest in the country. We are pleased that the Solicitor General filed an appeal to the Supreme Court of the Fourth Circuit Cowpasture decision as it relates to ACP's crossing underneath the Appalachian Trail. To date, 16 states, the AGA, INGA, the Chamber of Commerce, several unions, the National Association of Manufacturers, Mountain Valley Pipeline have all filed amicus briefs. 
History indicates cases appealed by the Solicitor General have an approximately 70% chance of being considered. We expect that in October or November, the Supreme Court will schedule arguments to occur in the spring of next year with a final decision no later than June 2020. We are confident that the Fourth Circuit's ruling will be overturned. And though at present, we are not publicly discussing potential administrative or legislative alternatives, the options that have been described by the developers of the Mountain Valley Pipeline should be expected to be applicable to the Atlantic Coast Pipeline.
We are disappointed that last week, the Fourth Circuit vacated the project's biological opinion. Over recent months, we have been taking steps to bolster the official record of the case in the event the court ruled negatively. These steps include the additional surveying of the rusty patched bumble bee along the Project corridor, which has been underway since mid-June. There's nothing in the court's opinion on the 4 species that we expect would prevent the biological opinion from being reissued in time to recommence construction by year-end and complete critical path tree filling during the November through March window.
We have included in the appendix a list of select outstanding regulatory reauthorizations, including resolution timing expectations. Based on the assumptions, our current project cost and in-service timing expectations remain consistent with the guidance we provided earlier this year on our fourth quarter earnings call.
Before I complete my remarks, I would like to add my personal thanks and well wishes to our colleagues who have opted to retire on an accelerated time line. Your legacy of living our core values will leave a lasting impression at Dominion Energy and you will be missed.
With that, I will summarize today's release as follows: we are on track to achieve full year safety results that are consistent with the record-setting performances of recent years. We are actively engaged throughout the company on initiatives that are focused on creating shareholder, customer and other stakeholder value by making Dominion Energy more efficient, sustainable and transparent. 
We achieved operating earnings per share above, or on a weather-normalized basis, at the midpoint of our guidance range. We are affirming our full year operating earnings per share guidance and our long-term growth rates. Our key regulated jurisdictions stand apart as premium locations in which to do business. We are making progress across our capital investment programs to the benefit of our customers. And we have a strong environmental, social and governance track record and strategy, and we will continue to increase our engagement with customers, shareholders and other stakeholders on those topics.
We will now be happy to answer your questions."

And end-use markets actually benefit from the low gas prices that you see. So while we understand the Appalachian gas prices are quite low, what that's done is it's driven a higher industrial growth in that region and more end-use and PowerGen customers. So as Tom talked about in the Analyst Day back in March, a lot of our focus is towards the end use rather than the producers."

So we mentioned -- I mentioned, and we have on the slide there that the net impact, none of the mitigants I described, for this year in the $0.05 to $0.06 range for the second half of the year.

For 2020, fair enough, think about double that amount so $0.10 to $0.12. So just put that in context. So $0.04 of weather hurt this year 6 months, we don't know what that will be the rest of the year. Or, of course, in 2020 that kind of thing stands ready to offset. When it comes to ACP, as a reminder, our guidance on the contribution from ACP in 2018 last year was $0.07. This year, it's $0.11. Next year, we have a little more visibility but not on a granular basis yet regarding the exact timing of recommencement and the sculpting of capital spend through 2020. So what the contribution in 2020 is, we don't yet know exactly but call it mid-teens to high teens, at best, contribution. So the $0.10 to $0.12 stands available to offset various unforeseen challenges, but that kind of puts it in context versus ACP, which you're asking is a lot smaller."

And obviously, for the norm, we don't really comment on material M&A. But I'm using color on the way we think about this. So we're always considering ways to create shareholder value to derisk our plan, to take our exposure to regulated and regulated-like businesses which now 95%, take it up towards 100%. So last year in 2018, obviously we made a lot of progress in that respect, as you know. 
And this year, that continued but on a totally different scale. We're really focusing on that last 5%, for the most part, of things that are not core or not regulated or regulated-like. For example, we divested a 15-megawatt fuel cell asset we had in Connecticut it's called Bridgeport, it's $35 million this year. We also divested our stake in NedPower, the wind facility in West Virginia. The amount was undisclosed but is modest. 
We're also fielding and thinking about what to do with another wind asset we own in Indiana, which is Fowler Ridge, no decisions there yet, early days. So that kind of thing, we're always thinking about it but it's very modest. Now I say that to put in context for retail, which is your question. So there are press reports about potential sales of our retail gas and -- there also, we've been fielding inbound inquiries on all of it, on the part that is in Georgia that was formerly SCANA business, on the legacy Dominion business. And we're thinking through that. There's certainly no decision. 
But importantly, we're thinking about what to do generally, so it's not so focused on the process. Should we keep it as well? How can we grow it? Could there be ways to grow through JV, for example, or some other structure? So it's more thinking along the lines as opposed to, ""Let's sell this thing,"" because we're probably not going to do that if it's not accretive. So no decisions, lots of thought processes. But no, nothing to share and not sure that there will be."

I know it's a little bit funny to talk about that savings as being kind of available for unforeseen headwinds, weather it's the most prevalent. We always talk about the potentially material impact of weather now",470,"Okay. Let me talk about that a little bit. I know it's a little bit funny to talk about that savings as being kind of available for unforeseen headwinds, weather it's the most prevalent. We always talk about the potentially material impact of weather now in Virginia and South Carolina on our earnings guidance ranges and where we end up. So it's hard to point any one thing because we feel pretty good about where we are at this stage, given what's to come in the next 2 quarters. 
And let me address that a little more. So last year, as we sat here on our second quarter call and we looked at kind of what was remaining, what we needed to do after our first 2 quarters to get to the midpoint of our guidance range, we needed $2.03. So this year, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the cadence is different. We have a back-end loaded profile to our EPS accrual through the second half of the year. So last year was $2.03. This year, it's $2.36, so bigger company, more earnings, but we also need -- have a little bit of catch-up, it's back-end loaded. 
The reasons for that and the reasons we are comfortable with that are there's things that are generally set out in that right-hand side of Page 7 in our deck. So the Millstone outage, $0.08 to $0.10. Last year was in fourth quarter, and for the most part, this year, done in spring. The net capacity expansion, PJM with Greensville in the mix now starting in June, $0.06 to $0.08. The VRP also in the mix, $0.05 to $0.06. Southeast Energy Group didn't have it last year, $0.04 to $0.06. 
And then another basket of things, they're smaller but regulated investment across our utility business for the next 6 months: the Millstone PPA we mentioned, assuming that comes into place October 1; and then the continued impact of O&M to the next 6 months. So in our minds, we don't really have one thing that the VRP will offset. It's just there and available. So we anticipate Julien a question, which was what if nothing comes up this year or next year? And there also, we're saying, I've said that it's not additive to our guidance. 
So if nothing comes up and we're in the lucky position of not having any headwinds that aren't expected or such event, what I would do is identify areas in O&M to advance spending in order to use that VRP savings to derisk our guidance, our earnings guidance for a longer period of time. So not a very direct answer to your question but that's the way we think about the VRP savings and what it will potentially help us with over the next period."

Of course, we're under construction on the 2 offshore wind turbines now, doing the onshore construction next summer will complete the 2 test turbines. In terms of the offshore wind economics, we've been watching very closely what's been happening throughout New England. I would say that the life cycle cost equivalent, LCOE, in those markets have been, call it, $85 and potentially higher. There's some speculation what may happen with production tax credits for offshore wind. Might they be renewed or not? We don't know. 
In Virginia, we're looking at the need to get the life cycle cost equivalent down closer to maybe the $80 range, which means we need to see about a 15% to 20% capital cost improvement. We think that those costs can move in that direction once we stand up the U.S. supply chain. That's been a real benefit that they've seen in Europe is being able to scale up the supply chain. 
And we also think that the development of larger turbines, 11 megawatt and greater, will drop those costs down closer to what we think we need in order to really see the build-out in Virginia. So we're watching all of that very closely. We think the time frame that we have in mind, which is '23, '24 and kind of beyond, we think that those cost reductions are achievable.

Dominion Energy reported second quarter 2019 operating earnings of $0.77 per share compared to our guidance range of $0.70 to $0.80 per share. Performance across our businesses was aided by better-than-normal weather, which increased utility",1099,"Good morning. Dominion Energy reported second quarter 2019 operating earnings of $0.77 per share compared to our guidance range of $0.70 to $0.80 per share. Performance across our businesses was aided by better-than-normal weather, which increased utility earnings by about $0.02 per share. Adjusted for normal weather, operating earnings for the fourth quarter were $0.75 per share, which is also the midpoint of our guidance range. Operating segment performance for the second quarter is shown on Slide 4.  
GAAP earnings for the quarter are $0.05 per share, which were driven primarily by charges related to the SCANA integration and the voluntary retirement program, which I will discuss in a moment. A reconciliation of operating earnings to reported earnings can be found on Schedule 2 of the Earnings Release Kit. I will now provide updates on several ongoing initiatives.
Turning to Slide 5. As announced at our Investor Day in March, we continue to work towards completing the restructuring of our reporting segments. During our fourth quarter earnings call early next year, we expect to provide our 2019 full year results as well as our 2020 guidance in conformity with these updated segments. As discussed previously, we believe that this new reporting structure will make our company more transparent to all stakeholders and will highlight the premium nature of each of our distinct businesses.
Similar to last quarter, the Alternate Breakdown Structure or ABS will be posted to our Investor Relations website shortly after this call. This document provides a preliminary view of our future intended reporting segment results. The ABS, which is not reflective of how we currently manage our businesses, is not intended to replace Dominion Energy's current operating segment disclosures.
Turning to Slide 6. We have concluded the previously announced voluntary retirement program or VRP. Though some retirements will become effective only in the coming months, most of our colleagues who elected to participate have already begun to enjoy their retirement. Roughly 12% of our total workforce elected to participate, which compares to an average annual retirement rate over the last 5 years of just over 3%. We, of course, wish them all the best in retirement and also thank them for their many years of dedicated service.
We expect this VRP to be impactful to our company and our workforce in a number of ways, in particular as we embark on industry-leading innovation initiatives highlighted by Tom and other members of our senior management team at our Investor Day in March. 
As it relates to thinking about the potential financial impact of the program, I would ask that you note the following: first, while the VRP's financial impacts are incremental to our previously announced Flat O&M initiative, I reiterate my comments from the first quarter call that these savings should not be considered additive to existing earnings guidance. Rather the savings from the VRP are available to overcome potential unexpected challenges and derisk the execution of our earnings growth plan. We view this approach as supportive of our objective to consistently and predictively deliver results in line with our guidance, which we expect would be a driver of premium equity valuation.
Second, the bottom line impact of this program will be influenced by near-term backfilling of up to 1/3 of the vacated positions given operational and safety requirement. Further, O&M savings in our regulated businesses accrue to our customers immediately, in the case of rider programs and over longer time frames via rate proceedings. Finally, VRP savings in our Southeast Energy Group are supportive of the expected transaction accretion of approximately $0.10 per share in each of the first 2 years following merger closing.
Turning to financing. In June, we successfully placed approximately $1.6 billion in equity-linked unit, consistent with our financing plan guidance. Due to a high-quality order book that was many times oversubscribed, we were able to achieve record pricing in terms of spread to common yield for security of this type. As a reminder, this transaction does not result in any near-term common stock issuance, and the financial impacts of this issuance were already contemplated in our existing earnings guidance.  
As discussed during our Investor Day, over the next several years, on average, we continue to expect nonmarketed equity issuance via DRIP of about $300 million per year and via our aftermarket program of some $300 million to $500 million per year to help prudently fund our sizable regulated capital investment program.
Moving now to operating earnings guidance on Slide 7. As usual, our operating earnings guidance ranges assume normal weather variations from which could cause results to be towards the top or the bottom of these ranges. For the third quarter, we are initiating guidance of $1 to $1.20 per share. Positive factors as compared to last year include growth from regulated investment across electric and gas utility programs, the contribution from the Southeast Energy Group and the impact of O&M initiatives. Negative factors as compared to last year include the impact of 2018 asset sales, share issuances, timing of a farmout and return to normal weather.
As you evaluate the cadence of our quarterly earnings as compared to last year, particularly as it relates to the second half of the year, please keep in mind the following factors, some of which have been quantified on the right-hand side of Slide 7: the timing of the Millstone refueling outage, which occurred in the spring this year as compared to the fall last year; the favorable net impact of PJM capacity prices, including our new Greensville power station's participation in the capacity market for the first time since it's in service late last year; the contribution of the Southeast Energy Group; earnings growth from continued regulated investment across electric and gas businesses; higher realized prices at our Millstone Power Station driven primarily by an expected October 1 effective date for the 10-year, 9 million megawatt-hour, zero-carbon contract with Connecticut utilities; and finally, the continuation of our Flat O&M and other expense control initiatives.
We expect that savings from the VRP, net of the mitigates just discussed will be between $0.05 and $0.06 per share during the second half of this year. These savings are available to address unplanned challenges that may arise, for example, items like the $0.04 of negative weather experienced so far this year. We are also affirming our expectations for full year 2019 operating earnings per share between $4.05 and $4.40. Similarly, we also reiterate our long-term EPS growth expectation of approximately 5% per year through next year and 5%-plus thereafter.
I will now turn the call over to Tom."

It is at the heart of our corporate culture, and we will continue to improve until we achieve the only acceptable safety statistic, 0 injuries. Those 6 months remain, year-to-date safety results are consistent with the record-setting results we have achieved in the last few years. 
Of particular note, the Southeast Energy Group overall safety performance has improved from what was already solid results, overcoming a loss of a colleague in the tragic event in Durham on April 10 from a third-party contractor and avoiding distractions from merger activities. I want to commend the women and men of the Southeast Energy Group who have responded so positively, providing safe, reliable and efficient delivery of energy to customers who are experiencing lower bills and seeing increased community giving, just as we committed prior to completion of the merger.
Turning to Slide 9. Earlier this month, CNBC released their 2019 update to America's Top States for Business. We were pleased, though not surprised, to see 4 of our 5 primary state-regulated jurisdictions ranked in the top 10 of the list, including Virginia, which was recognized as the nation's #1 state for business. You might recall from our Investor Day that 65% to 70% of our company's expected 2020 operating earnings are from state-regulated operations centered around these 5 key states, including 40% to 45% attributable to our Virginia-based utility. This is just one more validation of the theme we have highlighted regarding the differentiated nature of our high-quality regulated operations.
Another topic we regularly highlight to all Dominion Energy stakeholders is our ongoing ESG efforts. We're continuously enhancing our strategy in this area and increasing our communications regarding the progress we have made and will continue to make. For example, to our knowledge, we were the first utility company, and we believe the only U.S. company in any sector, to hold a dedicated ESG-focused Investor Day meeting. We created a new Board-level Sustainability and Corporate Responsibility Committee that oversees our approach to these matters. We have updated our emissions reduction goals to be more aggressive. We have improved our disclosures across-the-board, including inclusion of comparable ESG metrics. They are included in the appendix of these earnings call materials.
We have directly engaged with our largest institutional investors outside of proxy season in discussions about Dominion's industry-leading positions on these issues. And we are only 1 of 3 utility companies that have implemented an environmental justice policy, which ensures that all stakeholders including local communities have a voice in decisions on infrastructure investments. We believe that as investors become increasingly discerning around ESG criteria, Dominion's industry-leading efforts will be rewarded with a differentiated positive investment outlook.
I will turn now to recent updates related to our major investment initiatives. Earlier this month, we began construction of our $300 million offshore wind pilot project. The project was approved by Virginia regulators in November of last year and is a critical initial step in what has the potential to become a multiyear, multibillion dollar capital deployment in zero-carbon offshore wind energy. Recall that our Virginia offshore lease should accommodate over 2 gigawatts of generation capacity based on expected technology advancements, which is significantly more than what we have accounted for over our 5-year planning horizon. We continue to make progress on the $2 billion to $3 billion new pump storage facility. It would be an excellent complement to the intermittency of the increased wind and solar resources across our system.
During the second quarter, we narrowed the search for a potential location, and we'll spend the remainder of this year and part of next conducting more extensive surveys. The Virginia General Assembly has found the construction of such a facility to be in the public interest.
Next, relicensing of our existing regulated nuclear units in Virginia is an up to $4 billion capital program that supports safe, reliable and affordable energy for customers and is an important source of zero-carbon electricity production. During the second quarter, our nuclear station in Surry County generated its 500 billionth kilowatt-hour of zero-carbon electricity. Put that into context, 500 billion kilowatt-hours would power the entire state of Virginia for 5.5 years in a carbon-free manner.
Later this week, we will file our first battery pilot program. We will pair batteries with solar facilities to begin the integration of peak shifting and clipping as well as test of reliability benefits of batteries on our distribution grid.
On Slide 12, we have charted positive trends across 2 significant growth drivers for our power delivery business. On the left side, you can see the growth in electric transmission rate base, which will continue as we execute on the 5-year, $4.3 billion capital plan we shared at our Investor Day in March. These transmission investments improve system reliability to the benefit of our customers. On the right side, you see the impressive growth in data center capacity, which we also expect to continue for years to come. Our capital planning calls for $1.7 billion of investment associated with customer growth, including data centers over the next 5 years.
And finally, with regard to the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Supply Header. Our customers continue to need these project's capacity to serve their existing customers, move toward a low-carbon future and enable new economic development. It is noteworthy that natural gas prices in the region that will be served by the project remain among the highest in the country. We are pleased that the Solicitor General filed an appeal to the Supreme Court of the Fourth Circuit Cowpasture decision as it relates to ACP's crossing underneath the Appalachian Trail. To date, 16 states, the AGA, INGA, the Chamber of Commerce, several unions, the National Association of Manufacturers, Mountain Valley Pipeline have all filed amicus briefs. 
History indicates cases appealed by the Solicitor General have an approximately 70% chance of being considered. We expect that in October or November, the Supreme Court will schedule arguments to occur in the spring of next year with a final decision no later than June 2020. We are confident that the Fourth Circuit's ruling will be overturned. And though at present, we are not publicly discussing potential administrative or legislative alternatives, the options that have been described by the developers of the Mountain Valley Pipeline should be expected to be applicable to the Atlantic Coast Pipeline.
We are disappointed that last week, the Fourth Circuit vacated the project's biological opinion. Over recent months, we have been taking steps to bolster the official record of the case in the event the court ruled negatively. These steps include the additional surveying of the rusty patched bumblebee along the Project corridor, which has been underway since mid-June. There's nothing in the court's opinion on the 4 species that we expect would prevent the biological opinion from being reissued in time to recommence construction by year-end and complete critical path tree filling during the November through March window.
We have included in the appendix a list of select outstanding regulatory reauthorizations, including resolution timing expectations. Based on the assumptions, our current project cost and in-service timing expectations remain consistent with the guidance we provided earlier this year on our fourth quarter earnings call.
Before I complete my remarks, I would like to add my personal thanks and well wishes to our colleagues who have opted to retire on an accelerated time line. Your legacy of living our core values will leave a lasting impression at Dominion Energy and you will be missed.
With that, I will summarize today's release as follows: we are on track to achieve full year safety results that are consistent with the record-setting performances of recent years. We are actively engaged throughout the company on initiatives that are focused on creating shareholder, customer and other stakeholder value by making Dominion Energy more efficient, sustainable and transparent. 
We achieved operating earnings per share above, or on a weather-normalized basis, at the midpoint of our guidance range. We are affirming our full year operating earnings per share guidance and our long-term growth rates. Our key regulated jurisdictions stand apart as premium locations in which to do business. We are making progress across our capital investment programs to the benefit of our customers. And we have a strong environmental, social and governance track record and strategy, and we will continue to increase our engagement with customers, shareholders and other stakeholders on those topics.
We will now be happy to answer your questions."

For 2020, fair enough, think about double that amount so $0.10 to $0.12. So just put that in context. So $0.04 of weather hurt this year 6 months, we don't know what that will be the rest of the year. Or, of course, in 2020 that kind of thing stands ready to offset. When it comes to ACP, as a reminder, our guidance on the contribution from ACP in 2018 last year was $0.07. This year, it's $0.11. Next year, we have a little more visibility but not on a granular basis yet regarding the exact timing of recommencement and the sculpting of capital spend through 2020. So what the contribution in 2020 is, we don't yet know exactly but call it mid-teens to high teens, at best, contribution. So the $0.10 to $0.12 stands available to offset various unforeseen challenges, but that kind of puts it in context versus ACP, which you're asking is a lot smaller."

And obviously, for the norm, we don't really comment on material M&A. But I'm using color on the way we think about this. So we're always considering ways to create shareholder value to derisk our plan, to take our exposure to regulated and regulated-like businesses which now 95%, take it up towards 100%. So last year in 2018, obviously we made a lot of progress in that respect, as you know. 
And this year, that continued but on a totally different scale. We're really focusing on that last 5%, for the most part, of things that are not core or not regulated or regulated-like. For example, we divested a 15-megawatt fuel cell asset we had in Connecticut it's called Bridgeport, it's $35 million this year. We also divested our stake in NedPower, the wind facility in West Virginia. The amount was undisclosed but is modest. 
We're also fielding and thinking about what to do with another wind asset we own in Indiana, which is Fowler Ridge, no decisions there yet, early days. So that kind of thing, we're always thinking about it but it's very modest. Now I say that to put in context for retail, which is your question. So there are press reports about potential sales of our retail gas and -- there also, we've been fielding inbound inquiries on all of it, on the part that is in Georgia that was formerly SCANA business, on the legacy Dominion business. And we're thinking through that. There's certainly no decision. 
But importantly, we're thinking about what to do generally, so it's not so focused on the process. Should we keep it as well? How can we grow it? Could there be ways to grow through JV, for example, or some other structure? So it's more thinking along the lines as opposed to, ""Let's sell this thing,"" because we're probably not going to do that if it's not accretive. So no decisions, lots of thought processes. But no, nothing to share and not sure that there will be."

I know it's a little bit funny to talk about that savings as being kind of available for unforeseen headwinds, weather is the most prevalent. We always talk about the potentially material impact of weather now in Virginia and South Carolina on our earnings guidance ranges and where we end up. So it's hard to point any one thing because we feel pretty good about where we are at this stage, given what's to come in the next 2 quarters. 
And let me address that a little more. So last year, as we sat here on our second quarter call and we looked at kind of what was remaining, what we needed to do after our first 2 quarters to get to the midpoint of our guidance range, we needed $2.03. So this year, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the cadence is different. We have a back-end loaded profile to our EPS accrual through the second half of the year. So last year was $2.03. This year, it's $2.36, so bigger company, more earnings, but we also need -- have a little bit of catch-up, it's back-end loaded. 
The reasons for that and the reasons we are comfortable with that are there's things that are generally set out in that right-hand side of Page 7 in our deck. So the Millstone outage, $0.08 to $0.10. Last year was in fourth quarter, and for the most part, this year, done in spring. The net capacity expansion, PJM with Greensville in the mix now starting in June, $0.06 to $0.08. The VRP also in the mix, $0.05 to $0.06. Southeast Energy Group didn't have it last year, $0.04 to $0.06. 
And then another basket of things, they're smaller but regulated investment across our utility business for the next 6 months: the Millstone PPA we mentioned, assuming that comes into place October 1; and then the continued impact of O&M to the next 6 months. So in our minds, we don't really have one thing that the VRP will offset. It's just there and available. So we anticipate Julien a question, which was what if nothing comes up this year or next year? And there also, we're saying, I've said that it's not additive to our guidance. 
So if nothing comes up and we're in the lucky position of not having any headwinds that aren't expected or such event, what I would do is identify areas in O&M to advance spending in order to use that VRP savings to derisk our guidance, our earnings guidance for a longer period of time. So not a very direct answer to your question but that's the way we think about the VRP savings and what it will potentially help us with over the next period."

Of course, we're under construction on the 2 offshore wind turbines now, doing the onshore construction next summer will complete the 2 test turbines. In terms of the offshore wind economics, we've been watching very closely what's been happening throughout New England. I would say that the life cycle cost equivalent, LCOE, in those markets have been, call it, $85 and potentially higher. There's some speculation what may happen with production tax credits for offshore wind. Might they be renewed or not? We don't know. 
In Virginia, we're looking at the need to get the life cycle cost equivalent down closer to maybe the $80 range, which means we need to see about a 15% to 20% capital cost improvement. We think that those costs can move in that direction once we stand up the U.S. supply chain. That's been a real benefit that they've seen in Europe is being able to scale up the supply chain. 
And we also think that the development of larger turbines, 11 megawatt and greater, will drop those costs down closer to what we think we need in order to really see the build-out in Virginia. So we're watching all of that very closely. We think the time frame that we have in mind, which is '23, '24 and kind of beyond, we think that those cost reductions are achievable.

Before I walk through the quarterly results, which were above the midpoint of our guidance range, I wanted to highlight Dominion Energy's key investment themes, all of which are consistent with the messaging from our Investor Day in March. 
At the highest level, we delivered exceptional value to our customers, our communities, our employees and our shareholders. We do this by providing affordable, reliable and sustainable energy to our customers. Approximately 2/3 of our operating income comes from our state-regulated utility operations whose customers center around 5 key states. Our demand pull utility center [indiscernible] transmission storage customers account for most of the rest of our operating income. Together, these regulated and regulated-light customers comprise approximately 95% of our total operating income. From 2019 through 2023, we plan to invest $26 billion in growth capital programs that will modernize, strengthen and improve the sustainability of our systems to the benefit of these customers. Further, we do this by engaging with the communities in which we live and work by being responsible stewards of the environment and by focus -- focusing relentlessly on the safety of our nearly 20,000 employees. Tom will touch on these 3 topics more extensively in his remarks. 
Finally, we do this by delivering financial results that are consistently within our guidance for earnings and dividend growth. As an example, this quarter's results represent the 15th consecutive quarter of delivering weather-normalized operating earnings per share that are at or above the midpoint of our quarterly guidance range and, also, the 15th consecutive quarter of being in or above the range without weather normalizing. And today, we are also reaffirming our annual and long-term growth guidance. 
Turning now to the quarterly results on Slide 4. Today, we reported third quarter 2019 operating earnings of $1.18 per share compared to our guidance range of $1 to $1.20 per share. Strong performance across our segments was aided by better than normal weather, which increased utility earnings by about $0.05 per share. Adjusted for normal weather, operating earnings for the quarter were $1.13 per share, which is also above the midpoint of our guidance range. 
GAAP earnings for the quarter were $1.17 per share. A reconciliation of operating earnings to reported earnings can be found on Schedule 2 of the earnings release kit. 
On Slide 5, we've summarized several milestones achieved since our last call. First, Millstone began to sell electricity under the 0 carbon power contract with Connecticut Utilities on October 1. Under the 10-year contract, Millstone will sell 9 million-megawatt hours of electricity per year, representing 55% of the plant's output at a fixed price of $49.99 per megawatt hour. This contract, the financial impact of which is incorporated into our existing guidance, recognizes the tremendous value of Millstone's environmental and other attributes for the state and the region. 
For the plant output not covered by the contract, we will continue to employ a prudent hedging strategy. Note that the contract does not cover capacity as the entire plant is expected to continue to be compensated via the existing regional capacity program. We are pleased with this agreement as it ensures the ongoing financial viability of the plant, and we wish to thank the Governor's office, [indiscernible] and the electric utilities who work in a collaborative and thoughtful fashion to safeguard the state's environment, the economy, employment and energy security. 
Next, we continue to achieve constructive results across our various and normal course state level regulatory proceedings. In North Carolina, we reached a nearly complete settlement with commission staff for our electric operations in the state, with interim rates based on a 9.75% ROE to be effective this month. 
In Utah, our gas distribution business has filed its first post-merger base rate proceeding, which we expect will conclude early next year. 
Finally, we expect resolution of our Virginia ROE proceeding later this month. The updated ROE will impact in the near term approximately $4 billion of rate base currently earning ride of returns of 9.2%, plus adders of up to 1%. We estimate that every 50 basis point change in ROE would impact near-term rider earnings by between $0.01 and $0.02 per share per year. 
Next, we expect to complete the transition to our newly -- new operating segments by the end of this year. As a reminder, and as shown on Slide 6, we are reorganizing the way we manage and report our operating segments to more closely align with their customer and regulatory profile. During our fourth quarter earnings call, early next year, we expect to provide our 2019 full year results and 2020 guidance in conformity with these updated segments. 
As discussed previously, we believe that this new reporting structure will make our company more accessible and will highlight the premium nature of each of our businesses. 
Turning to Slide 7. On October 21, we announced that as part of our previously communicated intention to establish a permanent capital structure for the Cove Point facility, we reached an agreement with a financial investor affiliated with Brookfield to participate in an equity recapitalization of that asset. This transaction, the financial impacts of which are already included in our existing earnings and growth -- earnings growth guidance accomplishes several key objectives, including highlighting the intrinsic value created through Dominion's 5-year development efforts with an implied enterprise value of nearly $8.25 billion compared to a construction cost at the time of liquefaction completion of just over $4 million; redeploying capital from the low-growth annuity type area into our robust regulated growth capital program; preserving full operational control of the facility with no impact on existing customer contracts or employees; and reducing Dominion's annual common equity financing needs in the coming years from the levels described in our March Investor Day. Immediately upon close, expected later this year, we will use 100% of the proceeds to retire parent level debt. 
This transaction, which attractively addresses the equity portion for the facility's long-term capital structure, is step 1 of 2 as we intend to finalize long-term debt related to the asset in the near future. 
Moving quickly to credit. During 2018, we took major steps to improve our balance sheet while also reducing our business risk profile. We expect that our full year 2019 credit metrics will be supportive of our existing credit ratings, with debt coverage ratios normalized for merger-related charges in the mid-teens. 
Moving now to operating earnings guidance on Slide 8. As usual, our operating earnings guidance ranges assume normal weather, variations from which could cause results to be towards the top or the bottom of these ranges. 
For the fourth quarter, we're initiating guidance of $1.10 to $1.25 per share. Positive factors as compared to last year include the absence of the Millstone refueling outage, growth from regulated investment across electric and gas utility programs, contribution from the Southeast Energy Group, commitment of the Millstone 0 carbon contract, net capacity expense improvement and the impact of O&M initiatives. 
Negative factors as compared to last year include the impact of 2018 asset sales, share issuance [indiscernible] and return to normal weather. This fourth quarter guidance implies a narrowing of our 2019 full year guidance range to $4.15 to $4.30 per share with no change to the midpoint of our original guidance. 
Before I turn it over to Tom, let me summarize that today, we reported our 15th consecutive quarter of weather-normalized operating EPS at or above the midpoint of our guidance range. We are confirming the midpoint and narrowing our guidance range for 2019 full year operating EPS. And we are reiterating our long-term EPS growth expectation of approximately 5% next year and 5% plus thereafter. 
I'll now turn the call over to Tom."

We are focused on continuing that trend over the last 2 months of 2019. 
Turning to Slide 9. I will now address the topics Jim mentioned in his remarks. First, 3 weeks ago, we released our latest sustainability and corporate responsibility report. It's our most comprehensive report to date, and it delivers on the company's commitment to complete transparency. It embraces ESG disclosure best practices. It includes information on corporate governance and stakeholder engagement, social and workforce metrics, and indices that map to standards from the global reporting initiative and the Sustainability Accounting Standards board as well as the United Nations sustainable development goals. 
Key highlights from the report include: Dominion has reduced carbon dioxide emissions by 52% since 2005. We have also prevented more than 250,000 metric tons of methane entering the atmosphere from our gas infrastructure assets in the past decade, which is the equivalent of planting more than 100 million trees. The company has raised its diverse hiring rate from 27% to 42% from 2013 to 2018, and 1 in every 5 new hires is a veteran. In 2018, Dominion contributed nearly $35 million social betterment, and employees volunteered more than 126,000 hours in community service. In August, we announced plans for the largest electric school bus initiative in the nation. This innovative effort aims to replace 100% of the approximately 13,000 diesel-powered school buses in our Virginia electric utility service territory by 2030, which would be the equivalent in emission reductions of removing 65,000 cars from the road. The vehicle to grid technology allows the bus batteries to store and then release energy out of the grid during periods of high demand when the buses are not in use. 
Finally, last week, we announced that we are expanding our 50-50 partnership with Smithfield Foods to become the largest renewable natural gas supplier in the nation. In total, we are doubling our combined investment over the next 10 years to half a billion dollars, which will allow us to capture [ RNG ] that reduces greenhouse gas emissions that are equivalent to taking 500,000 cars off the road. We're planting 40 million new trees. We are one of the most sustainable and innovative energy companies in the United States, and we believe that our customers and shareholders will benefit from our efforts. 
Turning to Slide 10. We have several important initiatives underway in Virginia. First, offshore wind. Last month, we received key approvals from the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, BOEM, regarding the design, fabrication and installation of our 12-megawatt pilot project, which is under construction and scheduled to enter service late next year. The knowledge and experience we obtained from the permitting, construction and operations pilot will be invaluable as we embark on our program to develop 2.6 gigawatts of utility-scale offshore wind in support of Governor [ Northam's ] recent executive order number 43. That order provided clear direction to policymakers and agencies regarding the state's sustainable energy future as well as a challenge to Dominion Energy to accelerate the time line to look more renewables on our system, a challenge we embrace. 
Our intention is to bring the project, which is located 27 miles off the coast of Virginia Beach, online in 3 phases of 880 megawatts each. The 3 phases will enter service in 2024, 2025 and 2026, and taken together, will be the largest offshore wind installation in the United States. The projects will be developed and owned by Dominion Energy Virginia, with regulated cost recovery subject to approval by the Virginia State Corporation Commission. Our current 5-year capital plan provided at our Investor Day identifies $1.1 billion for offshore wind, inclusive of $300 million for the pilot, preliminary cost estimates, which we will work hard to reduce in the interest of customer savings, total an additional $7 billion. We anticipate capital expenditures to ramp up in the latter part of our current 5-year plan, with the most significant investment to take place in 2024 through 2026. 
We look forward to working closely with policymakers, regulators and other stakeholders to establish Virginia as the center of the United States offshore wind industry. Efforts presently underway include ocean survey work and the development of the construction and operations plan, which is targeted for submittal to BOEM late next year. We will make additional details available as we continue to make progress. 
Offshore wind is just one of the many investment programs that we continue to execute on for the benefit of our customers and in accordance with the Grid Transformation and Security Act. 4 weeks ago, we filed for a second phase of grid transformation investments to complement the cyber and physical security and telecommunication investments already approved by the SEC this past January. This second phase, which calls for over $500 million of capital investments through 2021, will enhance service to customers through implementation of new technologies and a series of new programs developed with input from stakeholders and customers over the past several months as well as a thorough third-party cost benefit analysis. That analysis concluded that the planned investments will deliver significant benefit to all customers across a wide range of areas while also driving down -- driving reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, increasing economic growth in the commonwealth and providing savings to electric vehicle owners. This phase includes the installation of nearly 1 million smart meters as well as a new customer information platform, which allows customers to digitally manage their energy use. Our prudency determination is expected in about 6 months, with a recovery determination thereafter. 
Overall, we expect our grid transformation investment programs to total nearly $3 billion over a 10-year period. 
Finally, 2 weeks ago, we announced an agreement with the Commonwealth of Virginia that combined with previously announced contracts will produce enough renewable power to meet roughly 45% of the state's government's annual energy use, which is the largest state renewable energy procurement in the country. To accomplish this, Dominion will own approximately 345 megawatts of new solar facilities and sell the output of the state under a long-term power purchase group. The balance of the megawatts will come from a third-party-owned wind farm. With these projects, we are nearly halfway fulfilling the commitment we made to Governor [ Northam ] to have 3,000 megawatts of solar and wind resources in service or under development in Virginia by 2022. 
Turning to Slide 11. We have provided a brief summary of capital investment related to the TTSA. As you can see, we are taking significant steps in successfully implementing programs that have been identified by state policymakers is crucial for our state. Over the last several months, the SEC has approved approximately $1.6 billion of capital investment with an additional $800 million filed in pending approval. During the third quarter, the commission approved rider recovery for nearly $300 million of our [ Rider E ] request, which was related to environmental upgrades at certain generating units. Since the last state-wide election that took place 2 years ago, Virginia's policymakers have supported on a bipartisan basis, common sense utility legislation that puts the Commonwealth firmly on a sustainable and modernized path to continued delivery of low carbon, affordable and resilient power. 
Notable examples include the Grid Transformation & Security Act in 2018 and comprehensive [ Coal Ash ] and rural broadband solutions in 2019. As we execute on these policy priorities, we remain vigilant of customer [indiscernible]. We intend to keep rates reasonable and competitive in the future, just as they are today. 
Turning to Slide 12. We continue to see very strong customer growth across our gas distribution franchise. Pending under our rider investment programs, including pipeline replacement, is tracking in line with the 5-year approximately $2 billion CapEx plan highlighted at our Investor Day. Last week, we received approval from the Utah Public Service Commission to proceed with our investment in a regulated reliability-driven LNG peaking facility. And in West Virginia, regulators recently approved a plan that will allow us to double our annual investment in replacing infrastructure by 2023. In South Carolina, our integration efforts and focus on operational excellence continues to proceed successfully. 
In early September, as Hurricane Dorian swept up the East Coast, nearly 300,000 of our South Carolina electric customers as well as over 170,000 of our North Carolina and Virginia customers experienced service disruptions. Our crews worked around the clock in hazardous conditions to quickly and safely restore power. In fact, in all 3 states, including South Carolina, where nearly 40% of our customers lost power, service was restored in less than 3 days. As part of our commitment to relief efforts across Virginia, North and South Carolina, we also donated $250,000 to the American Red Cross to support the purchase supplies and food as well as shelter for those in need. 
Turning next to the Atlantic Coast pipeline on Slide 13. Consistent with our expectations, the United States Supreme Court granted our appeal of the Fourth Circuit [indiscernible] decision, which relates to ACP's crossing underneath the Appalachian trail. We expect that the Supreme Court will schedule arguments to occur late winter or early spring of next year with a final decision no later than June 2020. We are confident in our legal position and believe that the Fourth Circuit's ruling will be overturned. Our focus remains on the Supreme Court appeal, but all other options remain available. 
Let me also address 2 other points. Regarding the project's biological opinion, I will reiterate our commentary from last quarter that there's nothing in the court's opinion on the 4 species that we expect would prevent the biological opinion from being reissued during this winter's tree felling window. However, even if the timing of the BO reissuance prevents us for taking full advantage of the window, including through the end of the first half of next year, we do not expect the existing project cost estimate of $7.3 billion to $7.8 billion to change. This cost range, which we provided early this year, incorporated a variety of potential permit resolution and construction recommencement time lines, including a successful AT Supreme Court appeal. We continue to expect project construction to be completed by the end of 2021, with full commissioning to conclude in early 2022. 
This past Tuesday, the Fourth Circuit heard arguments regarding an appeal of our Buckingham compressor station, minor source air permit. We remain confident that the extraordinary protections undertaken at the site as adapted to address -- and as adapted to address community input more than satisfied both the process and substance required by applicable law. The permit provides for the most stringent controls for any compressor station in the United States. We have demonstrated that emissions measured at and beyond the station fence line will meet the highest public health standards as applied to even the most sensitive populations and environments. We expect the court to issue a ruling within the next 3 months. We expect the project will be able to deliver significant volumes to customers under our current time line, even if the permit needs more time to be resolved. 
I will also note that since the last quarterly call, we have continued to advance discussions with Atlantic Coast Pipeline customers regarding the equitable resolution of project cost increases. We expect to reach an agreement in principle by the end of this year, and we are confident that the result will satisfactory balance customer rates with project returns. Our customers' demand for this critical and common sense energy infrastructure is unwavering. 
Turning to Slide 14. Early last month, we announced several leadership changes to better reflect the new financial and operating reporting structure that will take effect later this year. [ Bob Blue ], currently CEO of the Power Delivery Group, will assume responsibility for Dominion Energy Virginia and Dominion Energy Contracted Generation. Brian [indiscernible], currently CEO of the Gas Infrastructure Group, will assume responsibility for Dominion Energy South Carolina, Gas Transmission and Storage and Gas Distribution. In addition, Bob and Diane will each assume the title of Co-Chief Operating Officer. [indiscernible], currently Chief Administrative and Compliance Officer, will become the Chief of Staff for Dominion Energy and President of Dominion Energy Services. Bob, Diane, Carter and Jim Chapman, as Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, will continue to report directly to me. These leaders are exceptionally well-qualified to play important roles in the execution of our long-term strategy, and I congratulate them. 
I also want to thank Paul Koonce, who will retire in the coming months, for his many years of dedicated service to our company. His contributions will be missed, and we wish him all the very best in his future endeavors. 
With that, I will summarize today's release as follows: We are on track to achieve full year safety results that are consistent with the record-setting performance of recent years. We continue to take industry-leading innovative steps to demonstrate our leadership on environmental, social and governance matters. We achieved weather-normalized operating earnings that exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range for the 15th consecutive quarter. We are narrowing our full year 2019 operating earnings per share guidance and affirming our original midpoint. We are reiterating our long-term EPS growth expectations of approximately 5% next year and 5% plus thereafter. And we are making significant progress across our capital investment programs to the benefit of our customers. 
We will now be happy to answer your questions."

We've been working on this project for 6 years. We bought the right lease option, at lease rights in the 2013 auction that was run by phone. And ever since that time, we've been working with a variety of stakeholders to make sure we have the right plan, and we have the right folks to help us do the pilot. We got approval from the State Corporation Commission. It's been through phone. We have the permits for BOEM. One of the things to keep in mind that differentiates us from the New England situation is we own the entire lease for the entire coastal region of Virginia, and it's 26 miles offshore. It is not in fishing grounds, and it is not visible from the shore. So it's a very significant differentiating aspects of what's going on here in Virginia and what you've seen happen in New England. But from the macro level, and now I'll turn it over to Paul to answer the balance of your question."

And sort of bigger picture is VRP, offshore wind, the rate plans you have in Virginia, is there a point in time when you can change the way you guide to growth, i.e., moving from 5 plus more of a range, especially as we're trying to model what the incremental accretion is from offshore wind because it just seems like between Cove Point, your plan is becoming much more visible. So is there a point in time when you can start to layer in more of a definitive growth range versus 5 plus?"

So the spending and then the associated earnings, as I just walked through, the $1.1 billion, including the pilot, I mean, that's in our plan. It's in our earnings guidance. There are no changes for now on that front. 
On the VRP, you're right, that's kind of done and dusted earlier this year. We talked about that as being a savings of, call it, $0.05 to $0.06 this year, maybe double that on a full run rate next year and finishing over time as it's get it back to customers. So that -- we talked about that as being available savings to offset unforeseen headwinds, and that's still the case. But as an update this year, as you know, the vast majority of our business, 95% of our business is not commodity exposed in any way, the 5% that's not regulated or regulated like is. And within that 5% of our operating earnings, there are a couple of things. One is, obviously, the gas commodity environment is weak, and our business is largely immune to that. We have a little bit of exposure mostly around our single remaining processing plant, which is in West Virginia, and that's a little bit of a headwind as those businesses go from like very small to even smaller this year. So that's a little bit of a headwind. More materially, though, this [indiscernible] program that has been very successful. As you know, Shar, this is monetizing acreage and mineral resources below our storage field. We announced that program in early 2015, and we gave guidance to the end of the decade of $450 million to $500 million of pretax earnings, and we've been ticking along that kind of like clockwork. We're 75% do that, that guidance. But given the pricing, given the commodity environment and the pricing that's available to us today, we're choosing not to transact on a [indiscernible] this year. And we're going to hold that acreage net value for [indiscernible] transactions in future periods when there's an improvement in the commodity pricing environment. 
So what that means is, obviously, we've just reiterated our guidance, same midpoint. So that means we've overcome any unforeseen headwind, previously unforeseen relating to our decision not to transact on a [indiscernible] this year. So that's basically the VRP savings, which we're using it pretty much as we described we would, VRP savings and other initiatives to overcome that decision. But no change to our guidance.

And he specifically said that he recognize that there may be some who I want to push back on that, on whether it was necessary, required or a good thing for Virginia, that he was going to work very hard to ensure that the public policy and regulatory support is in place to carry out this plan, and it was only after those statements that we went ahead with our announcement to full deployment, although we had been working, obviously, because we filed for the PGM -- PJM interconnection agreement. 
So there's obviously a process in front of us. We are highly confident that it will be carried out to fruition. There is a lot of public support from this -- for this project, including from political leaders on both sides of the political fence, both Democrats and Republicans want to see this thing happen. 
So we have -- obviously, there are there -- a long way to go on it, but we have high confidence level in it going forward. It'll be the only offshore wind farm in federal waters. It will not be visible from the shore line. So you don't have any of these visual impacts of concern people. The environmental community is very supportive of the project going forward. The economic development people in Tidewater, Virginia are very supportive of this going forward. 
So obviously, we don't have any guarantees of that, Steve, but we have a very high confidence level in the outcome."

Before I walk through the quarterly results, which were above the midpoint of our guidance range, I wanted to highlight Dominion Energy's key investment themes, all of which are consistent with the messaging from our Inves",1285,"Thanks, Steve, and good morning. Before I walk through the quarterly results, which were above the midpoint of our guidance range, I wanted to highlight Dominion Energy's key investment themes, all of which are consistent with the messaging from our Investor Day in March.
At the highest level, we delivered exceptional value to our customers, our communities, our employees and our shareholders. We do this by providing affordable, reliable and sustainable energy to our customers. Approximately 2/3 of our operating income comes from our state-regulated utility operations whose customers center around 5 key states. Our demand pull utility-centered FERC transmission and storage customers account for most of the rest of our operating income. Together, these regulated and regulated-like customers comprise approximately  95% of our total operating income. From 2019 through 2023, we plan to invest $26 billion in growth capital programs that will modernize, strengthen and improve the sustainability of our systems to the benefit of these customers. Further, we do this by engaging with the communities in which we live and work by being responsible stewards of the environment and by focusing relentlessly on the safety of our nearly 20,000 employees. Tom will touch on these 3 topics more extensively in his remarks.
Finally, we do this by delivering financial results that are consistently within our guidance for earnings and dividend growth. As an example, this quarter's results represent the 15th consecutive quarter of delivering weather-normalized operating earnings per share that are at or above the midpoint of our quarterly guidance range and also the 15th consecutive quarter of being in or above the range without weather normalizing. And today, we are also reaffirming our annual and long-term growth guidance.
Turning now to the quarterly results on Slide 4. Today, we reported third quarter 2019 operating earnings of $1.18 per share compared to our guidance range of $1 to $1.20 per share. Strong performance across our segments was aided by better-than-normal weather, which increased utility earnings by about $0.05 per share. Adjusted for normal weather, operating earnings for the quarter were $1.13 per share, which is also above the midpoint of our guidance range. GAAP earnings for the quarter were $1.17 per share. A reconciliation of operating earnings to reported earnings can be found on Schedule 2 of the earnings release kit.
On Slide 5, we've summarized several milestones achieved since our last call. First, Millstone began to sell electricity under the 0 carbon power contract with Connecticut utilities on October 1. Under the 10-year contract, Millstone will sell 9 million megawatt hours of electricity per year, representing 55% of the plant's output at a fixed price of $49.99 per megawatt hour. This contract, the financial impact of which is incorporated into our existing guidance, recognizes the tremendous value of Millstone's environmental and other attributes for the state and the region.
For the plant output not covered by the contract, we will continue to employ a prudent hedging strategy. Note that the contract does not cover capacity as the entire plant is expected to continue to be compensated via the existing regional capacity program.
We are pleased with this agreement as it ensures the ongoing financial viability of the plant, and we wish to thank the Governor's office, DEEP, PURA and the electric utilities who work in a collaborative and thoughtful fashion to safeguard the state's environment, the economy, employment and energy security.
Next, we continue to achieve constructive results across our various and normal course state-level regulatory proceedings. In North Carolina, we reached a nearly complete settlement with commission staff for our electric operations in the state with interim rates based on a 9.75% ROE to be effective this month. In Utah, our gas distribution business has filed its first post-merger base rate proceeding, which we expect will conclude early next year. Finally, we expect resolution of our Virginia ROE proceeding later this month. The updated ROE will impact in the near term approximately $4 billion of rate base currently earning rider returns of 9.2%, plus adders of up to 1%. We estimate that every 50 basis point change in ROE would impact near-term rider earnings by between $0.01 and $0.02 per share per year.
Next, we expect to complete the transition to our newly -- new operating segments by the end of this year. As a reminder, and as shown on Slide 6, we are reorganizing the way we manage and report our operating segments to more closely align with their customer and regulatory profile. During our fourth quarter earnings call early next year, we expect to provide our 2019 full year results and 2020 guidance in conformity with these updated segments. As discussed previously, we believe that this new reporting structure will make our company more accessible and will highlight the premium nature of each of our businesses.
Turning to Slide 7. On October 21, we announced that as part of our previously communicated intention to establish a permanent capital structure for the Cove Point facility, we reached an agreement with a financial investor affiliated with Brookfield to participate in an equity recapitalization of that asset. This transaction, the financial impacts of which are already included in our existing earnings and growth -- earnings growth guidance, accomplishes several key objectives, including: highlighting the intrinsic value created through Dominion's 5-year development efforts with an implied enterprise value of nearly $8.25 billion compared to a construction cost at the time of liquefaction completion of just over $4 billion; redeploying capital from the low-growth annuity-type area into our robust regulated growth capital program; preserving full operational control of the facility with no impact on existing customer contracts or employees; and reducing Dominion's annual common equity financing needs in the coming years from the levels described in our March Investor Day. Immediately upon close, expected later this year, we will use 100% of the proceeds to retire parent-level debt. This transaction, which attractively addresses the equity portion of the facility's long-term capital structure, is step 1 of 2 as we intend to finalize long-term debt related to the asset in the near future.
Moving quickly to credit. During 2018, we took major steps to improve our balance sheet while also reducing our business risk profile. We expect that our full year 2019 credit metrics will be supportive of our existing credit ratings, with debt coverage ratios normalized for merger-related charges in the mid-teens.
Moving now to operating earnings guidance on Slide 8. As usual, our operating earnings guidance ranges assume normal weather, variations from which could cause results to be towards the top or the bottom of these ranges. For the fourth quarter, we're initiating guidance of $1.10 to $1.25 per share. Positive factors as compared to last year include the absence of the Millstone refueling outage, growth from regulated investment across electric and gas utility programs, contribution from the Southeast Energy Group, commitment of the Millstone 0 carbon contract, net capacity expense improvement and the impact of O&M initiatives.
Negative factors as compared to last year include the impact of 2018 asset sales, share issuances and a return to normal weather. This fourth quarter guidance implies a narrowing of our 2019 full year guidance range to $4.15 to $4.30 per share with no change to the midpoint of our original guidance.
Before I turn it over to Tom, let me summarize that today, we reported our 15th consecutive quarter of weather-normalized operating EPS at or above the midpoint of our guidance range. We are confirming the midpoint and narrowing our guidance range for 2019 full year operating EPS. And we are reiterating our long-term EPS growth expectation of approximately 5% next year and 5% plus thereafter.
I'll now turn the call over to Tom."

I'm pleased to report that our year-to-date safety performance is consistent with the record-setting results we have achieved in the last few years.

I'm pleased to report that our year-to-date safety performance is consistent with the record-setting results we have achieved in the last few years. We are focused on continuing that trend over the last 2 months of 2019.
Turning to Slide 9. I will now address the topics Jim mentioned in his remarks. First, 3 weeks ago, we released our latest sustainability and corporate responsibility report. It's our most comprehensive report to date, and it delivers on the company's commitment to complete transparency. It embraces ESG disclosure best practices. It includes information on corporate governance and stakeholder engagement, social and workforce metrics and indices that map to standards from the Global Reporting Initiative and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board as well as the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals.
Key highlights from the report include: Dominion has reduced carbon dioxide emissions by 52% since 2005. We have also prevented more than 250,000 metric tons of methane entering the atmosphere from our gas infrastructure assets in the past decade, which is the equivalent of planting more than 100 million trees. The company has raised its diverse hiring rate from 27% to 42% from 2013 to 2018, and 1 in every 5 new hires is a veteran. In 2018, Dominion contributed nearly $35 million social betterment, and employees volunteered more than 126,000 hours in community service. In August, we announced plans for the largest electric school bus initiative in the nation. This innovative effort aims to replace 100% of the approximately 13,000 diesel-powered school buses in our Virginia electric utility service territory by 2030, which would be the equivalent in emission reductions of removing 65,000 cars from the road. The vehicle-to-grid technology allows the bus batteries to store and then release energy out of the grid during periods of high demand when the buses are not in use.
Finally, last week, we announced that we are expanding our 50-50 partnership with Smithfield Foods to become the largest renewable natural gas supplier in the nation. In total, we are doubling our combined investment over the next 10 years to $0.5 billion, which will allow us to capture RNG that reduces greenhouse gas emissions that are equivalent to taking 500,000 cars off the road or planting 40 million new trees. We are one of the most sustainable and innovative energy companies in the United States, and we believe that our customers and shareholders will benefit from our efforts.
Turning to Slide 10. We have several important initiatives underway in Virginia. First, offshore wind. Last month, we received key approvals from the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, BOEM, regarding the design, fabrication and installation of our 12-megawatt pilot project, which is under construction and scheduled to enter service late next year. The knowledge and experience we obtained from the permitting, construction and operations pilot will be invaluable as we embark on our program to develop 2.6 gigawatts of utility-scale offshore wind in support of Governor Northam's recent executive order number 43. That order provided clear direction to policymakers and agencies regarding the state's sustainable energy future as well as a challenge to Dominion Energy to accelerate the time line for more renewables on our system, a challenge we embrace.
Our intention is to bring the project, which is  located 27 miles off the coast of Virginia Beach, online in 3 phases of 880 megawatts each. The 3 phases will enter service in 2024, 2025 and 2026, and taken together, will be the largest offshore wind installation in the United States. The projects will be developed and owned by Dominion Energy Virginia, with regulated cost recovery subject to approval by the Virginia State Corporation Commission.
Our current 5-year capital plan provided at our Investor Day identifies $1.1 billion for offshore wind, inclusive of $300 million for the pilot. Preliminary cost estimates, which we will work hard to reduce in the interest of customer savings, total an additional $7 billion. We anticipate capital expenditures to ramp up in the latter part of our current 5-year plan, with the most significant investment to take place in 2024 through 2026.
We look forward to working closely with policymakers, regulators and other stakeholders to establish Virginia as the center of the United States offshore wind industry. Efforts presently underway include ocean survey work and the development of the construction and operations plan, which is targeted for submittal to BOEM late next year. We will make additional details available as we continue to make progress.
Offshore wind is just one of the many investment programs that we continue to execute on for the benefit of our customers and in accordance with the Grid Transformation & Security Act. 4 weeks ago, we filed for a second phase of grid transformation investments to complement the cyber and physical security and telecommunication investments already approved by the SEC this past January. This second phase, which calls for over $500 million of capital investments through 2021, will enhance service to customers through implementation of new technologies and a series of new programs developed with input from stakeholders and customers over the past several months as well as a thorough third-party cost benefit analysis. That analysis concluded that the planned investments will deliver significant benefit to all customers across a wide range of areas while also driving down -- driving reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, increasing economic growth in the commonwealth and providing savings to electric vehicle owners. This phase includes the installation of nearly 1 million smart meters as well as a new customer information platform, which allows customers to digitally manage their energy use. Our prudency determination is expected in about 6 months, with a recovery determination thereafter. Overall, we expect our grid transformation investment programs to total nearly $3 billion over a 10-year period.
Finally, 2 weeks ago, we announced an agreement with the Commonwealth of Virginia that, combined with previously announced contracts, will produce enough renewable power to meet roughly 45% of the state government's annual energy use, which is the largest state renewable energy procurement in the country. To accomplish this, Dominion will own approximately 345 megawatts of new solar facilities and sell the output to the state under a long-term power purchase script. The balance of the megawatts will come from a third-party-owned wind farm. With these projects, we are nearly halfway fulfilling the commitment we made to Governor Northam to have 3,000 megawatts of solar and wind resources in service or under development in Virginia by 2022.
Turning to Slide 11. We have provided a brief summary of capital investment related to the GTSA. As you can see, we are taking significant steps in successfully implementing programs that have been identified by state policymakers as crucial for our state. Over the last several months, the SEC has approved approximately $1.6 billion of capital investment with an additional $800 million filed in pending approval. During the third quarter, the commission approved rider recovery for nearly $300 million of our Rider E request, which was related to environmental upgrades at certain generating units.
Since the last state-wide election that took place 2 years ago, Virginia's policymakers have supported on a bipartisan basis common sense utility legislation that puts the commonwealth firmly on a sustainable and modernized path to continued delivery of low-carbon, affordable and resilient power. Notable examples include the Grid Transformation & Security Act in 2018 and comprehensive coal ash and rural broadband solutions in 2019. As we execute on these policy priorities, we remain vigilant of customer bill impacts. We intend to keep rates reasonable and competitive in the future, just as they are today.
Turning to Slide 12. We continue to see very strong customer growth across our gas distribution franchise. Pending under our rider investment programs, including pipeline replacement, is tracking in line with the 5-year, approximately $2 billion CapEx plan highlighted at our Investor Day. Last week, we received approval from the Utah Public Service Commission to proceed with our investment in a regulated, reliability-driven LNG peaking facility. And in West Virginia, regulators recently approved a plan that will allow us to double our annual investment in replacing infrastructure by 2023. In South Carolina, our integration efforts and focus on operational excellence continue to proceed successfully.
In early September, as Hurricane Dorian swept up the East Coast, nearly 300,000 of our South Carolina electric customers as well as over 170,000 of our North Carolina and Virginia customers experienced service disruptions. Our crews worked around the clock in hazardous conditions to quickly and safely restore power. In fact, in all 3 states, including South Carolina where nearly 40% of our customers lost power, service was restored in less than 3 days. As part of our commitment to relief efforts across Virginia, North and South Carolina, we also donated $250,000 to the American Red Cross to support the purchase supplies and food as well as shelter for those in need.
Turning next to the Atlantic Coast Pipeline on Slide 13. Consistent with our expectations, the United States Supreme Court granted our appeal of the Fourth Circuit's Cowpasture decision, which relates to ACP's crossing underneath the Appalachian trail. We expect that the Supreme Court will schedule arguments to occur late winter or early spring of next year with a final decision no later than June 2020. We are confident in our legal position and believe that the Fourth Circuit's ruling will be overturned. Our focus remains on the Supreme Court appeal, but all other options remain available.
Let me also address 2 other points. Regarding the project's biological opinion, I will reiterate our commentary from last quarter that there is nothing in the court's opinion on the 4 species that we expect would prevent the biological opinion from being reissued during this winter's tree felling window. However, even if the timing of the BO reissuance prevents us for taking full advantage of the window, including through the end of the first half of next year, we do not expect the existing project cost estimate of $7.3 billion to $7.8 billion to change. This cost range, which we provided early this year, incorporated a variety of potential permit resolution and construction recommencement time lines, including a successful AT Supreme Court appeal. We continue to expect project construction to be completed by the end of 2021, with full commissioning to conclude in early 2022.
This past Tuesday, the Fourth Circuit heard arguments regarding an appeal of our Buckingham Compressor Station minor source air permit. We remain confident that the extraordinary protections undertaken at the site as adapted to address -- and as adapted to address community input more than satisfy both the process and substance required by applicable law. The permit provides for the most stringent controls for any compressor station in the United States. We have demonstrated that emissions measured at and beyond the station's fence line will meet the highest public health standards as applied to even the most sensitive populations and environments. We expect the court to issue a ruling within the next 3 months. We expect the project will be able to deliver significant volumes to customers under our current time line, even if the permit needs more time to be resolved.
I will also note that since the last quarterly call, we have continued to advance discussions with Atlantic Coast Pipeline customers regarding the equitable resolution of project cost increases. We expect to reach an agreement in principle by the end of this year, and we are confident that the result will satisfactorily balance customer rates with project returns. Our customers' demand for this critical and common sense energy infrastructure is unwavering.
Turning to Slide 14. Early last month, we announced several leadership changes to better reflect the new financial and operating reporting structure that will take effect later this year. Bob Blue, currently CEO of the Power Delivery Group, will assume responsibility for Dominion Energy Virginia and Dominion Energy Contracted Generation. Diane Leopold, currently CEO of the Gas Infrastructure Group, will assume responsibility for Dominion Energy South Carolina, Gas Transmission and Storage and Gas Distribution. In addition, Bob and Diane will each assume the title of Co-Chief Operating Officer. Carter Reid, currently Chief Administrative and Compliance Officer, will become the Chief of Staff for Dominion Energy and President of Dominion Energy Services. Bob, Diane, Carter and Jim Chapman, as Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, will continue to report directly to me. These leaders are exceptionally well qualified to play important roles in the execution of our long-term strategy, and I congratulate them. I also want to thank Paul Koonce who will retire in the coming months for his many years of dedicated service to our company. His contributions will be missed, and we wish him all the very best in his future endeavors.
With that, I will summarize today's release as follows: We are on track to achieve full year safety results that are consistent with the record-setting performance of recent years. We continue to take industry-leading innovative steps to demonstrate our leadership on environmental, social and governance matters. We achieved weather-normalized operating earnings that exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range for the 15th consecutive quarter. We are narrowing our full year 2019 operating earnings per share guidance and affirming our original midpoint. We are reiterating our long-term EPS growth expectations of approximately 5% next year and 5% plus thereafter. And we are making significant progress across our capital investment programs to the benefit of our customers.
We will now be happy to answer your questions."

The -- and Jim Chapman can answer any further questions on the financing. I would mention we are expecting rider recovery, and we'll seek rider approval for all 3 phases. We've been working on this project for 6 years. We bought the right lease option, the lease rights, in a 2013 auction that was run by BOEM. And ever since that time, we've been working with a variety of stakeholders to make sure we had the right plan and we had the right folks to help us do the pilot. We got approval from the State Corporation Commission. It's been through BOEM. We had the permits from BOEM.
One of the things to keep in mind that differentiates us from the New England situation is we own the entire lease for the entire coastal region of Virginia. And it's 26 miles offshore. It is not in fishing grounds, and it is not visible from the shore. So it's a very significant differentiating aspects of what's going on here in Virginia and what you've seen happen in New England but -- from the macro level. And now I'll turn it over to Paul to answer the balance of your question."

So we know the stakeholders, we know the process, and we feel really pretty good about it. I'll ask Jim to comment on financing."

So the majority of the spending to come in our current planning horizon is already in our plans that we walked through. And the rest, we'll update over time as time comes closer.

And sort of bigger picture is VRP, offshore wind, the rate plans you have in Virginia, is there a point in time when you can change the way you guide to growth, i.e., moving from 5% plus more of a range, especially as we're trying to model what the incremental accretion is from offshore wind? Because it just seems like between Cove Point, your plan is becoming much more visible. So is there a point in time when you can start to layer in more of a definitive growth range versus 5% plus?"
267105,639722447,1850251,"Dominion Energy, Inc., Q3 2019 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2019",2019-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Dominion Energy, Inc.","Executives","Sure.

So the spending and then the associated earnings, as I just walked through, the $1.1 billion, including the pilot, I mean, that's in our plan. It's in our earnings guidance. There are no changes for now on that front.
On the VRP, you're right, that's kind of done and dusted earlier this year. We talked about that as being a savings of, call it, $0.05 to $0.06 this year, maybe double that on a full run rate next year and diminishing over time as it's getting back to customers. So that -- we talked about that as being available savings to offset unforeseen headwinds, and that's still the case. But as an update, this year, as you know, the vast majority of our business, 95% of our business, is not commodity exposed in any way, the 5% that's not regulated or regulated-like is. And within that 5% of our operating earnings, there are a couple of things. One is, obviously, the gas commodity environment is weak, and our business is largely immune to that. We have a little bit of exposure mostly around our single remaining processing plant, which is in West Virginia, and that's a little bit of a headwind as those businesses go from like very small to even smaller this year. So that's a little bit of a headwind.
More materially, though, this farm-out program, that has been very successful. As you know, Shar, this is monetizing acreage and mineral resources below our storage field. We announced that program in early 2015, and we gave guidance to the end of the decade of $450 million to $500 million of pretax earnings, and we've been ticking along that kind of like clockwork. We're 75% through that guidance. But given the pricing, given the commodity environment and the pricing that's available to us today, we're choosing not to transact on a farm-out this year. And we're going to hold that acreage and that value for farm-out transactions in future periods when there's an improvement in the commodity pricing environment.
So what that means is, obviously, we've just reiterated our guidance, same midpoint. So that means we've overcome any unforeseen headwind, previously unforeseen, relating to our decision not to transact on a farm-out this year. So that's basically the VRP savings, which we're using it pretty much as we described we would, VRP savings and other initiatives to overcome that decision. So no change to our guidance. Those are the [indiscernible]."

Governor Northam, a few -- I guess a couple of months ago now, called for the construction of this wind farm because it's his intention to help Virginia develop into the center of the offshore wind industry along the East Coast, and that's a challenge that we embrace. And he specifically said that he recognized that there may be some who want to push back on that, on whether it was necessary, required or a good thing for Virginia, that he was going to work very hard to ensure that the public policy and regulatory support is in place to carry out this plan. And it was only after those statements that we went ahead with our announcement to full deployment, although we had been working obviously because we filed for the PGM -- PJM interconnection agreement.
So there's obviously a process in front of us. We are highly confident that it will be carried out to fruition. There is a lot of public support from this -- for this project, including from political leaders on both sides of the political fence, both Democrats and Republicans, that want to see this thing happen.
So we have -- obviously, there are -- a long way to go on it, but we have high confidence level in it going forward. It'll be the only offshore wind farm in federal waters. It will not be visible from the shore line. So you don't have any of these visual impacts that concern people. The environmental community is very supportive of the project going forward. The economic development people in Tidewater, Virginia, are very supportive of this going forward. So obviously, we don't have any guarantees of that, Steve, but we have a very high confidence level in the outcome."

Just in terms of ITC and safe harboring, of course, as you know, in order to qualify for ITC, a treatment for an offshore wind farm, you have to begin construction this year. We're looking at that. We don't have anything to comment about that, but we're aware of that timing. There may be some things that we can do to safe harbor certain of those costs. So we're exploring that, more to come on that in 2020.
In terms of plans and filings, we're not -- as Tom said, we're going to file for the BOEM application this time next year. We're not prepared to say exactly when we're going to file for the SEC application, but I can tell you that we will be conducting many public meetings over the course of 2020 as we make the environmental assessment. Obviously, marine life, plant and birds, we'll be doing ocean mapping, and we'll be doing geotech analysis or subsurface analysis. So you will begin to see all that sort of play out in 2020, and I think that will be a good way to sort of pace when we might expect to make an SEC filing."

Before I walk through the quarterly results, which were above the midpoint of our guidance range, I wanted to highlight Dominion Energy's key investment themes, all of which are consistent with the messaging from our Inves",1284,"Thanks, Steve, and good morning. Before I walk through the quarterly results, which were above the midpoint of our guidance range, I wanted to highlight Dominion Energy's key investment themes, all of which are consistent with the messaging from our Investor Day in March.
At the highest level, we delivered exceptional value to our customers, our communities, our employees and our shareholders. We do this by providing affordable, reliable and sustainable energy to our customers. Approximately 2/3 of our operating income comes from our state-regulated utility operations whose customers center around 5 key states. Our demand pull utility-centered FERC transmission and storage customers account for most of the rest of our operating income. Together, these regulated and regulated-like customers comprise approximately 95% of our total operating income. From 2019 through 2023, we plan to invest $26 billion in growth capital programs that will modernize, strengthen and improve the sustainability of our systems to the benefit of these customers. Further, we do this by engaging with communities in which we live and work, by being responsible stewards of the environment and by focusing relentlessly on the safety of our nearly 20,000 employees. Tom will touch on these 3 topics more extensively in his remarks.
Finally, we do this by delivering financial results that are consistently within our guidance for earnings and dividend growth. As an example, this quarter's results represent the 15th consecutive quarter of delivering weather-normalized operating earnings per share that are at or above the midpoint of our quarterly guidance range and also the 15th consecutive quarter of being in or above the range without weather normalizing. And today, we are also reaffirming our annual and long-term growth guidance.
Turning now to the quarterly results on Slide 4. Today, we reported third quarter 2019 operating earnings of $1.18 per share compared to our guidance range of $1 to $1.20 per share. Strong performance across our segments was aided by better-than-normal weather, which increased utility earnings by about $0.05 per share. Adjusted for normal weather, operating earnings for the quarter were $1.13 per share, which is also above the midpoint of our guidance range. GAAP earnings for the quarter were $1.17 per share. A reconciliation of operating earnings to reported earnings can be found on Schedule 2 of the earnings release kit.
On Slide 5, we've summarized several milestones achieved since our last call. First, Millstone began to sell electricity under the 0 carbon power contract with Connecticut utilities on October 1. Under the 10-year contract, Millstone will sell 9 million megawatt hours of electricity per year, representing 55% of the plant's output at a fixed price of $49.99 per megawatt hour. This contract, the financial impact of which is incorporated into our existing guidance, recognizes the tremendous value of Millstone's environmental and other attributes for the state and the region.
For the plant output not covered by the contract, we will continue to employ a prudent hedging strategy. Note that the contract does not cover capacity as the entire plant is expected to continue to be compensated via the existing regional capacity program.
We are pleased with this agreement as it ensures the ongoing financial viability of the plant, and we wish to thank the Governor's office, DEEP, PURA and the electric utilities who work in a collaborative and thoughtful fashion to safeguard the state's environment, the economy, employment and energy security.
Next, we continue to achieve constructive results across our various and normal course state-level regulatory proceedings. In North Carolina, we reached a nearly complete settlement with commission staff for our electric operations in the state with interim rates based on a 9.75% ROE to be effective this month. In Utah, our gas distribution business has filed its first post-merger base rate proceeding, which we expect will conclude early next year. Finally, we expect resolution of our Virginia ROE proceeding later this month. The updated ROE will impact in the near term approximately $4 billion of rate base currently earning rider returns of 9.2%, plus adders of up to 1%. We estimate that every 50 basis point change in ROE would impact near-term rider earnings by between $0.01 and $0.02 per share per year.
Next, we expect to complete the transition to our newly -- new operating segments by the end of this year. As a reminder, and as shown on Slide 6, we are reorganizing the way we manage and report our operating segments to more closely align with their customer and regulatory profiles. During our fourth quarter earnings call early next year, we expect to provide our 2019 full year results and 2020 guidance in conformity with these updated segments. As discussed previously, we believe that this new reporting structure will make our company more accessible and will highlight the premium nature of each of our businesses.
Turning to Slide 7. On October 21, we announced that as part of our previously communicated intention to establish a permanent capital structure for the Cove Point facility, we reached an agreement with a financial investor affiliated with Brookfield to participate in an equity recapitalization of that asset. This transaction, the financial impacts of which are already included in our existing earnings and growth -- earnings growth guidance, accomplishes several key objectives, including: highlighting the intrinsic value created through Dominion's 5-year development efforts with an implied enterprise value of nearly $8.25 billion compared to a construction cost at the time of liquefaction completion of just over $4 billion; redeploying capital from the low-growth annuity-type area into our robust regulated growth capital program; preserving full operational control of the facility with no impact on existing customer contracts or employees; and reducing Dominion's annual common equity financing needs in the coming years from the levels described in our March Investor Day. Immediately upon close, expected later this year, we will use 100% of the proceeds to retire parent-level debt. This transaction, which attractively addresses the equity portion of the facility's long-term capital structure, is step 1 of 2 as we intend to finalize long-term debt related to the asset in the near future.
Moving quickly to credit. During 2018, we took major steps to improve our balance sheet while also reducing our business risk profile. We expect that our full year 2019 credit metrics will be supportive of our existing credit ratings, with debt coverage ratios normalized for merger-related charges in the mid-teens.
Moving now to operating earnings guidance on Slide 8. As usual, our operating earnings guidance ranges assume normal weather, variations from which could cause results to be towards the top or the bottom of these ranges. For the fourth quarter, we're initiating guidance of $1.10 to $1.25 per share. Positive factors as compared to last year include the absence of the Millstone refueling outage, growth from regulated investment across electric and gas utility programs, contribution from the Southeast Energy Group, commencement of the Millstone 0 carbon contract, net capacity expense improvement and the impact of O&M initiatives.
Negative factors as compared to last year include the impact of 2018 asset sales, share issuances and a return to normal weather. This fourth quarter guidance implies a narrowing of our 2019 full year guidance range to $4.15 to $4.30 per share with no change to the midpoint of our original guidance.
Before I turn it over to Tom, let me summarize that today, we reported our 15th consecutive quarter of weather-normalized operating EPS at or above the midpoint of our guidance range. We are confirming the midpoint and narrowing our guidance range for 2019 full year operating EPS. And we are reiterating our long-term EPS growth expectation of approximately 5% next year and 5% plus thereafter.
I'll now turn the call over to Tom."

I'm pleased to report that our year-to-date safety performance is consistent with the record-setting results we have achieved in the last few years. We are focused on continuing that trend over the last 2 months of 2019.
Turning to Slide 9. I will now address the topics Jim mentioned in his remarks. First, 3 weeks ago, we released our latest sustainability and corporate responsibility report. It's our most comprehensive report to date, and it delivers on the company's commitment to complete transparency. It embraces ESG disclosure best practices. It includes information on corporate governance and stakeholder engagement, social and workforce metrics and indices that map to standards from the Global Reporting Initiative and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board as well as the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals.
Key highlights from the report include: Dominion has reduced carbon dioxide emissions by 52% since 2005. We have also prevented more than 250,000 metric tons of methane entering the atmosphere from our gas infrastructure assets in the past decade, which is the equivalent of planting more than 100 million trees. The company has raised its diverse hiring rate from 27% to 42% from 2013 to 2018, and 1 in every 5 new hires is a veteran. In 2018, Dominion contributed nearly $35 million to social betterment, and employees volunteered more than 126,000 hours in community service. In August, we announced plans for the largest electric school bus initiative in the nation. This innovative effort aims to replace 100% of the approximately 13,000 diesel-powered school buses in our Virginia electric utility service territory by 2030, which would be the equivalent in emission reductions of removing 65,000 cars from the road. The vehicle-to-grid technology allows the bus batteries to store and then release energy out of the grid during periods of high demand when the buses are not in use.
Finally, last week, we announced that we are expanding our 50-50 partnership with Smithfield Foods to become the largest renewable natural gas supplier in the nation. In total, we are doubling our combined investment over the next 10 years to $0.5 billion, which will allow us to capture RNG that reduces greenhouse gas emissions that are equivalent to taking 500,000 cars off the road or planting 40 million new trees. We are one of the most sustainable and innovative energy companies in the United States, and we believe that our customers and shareholders will benefit from our efforts.
Turning to Slide 10. We have several important initiatives underway in Virginia. First, offshore wind. Last month, we received key approvals from the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, BOEM, regarding the design, fabrication and installation of our 12-megawatt pilot project, which is under construction and scheduled to enter service late next year. The knowledge and experience we obtain from the permitting, construction and operations pilot will be invaluable as we embark on our program to develop 2.6 gigawatts of utility-scale offshore wind in support of Governor Northam's recent executive order number 43. That order provided clear direction to policymakers and agencies regarding the state's sustainable energy future as well as a challenge to Dominion Energy to accelerate the timeline for more renewables on our system, a challenge we embrace.
Our intention is to bring the project, which is located 27 miles off the coast of Virginia Beach, online in 3 phases of 880 megawatts each. The 3 phases will enter service in 2024, 2025 and 2026, and taken together, will be the largest offshore wind installation in the United States. The projects will be developed and owned by Dominion Energy Virginia, with regulated cost recovery subject to approval by the Virginia State Corporation Commission.
Our current 5-year capital plan provided at our Investor Day identifies $1.1 billion for offshore wind, inclusive of $300 million for the pilot. Preliminary cost estimates, which we will work hard to reduce in the interest of customer savings, total an additional $7 billion. We anticipate capital expenditures to ramp up in the latter part of our current 5-year plan, with the most significant investment to take place in 2024 through 2026.
We look forward to working closely with policymakers, regulators and other stakeholders to establish Virginia as the center of the United States offshore wind industry. Efforts presently underway include ocean survey work and the development of the construction and operations plan, which is targeted for submittal to BOEM late next year. We will make additional details available as we continue to make progress.
Offshore wind is just one of the many investment programs that we continue to execute on for the benefit of our customers and in accordance with the Grid Transformation & Security Act. Four weeks ago, we filed for a second phase of grid transformation investments to complement the cyber and physical security and telecommunication investments already approved by the SEC this past January. This second phase, which calls for over $500 million of capital investments through 2021, will enhance service to customers through implementation of new technologies and a series of new programs developed with input from stakeholders and customers over the past several months as well as a thorough third-party cost benefit analysis. That analysis concluded that the planned investments will deliver significant benefit to all customers across a wide range of areas while also driving down -- driving reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, increasing economic growth in the commonwealth and providing savings to electric vehicle owners. This phase includes the installation of nearly 1 million smart meters as well as a new customer information platform, which allows customers to digitally manage their energy use. A prudency determination is expected in about 6 months, with a recovery determination thereafter. Overall, we expect our grid transformation investment programs to total nearly $3 billion over a 10-year period.
Finally, 2 weeks ago, we announced an agreement with the Commonwealth of Virginia that, combined with previously announced contracts, will produce enough renewable power to meet roughly 45% of the state government's annual energy use, which is the largest state renewable energy procurement in the country. To accomplish this, Dominion will own approximately 345 megawatts of new solar facilities and sell the output to the state under a long-term power purchase agreement. The balance of the megawatts will come from a third-party-owned wind farm. With these projects, we are nearly halfway fulfilling the commitment we made to Governor Northam to have 3,000 megawatts of solar and wind resources in service or under development in Virginia by 2022.
Turning to Slide 11. We have provided a brief summary of capital investment related to the GTSA. As you can see, we are taking significant steps in successfully implementing programs that have been identified by state policymakers as crucial for our state. Over the last several months, the SEC has approved approximately $1.6 billion of capital investment with an additional $800 million filed and pending approval. During the third quarter, the commission approved rider recovery for nearly $300 million of our Rider E request, which was related to environmental upgrades of certain generating units.
Since the last state-wide election that took place 2 years ago, Virginia's policymakers have supported on a bipartisan basis common sense utility legislation that puts the commonwealth firmly on a sustainable and modernized path to continued delivery of low-carbon, affordable and resilient power. Notable examples include the Grid Transformation & Security Act in 2018 and comprehensive coal ash and rural broadband solutions in 2019. As we execute on these policy priorities, we remain vigilant of customer bill impacts. We intend to keep rates reasonable and competitive in the future, just as they are today.
Turning to Slide 12. We continue to see very strong customer growth across our gas distribution franchise. Pending under our rider investment programs, including pipeline replacement, is tracking in line with the 5-year, approximately $2 billion CapEx plan highlighted at our Investor Day. Last week, we received approval from the Utah Public Service Commission to proceed with our investment in a regulated, reliability-driven LNG peaking facility. And in West Virginia, regulators recently approved a plan that will allow us to double our annual investment in replacing infrastructure by 2023. In South Carolina, our integration efforts and focus on operational excellence continue to proceed successfully.
In early September, as Hurricane Dorian swept up the East Coast, nearly 300,000 of our South Carolina electric customers as well as over 170,000 of our North Carolina and Virginia customers experienced service disruptions. Our crews worked around the clock in hazardous conditions to quickly and safely restore power. In fact, in all 3 states, including South Carolina where nearly 40% of our customers lost power, service was restored in less than 3 days. As part of our commitment to relief efforts across Virginia, North and South Carolina, we also donated $250,000 to the American Red Cross to support the purchase supplies and food as well as shelter for those in need.
Turning next to the Atlantic Coast Pipeline on Slide 13. Consistent with our expectations, the United States Supreme Court granted our appeal of the Fourth Circuit's Cowpasture decision, which relates to ACP's crossing underneath the Appalachian trail. We expect that the Supreme Court will schedule arguments to occur late winter or early spring of next year with a final decision no later than June 2020. We are confident in our legal position and believe that the Fourth Circuit's ruling will be overturned. Our focus remains on the Supreme Court appeal, but all other options remain available.
Let me also address 2 other points. Regarding the project's biological opinion, I will reiterate our commentary from last quarter that there is nothing in the court's opinion on the 4 species that we expect would prevent the biological opinion from being reissued during this winter's tree felling window. However, even if the timing of the BO reissuance prevents us for taking full advantage of the window, including through the end of the first half of next year, we do not expect the existing project cost estimate of $7.3 billion to $7.8 billion to change. This cost range, which we provided early this year, incorporated a variety of potential permit resolution and construction recommencement time lines, including a successful AT Supreme Court appeal. We continue to expect project construction to be completed by the end of 2021, with full commissioning to conclude in early 2022.
This past Tuesday, the Fourth Circuit heard arguments regarding an appeal of our Buckingham Compressor Station minor source air permit. We remain confident that the extraordinary protections undertaken at the site as adapted to address -- and as adapted to address community input more than satisfy both the process and substance required by applicable law. The permit provides for the most stringent controls for any compressor station in the United States. We have demonstrated that emissions measured at and beyond the station's fence line will meet the highest public health standards as applied to even the most sensitive populations and environments. We expect the court to issue a ruling within the next 3 months. We expect the project will be able to deliver significant volumes to customers under our current timeline, even if the permit needs more time to be resolved.
I will also note that since the last quarterly call, we have continued to advance discussions with Atlantic Coast Pipeline customers regarding the equitable resolution of project cost increases. We expect to reach an agreement in principle by the end of this year, and we are confident that the result will satisfactorily balance customer rates with project returns. Our customers' demand for this critical and common sense energy infrastructure is unwavering.
Turning to Slide 14. Early last month, we announced several leadership changes to better reflect the new financial and operating reporting structure that will take effect later this year. Bob Blue, currently CEO of the Power Delivery Group, will assume responsibility for Dominion Energy Virginia and Dominion Energy Contracted Generation. Diane Leopold, currently CEO of the Gas Infrastructure Group, will assume responsibility for Dominion Energy South Carolina, Gas Transmission and Storage and Gas Distribution. In addition, Bob and Diane will each assume the title of Co-Chief Operating Officer. Carter Reid, currently Chief Administrative and Compliance Officer, will become the Chief of Staff for Dominion Energy and President of Dominion Energy Services. Bob, Diane, Carter and Jim Chapman, as Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, will continue to report directly to me. These leaders are exceptionally well qualified to play important roles in the execution of our long-term strategy, and I congratulate them. I also want to thank Paul Koonce who will retire in the coming months for his many years of dedicated service to our company. His contributions will be missed, and we wish him all the very best in his future endeavors.
With that, I will summarize today's release as follows: We are on track to achieve full year safety results that are consistent with the record-setting performance of recent years. We continue to take industry-leading innovative steps to demonstrate our leadership on environmental, social and governance matters. We achieved weather-normalized operating earnings that exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range for the 15th consecutive quarter. We are narrowing our full year 2019 operating earnings per share guidance and affirming our original midpoint. We are reiterating our long-term EPS growth expectations of approximately 5% next year and 5% plus thereafter. And we are making significant progress across our capital investment programs to the benefit of our customers.
We will now be happy to answer your questions."

The -- and Jim Chapman can answer any further questions on the financing. I would mention we are expecting rider recovery, and we'll seek rider approval for all 3 phases. We've been working on this project for 6 years. We bought the right lease option, the lease rights, in a 2013 auction that was run by BOEM. And ever since that time, we've been working with a variety of stakeholders to make sure we had the right plan and we had the right folks to help us do the pilot. We got approval from the State Corporation Commission. It's been through BOEM. We had the permits from BOEM.
One of the things to keep in mind that differentiates us from the New England situation is we own the entire lease for the entire coastal region of Virginia. And it's 26 miles offshore. It is not in fishing grounds, and it is not visible from the shore. So it's very significant differentiating aspects of what's going on here in Virginia and what you've seen happen in New England but -- from the macro level. And now I'll turn it over to Paul to answer the balance of your question."

And having -- as Tom mentioned, having just gone through it on the CVOW project, while that was a research area permit and this is a commercial and operating permit, the process is identical. So we know the stakeholders, we know the process, and we feel really pretty good about it. I'll ask Jim to comment on financing."

So the majority of the spending to come in our current planning horizon is already in our plans that we walked through. And the rest, we'll update over time as time comes closer. But given what Tom and Paul just described, this is all in a regulatory construct to be financed at VEPCO. It's certainly achievable, but the details will come in the next period."

And sort of bigger picture is VRP, offshore wind, the rate plans you have in Virginia, is there a point in time when you can change the way you guide to growth, i.e., moving from 5% plus more of a range, especially as we're trying to model what the incremental accretion is from offshore wind? Because it just seems like between Cove Point, your plan is becoming much more visible. So is there a point in time when you can start to layer in more of a definitive growth range versus 5% plus?"

So the spending and then the associated earnings, as I just walked through, the $1.1 billion, including the pilot, I mean, that's in our plan. It's in our earnings guidance. There are no changes for now on that front.
On the VRP, you're right, that's kind of done and dusted earlier this year. We talked about that as being a savings of, call it $0.05 to $0.06 this year, maybe double that on a full run rate next year and diminishing over time as it's  given back to customers. So that -- we talked about that as being available savings to offset unforeseen headwinds, and that's still the case. But as an update, this year, as you know, the vast majority of our business, 95% of our business, is not commodity exposed in any way, the 5% that's not regulated or regulated-like is. And within that 5% of our operating earnings, there's a couple things. One is, obviously, the gas commodity environment is weak, and our business is largely immune to that. We have a little bit of exposure mostly around our single remaining processing plant, which is in West Virginia, and that's a little bit of a headwind as those businesses go from like very small to even smaller this year. So that's a little bit of a headwind.
More materially, though, this farm-out program, that has been very successful. As you know, Shar, this is monetizing acreage and mineral resources below our storage field. We announced that program in early 2015, and we gave guidance to the end of the decade of $450 million to $500 million of pretax earnings, and we've been ticking along that kind of like clockwork. We're 75% through that guidance. But given the pricing, given the commodity environment and the pricing that's available to us today, we're choosing not to transact on a farm-out this year. And we're going to hold that acreage and that value for farm-out transactions in future periods when there's an improvement in the commodity pricing environment.
So what that means is, obviously, we've just reiterated our guidance, same midpoint. So that means we've overcome any unforeseen headwind, previously unforeseen, relating to our decision not to transact on a farm-out this year. So that's basically the VRP savings, which we're using it pretty much as we described we would, VRP savings and other initiatives to overcome that decision. So no change to our guidance. Those are the [indiscernible] parts."

Governor Northam, a few -- I guess a couple months ago now, called for the construction of this wind farm because it's his intention to help Virginia develop into the center of the offshore wind industry along the East Coast, and that's a challenge that we embrace. And he specifically said that he recognized that there may be some who want to push back on that, on whether it was necessary, required or a good thing for Virginia, that he was going to work very hard to ensure that the public policy and regulatory support was in place to carry out this plan. And it was only after those statements that we went ahead with our announcement to full deployment, although we had been working obviously because we filed for the PGM -- PJM interconnection agreement.
So there's obviously a process in front of us. We are highly confident that it will be carried out to fruition. There is a lot of public support from this -- for this project, including from political leaders on both sides of the political fence, both Democrats and Republicans, that want to see this thing happen.
So we have -- obviously, there are -- a long way to go on it, but we have high confidence level in it going forward. It'll be the only offshore wind farm in federal waters. It will not be visible from the shore line. So we don't have any of these visual impacts that concern people. The environmental community is very supportive of the project going forward. The economic development people in Tidewater, Virginia, are very supportive of this going forward. So obviously, we don't have any guarantees of that, Steve, but we have a very high confidence level in the outcome."

We are very concerned here about customer rates. It's something we focus on all the time. And because our goal is to ensure that our customer rates stay very competitive, well below national averages, below the regional averages, as they are now. And we intend for them to stay that way, including with the construction of this wind farm. So we will be working very hard with the fabricators, developers, installers. We will be the operators to ensure that we get the costs down as low as we can as we go ahead, which will be important for everybody involved helping us with the project. So with that, I'll turn it over to Paul."

Julien, again just to follow up on Tom's comments about costs, I think that's one of the key reasons why we broke the project up in 3 phases so that we could continue to let the supply chain mature, let the costs continue to come down so that the impact to rates are minimized.
Just in terms of ITC and safe harboring, of course, as you know, in order to qualify for ITC, a treatment for an offshore wind farm, you have to begin construction this year. We're looking at that. We don't have anything to comment about that, but we're aware of that timing. There may be some things that we can do to safe harbor certain of those costs. So we're exploring that, more to come on that in 2020.
In terms of plans and filings, we're not -- as Tom said, we're going to file for the BOEM application this time next year. We're not prepared to say exactly when we're going to file for the SEC application, but I can tell you that we will be conducting many public meetings over the course of 2020 as we make the environmental assessment. Obviously, marine life, plant and birds, we'll be doing ocean mapping, and we'll be doing geotech analysis or subsurface analysis. So you will begin to see all that sort of play out in 2020, and I think that will be a good way to sort of pace when we might expect to make an SEC filing."

We went through that whole process, very transparently answered all the questions, went to all the meetings.

Before I walk through the quarterly results, which were above the midpoint of our guidance range, I wanted to highlight Dominion Energy's key investment themes, all of which are consistent with the messaging from our Investor Day in March.
At the highest level, we delivered exceptional value to our customers, our communities, our employees and our shareholders. We do this by providing affordable, reliable and sustainable energy to our customers. Approximately 2/3 of our operating income comes from our state-regulated utility operations whose customers center around 5 key states. Our demand pull utility-centered FERC transmission and storage customers account for most of the rest of our operating income. Together, these regulated and regulated-like customers comprise approximately 95% of our total operating income. From 2019 through 2023, we plan to invest $26 billion in growth capital programs that will modernize, strengthen and improve the sustainability of our systems to the benefit of these customers. Further, we do this by engaging with communities in which we live and work, by being responsible stewards of the environment and by focusing relentlessly on the safety of our nearly 20,000 employees. Tom will touch on these 3 topics more extensively in his remarks.
Finally, we do this by delivering financial results that are consistently within our guidance for earnings and dividend growth. As an example, this quarter's results represent the 15th consecutive quarter of delivering weather-normalized operating earnings per share that are at or above the midpoint of our quarterly guidance range and also the 15th consecutive quarter of being in or above the range without weather normalizing. And today, we are also reaffirming our annual and long-term growth guidance.
Turning now to the quarterly results on Slide 4. Today, we reported third quarter 2019 operating earnings of $1.18 per share compared to our guidance range of $1 to $1.20 per share. Strong performance across our segments was aided by better-than-normal weather, which increased utility earnings by about $0.05 per share. Adjusted for normal weather, operating earnings for the quarter were $1.13 per share, which is also above the midpoint of our guidance range. GAAP earnings for the quarter were $1.17 per share. A reconciliation of operating earnings to reported earnings can be found on Schedule 2 of the earnings release kit.
On Slide 5, we've summarized several milestones achieved since our last call. First, Millstone began to sell electricity under the 0 carbon power contract with Connecticut utilities on October 1. Under the 10-year contract, Millstone will sell 9 million megawatt hours of electricity per year, representing 55% of the plant's output at a fixed price of $49.99 per megawatt hour. This contract, the financial impact of which is incorporated into our existing guidance, recognizes the tremendous value of Millstone's environmental and other attributes for the state and the region.
For the plant output not covered by the contract, we will continue to employ a prudent hedging strategy. Note that the contract does not cover capacity as the entire plant is expected to continue to be compensated via the existing regional capacity program.
We are pleased with this agreement as it ensures the ongoing financial viability of the plant, and we wish to thank the Governor's office, DEEP, PURA and the electric utilities who work in a collaborative and thoughtful fashion to safeguard the state's environment, the economy, employment and energy security.
Next, we continue to achieve constructive results across our various and normal course state-level regulatory proceedings. In North Carolina, we reached a nearly complete settlement with commission staff for our electric operations in the state with interim rates based on a 9.75% ROE to be effective this month. In Utah, our gas distribution business has filed its first post-merger base rate proceeding, which we expect will conclude early next year. Finally, we expect resolution of our Virginia ROE proceeding later this month. The updated ROE will impact in the near term approximately $4 billion of rate base currently earning rider returns of 9.2%, plus adders of up to 1%. We estimate that every 50 basis point change in ROE would impact near-term rider earnings by between $0.01 and $0.02 per share per year.
Next, we expect to complete the transition to our newly -- new operating segments by the end of this year. As a reminder, and as shown on Slide 6, we are reorganizing the way we manage and report our operating segments to more closely align with their customer and regulatory profiles. During our fourth quarter earnings call early next year, we expect to provide our 2019 full year results and 2020 guidance in conformity with these updated segments. As discussed previously, we believe that this new reporting structure will make our company more accessible and will highlight the premium nature of each of our businesses.
Turning to Slide 7. On October 21, we announced that as part of our previously communicated intention to establish a permanent capital structure for the Cove Point facility, we reached an agreement with a financial investor affiliated with Brookfield to participate in an equity recapitalization of that asset. This transaction, the financial impacts of which are already included in our existing earnings and growth -- earnings growth guidance, accomplishes several key objectives, including: highlighting the intrinsic value created through Dominion's 5-year development efforts with an implied enterprise value of nearly $8.25 billion compared to a construction cost at the time of liquefaction completion of just over $4 billion; redeploying capital from the low-growth annuity-type area into our robust regulated growth capital program; preserving full operational control of the facility with no impact on existing customer contracts or employees; and reducing Dominion's annual common equity financing needs in the coming years from the levels described in our March Investor Day. Immediately upon close, expected later this year, we will use 100% of the proceeds to retire parent-level debt. This transaction, which attractively addresses the equity portion of the facility's long-term capital structure, is step 1 of 2 as we intend to finalize long-term debt related to the asset in the near future.
Moving quickly to credit. During 2018, we took major steps to improve our balance sheet while also reducing our business risk profile. We expect that our full year 2019 credit metrics will be supportive of our existing credit ratings, with debt coverage ratios normalized for merger-related charges in the mid-teens.
Moving now to operating earnings guidance on Slide 8. As usual, our operating earnings guidance ranges assume normal weather, variations from which could cause results to be towards the top or the bottom of these ranges. For the fourth quarter, we're initiating guidance of $1.10 to $1.25 per share. Positive factors as compared to last year include the absence of the Millstone refueling outage, growth from regulated investment across electric and gas utility programs, contribution from the Southeast Energy Group, commencement of the Millstone 0 carbon contract, net capacity expense improvement and the impact of O&M initiatives.
Negative factors as compared to last year include the impact of 2018 asset sales, share issuances and a return to normal weather. This fourth quarter guidance implies a narrowing of our 2019 full year guidance range to $4.15 to $4.30 per share with no change to the midpoint of our original guidance.
Before I turn it over to Tom, let me summarize that today, we reported our 15th consecutive quarter of weather-normalized operating EPS at or above the midpoint of our guidance range. We are confirming the midpoint and narrowing our guidance range for 2019 full year operating EPS. And we are reiterating our long-term EPS growth expectation of approximately 5% next year and 5% plus thereafter.
I'll now turn the call over to Tom."

I'm pleased to report that our year-to-date safety performance is consistent with the record-setting results we have achieved in the last few years.

I'm pleased to report that our year-to-date safety performance is consistent with the record-setting results we have achieved in the last few years. We are focused on continuing that trend over the last 2 months of 2019.
Turning to Slide 9. I will now address the topics Jim mentioned in his remarks. First, 3 weeks ago, we released our latest sustainability and corporate responsibility report. It's our most comprehensive report to date, and it delivers on the company's commitment to complete transparency. It embraces ESG disclosure best practices. It includes information on corporate governance and stakeholder engagement, social and workforce metrics and indices that map to standards from the Global Reporting Initiative and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board as well as the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals.
Key highlights from the report include: Dominion has reduced carbon dioxide emissions by 52% since 2005. We have also prevented more than 250,000 metric tons of methane entering the atmosphere from our gas infrastructure assets in the past decade, which is the equivalent of planting more than 100 million trees. The company has raised its diverse hiring rate from 27% to 42% from 2013 to 2018, and 1 in every 5 new hires is a veteran. In 2018, Dominion contributed nearly $35 million to social betterment, and employees volunteered more than 126,000 hours in community service. In August, we announced plans for the largest electric school bus initiative in the nation. This innovative effort aims to replace 100% of the approximately 13,000 diesel-powered school buses in our Virginia electric utility service territory by 2030, which would be the equivalent in emission reductions of removing 65,000 cars from the road. The vehicle-to-grid technology allows the bus batteries to store and then release energy out of the grid during periods of high demand when the buses are not in use.
Finally, last week, we announced that we are expanding our 50-50 partnership with Smithfield Foods to become the largest renewable natural gas supplier in the nation. In total, we are doubling our combined investment over the next 10 years to $0.5 billion, which will allow us to capture RNG that reduces greenhouse gas emissions that are equivalent to taking 500,000 cars off the road or planting 40 million new trees. We are one of the most sustainable and innovative energy companies in the United States, and we believe that our customers and shareholders will benefit from our efforts.
Turning to Slide 10. We have several important initiatives underway in Virginia. First, offshore wind. Last month, we received key approvals from the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, BOEM, regarding the design, fabrication and installation of our 12-megawatt pilot project, which is under construction and scheduled to enter service late next year. The knowledge and experience we obtain from the permitting, construction and operations pilot will be invaluable as we embark on our program to develop 2.6 gigawatts of utility-scale offshore wind in support of Governor Northam's recent executive order number 43. That order provided clear direction to policymakers and agencies regarding the state's sustainable energy future as well as a challenge to Dominion Energy to accelerate the timeline for more renewables on our system, a challenge we embrace.
Our intention is to bring the project, which is located 27 miles off the coast of Virginia Beach, online in 3 phases of 880 megawatts each. The 3 phases will enter service in 2024, 2025 and 2026, and taken together, will be the largest offshore wind installation in the United States. The projects will be developed and owned by Dominion Energy Virginia, with regulated cost recovery subject to approval by the Virginia State Corporation Commission.
Our current 5-year capital plan provided at our Investor Day identifies $1.1 billion for offshore wind, inclusive of $300 million for the pilot. Preliminary cost estimates, which we will work hard to reduce in the interest of customer savings, total an additional $7 billion. We anticipate capital expenditures to ramp up in the latter part of our current 5-year plan, with the most significant investment to take place in 2024 through 2026.
We look forward to working closely with policymakers, regulators and other stakeholders to establish Virginia as the center of the United States offshore wind industry. Efforts presently underway include ocean survey work and the development of the construction and operations plan, which is targeted for submittal to BOEM late next year. We will make additional details available as we continue to make progress.
Offshore wind is just one of the many investment programs that we continue to execute on for the benefit of our customers and in accordance with the Grid Transformation & Security Act. Four weeks ago, we filed for a second phase of grid transformation investments to complement the cyber and physical security and telecommunication investments already approved by the SEC this past January. This second phase, which calls for over $500 million of capital investments through 2021, will enhance service to customers through implementation of new technologies and a series of new programs developed with input from stakeholders and customers over the past several months as well as a thorough third-party cost benefit analysis. That analysis concluded that the planned investments will deliver significant benefit to all customers across a wide range of areas while also driving down -- driving reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, increasing economic growth in the commonwealth and providing savings to electric vehicle owners. This phase includes the installation of nearly 1 million smart meters as well as a new customer information platform, which allows customers to digitally manage their energy use. A prudency determination is expected in about 6 months, with a recovery determination thereafter. Overall, we expect our grid transformation investment programs to total nearly $3 billion over a 10-year period.
Finally, 2 weeks ago, we announced an agreement with the Commonwealth of Virginia that, combined with previously announced contracts, will produce enough renewable power to meet roughly 45% of the state government's annual energy use, which is the largest state renewable energy procurement in the country. To accomplish this, Dominion will own approximately 345 megawatts of new solar facilities and sell the output to the state under a long-term power purchase agreement. The balance of the megawatts will come from a third-party-owned wind farm. With these projects, we are nearly halfway fulfilling the commitment we made to Governor Northam to have 3,000 megawatts of solar and wind resources in service or under development in Virginia by 2022.
Turning to Slide 11. We have provided a brief summary of capital investment related to the GTSA. As you can see, we are taking significant steps in successfully implementing programs that have been identified by state policymakers as crucial for our state. Over the last several months, the SEC has approved approximately $1.6 billion of capital investment with an additional $800 million filed and pending approval. During the third quarter, the commission approved rider recovery for nearly $300 million of our Rider E request, which was related to environmental upgrades of certain generating units.
Since the last state-wide election that took place 2 years ago, Virginia's policymakers have supported on a bipartisan basis common sense utility legislation that puts the commonwealth firmly on a sustainable and modernized path to continued delivery of low-carbon, affordable and resilient power. Notable examples include the Grid Transformation & Security Act in 2018 and comprehensive coal ash and rural broadband solutions in 2019. As we execute on these policy priorities, we remain vigilant of customer bill impacts. We intend to keep rates reasonable and competitive in the future, just as they are today.
Turning to Slide 12. We continue to see very strong customer growth across our gas distribution franchise. Pending under our rider investment programs, including pipeline replacement, is tracking in line with the 5-year, approximately $2 billion CapEx plan highlighted at our Investor Day. Last week, we received approval from the Utah Public Service Commission to proceed with our investment in a regulated, reliability-driven LNG peaking facility. And in West Virginia, regulators recently approved a plan that will allow us to double our annual investment in replacing infrastructure by 2023. In South Carolina, our integration efforts and focus on operational excellence continue to proceed successfully.
In early September, as Hurricane Dorian swept up the East Coast, nearly 300,000 of our South Carolina electric customers as well as over 170,000 of our North Carolina and Virginia customers experienced service disruptions. Our crews worked around the clock in hazardous conditions to quickly and safely restore power. In fact, in all 3 states, including South Carolina where nearly 40% of our customers lost power, service was restored in less than 3 days. As part of our commitment to relief efforts across Virginia, North and South Carolina, we also donated $250,000 to the American Red Cross to support the purchase supplies and food as well as shelter for those in need.
Turning next to the Atlantic Coast Pipeline on Slide 13. Consistent with our expectations, the United States Supreme Court granted our appeal of the Fourth Circuit's Cowpasture decision, which relates to ACP's crossing underneath the Appalachian trail. We expect that the Supreme Court will schedule arguments to occur late winter or early spring of next year with a final decision no later than June 2020. We are confident in our legal position and believe that the Fourth Circuit's ruling will be overturned. Our focus remains on the Supreme Court appeal, but all other options remain available.
Let me also address 2 other points. Regarding the project's biological opinion, I will reiterate our commentary from last quarter that there is nothing in the court's opinion on the 4 species that we expect would prevent the biological opinion from being reissued during this winter's tree felling window. However, even if the timing of the BO reissuance prevents us for taking full advantage of the window, including through the end of the first half of next year, we do not expect the existing project cost estimate of $7.3 billion to $7.8 billion to change. This cost range, which we provided early this year, incorporated a variety of potential permit resolution and construction recommencement time lines, including a successful AT Supreme Court appeal. We continue to expect project construction to be completed by the end of 2021, with full commissioning to conclude in early 2022.
This past Tuesday, the Fourth Circuit heard arguments regarding an appeal of our Buckingham Compressor Station minor source air permit. We remain confident that the extraordinary protections undertaken at the site as adapted to address -- and as adapted to address community input more than satisfy both the process and substance required by applicable law. The permit provides for the most stringent controls for any compressor station in the United States. We have demonstrated that emissions measured at and beyond the station's fence line will meet the highest public health standards as applied to even the most sensitive populations and environments. We expect the court to issue a ruling within the next 3 months. We expect the project will be able to deliver significant volumes to customers under our current timeline, even if the permit needs more time to be resolved.
I will also note that since the last quarterly call, we have continued to advance discussions with Atlantic Coast Pipeline customers regarding the equitable resolution of project cost increases. We expect to reach an agreement in principle by the end of this year, and we are confident that the result will satisfactorily balance customer rates with project returns. Our customers' demand for this critical and common sense energy infrastructure is unwavering.
Turning to Slide 14. Early last month, we announced several leadership changes to better reflect the new financial and operating reporting structure that will take effect later this year. Bob Blue, currently CEO of the Power Delivery Group, will assume responsibility for Dominion Energy Virginia and Dominion Energy Contracted Generation. Diane Leopold, currently CEO of the Gas Infrastructure Group, will assume responsibility for Dominion Energy South Carolina, Gas Transmission and Storage and Gas Distribution. In addition, Bob and Diane will each assume the title of Co-Chief Operating Officer. Carter Reid, currently Chief Administrative and Compliance Officer, will become the Chief of Staff for Dominion Energy and President of Dominion Energy Services. Bob, Diane, Carter and Jim Chapman, as Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, will continue to report directly to me. These leaders are exceptionally well qualified to play important roles in the execution of our long-term strategy, and I congratulate them. I also want to thank Paul Koonce who will retire in the coming months for his many years of dedicated service to our company. His contributions will be missed, and we wish him all the very best in his future endeavors.
With that, I will summarize today's release as follows: We are on track to achieve full year safety results that are consistent with the record-setting performance of recent years. We continue to take industry-leading innovative steps to demonstrate our leadership on environmental, social and governance matters. We achieved weather-normalized operating earnings that exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range for the 15th consecutive quarter. We are narrowing our full year 2019 operating earnings per share guidance and affirming our original midpoint. We are reiterating our long-term EPS growth expectations of approximately 5% next year and 5% plus thereafter. And we are making significant progress across our capital investment programs to the benefit of our customers.
We will now be happy to answer your questions."

The -- and Jim Chapman can answer any further questions on the financing. I would mention we are expecting rider recovery, and we'll seek rider approval for all 3 phases. We've been working on this project for 6 years. We bought the right lease option, the lease rights, in a 2013 auction that was run by BOEM. And ever since that time, we've been working with a variety of stakeholders to make sure we had the right plan and we had the right folks to help us do the pilot. We got approval from the State Corporation Commission. It's been through BOEM. We had the permits from BOEM.
One of the things to keep in mind that differentiates us from the New England situation is we own the entire lease for the entire coastal region of Virginia. And it's 26 miles offshore. It is not in fishing grounds, and it is not visible from the shore. So it's very significant differentiating aspects of what's going on here in Virginia and what you've seen happen in New England but -- from the macro level. And now I'll turn it over to Paul to answer the balance of your question."

And having -- as Tom mentioned, having just gone through it on the CVOW project, while that was a research area permit and this is a commercial and operating permit, the process is identical. So we know the stakeholders, we know the process, and we feel really pretty good about it. I'll ask Jim to comment on financing."

So the majority of the spending to come in our current planning horizon is already in our plans that we walked through. And the rest, we'll update over time as time comes closer. But given what Tom and Paul just described, this is all in a regulatory construct to be financed at VEPCO. It's certainly achievable, but the details will come in the next period."

And sort of bigger picture is VRP, offshore wind, the rate plans you have in Virginia, is there a point in time when you can change the way you guide to growth, i.e., moving from 5% plus more of a range, especially as we're trying to model what the incremental accretion is from offshore wind? Because it just seems like between Cove Point, your plan is becoming much more visible. So is there a point in time when you can start to layer in more of a definitive growth range versus 5% plus?"

So the spending and then the associated earnings, as I just walked through, the $1.1 billion, including the pilot, I mean, that's in our plan. It's in our earnings guidance. There are no changes for now on that front.
On the VRP, you're right, that's kind of done and dusted earlier this year. We talked about that as being a savings of, call it $0.05 to $0.06 this year, maybe double that on a full run rate next year and diminishing over time as it's  given back to customers. So that -- we talked about that as being available savings to offset unforeseen headwinds, and that's still the case. But as an update, this year, as you know, the vast majority of our business, 95% of our business, is not commodity exposed in any way, the 5% that's not regulated or regulated-like is. And within that 5% of our operating earnings, there's a couple things. One is, obviously, the gas commodity environment is weak, and our business is largely immune to that. We have a little bit of exposure mostly around our single remaining processing plant, which is in West Virginia, and that's a little bit of a headwind as those businesses go from like very small to even smaller this year. So that's a little bit of a headwind.
More materially, though, this farm-out program, that has been very successful. As you know, Shar, this is monetizing acreage and mineral resources below our storage field. We announced that program in early 2015, and we gave guidance to the end of the decade of $450 million to $500 million of pretax earnings, and we've been ticking along that kind of like clockwork. We're 75% through that guidance. But given the pricing, given the commodity environment and the pricing that's available to us today, we're choosing not to transact on a farm-out this year. And we're going to hold that acreage and that value for farm-out transactions in future periods when there's an improvement in the commodity pricing environment.
So what that means is, obviously, we've just reiterated our guidance, same midpoint. So that means we've overcome any unforeseen headwind, previously unforeseen, relating to our decision not to transact on a farm-out this year. So that's basically the VRP savings, which we're using it pretty much as we described we would, VRP savings and other initiatives to overcome that decision. So no change to our guidance. Those are the [indiscernible] parts."

We paid for it in the auction. Nobody else can build a wind farm off of Virginia. Governor Northam, a few -- I guess a couple months ago now, called for the construction of this wind farm because it's his intention to help Virginia develop into the center of the offshore wind industry along the East Coast, and that's a challenge that we embrace. And he specifically said that he recognized that there may be some who want to push back on that, on whether it was necessary, required or a good thing for Virginia that he was going to work very hard to ensure that the public policy and regulatory support was in place to carry out this plan. And it was only after those statements that we went ahead with our announcement to full deployment, although we had been working obviously because we filed for the PGM -- PJM interconnection agreement.
So there's obviously a process in front of us. We are highly confident that it will be carried out to fruition. There is a lot of public support from this -- for this project, including from political leaders on both sides of the political fence, both Democrats and Republicans, that want to see this thing happen.
So we have -- obviously, there are -- a long way to go on it, but we have high confidence level in it going forward. It'll be the only offshore wind farm in federal waters. It will not be visible from the shore line. So we don't have any of these visual impacts that concern people. The environmental community is very supportive of the project going forward. The economic development people in Tidewater, Virginia, are very supportive of this going forward. So obviously, we don't have any guarantees of that, Steve, but we have a very high confidence level in the outcome."

On a macro basis, and I'll turn it over to Paul Koonce. 
We are very concerned here about customer rates. It's something we focus on all the time. And because our goal is to ensure that our customer rates stay very competitive, well below national averages, below the regional averages, as they are now. And we intend for them to stay that way, including with the construction of this wind farm. So we will be working very hard with the fabricators, developers, installers. We will be the operators to ensure that we get the costs down as low as we can as we go ahead, which will be important for everybody involved helping us with the project. So with that, I'll turn it over to Paul."

Julien, again just to follow up on Tom's comments about costs, I think that's one of the key reasons why we broke the project up in 3 phases so that we could continue to let the supply chain mature, let the costs continue to come down so that the impact to rates are minimized.
Just in terms of ITC and safe harboring, of course, as you know, in order to qualify for ITC, a treatment for an offshore wind farm, you have to begin construction this year. We're looking at that. We don't have anything to comment about that, but we're aware of that timing. There may be some things that we can do to safe harbor certain of those costs. So we're exploring that, more to come on that in 2020.
In terms of plans and filings, we're not -- as Tom said, we're going to file for the BOEM application this time next year. We're not prepared to say exactly when we're going to file for the SEC application, but I can tell you that we will be conducting many public meetings over the course of 2020 as we make the environmental assessment. Obviously, marine life, plant and birds, we'll be doing ocean mapping, and we'll be doing geotech analysis or subsurface analysis. So you will begin to see all that sort of play out in 2020, and I think that will be a good way to sort of pace when we might expect to make an SEC filing."

We went through that whole process, very transparently answered all the questions, went to all the meetings.
