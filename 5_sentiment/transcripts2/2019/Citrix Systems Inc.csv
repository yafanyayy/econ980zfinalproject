Thanks for joining us today. I'm very pleased to report strong fourth quarter and full year 2018 results. All of our key performance metrics came in at or above the targets we provided.

All of our key performance metrics came in at or above the targets we provided. And importantly, our subscription model transition accelerated. It's a great way to end what was a truly transformational year for Citrix. Across the organization, we're aligning to drive acceleration of our subscription transition and sustained top line growth. Our value proposition to customers is that our solutions abstract away complexity and simplify how work is done. 
Similarly, we've eliminated complexities within our own organization to make it easier for our customers and our partners to do business with us. The foundational work that we've done and the changes we continue to fine-tune support the exciting growth opportunity we see for Citrix in the years ahead. 
Our history of leadership in desktop and app virtualization provide Citrix with a unique cornerstone within large enterprise customers. Customers around the world employ our virtualization products, many of whom also leverage Citrix networking solutions as a natural extension of the workspace, a key component of application performance. That said, we believe our penetration in our existing customer base is only 25% or 30% of the available seats. We believe we're just beginning to scratch the surface on our longer-term opportunity to both expand within our installed base but also to attract new customers. 
The proliferation of applications, the top of mind criticality of security and the rapid expansion of mobile devices in cloud has set the stage for the need to adopt a unified and secure workspace. We believe Citrix is well positioned to help our customers maximize their productivity, the engagement and the satisfaction of their most valuable resources, their employees. Within our Workspace business, we have an opportunity to dramatically expand our footprint within our current customer base beyond those who require virtualization through really everyone within the organization. We believe this concept will enable us to serve a substantially higher portion of enterprise knowledge workers. Not everyone requires the highest level of performance security and reliability that virtualization provides. 
The construct of a dynamic more general-purpose workspace enables Citrix to become a ubiquitous utility, upon which even the lightest application users can benefit from the intelligence, automation, security that the Workspace provides. For example, secure SaaS enables enterprises to support a growing number of SaaS applications while ensuring there's no data leakage. With single sign-on, enhanced security for SaaS apps, web filtering and analytics, Citrix Workspace helps our customers provide a more seamless experience that underpins improved employee engagement and productivity. Longer term, the general-purpose Workspace concept represents an opportunity for Citrix to reach a much broader customer base. It also provides a platform upon which our partners can deliver unique functionalities, specific to the needs of different vertical markets and enables us to provide a solution to every user on any platform anywhere in the world. 
[indiscernible], the largest law firm in the world is a great example of how Citrix helps customers simplify complexity and provide a great consistent user experience that helps drive productivity. Following a series of acquisitions, now has around 16,000 employees globally, all of whom have to operate under their various rules, customs and regulations applicable to their locations. Compounding this complexity is a need for flexibility in moving some of their offices entirely to the cloud; while other locations with more legacy infrastructure, require the move to be at a more measured pace and others likely to remain in a hybrid environment for the foreseeable future. This long-standing customer chose Citrix Cloud services on Azure in partnership with Microsoft because we're the only ones that can provide a seamless, single and strategic solution to help alleviate this business complexity. 
Similarly, American furniture retailer, Our House, is struggling with the fixed capacity and constraints on its on-premise infrastructure and needed to improve application performance without making big capital commitments. Citrix Cloud is helping solve Our House's business and technical challenges by moving workloads between on-premise and cloud locations, enabling the scale up of cloud resources as their business requirements change and preserving their flexibility to mix-and-match cloud infrastructure in the future. 
In addition to the opportunity we have to increase Citrix's penetration within our customer base, the organizational changes we've made to accelerate the move to cloud in our subscription model increases our focus and improves our ability to attract new customers. In fact, in the fourth quarter, total bookings from new customers to Citrix Cloud delivered strong growth, both on a sequential and year-over-year basis. And the number of new customers added to Citrix Cloud accelerated dramatically relative to Q3 and more than doubled from a year-ago period. For the full year, the number of new customers added to Citrix Cloud more than tripled. 
From a bookings perspective, the customers migrating to cloud continue to gain momentum, with [indiscernible] relatively early stages of moving our current installed base. In 2018, less than 1/3 of our cloud bookings came from migrating installed base with the majority of bookings coming from either new seats or net new customers. This success is a direct result of a number of initiatives we executed in 2018, all of which are aligned against our broader initiatives. 
First, with accelerating to the cloud. From product development and innovation, to sales marketing and back-end supporting functions and infrastructure. We're now organized. We've made the transition to the cloud as a priority. 
Second is we define our portfolio. Not only do we unify our product road map, but we've also simplified our messaging and our naming conventions that enable us to up-level conversations with our customers to the C suite. We continue to pivot our selling motion towards emphasizing the value of our complete solutions rather than just selling point products. 
The third area is about expansion into new opportunities. In our Workspace business, we're moving from organizing work to really guiding and automating work. In networking, we're expanding our analytics capabilities to address the challenges inherent in complex, hybrid, multi-cloud environments. We also executed a few technology tuck-in acquisitions, one for real-time Internet traffic management and another for intelligent consolidated access to Workspace activities and integrations with a number of business-critical apps. These acquisitions accelerate our road map and demonstrate our commitment to making thoughtful strategic investments in innovation. 
However, growth in '18 was clearly driven by the Workspace, which delivered the fastest bookings growth since 2012, with products and subscription bookings up in the teens. I expect Workspace to continue to lead Citrix's growth as we progress through 2019. 
Networking, of course, continues to be a cyclical industry, with some secular trends that are worth noting. Today, a large majority of our networking revenue is being derived from hardware. While we continue to support our installed base, we're clearly putting the investments and our focus on the subscription software piece of our networking business. As you know, the value of hardware revenue stream is very different from that of the higher-margin revenue generated by subscription software. And of course, at its heart, Citrix is a software company and increasingly, a subscription-based recurring revenue software company. Our networking strategy is to focus investments in the faster-growing software business. The future of networking, of course, is software, and we're looking to position Citrix as the long-term beneficiary of this secular shift. 
Consistent with this hardware-related volatility, our SSP segment tends to be the most valuable part of the overall networking business. In Q4, SSP accounted for only about 15% of total networking bookings, down about 15% year-on-year. We continue to expect this to be the case in '19 due to the sporadic purchasing patterns of a handful of hyperscale customers. That said, we're confident in the longer-term growth opportunities within networking software. We're positioning Citrix to benefit from the evolution of network architectures from less to micro services and across platforms with hybrid, multi-cloud environments. This is an opportunity for Citrix to provide platform-agnostic flexibility, performance and a consistent experience, regardless of where applications reside. These opportunities in both our Workspace and networking businesses, combined with our increased investments we're making in product development, marketing, demand generation and our growing number of quota-carrying reps and channel partners, gives me the confidence in our outlook for the years ahead. 
Today, I believe we have the best product portfolio we've ever had. We're solving real, complex customer challenges, and we're focusing on customer experience and customer success in a holistic way to drive better outcomes for our customers, and of course, for Citrix. Our strategic partnership with Microsoft is stronger than ever, and we continue to collaborate in development and go-to-market and benefit from the great symbiotic relationship. And we continue to deliver both strong financial results and innovation while driving continued progress in our subscription model transition. 
With that, let me turn it over to Drew to review our financials and guidance in more detail. Drew?"

And thank you all for joining our call this afternoon. As David mentioned, we delivered strong fourth quarter results with our model transition progressing ahead of plan. Our subscription mix accelerated to over 50% of product bookings i",1662,"Thank you, David. And thank you all for joining our call this afternoon. As David mentioned, we delivered strong fourth quarter results with our model transition progressing ahead of plan. Our subscription mix accelerated to over 50% of product bookings in the quarter, up from 30% in the fourth quarter of last year. The full year subscription bookings accounted for 42% of total product bookings. As we enter the next phase of our subscription model transition, we know it would be helpful for you to better understand the components of our subscription revenue. So we'd like to provide more transparency into the SaaS portion of our subscription revenue. This will make it easier for you to track the progress of our Citrix Cloud revenue stream over time. Internally, we continue to prioritize SaaS, which has grown to more than $270 million in 2018, which was approximately 60% of our subscription revenue and growing faster than total subscription revenue. In the fourth quarter, SaaS revenue grew to $78 million, [ nearly 10% ] of total revenue. 
Going forward, we believe SaaS revenue will be one of the most important measures of the evolution of our business model and an important KPI for the progression of our subscription transition. As such, we plan to provide the SaaS component within the subscription revenue on an ongoing basis, beginning in the first quarter of 2019. Importantly, this will also serve to isolate the variability that comes from the parts of the subscription revenue that are more susceptible to seasonal fluctuations. For example, the on-premise term and transaction elements within subscription revenue are subject to seasonally softer periods, like the first quarter. 
With business migrating to the higher-value recurring revenue stream associated with a subscription model, more of our business booked in the current period will be recognized in future periods. This could be monitored in the data provided on our future committed revenue or deferred and unbilled revenue as seen on our supplemental disclosures. Our future committed revenue grew 12% year-over-year to $2.2 billion in the fourth quarter. Please note that the adoption of revenue accounting standard ASC 606 creates an approximate 200 basis point headwind to our fourth quarter 2018 deferred and unbilled revenue compared to that of the fourth quarter of 2017. 
In the fourth quarter, revenue grew by 3% year-over-year, driven by subscription revenue growth of 45% from the year-ago period, which accelerated from the third quarter. It's important to note to highlight that the subscription model transition had a dampening effect on the fourth quarter reported revenue of approximately 150 to 200 basis points. Workspace revenue of $557 million increased 6% from the year-ago period and increased 6% for the full year. Workspace subscription revenue grew 35% in the fourth quarter. In fact, year-over-year, Workspace subscription revenue increased more than 30% in every quarter during 2018. 
We continue to be very pleased with the underlying strength of the Workspace business. Our leadership and vision in Workspace, as David described, is clearly resonating with customers. As Citrix Cloud offering and ability to support hybrid-cloud environments, it's helping us both expand within our existing customer base and attract new customers to the Citrix platform. In the fourth quarter, subscriptions accounted for over 60% of Workspace product bookings versus 42% in the year-ago period and 57% in the prior quarter. We are tracking well ahead of our original transition milestone in this business. 
Within Workspace, content collaboration revenue increased 4% year-over-year to $47 million in the quarter. Please keep in mind that this was the final quarter in which we will separately break out revenue for the ShareFile business. As discussed on prior calls, this business has evolved to more of an integrated file, sync and sharing solution for our enterprise customers as opposed to primarily addressing the stand-alone SMB space. As such, content collaboration results are now integrated into our Workspace business. 
Networking revenue of $206 million declined 4% year-over-year, due in large part to the cyclical ordering patterns at the large hyperscale providers. In fact, the decline in the SSP business negatively impacted networking revenue by approximately $20 million in the fourth quarter as compared to the year-ago period. Despite this SSP headwind, we were able to achieve both top and bottom line expectations. For the full year, total networking revenue increased 3% compared to the full year of 2017 and increased from 4% to 9% of the total. 
Looking ahead, as the mix within our networking business transitions away from hardware, it will create pressure on reported revenue. As we progress through this mix shift transition, the growth of networking subscription revenue will be a more meaningful reflection of the underlying performance of this business. In the fourth quarter, networking subscription revenue more than doubled year-over-year, both in the fourth quarter and for the full year. That said, we are earlier in the transformation of our networking business to the subscription model relative to the transformation of our Workspace business. 
The momentum of our business remains strong, particularly considering the 150 to 200 basis point subscription revenue mix headwind as well as the previously noted $20 million SSP headwind. We continue to be pleased with the underlying growth of our core software business in the mid- to high single digits on a year-over-year basis. 
Turning to the geographies. Subscription revenue in the fourth quarter grew more than 40% year-over-year in the Americas and in EMEA, and it nearly doubled year-over-year in APJ. For the full year, revenue in the Americas accounted for 58% of total revenue; EMEA accounted for 32%; and APJ accounted for 10% of the total revenue for the full year. 
Adjusted operating margin in the fourth quarter was 35% and was 32% for the full year, slightly above the high end of our guidance range. Recall that adjusted operating margin in the fourth quarter of 2017 was positively impacted by the restructuring actions we took in October of that year to realign the organization to better support our subscription model transition and enable us to more aggressively invest in innovation. The lag between the time of the restructuring and the time it takes to thoughtful and disciplined investments in the business explains the variation in adjusted operating margin relative to the year-ago period for the quarter and for the year. 
Looking ahead, we will continue expanding profitability with investments to improve our long-term sustainable growth trajectory. In the quarter, cash flow from operations was approximately $206 million and down from the year-ago period. This year-over-year decline reflects the impact of the timing of the cash collections as a result of our subscription model transition. As a consequence of the rapid subscription model rep, more revenue and more cash flow will be recognized and collected in future periods. The primary offset of this is unbilled revenue, which increased over 300% during FY '18 to over $325 million. For the full year, cash flow from operations was $1,035,000,000, up 7% from 2017. We expect full year cash flow from operations to continue to grow year-over-year in 2019. 
Looking at the balance sheet. We ended the fourth quarter with approximately $1.8 billion in cash and investments. During Q4, we repurchased approximately $380 million of shares, thereby completing our $2 billion share repurchase commitment announced in November of 2017. We currently have $770 million of share repurchase authorization remaining. 
In the fourth quarter, we also paid our first quarterly dividend, returning an additional $47 million to shareholders following our Board of Directors $0.35 per share dividend declaration. As mentioned on today's earnings release, our Board of Directors declared our quarterly dividend of $0.35 per share to be paid later this quarter. 
Now turning to guidance. For the full year 2019, consistent with our multiyear strategy, we expect continued momentum in the adoption of our cloud services. We are reiterating our full year 2019 guidance, which includes: revenue between $3.08 billion and $3.09 billion; adjusted operating margin of 31.5% to 32%; and adjusted EPS of approximately $6. This guidance reflects our belief the subscription bookings as a percentage of product bookings will increase from just over 40% last year to as much as 55% in 2019. This mix shift creates a revenue headwind of between 150 and 200 basis points during the year. This guidance also contemplates a headwind from networking hardware. The timing of this networking hardware headwind is the primary driver of our first quarter guidance. We currently anticipate revenue between $700 million and $710 million; adjusted EPS of approximately $1.15 to $1.20. 
To provide some context with regard to the quarterly progression through the course of 2019, please keep in mind that the first quarter is always the seasonally weakest quarter of the year for Citrix. However, we expect strong Workspace growth in the quarter, primarily driven by Citrix Cloud subscriptions. Visibility of the timing of the networking hardware orders into a concentrated number of hyperscale customers, we expect the headwind to the first quarter of revenue to be more pronounced. As mentioned, orders from these customers are volatile. While it's helpful to look at them, historical seasonality of our results for the ramp in margins and the EPS throughout the year, it is important to note that 2018 results were impacted by our 2017 restructuring and the adoption of the ASC 606. As mentioned earlier, operating expenses from the first half of 2018 benefited from the restructuring actions taken toward the end of 2017 and reflect the lag in time it takes to reinvest in the business. As such, in the first quarter, you should expect to see bookings revenue, adjusted margin and EPS at the lowest point of the year. In other words, 2019 operating margin expansion and EPS growth will be weighted towards the second half of the year due to normal seasonality, our continued shift to subscription revenue and our recent investments in building sales capacity. 
With that, I'd like to open the call up for questions."

But we shifted Q1 to account for the timing of SSP hardware. That's really the only volatile part of our business because Workspace is kind of rocking up into the right at this point in time. And so when we engage with a hyperscale, we generally have a demand intent for the full year. So we have a pretty good understanding of what their capital requirements are going to be for a full year period of time. And it just becomes a little harder to predict the exact quarters in which those will fall. We just happen to know, Q1 in particular, is not a large concentration of purchases for that small group of customers. So we understand the full year. But what I'd say about overall demand in that segment is that the SSPs have been declining in the aggregate for about 3 years now. They're down in the low double digits, and we are seeing this [indiscernible] in 2019. That's been in our plan in our guidance as well. So we're pretty much spot on in '18 from our expectation. Directionally, it's a combination of their infrastructure just becoming more efficient over time, combination of more of those capabilities moving towards software. So it's a combination of those 2 dynamics but contemplated in our plan and our outlook."

That's the line where it's reflecting the more ratable elements of our business. And so remind everybody that, as we've discussed on prior calls, our subscription revenue includes 3 components: SaaS revenue, which is from Citrix Cloud, that's the largest and fastest-growing component; second, is the transactional revenue from CSPs, which continues to grow nicely; and then term licenses or on-prem license sales. Think of that as kind of a bridge to the cloud. And so what we're doing going forward is we're breaking those out so that everyone can see with more clarity exactly what's going on in the SaaS part of the business. That is most reflective of our actual strategic evolution, and that removes some of the noise that happens quarter to quarter with consumption-based programs like CSP and term licenses that have a little bit of an accounting adjustment that influences their recognition. Those tend to, frankly, be more seasonal in nature. So that's why we're isolating that. And I'd encourage you to go back and look at our presentation that we laid out because we gave all of the historical quarters for 2019 and allow you to model that really effectively going forward."

I mean, if you think about the overall dynamics, I mean, it's clear to everyone that as application architecture has changed and where applications are being run, whether those are on-premise or the cloud, the networking industry is changing. More and more value is going to be delivered via software. That's why our solution has always been to approach networking as more of a hybrid multi-cloud. So really what that means is we've got a software-based solution that can be deployed in the form factor of an appliance, virtual appliance, in a container, et cetera. And what we're seeing from our customers is more and more of those purchases are coming from the software form. That's really a reflection of the hybrid multi-cloud phenomenon. For us, when we talk about margins, in the aggregate, across the company, margin has a little bit of a pressure for -- but there's 2 dynamic going on. So we see margins coming down a little bit. The reason they're coming down is because we're moving from extremely high-margin software business on a perpetual basis to cloud. That's the kind of function number one. That's offset, as you pointed out, by less hardware and more software on the networking side. So those actually helps and provides a tailwind. But in the aggregate, in general, the bigger shift is the one from on-prem to cloud. And so I think you should expect to see some gradual pressure on gross margin over the next several years as we drive the success of that transition."

And so what we've been talking about all along is less about deferred revenue and much more about unbilled revenue. So everybody is clear. Our typical Citrix Cloud contract is a 3-year contractual commitment with annual billings. And that's why we're looking at this huge growth in unbilled revenue. Historically, we will bill all that upfront. But in the model, it's much more of a combination of unbilled and deferred. So Andrew talks about future committed revenue, that's the number he's referring to. That's the number that was up about 12% year-on-year. It now sits at nearly $2.2 billion. And that's the one to keep an eye on. And I think when you add that change to our reported revenue, that gives you a very good approximation of the underlying bookings growth in the company. So that's more of how the business is progressing. Just to do the math for you, that shows that the underlying business is growing in the mid- to high single-digit range."

But more importantly, so much net new functionality, whether we're talking about analytics or unified endpoint management or content collaboration or security SaaS application and and all these other solutions inside the Workspace. So that's one of the reasons the end of the year, our trade-up motion started to really uptick. But I expect that to be a strong motion throughout '19. So our entire value proposition is really changing. So the customers that are adopting right now are not doing it to simplify an old virtualization deployed. Frankly, we're encouraging them to leave that as is. This is really about that broad general-purpose expansion that I referenced earlier. How do we go much broader and deeper in those accounts?

So I think it's fair to say that, that platform always gets higher functionality as time goes by. That hasn't changed in decades now. And so our strategy is always for that part of the business to embrace and expand. We work with Microsoft on a collaborative basis for new initiatives like Desktop-as-a-Service. We're the only vendor that is going to be announcing -- well, has announced and going to be delivering a native DaaS service on top of Azure where we can bundle Azure capacity and sell that as one turnkey solution.

That's why we're building those together. So overall, I mean, we're working very collaboratively with them, both on the development side and on the go-to-market side.

I mean, I'd say that the alignment across the go-to-market teams, both partners and Citrix badged, is as high as it's ever been and the enthusiasm is good because they were successful in '18. The intent of changes that we made with partners are modest. Last year, in '18, we made pretty material changes to move them away from traditional models where they get paid to renew maintenance and things like that really towards net new product, net new subscription. And so the next phase of that, that we introduce in '19 is starting to put more incentive around actual usage of those cloud solutions because it's really critical that customers see success in their purchases. So now one of the steps is to continue to drive active daily use of those products. And so as customers are successful, then the partner gets an additional incentive on the back end of that. That's one of just continuous engagement overall. We took them through a lot of this very similar messaging and then other content, which was under MBA, but really talking about this new broad market opportunity that exists by the extended general-purpose Workspace, where we give them detailed road maps of where we're going on the intelligent Workspace.

All of our key performance metrics came in at or above the targets we provided. And importantly, our subscription model transition accelerated. It's a great way to end what was a truly transformational year for Citrix.
Across the organization, we're aligning to drive acceleration of our subscription transition and sustained top line growth. Our value proposition to customers is that our solutions [ abstract the way of ] complexity and simplify how work gets done.
Similarly, we've eliminated complexities within our own organization to make it easier for our customers and our partners to do business with us. The foundational work that we've done and the changes we continue to fine-tune support the exciting growth opportunities we see for Citrix in the years ahead.
Our history of leadership in desktop and app virtualization provides Citrix with a unique cornerstone within large enterprise customers. Customers around the world employ our virtualization products, many of whom also leverage Citrix networking solutions as a natural extension of the workspace, a key component of application performance.
That said, we believe our penetration in our existing customer base is only 25% or 30% of the available seats. We believe we're just beginning to scratch the surface on our longer-term opportunity to both expand within our installed base and also to attract new customers.
The proliferation of applications, the top of mind criticality of security and the rapid expansion of mobile devices and cloud has set the stage for the need to adopt a unified and secure workspace. We believe Citrix is well positioned to help our customers maximize the productivity, the engagement and the satisfaction of their most valuable resources, their employees.
Within our Workspace business, we have an opportunity to dramatically expand our footprint within our current customer base, beyond those who require virtualization to really everyone within the organization. We believe this concept will enable us to serve a substantially higher portion of enterprise knowledge workers. Not everyone requires the highest level of performance security and reliability that virtualization provides.
The construct of a dynamic, more general-purpose workspace enables Citrix to become a ubiquitous utility, upon which even the lightest application users can benefit from the intelligence, automation and security that the Workspace provides. For example, secure SaaS enables enterprises to support a growing number of SaaS applications while ensuring there's no data leakage. With single sign-on, enhanced security for SaaS apps, web filtering and analytics, Citrix Workspace helps our customers provide a more seamless experience that underpins improved employee engagement and productivity.
Longer term, the general purpose Workspace concept represents an opportunity for Citrix to reach a much broader customer base. It also provides a platform upon which our partners can deliver unique functionalities, specific to the needs of different vertical markets and enables us to provide a solution to every user on any platform anywhere in the world.
Dentons, the largest law firm in the world, is a great example of how Citrix helps customers simplify complexity and provide a great consistent user experience that helps drive productivity. Following a series of acquisitions, Dentons now has around 16,000 employees globally, all of whom have to operate under the various rules, customs and regulations applicable to their locations.
Compounding this complexity is a need for flexibility in moving some of their offices entirely to the cloud, while other locations, with more legacy infrastructure, require the move to be at a more measured pace and others likely to remain in a hybrid environment for the foreseeable future. This long-standing customer chose Citrix Cloud services on Azure in partnership with Microsoft because we're the only ones that can provide a seamless, single and strategic solution to help alleviate this business complexity.
Similarly, American furniture retailer, Our House, is struggling with the fixed capacity and constraints of its on-premise infrastructure and needed to improve application performance without making big capital commitments. Citrix Cloud is helping solve Our House's business and technical challenges by moving workloads between on-premise and cloud locations, enabling the scale-up of cloud resources as their business requirements change and preserving their flexibility to mix and match cloud infrastructure in the future.
In addition to the opportunity we have to increase Citrix's penetration within our customer base, the organizational changes we've made to accelerate the move to cloud in our subscription model increases our focus and improves our ability to attract new customers.
In fact, in the fourth quarter, total bookings from new customers to Citrix Cloud delivered strong growth, both on a sequential and year-over-year basis. And the number of new customers added to Citrix Cloud accelerated dramatically relative to Q3 and more than doubled from a year ago period. For the full year, the number of new customers added to Citrix Cloud more than tripled.
From a bookings perspective, the customers migrating to cloud continue to gain momentum, [ within the ] relatively early stages of moving our current installed base. In 2018, less than 1/3 of our cloud bookings came from migrating installed base with the majority of bookings coming from either new seats or net new customers. This success is a direct result of a number of initiatives we executed in 2018, all of which are aligned against our broader initiatives.
First, with accelerating to the cloud, from product development and innovation to sales marketing and back-end supporting functions and infrastructure. We're now organized. We've made the transition to the cloud as a priority.
Second is we define our portfolio. Not only do we unify our product road map, but we've also simplified our messaging and our naming conventions that enable us to up-level conversations with our customers to the C-Suite. We continue to pivot our selling motion towards emphasizing the value of our complete solutions rather than just selling point products.
The third area is about expansion into new opportunities. In our Workspace business, we're moving from organizing work to really guiding and automating work. In networking, we're expanding our analytics capabilities to address the challenges inherent in complex, hybrid, multi-cloud environments.
We also executed a few technology tuck-in acquisitions, one for real-time Internet traffic management and another for intelligent consolidated access to Workspace activities and integrations with a number of business-critical apps. These acquisitions accelerate our road map and demonstrate our commitment to making thoughtful, strategic investments in innovation.
However, growth in '18 was clearly driven by the Workspace, which delivered the fastest bookings growth since 2012, with product and subscription bookings up in the teens. I expect Workspace to continue to lead Citrix' growth as we progress through 2019.
Networking, of course, continues to be a cyclical industry with some secular trends that are worth noting. Today, a large majority of our networking revenue is being derived from hardware. While we continue to support our installed base, we're clearly putting the investments and our focus on the subscription software piece of our networking business.
As you know, the value of hardware revenue stream is very different from that of the higher-margin revenue generated by subscription software. And of course, at its heart, Citrix is a software company and increasingly, a subscription-based recurring revenue software company. Our networking strategy is to focus investments in the faster-growing software business. The future of networking, of course, is software, and we're looking to position Citrix as the long-term beneficiary of this secular shift.
Consistent with this hardware-related volatility, our SSP segment tends to be the most valuable part of the overall networking business. In Q4, SSP accounted for only about 15% of total networking bookings, down about 15% year-on-year. We continue to expect this to be the case in '19 due to the sporadic purchasing patterns of a handful of hyperscale customers.
That said, we're confident in the longer-term growth opportunities within networking software. We're positioning Citrix to benefit from the evolution of network architectures from monoliths to microservices and across platforms with hybrid, multi-cloud environments. This is an opportunity for Citrix to provide platform-agnostic flexibility, performance and a consistent experience, regardless of where applications reside.
These opportunities in both our Workspace and networking businesses, combined with our increased investments we're making in product development, marketing, demand generation and our growing number of quota-carrying reps and channel partners, gives me the confidence in our outlook for the years ahead.
Today, I believe we have the best product portfolio we've ever had. We're solving real, complex customer challenges, and we're focusing on customer experience and customer success in a holistic way to drive better outcomes for our customers, and of course, for Citrix.
Our strategic partnership with Microsoft is stronger than ever, and we continue to collaborate in development and go to market and benefit from the great symbiotic relationship. And we continue to deliver both strong financial results and innovation while driving continued progress in our subscription model transition.
With that, let me turn it over to Drew to review our financials and guidance in more detail. Drew?"

Internally, we continue to prioritize SaaS, which has grown to more than $270 million in 2018, which was approximately 50% of our subscription revenue and growing faster than total subscription revenue. In the fourth quarter, SaaS revenue grew to $78 million, nearly 10% of total revenue.
Going forward, we believe SaaS revenue will be one of the most important measures of the evolution of our business model and an important KPI for the progression of our subscription transition. As such, we plan to provide the SaaS component within the subscription revenue on an ongoing basis, beginning in the first quarter of 2019.
Importantly, this will also serve to isolate the variability that comes from the parts of the subscription revenue that are more susceptible to seasonal fluctuations. For example, the on-premise churn and transaction elements within subscription revenue are subject to seasonally softer periods like the first quarter.
With [ mobile ] business migrating to the higher-value recurring revenue stream associated with a subscription model, more of our business booked in the current period will be recognized in future periods. This could be monitored in the data provided on our future committed revenue or deferred and unbilled revenue as seen on our supplemental disclosures.
Our future committed revenue grew 12% year-over-year to $2.2 billion in the fourth quarter. Please note that the adoption of revenue accounting standard ASC 606 creates an approximate 200 basis point headwind to our fourth quarter 2018 deferred and unbilled revenue compared to that of the fourth quarter of 2017.
In the fourth quarter, revenue grew by 3% year-over-year, driven by subscription revenue growth of 45% from the year-ago period, which accelerated from the third quarter. It's important to note -- to highlight that the subscription model transition had a dampening effect on the fourth quarter reported revenue of approximately 150 to 200 basis points.
Workspace revenue of $557 million increased 6% from the year ago period and increased 6% for the full year. Workspace subscription revenue grew 35% in the fourth quarter. In fact, year-over-year, Workspace subscription revenue increased more than 30% in every quarter during 2018.
We continue to be very pleased with the underlying strength of the Workspace business. Our leadership and vision in Workspace, as David described, is clearly resonating with customers. As Citrix Cloud offering and ability to support hybrid cloud environments, it's helping us both expand within our existing customer base and attract new customers to the Citrix platform. In the fourth quarter, subscriptions accounted for over 60% of Workspace product bookings versus 42% in the year ago period and 57% in the prior quarter. We are tracking well ahead of our original transition milestone in this business.
Within Workspace, content collaboration revenue increased 4% year-over-year to $47 million in the quarter. Please keep in mind that this was the final quarter in which we will separately break out revenue for the ShareFile business. As discussed on prior calls, this business has evolved to more of an integrated file, sync and sharing solution for our enterprise customers as opposed to primarily addressing the stand-alone SMB space. As such, content collaboration results are now integrated into our Workspace business.
Networking revenue of $206 million declined 4% year-over-year, due to large part to the cyclical ordering patterns at the large hyperscale providers. In fact, the decline in the SSP business negatively impacted networking revenue by approximately $20 million in the fourth quarter as compared to the year ago period.
Despite this SSP headwind, we were able to achieve both top and bottom line expectations. For the full year, total networking revenue increased 3% compared to the full year of 2017 and increased from 4% to 9% of the total.
Looking ahead, as the mix within our networking business transitions away from hardware, it will create pressure on reported revenue. As we progress through this mix shift transition, the growth of networking subscription revenue will be a more meaningful reflection of the underlying performance of this business.
In the fourth quarter, networking subscription revenue more than doubled year-over-year, both in the fourth quarter and for the full year. That said, we are earlier in the transformation of our networking business to the subscription model relative to the transformation of our Workspace business.
The momentum of our business remains strong, particularly considering the 150 to 200 basis point subscription revenue mix headwind as well as the previously noted $20 million SSP headwind. We continue to be pleased with the underlying growth of our core software business in the mid to high single digits on a year-over-year basis.
Turning to the geographies. Subscription revenue in the fourth quarter grew more than 40% year-over-year in the Americas and in EMEA and it nearly doubled year-over-year in APJ. For the full year, revenue in the Americas accounted for 58% of total revenue, EMEA accounted for 32% and APJ accounted for 10% of the total revenue for the full year.
Adjusted operating margin in the fourth quarter was 35% and was 32% for the full year, slightly above the high end of our guidance range. Recall that adjusted operating margin in the fourth quarter of 2017 was positively impacted by the restructuring actions we took in October of that year to realign the organization to better support our subscription model transition and enable us to more aggressively invest in innovation.
The lag between the time of the restructuring and the time it takes to [ grab ] thoughtful and disciplined investments in the business explains the variation in adjusted operating margin relative to the year ago period for the quarter and for the year.
Looking ahead, we will continue [indiscernible] expanding profitability with investments to improve our long-term sustainable growth trajectory. In the quarter, cash flow from operations was approximately $206 million and down from the year ago period. This year-over-year decline reflects the impact of the timing of the cash collections as a result of our subscription model transition.
As a consequence of the rapid subscription model [ ramp ], more revenue and more cash flow will be recognized and collected in future periods. The primary offset of this is unbilled revenue, which increased over 300% during FY '18 to over $325 million. For the full year, cash flow from operations was $1,035,000,000, up 7% from 2017. We expect full year cash flow from operations to continue to grow year-over-year in 2019.
Looking at the balance sheet, we ended the fourth quarter with approximately $1.8 billion in cash and investments. During Q4, we repurchased approximately $380 million of shares, thereby completing our $2 billion share repurchase commitment announced in November of 2017. We currently have $770 million of share repurchase authorization remaining.
In the fourth quarter, we also paid our first quarterly dividend, returning an additional $47 million to shareholders following our Board of Directors' $0.35 per share dividend declaration. As mentioned on today's earnings release, our Board of Directors declared our quarterly dividend of $0.35 per share to be paid later this quarter. 
Now turning to guidance. For the full year 2019, consistent with our multiyear strategy, we expect continued momentum in the adoption of our cloud services. We are reiterating our full year 2019 guidance, which includes: revenue between $3.08 billion and $3.09 billion, adjusted operating margin of 31.5% to 32% and adjusted EPS of approximately $6.
This guidance reflects our belief that subscription bookings as a percentage of product bookings will increase from just over 40% last year to as much as 55% in 2019. This mix shift creates a revenue headwind of between 150 and 200 basis points during the year. This guidance also contemplates a headwind from networking hardware.
The timing of this networking hardware headwind is the primary driver of our first quarter guidance. We currently anticipate revenue between $700 million and $710 million; adjusted EPS of approximately $1.15 to $1.20.
To provide some context with regard to the quarterly progression through the course of 2019, please keep in mind that the first quarter is always the seasonally weakest quarter of the year for Citrix. However, we expect strong Workspace growth in the quarter, primarily driven by Citrix Cloud subscriptions.
Given the visibility of the timing of the networking hardware orders into a concentrated number of hyperscale customers, we expect the headwind to the first quarter of revenue to be more pronounced. As mentioned, orders from these customers are volatile.
While it's helpful to look at the historical seasonality of our results for the ramp in margins and the EPS throughout the year, it is important to note that 2018 results were positively impacted by our 2017 restructuring and the adoption of ASC 606. As mentioned earlier, operating expenses from the first half of 2018 benefited from the restructuring actions taken toward the end of 2017 and reflect the lag in time it takes to reinvest in the business.
As such, in the first quarter, you should expect to see bookings revenue, adjusted margin and EPS at the lowest point of the year. In other words, 2019 operating margin expansion and EPS growth will be weighted towards the second half of the year due to normal seasonality, our continued shift to subscription revenue and our recent investments in building sales capacity.
With that, I'd like to open the call up for questions."

And we've been able to articulate not just incremental value around the Workspace for how we're organizing work and we're helping secure and manage a lot of their applications, bringing together content into really a clean, simple solution. But we've articulated this vision now for what I described in the prepared remarks as really general purpose. And so what that means in simple terms is that we're adding value to non-virtualized use cases as well. So now we've got a full package of the Workspace that could be applicable to every user in every enterprise, not just at current 30% that today is using virtualization, but more of a ubiquitous platform that allows us to go wall to wall. And as we're successful driving that penetration, we can add a lot of incremental value with new engagements and new solutions on top of that for customers. So it's a combination of more focused and direct selling. Our sales teams did a great job in 2018, the best products that we've ever had and I think the most compelling vision, both for virtualization capabilities and now outside.

So if everyone recalls, a minute ago, we reiterated our full year guidance, but we shifted Q1 to account for the timing of SSP hardware. That's really the only volatile part of our business because Workspace is kind of rocking up into the right at this point in time. And so when we engage with a hyperscale, we generally have a demand intent for the full year. So we have a pretty good understanding of what their capital requirements are going to be for a full year period of time. And it just becomes a little harder to predict the exact quarters in which those will fall. We just happen to know, Q1 in particular is not a large concentration of purchases for that small group of customers. So we understand the full year. But what I'd say about overall demand in that segment is that the SSPs have been declining in the aggregate for about 3 years now. They're down in the low double digits, and we are seeing the DaaS [ going to phase ] in 2019. That's been in our plan in our guidance as well. So we're pretty much spot on in '18 from our expectation. Directionally, it's a combination of their infrastructure just becoming more efficient over time, combination of more of those capabilities moving towards software.

That's the line where it's reflecting the more ratable elements of our business. And so remind everybody that, as we've discussed on prior calls, our subscription revenue includes 3 components: SaaS revenue, which is from Citrix Cloud, that's the largest and fastest-growing component; second is the transactional revenue from CSPs, which continues to grow nicely; and then term licenses or on-prem license sales. Think of that as kind of a bridge to the cloud. And so what we're doing going forward is we're breaking those out so that everyone can see with more clarity exactly what's going on in the SaaS part of the business. That is most reflective of our actual strategic evolution, and that removes some of the noise that happens quarter-to-quarter with consumption-based programs like CSP and term licenses that have a little bit of an accounting adjustment that influences their recognition. Those tend to frankly be more seasonal in nature. So that's why we're isolating that.

I mean, Mark, if you think about the overall dynamics, I mean, it's clear to everyone that as application architecture has changed and where applications are being run, whether those are on-premise or the cloud, the networking industry is changing. More and more value is going to be delivered via software. That's why our solution has always been to approach networking as more of a hybrid multi-cloud. So really, what that means is we've got a software-based solution that can be deployed in the form factor of an appliance, virtual appliance, in a container, et cetera. And what we're seeing from our customers is more and more of those purchases are coming from the software form. That's really a reflection of the hybrid multi-cloud phenomenon. For us, when we talk about margins, in the aggregate, across the company, margin has a little bit of a pressure for -- but there's 2 dynamic going on. So you'll see margins coming down a little bit. The reason they're coming down is because we're moving from extremely high-margin software business on a perpetual basis to cloud. That's really kind of function number one. That's offset, as you pointed out, by less hardware and more software on the networking side. So those actually helps and provides a tailwind. But in the aggregate, in general, the bigger shift is the one from on-prem to cloud. And so I think you should expect to see some gradual pressure on gross margin over the next several years as we drive the success of that transition."

Historically, we would have billed all that upfront. But in the new model, it's much more of this combination of unbilled and deferred. So when Drew talks about future committed revenue, that's the number he's referring to. That's the number that was up about 12% year-on-year. It now sits at nearly $2.2 billion, and that's the one to keep an eye on.

I'd say a year ago, most customers were looking at Citrix Cloud as a hosted control plane to simplify the management of their on-premise virtualization. And honestly, that proposition wasn't that compelling. I mean, it sounded expensive to a lot of customers. Fast-forward throughout 2018, and we have articulated a much broader story. And in fact, there's over a dozen services live as part of Citrix Cloud to be able to optimize on premise, should they want that. But more importantly, so much net new functionality, whether we're talking about analytics or unified endpoint management or content collaboration or secure SaaS application and all these other solutions inside the Workspace. So that's one of the reasons why at the end of the year, our trade-up motion has started to really uptick, but I expect that to be a strong motion throughout '19. So that entire value proposition is really changing. So the customers that are adopting right now are not doing it to simplify an old virtualization deployment. Frankly, we're encouraging them to leave that as is. This is really about that broad general-purpose expansion that I referenced earlier. How do we go much broader and deeper in those accounts? And then over time, as they move their workloads, the virtualization workloads to the cloud, then we can provide a lot of incremental value on top of that. But I look at that honestly as a Phase 2."

Clearly, the fourth quarter results cap off a really important year for our overall transformation. We exceeded expectations across all metrics despite some of the cyclical headwinds in networking, hardware, the areas that we've talked about.
Our subscription model transition is accelerating, as we've said, as evidenced by subscription revenue at 45% in Q4, the fact that unbilled and deferred revenue is up well over $200 million year-on-year and the other metrics that are supporting that overall.
So clearly, we're excited about the opportunity to drive growth in the years ahead, capitalizing on the opportunity to further penetrate both our existing installed base as well as really using the general purpose Workspace concept to attract net new customers, net new opportunities looking forward.

All of our key performance metrics came in at or above the targets we provided. And importantly, our subscription model transition accelerated. It's a great way to end what was a truly transformational year for Citrix.
Across the organization, we're aligning to drive acceleration of our subscription transition and sustained top line growth. Our value proposition to customers is that our solutions [ abstract ] away complexity and simplify how work gets done.
Similarly, we've eliminated complexities within our own organization to make it easier for our customers and our partners to do business with us. The foundational work that we've done and the changes we continue to fine-tune support the exciting growth opportunities we see for Citrix in the years ahead.
Our history of leadership in desktop and app virtualization provides Citrix with a unique cornerstone within large enterprise customers. Customers around the world employ our virtualization products, many of whom also leverage Citrix networking solutions as a natural extension of the workspace, a key component of application performance.
That said, we believe our penetration in our existing customer base is only 25% or 30% of the available seats. We believe we're just beginning to scratch the surface on our longer-term opportunity to both expand within our installed base and also to attract new customers.
The proliferation of applications, the top of mind criticality of security and the rapid expansion of mobile devices and cloud has set the stage for the need to adopt a unified and secure workspace. We believe Citrix is well positioned to help our customers maximize the productivity, the engagement and the satisfaction of their most valuable resources, their employees.
Within our Workspace business, we have an opportunity to dramatically expand our footprint within our current customer base, beyond those who require virtualization to really everyone within the organization. We believe this concept will enable us to serve a substantially higher portion of enterprise knowledge workers. Not everyone requires the highest level of performance security and reliability that virtualization provides.
The construct of a dynamic, more general-purpose workspace enables Citrix to become a ubiquitous utility, upon which even the lightest application users can benefit from the intelligence, automation and security that the Workspace provides. For example, secure SaaS enables enterprises to support a growing number of SaaS applications while ensuring there's no data leakage. With single sign-on, enhanced security for SaaS apps, web filtering and analytics, Citrix Workspace helps our customers provide a more seamless experience that underpins improved employee engagement and productivity.
Longer term, the general purpose Workspace concept represents an opportunity for Citrix to reach a much broader customer base. It also provides a platform upon which our partners can deliver unique functionalities, specific to the needs of different vertical markets and enables us to provide a solution to every user on any platform anywhere in the world.
Dentons, the largest law firm in the world, is a great example of how Citrix helps customers simplify complexity and provide a great consistent user experience that helps drive productivity. Following a series of acquisitions, Dentons now has around 16,000 employees globally, all of whom have to operate under the various rules, customs and regulations applicable to their locations.
Compounding this complexity is a need for flexibility in moving some of their offices entirely to the cloud, while other locations, with more legacy infrastructure, require the move to be at a more measured pace and others likely to remain in a hybrid environment for the foreseeable future. This long-standing customer chose Citrix Cloud services on Azure in partnership with Microsoft because we're the only ones that can provide a seamless, single and strategic solution to help alleviate this business complexity.
Similarly, American furniture retailer, Our House, is struggling with the fixed capacity and constraints of its on-premise infrastructure and needed to improve application performance without making big capital commitments. Citrix Cloud is helping solve Our House's business and technical challenges by moving workloads between on-premise and cloud locations, enabling the scale-up of cloud resources as their business requirements change and preserving their flexibility to mix and match cloud infrastructure in the future.
In addition to the opportunity we have to increase Citrix's penetration within our customer base, the organizational changes we've made to accelerate the move to cloud in our subscription model increases our focus and improves our ability to attract new customers.
In fact, in the fourth quarter, total bookings from new customers to Citrix Cloud delivered strong growth, both on a sequential and year-over-year basis. And the number of new customers added to Citrix Cloud accelerated dramatically relative to Q3 and more than doubled from a year ago period. For the full year, the number of new customers added to Citrix Cloud more than tripled.
From a bookings perspective, the customers migrating to cloud continue to gain momentum. We're still in the relatively early stages of moving our current installed base. In 2018, less than 1/3 of our cloud bookings came from migrating installed base with the majority of bookings coming from either new seats or net new customers. This success is a direct result of a number of initiatives we executed in 2018, all of which are aligned against our broader mission.
First, with accelerating to the cloud, from product development and innovation to sales marketing and back-end supporting functions and infrastructure. We're now organized. We've made the transition so the cloud is a priority.
Second is unifying our portfolio. Not only do we unify our product road map, but we've also simplified our messaging and our naming conventions that enable us to up-level conversations with our customers to the C-Suite. We continue to pivot our selling motion towards emphasizing the value of our complete solutions rather than just selling point products.
The third area is about expansion into new opportunities. In our Workspace business, we're moving from organizing work to really guiding and automating work. In networking, we're expanding our analytics capabilities to address the challenges inherent in complex, hybrid, multi-cloud environments.
We also executed a few technology tuck-in acquisitions, one for real-time Internet traffic management and another for intelligent consolidated access to Workspace activities and integrations with a number of business-critical apps. These acquisitions accelerate our road map and demonstrate our commitment to making thoughtful, strategic investments in innovation.
Our overall growth in '18 was clearly driven by the Workspace, which delivered the fastest bookings growth since 2012, with product and subscription bookings up in the teens. I expect Workspace to continue to lead Citrix's growth as we progress through 2019.
Networking, of course, continues to be a cyclical industry with some secular trends that are worth noting. Today, a large majority of our networking revenue is being derived from hardware. While we'll continue to support our installed base, we're clearly putting the investments and our focus on the subscription software piece of our networking business.
As you know, the value of hardware revenue stream is very different from that of the higher-margin revenue generated by subscription software. And of course, at its heart, Citrix is a software company and increasingly, a subscription-based recurring revenue software company. Our networking strategy is to focus investments in the faster-growing software business. The future of networking, of course, is software, and we're working to position Citrix as the long-term beneficiary of this secular shift.
Consistent with this hardware-related volatility, our SSP segment tends to be the most valuable part of the overall networking business. In Q4, SSP accounted for only about 15% of total networking bookings, down about 15% year-on-year. We continue to expect this to be the case in '19 due to the sporadic purchasing patterns of a handful of hyperscale customers.
That said, we're confident in the longer-term growth opportunities within networking software. We're positioning Citrix to benefit from the evolution of network architectures from monoliths to microservices and across platforms with hybrid, multi-cloud environments. This is an opportunity for Citrix to provide platform-agnostic flexibility, performance and a consistent experience, regardless of where applications reside.
These opportunities in both our Workspace and networking businesses, combined with our increased investments we're making in product development, marketing, demand generation and our growing number of quota-carrying reps and channel partners, gives me the confidence in our outlook for the years ahead.
Today, I believe we have the best product portfolio we've ever had. We're solving real, complex customer challenges, and we're focusing on customer experience and customer success in a holistic way to drive better outcomes for our customers, and of course, for Citrix.
Our strategic partnership with Microsoft is stronger than ever, and we continue to collaborate in development and go to market and benefit from the great symbiotic relationship. And we continue to deliver both strong financial results and innovation while driving continued progress in our subscription model transition.
With that, let me turn it over to Drew to review our financials and guidance in more detail. Drew?"
26524,597899735,1639355,"Citrix Systems, Inc., Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Jan 23, 2019",2019-01-23,"Earnings Calls","Citrix Systems, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, David, and thank you all for joining our call this afternoon. As David mentioned, we delivered strong fourth quarter results with our model transition progressing ahead of plan.

As David mentioned, we delivered strong fourth quarter results with our model transition progressing ahead of plan. Our subscription mix accelerated to over 50% of product bookings in the quarter, up from 30% in the fourth quarter of last year. The full year subscription bookings accounted for 42% of total product bookings.
As we enter the next phase of our subscription model transition, we know it would be helpful for you to better understand the components of our subscription revenue. So we'd like to provide more transparency into the SaaS portion of our subscription revenue. This will make it easier for you to track the progress of our Citrix Cloud revenue stream over time.
Internally, we continue to prioritize SaaS, which has grown to more than $270 million in 2018, which was approximately 60% of our subscription revenue and growing faster than total subscription revenue. In the fourth quarter, SaaS revenue grew to $78 million, nearly 10% of total revenue.
Going forward, we believe SaaS revenue will be one of the most important measures of the evolution of our business model and an important KPI for the progression of our subscription transition. As such, we plan to provide the SaaS component within the subscription revenue on an ongoing basis, beginning in the first quarter of 2019.
Importantly, this will also serve to isolate the variability that comes from the parts of the subscription revenue that are more susceptible to seasonal fluctuations. For example, the on-premise churn and transaction elements within subscription revenue are subject to seasonally softer periods like the first quarter.
With more of our business migrating to the higher-value recurring revenue stream associated with a subscription model, more of our business booked in the current period will be recognized in future periods. This could be monitored in the data provided on our future committed revenue or deferred and unbilled revenue as seen on our supplemental disclosures.
Our future committed revenue grew 12% year-over-year to $2.2 billion in the fourth quarter. Please note that the adoption of revenue accounting standard ASC 606 creates an approximate 200 basis point headwind to our fourth quarter 2018 deferred and unbilled revenue compared to that of the fourth quarter of 2017.
In the fourth quarter, revenue grew by 3% year-over-year, driven by subscription revenue growth of 45% from the year-ago period, which accelerated from the third quarter. It's important to note -- to highlight that the subscription model transition had a dampening effect on the fourth quarter reported revenue of approximately 150 to 200 basis points.
Workspace revenue of $557 million increased 6% from the year ago period and increased 6% for the full year. Workspace subscription revenue grew 35% in the fourth quarter. In fact, year-over-year, Workspace subscription revenue increased more than 30% in every quarter during 2018.
We continue to be very pleased with the underlying strength of the Workspace business. Our leadership and vision in Workspace, as David described, is clearly resonating with customers. As Citrix Cloud offering and ability to support hybrid cloud environments, is helping us both expand within our existing customer base and attract new customers to the Citrix platform. In the fourth quarter, subscriptions accounted for over 60% of Workspace product bookings versus 42% in the year ago period and 57% in the prior quarter. We are tracking well ahead of our original transition milestone in this business.
Within Workspace, content collaboration revenue increased 4% year-over-year to $47 million in the quarter. Please keep in mind that this was the final quarter in which we will separately break out revenue for the ShareFile business. As discussed on prior calls, this business has evolved to more of an integrated file, sync and sharing solution for our enterprise customers as opposed to primarily addressing the standalone SMB space. As such, content collaboration results are now integrated into our Workspace business.
Networking revenue of $206 million declined 4% year-over-year, due in large part to the cyclical ordering patterns at the large hyperscale providers. In fact, the decline in the SSP business negatively impacted networking revenue by approximately $20 million in the fourth quarter as compared to the year ago period.
Despite this SSP headwind, we were able to achieve both top and bottom line expectations. For the full year, total networking revenue increased 3% compared to the full year of 2017 and increased from 4% to 9% of the total.
Looking ahead, as the mix within our networking business transitions away from hardware, it will create pressure on reported revenue. As we progress through this mix shift transition, the growth of networking subscription revenue will be a more meaningful reflection of the underlying performance of this business.
In the fourth quarter, networking subscription revenue more than doubled year-over-year, both in the fourth quarter and for the full year. That said, we are earlier in the transformation of our networking business to the subscription model relative to the transformation of our Workspace business.
The momentum of our business remains strong, particularly considering the 150 to 200 basis point subscription mix headwind as well as the previously noted $20 million SSP headwind. We continue to be pleased with the underlying growth of our core software business in the mid- to high single digits on a year-over-year basis.
Turning to the geographies. Subscription revenue in the fourth quarter grew more than 40% year-over-year in the Americas and in EMEA and it nearly doubled year-over-year in APJ. For the full year, revenue in the Americas accounted for 58% of total revenue, EMEA accounted for 32% and APJ accounted for 10% of the total revenue for the full year.
Adjusted operating margin in the fourth quarter was 35% and was 32% for the full year, slightly above the high end of our guidance range. Recall that adjusted operating margin in the fourth quarter of 2017 was positively impacted by the restructuring actions we took in October of that year to realign the organization to better support our subscription model transition and enable us to more aggressively invest in innovation.
The lag between the time of the restructuring and the time it takes to ramp thoughtful and disciplined investments in the business explains the variation in adjusted operating margin relative to the year ago period for the quarter and for the year.
Looking ahead, we will continue to balance expanding profitability with investments to improve our long-term sustainable growth trajectory. In the quarter, cash flow from operations was approximately $206 million and down from the year ago period. This year-over-year decline reflects the impact of the timing of cash collections as a result of our subscription model transition.
As a consequence of the rapid subscription model ramp, more revenue and more cash flow will be recognized and collected in future periods. The primary offset of this is unbilled revenue, which increased over 300% during FY '18 to over $325 million. For the full year, cash flow from operations was $1,035,000,000, up 7% from 2017. We expect full year cash flow from operations to continue to grow year-over-year in 2019.
Looking at the balance sheet, we ended the fourth quarter with approximately $1.8 billion in cash and investments. During Q4, we repurchased approximately $380 million of shares, thereby completing our $2 billion share repurchase commitment announced in November of 2017. We currently have $770 million of share repurchase authorization remaining.
In the fourth quarter, we also paid our first quarterly dividend, returning an additional $47 million to shareholders following our Board of Directors' $0.35 per share dividend declaration. As mentioned on today's earnings release, our Board of Directors declared our quarterly dividend of $0.35 per share to be paid later this quarter. 
Now turning to guidance. For the full year 2019, consistent with our multiyear strategy, we expect continued momentum in the adoption of our cloud services. We are reiterating our full year 2019 guidance, which includes: revenue between $3.08 billion and $3.09 billion, adjusted operating margin of 31.5% to 32% and adjusted EPS of approximately $6.
This guidance reflects our belief that subscription bookings as a percentage of product bookings will increase from just over 40% last year to as much as 55% in 2019. This mix shift creates a revenue headwind of between 150 and 200 basis points during the year. This guidance also contemplates a headwind from networking hardware.
The timing of this networking hardware headwind is the primary driver of our first quarter guidance. We currently anticipate revenue between $700 million and $710 million; adjusted EPS of approximately $1.15 to $1.20.
To provide some context with regard to the quarterly progression through the course of 2019, please keep in mind that the first quarter is always the seasonally weakest quarter of the year for Citrix. However, we expect strong Workspace growth in the quarter, primarily driven by Citrix Cloud subscriptions.
Given the visibility of the timing of the networking hardware orders into a concentrated number of hyperscale customers, we expect the headwind to the first quarter of revenue to be more pronounced. As mentioned, orders from these customers are volatile.
While it's helpful to look at the historical seasonality of our results for the ramp in margins and the EPS throughout the year, it is important to note that 2018 results were positively impacted by our 2017 restructuring and the adoption of ASC 606. As mentioned earlier, operating expenses in the first half of 2018 benefited from the restructuring actions taken toward the end of 2017 and reflect the lag in time it takes to reinvest in the business.
As such, in the first quarter, you should expect to see bookings, revenue, adjusted margin and EPS at the lowest point of the year. In other words, 2019 operating margin expansion and EPS growth will be weighted towards the second half of the year due to normal seasonality, our continued shift to subscription revenue and our recent investments in building sales capacity.
With that, I'd like to open the call up for questions."

So we're really happy with where we are, and we expect double-digit performance again in 2019. So what's happening is that, overall, we've just laid out a really compelling vision for customers. And we've been able to articulate not just incremental value around the Workspace for how we're organizing work and we're helping secure and manage a lot of their applications, bringing together content into really a clean, simple solution. We've articulated this vision now for what I described in the prepared remarks as really general purpose. And so what that means in simple terms is that we're adding value to non-virtualized use cases as well. So now we've got a full package of the Workspace that could be applicable to every user in every enterprise, not just that current 30% that today is using virtualization, but more of a ubiquitous platform that allows us to go wall to wall. And as we're successful driving that penetration, we can add a lot of incremental value with new engagements and new solutions on top of that for customers. So it's a combination of more focused and direct selling. Our sales teams did a great job in 2018, the best product set we've ever had and I think the most compelling vision, both for virtualization capabilities and now outside. And that's what's driving that business recovery overall."

So if everyone recalls, a minute ago, we reiterated our full year guidance, but we shifted Q1 to account for the timing of SSP hardware. That's really the only volatile part of our business because Workspace is kind of rocking up into the right at this point in time. And so when we engage with a hyperscale, we generally have a demand intent for the full year. So we have a pretty good understanding of what their capital requirements are going to be for a full year period of time. And it just becomes a little harder to predict the exact quarters in which those will fall. We just happen to know, Q1 in particular is not a large concentration of purchases for that small group of customers. So we understand the full year. But what I'd say about overall demand in that segment is that the SSPs have been declining in the aggregate for about 3 years now. They're down in the low double digits, and we are seeing that that's going to be the pace in 2019. That's been in our plan and in our guidance as well. So we're pretty much spot on in '18 from our expectation. Directionally, it's a combination of their infrastructures just becoming more efficient over time, combination of more of those capabilities moving towards software. So it's a kind of combination of those 2 dynamics but contemplated in our plan and in our outlook."

That's the line where it's reflecting the more ratable elements of our business. And so remind everybody that, as we've discussed on prior calls, our subscription revenue includes 3 components: SaaS revenue, which is from Citrix Cloud, that's the largest and fastest-growing component; second is the transactional revenue from CSPs, which continues to grow nicely; and then term licenses for on-prem license sales. Think of that as kind of a bridge to the cloud. And so what we're doing going forward is we're breaking those out so that everyone can see with more clarity exactly what's going on in the SaaS part of the business. That is most reflective of our actual strategic evolution, and that removes some of the noise that happens quarter-to-quarter with consumption-based programs like CSP and term licenses that have a little bit of an accounting adjustment that influences their recognition. Those tend to frankly be more seasonal in nature. So that's why we're isolating that.

I mean, Mark, if you think about the overall dynamics, I mean, it's clear to everyone that as application architecture has changed and where applications are being run, whether those are on-premise or the cloud, the networking industry is changing. More and more value is going to be delivered via software. That's why our solution has always been to approach networking as more of a hybrid multi-cloud. So really, what that means is we've got a software-based solution that can be deployed in the form factor of an appliance, virtual appliance, in a container, et cetera. And what we're seeing from our customers is more and more of those purchases are coming from the software form. That's really a reflection of the hybrid multi-cloud phenomenon. For us, when we talk about margins, in the aggregate, across the company, margin has a little bit of a pressure for -- but there's 2 dynamic going on. So you'll see margins coming down a little bit. The reason they're coming down is because we're moving from extremely high-margin software business on a perpetual basis to cloud. That's really kind of function number one. That's offset, as you pointed out, by less hardware and more software on the networking side. So those actually helps and provides a tailwind. But in the aggregate, in general, the bigger shift is the one from on-prem to cloud. And so I think you should expect to see some gradual pressure on gross margin over the next several years as we drive the success of that transition."

And so what we've been talking about all along is more -- less about deferred revenue and much more about unbilled revenue. So everybody is clear, our typical Citrix Cloud contract is a 3-year contractual commitment with annual billings. And that's why we're looking at this huge growth in unbilled revenue. Historically, we would have billed all that upfront. But in the new model, it's much more of this combination of unbilled and deferred. So when Drew talks about future committed revenue, that's the number he's referring to. That's the number that was up about 12% year-on-year. It now sits at nearly $2.2 billion, and that's the one to keep an eye on. And I think when you add that change to our reported revenue, that gives you a very good approximation of the underlying bookings growth in the company.

But more importantly, so much net new functionality, whether we're talking about analytics or unified endpoint management or content collaboration or secure SaaS application and all these other solutions inside the Workspace. So that's one of the reasons why at the end of the year, our trade-up motion has started to really uptick, but I expect that to be a strong motion throughout '19. So that entire value proposition is really changing. So the customers that are adopting right now are not doing it to simplify an old virtualization deployment. Frankly, we're encouraging them to leave that as is. This is really about that broad general-purpose expansion that I referenced earlier. How do we go much broader and deeper in those accounts?

But is there something else too that's happening, like you did talk about the large hyperscale customers. And we understand that, that's been happening for a long, long time too. And we understand that, that can cause some volatility. But it's not nearly the volatility that it used to be, as far as what we used to see in that business. So I'm just -- there's a lot of questions around this, especially this next quarter's guidance relative to what's happening for the year. And I just -- I don't know, it just seems like there's something else going on here. I just want to make sure we're not missing something."

We've moved from up to 42% of new bookings coming from subscription we were a 30%, 30-ish or -- what were we the year before? Mid-20s and then much lower 2 years earlier. And so Drew talked about the incremental headwind that comes from moving from 40% last year to 55-plus this year. Couple of hundred basis point headwind on revenue growth, incremental to where we were. And then it's just a matter of the networking business as we referred to, SSP a little bit lumpy. And then gradually, over time, hardware shifts into software. There's not really a dynamic. I think the easiest way to understand economically the change in our business is look at the change in deferred and unbilled right next to the recognized revenue numbers.

And it sounds like you're sort of maintaining that, which is good to see. But at the same time, with the first quarter being a little bit lighter than at least we had, I -- obviously, you hadn't given guidance for that and not raising that. I'm just trying to -- I just want to make sure that we're not missing something. So you didn't lower guidance for the year. I get that. That's good.

So I think it's fair to say that, that platform always gets higher functionality as time goes by. That hasn't changed in decades now. And so our strategy is always for that part of the business to embrace and extend. We work with Microsoft on a collaborative basis for new initiatives like Desktop as a Service. We're the only vendor that is going to be announcing -- well, has announced and going to be delivering a native DaaS service on top of Azure where we can bundle Azure capacity and sell that as one turnkey solution.

I mean, I'd say that the alignment across the go-to-market teams, both partners and Citrix badged, is as high as it's ever been, and the enthusiasm is good because they were successful in '18. The incentive changes that we made with partners are modest. Last year, in '18, we made pretty material changes to move them away from traditional models where they get paid to renew maintenance and things like that, really towards net new product, net new subscription. And so the next phase of that, that we introduce in '19 is starting to put more incentive around actual usage of those cloud solutions because it's really critical that customers see success in their purchases. So now one of the steps is to continue to drive active daily use of those products. And so as customers are successful, then the partner gets an additional incentive on the back end of that. That's more of just continuous engagement overall. We took them through a lot of this very similar messaging and then other content which was under NDA but really talking about this new broad market opportunity that exists by the extended general purpose Workspace, where we give them detailed road maps of where we're going on the intelligent Workspace.

All of our key performance metrics came in at or above the targets we provided. And importantly, our subscription model transition accelerated. It's a great way to end what was a truly transformational year for Citrix.
Across the organization, we're aligning to drive acceleration of our subscription transition and sustained top line growth. Our value proposition to customers is that our solutions [ abstract ] away complexity and simplify how work gets done.
Similarly, we've eliminated complexities within our own organization to make it easier for our customers and our partners to do business with us. The foundational work that we've done and the changes we continue to fine-tune support the exciting growth opportunities we see for Citrix in the years ahead.
Our history of leadership in desktop and app virtualization provides Citrix with a unique cornerstone within large enterprise customers. Customers around the world employ our virtualization products, many of whom also leverage Citrix networking solutions as a natural extension of the workspace, a key component of application performance.
That said, we believe our penetration in our existing customer base is only 25% or 30% of the available seats. We believe we're just beginning to scratch the surface on our longer-term opportunity to both expand within our installed base and also to attract new customers.
The proliferation of applications, the top of mind criticality of security and the rapid expansion of mobile devices and cloud has set the stage for the need to adopt a unified and secure workspace. We believe Citrix is well positioned to help our customers maximize the productivity, the engagement and the satisfaction of their most valuable resources, their employees.
Within our Workspace business, we have an opportunity to dramatically expand our footprint within our current customer base, beyond those who require virtualization to really everyone within the organization. We believe this concept will enable us to serve a substantially higher portion of enterprise knowledge workers. Not everyone requires the highest level of performance security and reliability that virtualization provides.
The construct of a dynamic, more general-purpose workspace enables Citrix to become a ubiquitous utility, upon which even the lightest application users can benefit from the intelligence, automation and security that the Workspace provides. For example, secure SaaS enables enterprises to support a growing number of SaaS applications while ensuring there's no data leakage. With single sign-on, enhanced security for SaaS apps, web filtering and analytics, Citrix Workspace helps our customers provide a more seamless experience that underpins improved employee engagement and productivity.
Longer term, the general purpose Workspace concept represents an opportunity for Citrix to reach a much broader customer base. It also provides a platform upon which our partners can deliver unique functionalities, specific to the needs of different vertical markets and enables us to provide a solution to every user on any platform anywhere in the world.
Dentons, the largest law firm in the world, is a great example of how Citrix helps customers simplify complexity and provide a great consistent user experience that helps drive productivity. Following a series of acquisitions, Dentons now has around 16,000 employees globally, all of whom have to operate under the various rules, customs and regulations applicable to their locations.
Compounding this complexity is a need for flexibility in moving some of their offices entirely to the cloud, while other locations, with more legacy infrastructure, require the move to be at a more measured pace and others likely to remain in a hybrid environment for the foreseeable future. This long-standing customer chose Citrix Cloud services on Azure in partnership with Microsoft because we're the only ones that can provide a seamless, single and strategic solution to help alleviate this business complexity.
Similarly, American furniture retailer, Our House, is struggling with the fixed capacity and constraints of its on-premise infrastructure and needed to improve application performance without making big capital commitments. Citrix Cloud is helping solve Our House's business and technical challenges by moving workloads between on-premise and cloud locations, enabling the scale-up of cloud resources as their business requirements change and preserving their flexibility to mix and match cloud infrastructure in the future.
In addition to the opportunity we have to increase Citrix's penetration within our customer base, the organizational changes we've made to accelerate the move to cloud in our subscription model increases our focus and improves our ability to attract new customers.
In fact, in the fourth quarter, total bookings from new customers to Citrix Cloud delivered strong growth, both on a sequential and year-over-year basis. And the number of new customers added to Citrix Cloud accelerated dramatically relative to Q3 and more than doubled from a year ago period. For the full year, the number of new customers added to Citrix Cloud more than tripled.
From a bookings perspective, the customers migrating to cloud continue to gain momentum. We're still in the relatively early stages of moving our current installed base. In 2018, less than 1/3 of our cloud bookings came from migrating installed base with the majority of bookings coming from either new seats or net new customers. This success is a direct result of a number of initiatives we executed in 2018, all of which are aligned against our broader mission.
First, with accelerating to the cloud, from product development and innovation to sales marketing and back-end supporting functions and infrastructure. We're now organized. We've made the transition so the cloud is a priority.
Second is unifying our portfolio. Not only do we unify our product road map, but we've also simplified our messaging and our naming conventions that enable us to up-level conversations with our customers to the C-Suite. We continue to pivot our selling motion towards emphasizing the value of our complete solutions rather than just selling point products.
The third area is about expansion into new opportunities. In our Workspace business, we're moving from organizing work to really guiding and automating work. In networking, we're expanding our analytics capabilities to address the challenges inherent in complex, hybrid, multi-cloud environments.
We also executed a few technology tuck-in acquisitions, one for real-time Internet traffic management and another for intelligent consolidated access to Workspace activities and integrations with a number of business-critical apps. These acquisitions accelerate our road map and demonstrate our commitment to making thoughtful, strategic investments in innovation.
Our overall growth in '18 was clearly driven by the Workspace, which delivered the fastest bookings growth since 2012, with product and subscription bookings up in the teens. I expect Workspace to continue to lead Citrix's growth as we progress through 2019.
Networking, of course, continues to be a cyclical industry with some secular trends that are worth noting. Today, a large majority of our networking revenue is being derived from hardware. While we'll continue to support our installed base, we're clearly putting the investments and our focus on the subscription software piece of our networking business.
As you know, the value of hardware revenue stream is very different from that of the higher-margin revenue generated by subscription software. And of course, at its heart, Citrix is a software company and increasingly, a subscription-based recurring revenue software company. Our networking strategy is to focus investments in the faster-growing software business. The future of networking, of course, is software, and we're working to position Citrix as the long-term beneficiary of this secular shift.
Consistent with this hardware-related volatility, our SSP segment tends to be the most valuable part of the overall networking business. In Q4, SSP accounted for only about 15% of total networking bookings, down about 15% year-on-year. We continue to expect this to be the case in '19 due to the sporadic purchasing patterns of a handful of hyperscale customers.
That said, we're confident in the longer-term growth opportunities within networking software. We're positioning Citrix to benefit from the evolution of network architectures from monoliths to microservices and across platforms with hybrid, multi-cloud environments. This is an opportunity for Citrix to provide platform-agnostic flexibility, performance and a consistent experience, regardless of where applications reside.
These opportunities in both our Workspace and networking businesses, combined with our increased investments we're making in product development, marketing, demand generation and our growing number of quota-carrying reps and channel partners, gives me the confidence in our outlook for the years ahead.
Today, I believe we have the best product portfolio we've ever had. We're solving real, complex customer challenges, and we're focusing on customer experience and customer success in a holistic way to drive better outcomes for our customers, and of course, for Citrix.
Our strategic partnership with Microsoft is stronger than ever, and we continue to collaborate in development and go to market and benefit from the great symbiotic relationship. And we continue to deliver both strong financial results and innovation while driving continued progress in our subscription model transition.
With that, let me turn it over to Drew to review our financials and guidance in more detail. Drew?"

As David mentioned, we delivered strong fourth quarter results with our model transition progressing ahead of plan.

As David mentioned, we delivered strong fourth quarter results with our model transition progressing ahead of plan. Our subscription mix accelerated to over 50% of product bookings in the quarter, up from 30% in the fourth quarter of last year. The full year subscription bookings accounted for 42% of total product bookings.
As we enter the next phase of our subscription model transition, we know it would be helpful for you to better understand the components of our subscription revenue. So we'd like to provide more transparency into the SaaS portion of our subscription revenue. This will make it easier for you to track the progress of our Citrix Cloud revenue stream over time.
Internally, we continue to prioritize SaaS, which has grown to more than $270 million in 2018, which was approximately 60% of our subscription revenue and growing faster than total subscription revenue. In the fourth quarter, SaaS revenue grew to $78 million, nearly 10% of total revenue.
Going forward, we believe SaaS revenue will be one of the most important measures of the evolution of our business model and an important KPI for the progression of our subscription transition. As such, we plan to provide the SaaS component within the subscription revenue on an ongoing basis, beginning in the first quarter of 2019.
Importantly, this will also serve to isolate the variability that comes from the parts of the subscription revenue that are more susceptible to seasonal fluctuations. For example, the on-premise churn and transaction elements within subscription revenue are subject to seasonally softer periods like the first quarter.
With more of our business migrating to the higher-value recurring revenue stream associated with a subscription model, more of our business booked in the current period will be recognized in future periods. This could be monitored in the data provided on our future committed revenue or deferred and unbilled revenue as seen on our supplemental disclosures.
Our future committed revenue grew 12% year-over-year to $2.2 billion in the fourth quarter. Please note that the adoption of revenue accounting standard ASC 606 creates an approximate 200 basis point headwind to our fourth quarter 2018 deferred and unbilled revenue compared to that of the fourth quarter of 2017.
In the fourth quarter, revenue grew by 3% year-over-year, driven by subscription revenue growth of 45% from the year-ago period, which accelerated from the third quarter. It's important to note -- to highlight that the subscription model transition had a dampening effect on the fourth quarter reported revenue of approximately 150 to 200 basis points.
Workspace revenue of $557 million increased 6% from the year ago period and increased 6% for the full year. Workspace subscription revenue grew 35% in the fourth quarter. In fact, year-over-year, Workspace subscription revenue increased more than 30% in every quarter during 2018.
We continue to be very pleased with the underlying strength of the Workspace business. Our leadership and vision in Workspace, as David described, is clearly resonating with customers. As Citrix Cloud offering and ability to support hybrid cloud environments, is helping us both expand within our existing customer base and attract new customers to the Citrix platform. In the fourth quarter, subscriptions accounted for over 60% of Workspace product bookings versus 42% in the year ago period and 57% in the prior quarter. We are tracking well ahead of our original transition milestone in this business.
Within Workspace, content collaboration revenue increased 4% year-over-year to $47 million in the quarter. Please keep in mind that this was the final quarter in which we will separately break out revenue for the ShareFile business. As discussed on prior calls, this business has evolved to more of an integrated file, sync and sharing solution for our enterprise customers as opposed to primarily addressing the stand-alone SMB space. As such, content collaboration results are now integrated into our Workspace business.
Networking revenue of $206 million declined 4% year-over-year, due in large part to the cyclical ordering patterns at the large hyperscale providers. In fact, the decline in the SSP business negatively impacted networking revenue by approximately $20 million in the fourth quarter as compared to the year ago period.
Despite this SSP headwind, we were able to achieve both top and bottom line expectations. For the full year, total networking revenue increased 3% compared to the full year of 2017 and increased from 4% to 9% of the total.
Looking ahead, as the mix within our networking business transitions away from hardware, it will create pressure on reported revenue. As we progress through this mix shift transition, the growth of networking subscription revenue will be a more meaningful reflection of the underlying performance of this business.
In the fourth quarter, networking subscription revenue more than doubled year-over-year, both in the fourth quarter and for the full year. That said, we are earlier in the transformation of our networking business to the subscription model relative to the transformation of our Workspace business.
The momentum of our business remains strong, particularly considering the 150 to 200 basis point subscription mix headwind as well as the previously noted $20 million SSP headwind. We continue to be pleased with the underlying growth of our core software business in the mid- to high single digits on a year-over-year basis.
Turning to the geographies. Subscription revenue in the fourth quarter grew more than 40% year-over-year in the Americas and in EMEA and it nearly doubled year-over-year in APJ. For the full year, revenue in the Americas accounted for 58% of total revenue, EMEA accounted for 32% and APJ accounted for 10% of the total revenue for the full year.
Adjusted operating margin in the fourth quarter was 35% and was 32% for the full year, slightly above the high end of our guidance range. Recall that adjusted operating margin in the fourth quarter of 2017 was positively impacted by the restructuring actions we took in October of that year to realign the organization to better support our subscription model transition and enable us to more aggressively invest in innovation.
The lag between the time of the restructuring and the time it takes to ramp thoughtful and disciplined investments in the business explains the variation in adjusted operating margin relative to the year ago period for the quarter and for the year.
Looking ahead, we will continue to balance expanding profitability with investments to improve our long-term sustainable growth trajectory. In the quarter, cash flow from operations was approximately $206 million and down from the year ago period. This year-over-year decline reflects the impact of the timing of cash collections as a result of our subscription model transition.
As a consequence of the rapid subscription model ramp, more revenue and more cash flow will be recognized and collected in future periods. The primary offset of this is unbilled revenue, which increased over 300% during FY '18 to over $325 million. For the full year, cash flow from operations was $1,035,000,000, up 7% from 2017. We expect full year cash flow from operations to continue to grow year-over-year in 2019.
Looking at the balance sheet, we ended the fourth quarter with approximately $1.8 billion in cash and investments. During Q4, we repurchased approximately $380 million of shares, thereby completing our $2 billion share repurchase commitment announced in November of 2017. We currently have $770 million of share repurchase authorization remaining.
In the fourth quarter, we also paid our first quarterly dividend, returning an additional $47 million to shareholders following our Board of Directors' $0.35 per share dividend declaration. As mentioned on today's earnings release, our Board of Directors declared our quarterly dividend of $0.35 per share to be paid later this quarter. 
Now turning to guidance. For the full year 2019, consistent with our multiyear strategy, we expect continued momentum in the adoption of our cloud services. We are reiterating our full year 2019 guidance, which includes: revenue between $3.08 billion and $3.09 billion, adjusted operating margin of 31.5% to 32% and adjusted EPS of approximately $6.
This guidance reflects our belief that subscription bookings as a percentage of product bookings will increase from just over 40% last year to as much as 55% in 2019. This mix shift creates a revenue headwind of between 150 and 200 basis points during the year. This guidance also contemplates a headwind from networking hardware.
The timing of this networking hardware headwind is the primary driver of our first quarter guidance. We currently anticipate revenue between $700 million and $710 million; adjusted EPS of approximately $1.15 to $1.20.
To provide some context with regard to the quarterly progression through the course of 2019, please keep in mind that the first quarter is always the seasonally weakest quarter of the year for Citrix. However, we expect strong Workspace growth in the quarter, primarily driven by Citrix Cloud subscriptions.
Given the visibility of the timing of the networking hardware orders into a concentrated number of hyperscale customers, we expect the headwind to the first quarter of revenue to be more pronounced. As mentioned, orders from these customers are volatile.
While it's helpful to look at the historical seasonality of our results for the ramp in margins and the EPS throughout the year, it is important to note that 2018 results were positively impacted by our 2017 restructuring and the adoption of ASC 606. As mentioned earlier, operating expenses in the first half of 2018 benefited from the restructuring actions taken toward the end of 2017 and reflect the lag in time it takes to reinvest in the business.
As such, in the first quarter, you should expect to see bookings, revenue, adjusted margin and EPS at the lowest point of the year. In other words, 2019 operating margin expansion and EPS growth will be weighted towards the second half of the year due to normal seasonality, our continued shift to subscription revenue and our recent investments in building sales capacity.
With that, I'd like to open the call up for questions."

We've articulated this vision now for what I described in the prepared remarks as really general purpose. And so what that means in simple terms is that we're adding value to non-virtualized use cases as well. So now we've got a full package of the Workspace that could be applicable to every user in every enterprise, not just that current 30% that today is using virtualization, but more of a ubiquitous platform that allows us to go wall to wall. And as we're successful driving that penetration, we can add a lot of incremental value with new engagements and new solutions on top of that for customers. So it's a combination of more focused and direct selling.

So if everyone recalls, a minute ago, we reiterated our full year guidance, but we shifted Q1 to account for the timing of SSP hardware. That's really the only volatile part of our business because Workspace is kind of rocking up into the right at this point in time. And so when we engage with a hyperscale, we generally have a demand intent for the full year. So we have a pretty good understanding of what their capital requirements are going to be for a full year period of time. And it just becomes a little harder to predict the exact quarters in which those will fall. We just happen to know, Q1 in particular is not a large concentration of purchases for that small group of customers. So we understand the full year. But what I'd say about overall demand in that segment is that the SSPs have been declining in the aggregate for about 3 years now. They're down in the low double digits, and we are seeing that that's going to be the pace in 2019. That's been in our plan and in our guidance as well. So we're pretty much spot on in '18 from our expectation. Directionally, it's a combination of their infrastructures just becoming more efficient over time, combination of more of those capabilities moving towards software.

And so remind everybody that, as we've discussed on prior calls, our subscription revenue includes 3 components: SaaS revenue, which is from Citrix Cloud, that's the largest and fastest-growing component; second is the transactional revenue from CSPs, which continues to grow nicely; and then term licenses for on-prem license sales. Think of that as kind of a bridge to the cloud. And so what we're doing going forward is we're breaking those out so that everyone can see with more clarity exactly what's going on in the SaaS part of the business. That is most reflective of our actual strategic evolution, and that removes some of the noise that happens quarter-to-quarter with consumption-based programs like CSP and term licenses that have a little bit of an accounting adjustment that influences their recognition. Those tend to frankly be more seasonal in nature. So that's why we're isolating that. I'd encourage you to go back and look at our presentation that we laid out because we gave all of the historical quarters for 2019 and allow you to model that really effectively going forward."

I mean, Mark, if you think about the overall dynamics, I mean, it's clear to everyone that as application architecture has changed and where applications are being run, whether those are on-premise or the cloud, the networking industry is changing. More and more value is going to be delivered via software. That's why our solution has always been to approach networking as more of a hybrid multi-cloud. So really, what that means is we've got a software-based solution that can be deployed in the form factor of an appliance, virtual appliance, in a container, et cetera. And what we're seeing from our customers is more and more of those purchases are coming from the software form. That's really a reflection of the hybrid multi-cloud phenomenon. For us, when we talk about margins, in the aggregate, across the company, margin has a little bit of a pressure for -- but there's 2 dynamic going on. So you'll see margins coming down a little bit. The reason they're coming down is because we're moving from extremely high-margin software business on a perpetual basis to cloud. That's really kind of function number one. That's offset, as you pointed out, by less hardware and more software on the networking side. So those actually helps and provides a tailwind. But in the aggregate, in general, the bigger shift is the one from on-prem to cloud. And so I think you should expect to see some gradual pressure on gross margin over the next several years as we drive the success of that transition."

And so what we've been talking about all along is more -- less about deferred revenue and much more about unbilled revenue. So everybody is clear, our typical Citrix Cloud contract is a 3-year contractual commitment with annual billings. And that's why we're looking at this huge growth in unbilled revenue. Historically, we would have billed all that upfront. But in the new model, it's much more of this combination of unbilled and deferred. So when Drew talks about future committed revenue, that's the number he's referring to. That's the number that was up about 12% year-on-year. It now sits at nearly $2.2 billion, and that's the one to keep an eye on. And I think when you add that change to our reported revenue, that gives you a very good approximation of the underlying bookings growth in the company. So that's more of how the business is progressing. Just to do the math for you, that shows that the underlying business is growing in the mid to high single-digit range."

I'd say a year ago, most customers were looking at Citrix Cloud as a hosted control plane to simplify the management of their on-premise virtualization. And honestly, that proposition wasn't that compelling. I mean, it sounded expensive to a lot of customers. Fast-forward throughout 2018, and we have articulated a much broader story. And in fact, there's over a dozen services live as part of Citrix Cloud to be able to optimize on premise, should they want that. But more importantly, so much net new functionality, whether we're talking about analytics or unified endpoint management or content collaboration or secure SaaS application and all these other solutions inside the Workspace. So that's one of the reasons why at the end of the year, our trade-up motion has started to really uptick, but I expect that to be a strong motion throughout '19. So that entire value proposition is really changing. So the customers that are adopting right now are not doing it to simplify an old virtualization deployment. Frankly, we're encouraging them to leave that as is. This is really about that broad general-purpose expansion that I referenced earlier. How do we go much broader and deeper in those accounts? And then over time, as they move their workloads, the virtualization workloads to the cloud, then we can provide a lot of incremental value on top of that. But I look at that honestly as a Phase 2."

That's the way to think about it. And then for the last 25 years, our products, our virtualization products that is, have embraced and extended the Windows Server platform. As Windows becomes subsumed by Azure, we now embrace and extend the Azure Virtual Desktop platform. It's the exact same analogy to where we've been over time. So I think it's fair to say that, that platform always gets higher functionality as time goes by. That hasn't changed in decades now. And so our strategy is always for that part of the business to embrace and extend. We work with Microsoft on a collaborative basis for new initiatives like Desktop as a Service. We're the only vendor that is going to be announcing -- well, has announced and going to be delivering a native DaaS service on top of Azure where we can bundle Azure capacity and sell that as one turnkey solution. I think that's a -- right now, that is not a large part of the overall market, but we recognize that there are use cases where that is an important solution to have. That's why we're building those together. So overall, I mean, we're working very collaboratively with them, both on the development side and on the go-to-market side and we'll continue to, not just in virtualization, of course, but in areas like virtual WAN and mobility and many others."

I mean, I'd say that the alignment across the go-to-market teams, both partners and Citrix badged, is as high as it's ever been, and the enthusiasm is good because they were successful in '18. The incentive changes that we made with partners are modest. Last year, in '18, we made pretty material changes to move them away from traditional models where they get paid to renew maintenance and things like that, really towards net new product, net new subscription. And so the next phase of that, that we introduce in '19 is starting to put more incentive around actual usage of those cloud solutions because it's really critical that customers see success in their purchases. So now one of the steps is to continue to drive active daily use of those products. And so as customers are successful, then the partner gets an additional incentive on the back end of that. That's more of just continuous engagement overall. We took them through a lot of this very similar messaging and then other content which was under NDA but really talking about this new broad market opportunity that exists by the extended general purpose Workspace, where we give them detailed road maps of where we're going on the intelligent Workspace. And that just gives them a lot more flavor for how the TAM is going to double over time and how we're moving into really higher-growth market opportunities."

All of our key performance metrics came in at or above the targets we provided. And importantly, our subscription model transition accelerated. It's a great way to end what was a truly transformational year for Citrix.
Across the organization, we're aligning to drive acceleration of our subscription transition and sustained top line growth. Our value proposition to customers is that our solutions [ abstract ] away complexity and simplify how work gets done.
Similarly, we've eliminated complexities within our own organization to make it easier for our customers and our partners to do business with us. The foundational work that we've done and the changes we continue to fine-tune support the exciting growth opportunities we see for Citrix in the years ahead.
Our history of leadership in desktop and app virtualization provides Citrix with a unique cornerstone within large enterprise customers. Customers around the world employ our virtualization products, many of whom also leverage Citrix networking solutions as a natural extension of the workspace, a key component of application performance.
That said, we believe our penetration in our existing customer base is only 25% or 30% of the available seats. We believe we're just beginning to scratch the surface on our longer-term opportunity to both expand within our installed base and also to attract new customers.
The proliferation of applications, the top of mind criticality of security and the rapid expansion of mobile devices and cloud has set the stage for the need to adopt a unified and secure workspace. We believe Citrix is well positioned to help our customers maximize the productivity, the engagement and the satisfaction of their most valuable resources, their employees.
Within our Workspace business, we have an opportunity to dramatically expand our footprint within our current customer base, beyond those who require virtualization to really everyone within the organization. We believe this concept will enable us to serve a substantially higher portion of enterprise knowledge workers. Not everyone requires the highest level of performance security and reliability that virtualization provides.
The construct of a dynamic, more general-purpose workspace enables Citrix to become a ubiquitous utility, upon which even the lightest application users can benefit from the intelligence, automation and security that the Workspace provides. For example, secure SaaS enables enterprises to support a growing number of SaaS applications while ensuring there's no data leakage. With single sign-on, enhanced security for SaaS apps, web filtering and analytics, Citrix Workspace helps our customers provide a more seamless experience that underpins improved employee engagement and productivity.
Longer term, the general purpose Workspace concept represents an opportunity for Citrix to reach a much broader customer base. It also provides a platform upon which our partners can deliver unique functionalities, specific to the needs of different vertical markets and enables us to provide a solution to every user on any platform anywhere in the world.
Dentons, the largest law firm in the world, is a great example of how Citrix helps customers simplify complexity and provide a great consistent user experience that helps drive productivity. Following a series of acquisitions, Dentons now has around 16,000 employees globally, all of whom have to operate under the various rules, customs and regulations applicable to their locations.
Compounding this complexity is a need for flexibility in moving some of their offices entirely to the cloud, while other locations, with more legacy infrastructure, require the move to be at a more measured pace and others likely to remain in a hybrid environment for the foreseeable future. This long-standing customer chose Citrix Cloud services on Azure in partnership with Microsoft because we're the only ones that can provide a seamless, single and strategic solution to help alleviate this business complexity.
Similarly, American furniture retailer, Our House, is struggling with the fixed capacity and constraints of its on-premise infrastructure and needed to improve application performance without making big capital commitments. Citrix Cloud is helping solve Our House's business and technical challenges by moving workloads between on-premise and cloud locations, enabling the scale-up of cloud resources as their business requirements change and preserving their flexibility to mix and match cloud infrastructure in the future.
In addition to the opportunity we have to increase Citrix's penetration within our customer base, the organizational changes we've made to accelerate the move to cloud in our subscription model increases our focus and improves our ability to attract new customers.
In fact, in the fourth quarter, total bookings from new customers to Citrix Cloud delivered strong growth, both on a sequential and year-over-year basis. And the number of new customers added to Citrix Cloud accelerated dramatically relative to Q3 and more than doubled from a year ago period. For the full year, the number of new customers added to Citrix Cloud more than tripled.
From a bookings perspective, the customers migrating to cloud continue to gain momentum. We're still in the relatively early stages of moving our current installed base. In 2018, less than 1/3 of our cloud bookings came from migrating installed base with the majority of bookings coming from either new seats or net new customers. This success is a direct result of a number of initiatives we executed in 2018, all of which are aligned against our broader mission.
First, with accelerating to the cloud, from product development and innovation to sales marketing and back-end supporting functions and infrastructure. We're now organized. We've made the transition so the cloud is a priority.
Second is unifying our portfolio. Not only do we unify our product road map, but we've also simplified our messaging and our naming conventions that enable us to up-level conversations with our customers to the C-Suite. We continue to pivot our selling motion towards emphasizing the value of our complete solutions rather than just selling point products.
The third area is about expansion into new opportunities. In our Workspace business, we're moving from organizing work to really guiding and automating work. In networking, we're expanding our analytics capabilities to address the challenges inherent in complex, hybrid, multi-cloud environments.
We also executed a few technology tuck-in acquisitions, one for real-time Internet traffic management and another for intelligent consolidated access to Workspace activities and integrations with a number of business-critical apps. These acquisitions accelerate our road map and demonstrate our commitment to making thoughtful, strategic investments in innovation.
Our overall growth in '18 was clearly driven by the Workspace, which delivered the fastest bookings growth since 2012, with product and subscription bookings up in the teens. I expect Workspace to continue to lead Citrix's growth as we progress through 2019.
Networking, of course, continues to be a cyclical industry with some secular trends that are worth noting. Today, a large majority of our networking revenue is being derived from hardware. While we'll continue to support our installed base, we're clearly putting the investments and our focus on the subscription software piece of our networking business.
As you know, the value of hardware revenue stream is very different from that of the higher-margin revenue generated by subscription software. And of course, at its heart, Citrix is a software company and increasingly, a subscription-based recurring revenue software company. Our networking strategy is to focus investments in the faster-growing software business. The future of networking, of course, is software, and we're working to position Citrix as the long-term beneficiary of this secular shift.
Consistent with this hardware-related volatility, our SSP segment tends to be the most valuable part of the overall networking business. In Q4, SSP accounted for only about 15% of total networking bookings, down about 15% year-on-year. We continue to expect this to be the case in '19 due to the sporadic purchasing patterns of a handful of hyperscale customers.
That said, we're confident in the longer-term growth opportunities within networking software. We're positioning Citrix to benefit from the evolution of network architectures from monoliths to microservices and across platforms with hybrid, multi-cloud environments. This is an opportunity for Citrix to provide platform-agnostic flexibility, performance and a consistent experience, regardless of where applications reside.
These opportunities in both our Workspace and networking businesses, combined with our increased investments we're making in product development, marketing, demand generation and our growing number of quota-carrying reps and channel partners, gives me the confidence in our outlook for the years ahead.
Today, I believe we have the best product portfolio we've ever had. We're solving real, complex customer challenges, and we're focusing on customer experience and customer success in a holistic way to drive better outcomes for our customers, and of course, for Citrix.
Our strategic partnership with Microsoft is stronger than ever, and we continue to collaborate in development and go to market and benefit from the great symbiotic relationship. And we continue to deliver both strong financial results and innovation while driving continued progress in our subscription model transition.
With that, let me turn it over to Drew to review our financials and guidance in more detail. Drew?"

As David mentioned, we delivered strong fourth quarter results with our model transition progressing ahead of plan.

As David mentioned, we delivered strong fourth quarter results with our model transition progressing ahead of plan. Our subscription mix accelerated to over 50% of product bookings in the quarter, up from 30% in the fourth quarter of last year. The full year subscription bookings accounted for 42% of total product bookings.
As we enter the next phase of our subscription model transition, we know it would be helpful for you to better understand the components of our subscription revenue. So we'd like to provide more transparency into the SaaS portion of our subscription revenue. This will make it easier for you to track the progress of our Citrix Cloud revenue stream over time.
Internally, we continue to prioritize SaaS, which has grown to more than $270 million in 2018, which was approximately 60% of our subscription revenue and growing faster than total subscription revenue. In the fourth quarter, SaaS revenue grew to $78 million, nearly 10% of total revenue.
Going forward, we believe SaaS revenue will be one of the most important measures of the evolution of our business model and an important KPI for the progression of our subscription transition. As such, we plan to provide the SaaS component within the subscription revenue on an ongoing basis, beginning in the first quarter of 2019.
Importantly, this will also serve to isolate the variability that comes from the parts of the subscription revenue that are more susceptible to seasonal fluctuations. For example, the on-premise churn and transaction elements within subscription revenue are subject to seasonally softer periods like the first quarter.
With more of our business migrating to the higher-value recurring revenue stream associated with a subscription model, more of our business booked in the current period will be recognized in future periods. This could be monitored in the data provided on our future committed revenue or deferred and unbilled revenue as seen on our supplemental disclosures.
Our future committed revenue grew 12% year-over-year to $2.2 billion in the fourth quarter. Please note that the adoption of revenue accounting standard ASC 606 creates an approximate 200 basis point headwind to our fourth quarter 2018 deferred and unbilled revenue compared to that of the fourth quarter of 2017.
In the fourth quarter, revenue grew by 3% year-over-year, driven by subscription revenue growth of 45% from the year-ago period, which accelerated from the third quarter. It's important to note -- to highlight that the subscription model transition had a dampening effect on the fourth quarter reported revenue of approximately 150 to 200 basis points.
Workspace revenue of $557 million increased 6% from the year ago period and increased 6% for the full year. Workspace subscription revenue grew 35% in the fourth quarter. In fact, year-over-year, Workspace subscription revenue increased more than 30% in every quarter during 2018.
We continue to be very pleased with the underlying strength of the Workspace business. Our leadership and vision in Workspace, as David described, is clearly resonating with customers. As Citrix Cloud offering and ability to support hybrid cloud environments, is helping us both expand within our existing customer base and attract new customers to the Citrix platform. In the fourth quarter, subscriptions accounted for over 60% of Workspace product bookings versus 42% in the year ago period and 57% in the prior quarter. We are tracking well ahead of our original transition milestone in this business.
Within Workspace, content collaboration revenue increased 4% year-over-year to $47 million in the quarter. Please keep in mind that this was the final quarter in which we will separately break out revenue for the ShareFile business. As discussed on prior calls, this business has evolved to more of an integrated file, sync and sharing solution for our enterprise customers as opposed to primarily addressing the stand-alone SMB space. As such, content collaboration results are now integrated into our Workspace business.
Networking revenue of $206 million declined 4% year-over-year, due in large part to the cyclical ordering patterns at the large hyperscale providers. In fact, the decline in the SSP business negatively impacted networking revenue by approximately $20 million in the fourth quarter as compared to the year ago period.
Despite this SSP headwind, we were able to achieve both top and bottom line expectations. For the full year, total networking revenue increased 3% compared to the full year of 2017 and increased from 4% to 9% of the total.
Looking ahead, as the mix within our networking business transitions away from hardware, it will create pressure on reported revenue. As we progress through this mix shift transition, the growth of networking subscription revenue will be a more meaningful reflection of the underlying performance of this business.
In the fourth quarter, networking subscription revenue more than doubled year-over-year, both in the fourth quarter and for the full year. That said, we are earlier in the transformation of our networking business to the subscription model relative to the transformation of our Workspace business.
The momentum of our business remains strong, particularly considering the 150 to 200 basis point subscription mix headwind as well as the previously noted $20 million SSP headwind. We continue to be pleased with the underlying growth of our core software business in the mid- to high single digits on a year-over-year basis.
Turning to the geographies. Subscription revenue in the fourth quarter grew more than 40% year-over-year in the Americas and in EMEA and it nearly doubled year-over-year in APJ. For the full year, revenue in the Americas accounted for 58% of total revenue, EMEA accounted for 32% and APJ accounted for 10% of the total revenue for the full year.
Adjusted operating margin in the fourth quarter was 35% and was 32% for the full year, slightly above the high end of our guidance range. Recall that adjusted operating margin in the fourth quarter of 2017 was positively impacted by the restructuring actions we took in October of that year to realign the organization to better support our subscription model transition and enable us to more aggressively invest in innovation.
The lag between the time of the restructuring and the time it takes to ramp thoughtful and disciplined investments in the business explains the variation in adjusted operating margin relative to the year ago period for the quarter and for the year.
Looking ahead, we will continue to balance expanding profitability with investments to improve our long-term sustainable growth trajectory. In the quarter, cash flow from operations was approximately $206 million and down from the year ago period. This year-over-year decline reflects the impact of the timing of cash collections as a result of our subscription model transition.
As a consequence of the rapid subscription model ramp, more revenue and more cash flow will be recognized and collected in future periods. The primary offset of this is unbilled revenue, which increased over 300% during FY '18 to over $325 million. For the full year, cash flow from operations was $1,035,000,000, up 7% from 2017. We expect full year cash flow from operations to continue to grow year-over-year in 2019.
Looking at the balance sheet, we ended the fourth quarter with approximately $1.8 billion in cash and investments. During Q4, we repurchased approximately $380 million of shares, thereby completing our $2 billion share repurchase commitment announced in November of 2017. We currently have $770 million of share repurchase authorization remaining.
In the fourth quarter, we also paid our first quarterly dividend, returning an additional $47 million to shareholders following our Board of Directors' $0.35 per share dividend declaration. As mentioned on today's earnings release, our Board of Directors declared our quarterly dividend of $0.35 per share to be paid later this quarter. 
Now turning to guidance. For the full year 2019, consistent with our multiyear strategy, we expect continued momentum in the adoption of our cloud services. We are reiterating our full year 2019 guidance, which includes: revenue between $3.08 billion and $3.09 billion, adjusted operating margin of 31.5% to 32% and adjusted EPS of approximately $6.
This guidance reflects our belief that subscription bookings as a percentage of product bookings will increase from just over 40% last year to as much as 55% in 2019. This mix shift creates a revenue headwind of between 150 and 200 basis points during the year. This guidance also contemplates a headwind from networking hardware.
The timing of this networking hardware headwind is the primary driver of our first quarter guidance. We currently anticipate revenue between $700 million and $710 million; adjusted EPS of approximately $1.15 to $1.20.
To provide some context with regard to the quarterly progression through the course of 2019, please keep in mind that the first quarter is always the seasonally weakest quarter of the year for Citrix. However, we expect strong Workspace growth in the quarter, primarily driven by Citrix Cloud subscriptions.
Given the visibility of the timing of the networking hardware orders into a concentrated number of hyperscale customers, we expect the headwind to the first quarter of revenue to be more pronounced. As mentioned, orders from these customers are volatile.
While it's helpful to look at the historical seasonality of our results for the ramp in margins and the EPS throughout the year, it is important to note that 2018 results were positively impacted by our 2017 restructuring and the adoption of ASC 606. As mentioned earlier, operating expenses in the first half of 2018 benefited from the restructuring actions taken toward the end of 2017 and reflect the lag in time it takes to reinvest in the business.
As such, in the first quarter, you should expect to see bookings, revenue, adjusted margin and EPS at the lowest point of the year. In other words, 2019 operating margin expansion and EPS growth will be weighted towards the second half of the year due to normal seasonality, our continued shift to subscription revenue and our recent investments in building sales capacity.
With that, I'd like to open the call up for questions."

We've articulated this vision now for what I described in the prepared remarks as really general purpose. And so what that means in simple terms is that we're adding value to non-virtualized use cases as well. So now we've got a full package of the Workspace that could be applicable to every user in every enterprise, not just that current 30% that today is using virtualization, but more of a ubiquitous platform that allows us to go wall to wall. And as we're successful driving that penetration, we can add a lot of incremental value with new engagements and new solutions on top of that for customers. So it's a combination of more focused and direct selling. Our sales teams did a great job in 2018, the best product set we've ever had and I think the most compelling vision, both for virtualization capabilities and now outside.

So if everyone recalls, a minute ago, we reiterated our full year guidance, but we shifted Q1 to account for the timing of SSP hardware. That's really the only volatile part of our business because Workspace is kind of rocking up into the right at this point in time. And so when we engage with a hyperscale, we generally have a demand intent for the full year. So we have a pretty good understanding of what their capital requirements are going to be for a full year period of time. And it just becomes a little harder to predict the exact quarters in which those will fall. We just happen to know, Q1 in particular is not a large concentration of purchases for that small group of customers. So we understand the full year. But what I'd say about overall demand in that segment is that the SSPs have been declining in the aggregate for about 3 years now. They're down in the low double digits, and we are seeing that that's going to be the pace in 2019. That's been in our plan and in our guidance as well. So we're pretty much spot on in '18 from our expectation. Directionally, it's a combination of their infrastructures just becoming more efficient over time, combination of more of those capabilities moving towards software.

Think of that as kind of a bridge to the cloud. And so what we're doing going forward is we're breaking those out so that everyone can see with more clarity exactly what's going on in the SaaS part of the business. That is most reflective of our actual strategic evolution, and that removes some of the noise that happens quarter-to-quarter with consumption-based programs like CSP and term licenses that have a little bit of an accounting adjustment that influences their recognition. Those tend to frankly be more seasonal in nature. So that's why we're isolating that.

I mean, Mark, if you think about the overall dynamics, I mean, it's clear to everyone that as application architecture has changed and where applications are being run, whether those are on-premise or the cloud, the networking industry is changing. More and more value is going to be delivered via software. That's why our solution has always been to approach networking as more of a hybrid multi-cloud. So really, what that means is we've got a software-based solution that can be deployed in the form factor of an appliance, virtual appliance, in a container, et cetera. And what we're seeing from our customers is more and more of those purchases are coming from the software form. That's really a reflection of the hybrid multi-cloud phenomenon. For us, when we talk about margins, in the aggregate, across the company, margin has a little bit of a pressure for -- but there's 2 dynamic going on. So you'll see margins coming down a little bit. The reason they're coming down is because we're moving from extremely high-margin software business on a perpetual basis to cloud. That's really kind of function number one. That's offset, as you pointed out, by less hardware and more software on the networking side. So those actually helps and provides a tailwind. But in the aggregate, in general, the bigger shift is the one from on-prem to cloud. And so I think you should expect to see some gradual pressure on gross margin over the next several years as we drive the success of that transition."

Historically, we would have billed all that upfront. But in the new model, it's much more of this combination of unbilled and deferred. So when Drew talks about future committed revenue, that's the number he's referring to. That's the number that was up about 12% year-on-year.

And then over time, as they move their workloads, the virtualization workloads to the cloud, then we can provide a lot of incremental value on top of that. But I look at that honestly as a Phase 2."

Last year, in '18, we made pretty material changes to move them away from traditional models where they get paid to renew maintenance and things like that, really towards net new product, net new subscription. And so the next phase of that, that we introduce in '19 is starting to put more incentive around actual usage of those cloud solutions because it's really critical that customers see success in their purchases. So now one of the steps is to continue to drive active daily use of those products. And so as customers are successful, then the partner gets an additional incentive on the back end of that.

Clearly, the fourth quarter results cap off a really important year for our overall transformation. We exceeded expectations across all metrics despite some of the cyclical headwinds in networking, hardware, the areas that we've talked about.
Our subscription model transition is accelerating, as we've said, as evidenced by subscription revenue at 45% in Q4, the fact that unbilled and deferred revenue is up well over $200 million year-on-year and the other metrics that are supporting that overall.
So clearly, we're excited about the opportunity to drive growth in the years ahead, capitalizing on the opportunity to further penetrate both our existing installed base as well as really using the general purpose Workspace concept to attract net new customers, net new opportunities looking forward.
So we'll come back in 3 months, provide you with an update on those initiatives. Everybody, have a good night, and talk to you soon."

Before we get started, though, I want to welcome to Jessica Soisson to the call. She's my long-term colleague, our current Chief Accounting Officer and as Traci said, Interim CFO as Drew is leaving to pursue other opportunities. 
So as you saw in the summary, we had a really good quarterly. We exceeded forecast on both revenue and EPS and frankly, can boil it down into 3 key areas. First one is that the strength is coming from the Workspace. Workspace revenue in total is up 13% year-on-year. This is the fastest growth we've seen in many, many years. 
Second is that total SaaS revenue for the company was up 43%, and this is due to the strength of our ongoing subscription bookings. In fact, the strength in subscription drove future committed revenue, which [indiscernible] deferred and unbilled up 21% from last year. In fact, the subscription mix is running ahead of plan, and I expect that to be the case throughout the year. 
Third item is, as we've talked about a couple of times, the strategic service provider customers, really those 3 historically largest hyperscale networking customers just continuing to be a headwind to revenue due to timing. We expect this to persist into the second quarter, as I've previously stated. 
However, when you exclude these 3 SSP customers, revenue for the rest of the company was just under $700 million, which is up 10% year-over-year. So all in, just really happy with the performance of the quarter. 
And so now let's open it up for Q&A."

I'd say overall, the business is continuing to trend we've seen over the last, probably the last 6, 8 quarters in a row now. I mean more specifically, we've been talking about the Workspace in broader terms than we ever had in the past. I mean we created virtualization years and years ago, and we still have an amazing business in that area. But what's really resonating with customers is the broader vision around providing a holistic workspace for all application types, whether those are virtualized, SaaS, mobile and really making that something that can help engage employees, drive productivity, simplify the infrastructure, et cetera. And so that's a lot of what we've been talking about, and we're getting a lot of great response from customers. That's allowed us to sign more and more up for longer-term subscription deals, generate a higher number of large enterprise deals. And so we feel good about it. Right now, we've got -- I'd say that the amount of revenue coming from subscriptions is significantly higher than that of perpetual license, and that should continue. The growth rate will move around a little bit quarter-to-quarter just based on mix. It's still -- whether it's perpetual license or on-premise term that tend to have a little higher rev rec. So directionally, it's up in the right, but I would expect it to bounce around a little bit along that trend."

Specific to Q2, we've never given 2Q guidance before. Q2, if you look back over the last couple of years, tends to be our lowest-margin quarter because it's our highest expense quarter. And the reason that is, is Q2 is a lot of seasonal items like our big Synergy conference, that's when we do merit increases. And correspondingly, that's our highest marketing quarter historically. So it tends to pop and then come back down in Q3 and Q4, and I would expect that to be the case in this year as well."

And the year prior, it had similar lumpiness. And so as I've stated many times over the years, we have pretty good visibility into the full year, but the quarters [indiscernible] is a little bit harder. And that's the primary reason why we're going to break it out going forward. And so that everybody can look past it with a lot of clarity to understand when it's hurting and where it's contributing to the quarterly. So on the broader secular trend, yes, it's been declining at a rate of about 10% for several years now. And so it's very consistent with the way we've talked about it.

Workspace is a software product, and it's a much more natural transition there. On networking, I think it's important to take a little bit of a step back and think about strategically what we're driving. I mean we're a software company by nature. That's what we do. And so our approach to networking has been to really disaggregate the functionality from the hardware appliance itself. And that's always been the strategy. But giving customers that flexibility to consume networking hardware in the form factor of a hardware appliance, a virtual appliance as a container and in some instances, as a service, and hearing capacity, in some instances, across those different types of form factors. That's really our strategy to be able to address a number of, let's call it different secular trends that are going on in networking entirely. So it will continue to move more towards software. I think that should be the expectation, but it'll be more gradual than on the Workspace business."

We announced that we are building a DaaS product on top of Azure virtual desktop, which we'll talk about little bit later in the year. But it's a different category than we've competed in historically. And we do think it's important. That's one of the reasons why we're doing this natively on top of Microsoft. We're actually becoming a cloud service provider so that we can bundle certain capabilities in the infrastructure together with our solution, the idea to really focus on customer simplicity and simplification. And that's going to be our strategy going forward. We've been embracing and extending the Microsoft platform for 30 years now.

And what that means is it's the opportunity to expand beyond traditional virtualization in the installed base. And think about providing customers with a platform upon which automation, security, analytics can reside that provides value even to the users that have really light application use, including those that don't need any virtualization whatsoever. So all applications, all potential seats inside of an account really anywhere in the world, et cetera. And that overall core message is resonating with customers.

Hopefully, everybody has had a chance to read through our quarterly results summary and all the new disclosures that we're going to be breaking out going forward. The idea here, of course, is designed to really simplify the understanding of our business and the success across our subscription model transition.
Before we get started, though, I want to welcome Jessica Soisson to the call. She's my long-term colleague, our current Chief Accounting Officer, and as Traci said, Interim CFO as Drew is leaving to pursue other opportunities. 
So as you saw in the summary, we had a really good quarter. We exceeded forecast on both revenue and EPS. And frankly, can boil it down into 3 key areas. First one, is that the strength is coming from the Workspace. Workspace revenue in total is up 13% year-on-year. This is the fastest growth we've seen in many, many years. 
Second is that total SaaS revenue for the company was up 43%, and this is due to the strength of our ongoing subscription bookings. In fact, the strength in subscription drove future committed revenue, which consists of deferred and unbilled up 21% from last year. In fact, the subscription mix is running ahead of plan, and I expect that to be the case throughout the year.
Third item is, as we've talked about a couple of times, the strategic service provider customers, really those 3 historically largest hyperscale networking customers just continuing to be a headwind to revenue due to timing. We expect this to persist into the second quarter, as I've previously stated. 
However, when you exclude these 3 SSP customers, revenue for the rest of the company was just under $700 million, which is up 10% year-over-year. So all in, just really happy with the performance of the quarter. 
And so now let's open it up for Q&A."

I'd say, overall, the business is continuing the trends that we've seen over the last, probably the last 6, 8 quarters in a row now. I mean, more specifically, we've been talking about the Workspace in broader terms than we ever had in the past. I mean, we created virtualization years and years ago, and we still have an amazing business in that area. But what's really resonating with customers is the broader vision around providing a holistic workspace for all application types, whether those are virtualized, SaaS, mobile, and really making that something that can help engage employees, drive productivity, simplify the infrastructure, et cetera. 
And so that's a lot of what we've been talking about, and we're getting a lot of great response from customers. That's allowed us to sign more and more up for longer-term subscription deals, generate a higher number of large enterprise deals. And so we feel good about it. Right now, we've got -- I'd say the amount of revenue coming from subscriptions is significantly higher than that of perpetual license, and that should continue. The growth rate will move around a little bit quarter-to-quarter just based on mix. It's still -- whether it's perpetual license or on-premise term that can tend to have a little higher rev rec. So directionally, it's up in the right, but I would expect it to bounce around a little bit along that trend."

Still expecting full year guidance of about 4% top line growth, margin up to about 32 points and $6 of EPS. And I'd say the only thing that I'm thinking about in terms of the full year is that subscription mix is running hotter towards subscription, so that causes a little bit of a headwind. Specific to Q2, we've never given 2Q guidance before. Q2, if you look back over the last couple of years, tends to be our lowest-margin quarter because it's our highest expense quarter. And the reason that is, is Q2 is a lot of seasonal items like our big Synergy conference, that's when we do merit increases. And correspondingly, that's our highest marketing quarter historically. So it tends to pop, and then come back down in Q3 and Q4, and I would expect that to be the case in this year as well."

So when we're talking about the SSP business, let me remind everybody. It's about 3% of total revenue. It's not a big number. But it is subject to both cyclical and secular pressures. Cyclically, it's lumpy, and it's always been that way. If you look at last year, there was about $100 million of business in the first half of the year and $50 million in the second half. And the year prior, it had similar lumpiness. And so as I've stated many times over the years, we have pretty good visibility into the full year, but the quarterization is a little harder. And that's the primary reason why we're going to break it out going forward. And so that everybody can look past it with a lot of clarity to understand when it's hurting and where it's contributing to the quarter. So on the broader secular trend, yes, it's been declining at a rate of about 10% for several years now. And so it's very consistent with the way we've talked about it. And that's just the normal scaling the 3 big hyperscales are going to have."

Workspace is a software product, and it's a much more natural transition there. On networking, I think it's important to take a little bit of a step back and think about strategically what we're driving. I mean we're a software company by nature. That's what we do. And so our approach to networking has been to really disaggregate the functionality from the hardware appliance itself. And that's always been the strategy. But giving customers that flexibility to consume networking hardware in the form factor of a hardware appliance, a virtual appliance as a container, and in some instances, as a service, and hearing capacity, in some instances, across those different types of form factors. That's really our strategy to be able to address a number of, let's call it different secular trends that are going on in networking entirely. So it will continue to move more towards software. I think that should be the expectation, but it'll be more gradual than on the Workspace business."

It's those types of things. But it also includes platform evolution. So I'd say that that's one of many. In terms of DaaS, we actually don't compete in DaaS today. We've announced that we are building a DaaS product on top of Azure virtual desktop, which we'll talk about a little bit later in the year. But it's a different category than we've competed in historically. And we do think it's important. That's one of the reasons why we're doing this natively on top of Microsoft. We're actually becoming a cloud service provider so that we can bundle certain capabilities in the infrastructure together with our solution, the idea to really focus on customer simplicity and simplification. And that's going to be our strategy going forward. We've been embracing and extending the Microsoft platform for 30 years now.

And think about providing customers with a platform upon which automation, security, analytics can reside that provides value even to the users that have really light application use, including those that don't need any virtualization whatsoever. So all applications, all potential seats inside of an account really anywhere in the world, et cetera. And that overall core message is resonating with customers. And I think that's allowed us to reengage and start accelerating that business over the past couple of years."

Before we get started, though, I want to welcome Jessica Soisson to the call. She's my long-term colleague, our current Chief Accounting Officer, and as Traci said, Interim CFO as Drew is leaving to pursue other opportunities. 
So as you saw in the summary, we had a really good quarter. We exceeded forecast on both revenue and EPS. And frankly, can boil it down into 3 key areas. First one is that the strength is coming from the Workspace. Workspace revenue in total is up 13% year-on-year. This is the fastest growth we've seen in many, many years. 
Second is that total SaaS revenue for the company was up 43%, and this is due to the strength of our ongoing subscription bookings. In fact, the strength in subscription drove future committed revenue, which consists of deferred and unbilled up 21% from last year. In fact, the subscription mix is running ahead of plan, and I expect that to be the case throughout the year.
Third item is, as we've talked about a couple of times, the strategic service provider customers. Really, those 3 historically largest hyperscale networking customers just continue to be a headwind to revenue due to timing. We expect this to persist into the second quarter, as I've previously stated. 
However, when you exclude these 3 SSP customers, revenue for the rest of the company was just under $700 million, which is up 10% year-over-year. So all in, just really happy with the performance of the quarter. 
And so now let's open it up for Q&A."

I'd say, overall, the business is continuing the trends that we've seen over the last -- probably the last 6, 8 quarters in a row now. I mean, more specifically, we've been talking about the Workspace in broader terms than we ever had in the past. I mean, we created virtualization years and years ago, and we still have an amazing business in that area. But what's really resonating with customers is the broader vision around providing a holistic workspace for all application types, whether those are virtualized, SaaS, mobile, and really making that something that can help engage employees, drive productivity, simplify the infrastructure, et cetera. 
And so that's a lot of what we've been talking about, and we're getting a lot of great response from customers. That's allowed us to sign more and more up for longer-term subscription deals, generate a higher number of large enterprise deals. And so we feel good about it. Right now, we've got -- I'd say the amount of revenue coming from subscriptions is significantly higher than that of perpetual license, and that should continue. The growth rate will move around a little bit quarter-to-quarter just based on mix. It's still -- whether it's perpetual license or on-premise term that can tend to have a little higher rev rec. So directionally, it's up in the right, but I would expect it to bounce around a little bit along that trend."

And I'd say the only thing that I'm thinking about in terms of the full year is that subscription mix is running hotter towards subscription, so that causes a little bit of a headwind. Specific to Q2, we've never given 2Q guidance before. Q2, if you look back over the last couple of years, tends to be our lowest-margin quarter because it's our highest expense quarter. And the reason that is, is Q2 is a lot of seasonal items like our big Synergy conference, that's when we do merit increases. And correspondingly, that's our highest marketing quarter historically. So it tends to pop, and then come back down in Q3 and Q4. And I would expect that to be the case in this year as well."

So when we're talking about the SSP business, let me remind everybody. It's about 3% of total revenue. It's not a big number. But it is subject to both cyclical and secular pressures. Cyclically, it's lumpy, and it's always been that way. If you look at last year, there was about $100 million of business in the first half of the year and $50 million in the second half. And the year prior had similar lumpiness. And so as I've stated many times over the years, we have pretty good visibility into the full year, but the quarterization is a little harder. And that's the primary reason why we're going to break it out going forward. And so that everybody can look past it with a lot of clarity to understand their -- when it's hurting and where it's contributing to the quarter. So on the broader secular trend, yes, it's been declining at a rate of about 10% for several years now. And so it's very consistent with the way we've talked about it.

Help me think about the pace by which you think you can pivot networking business into subscription.

Workspace is a software product, and it's a much more natural transition there. On networking, I think it's important to take a little bit of a step back and think about strategically what we're driving. I mean, we're a software company by nature. That's what we do. And so our approach to networking has been to really disaggregate the functionality from the hardware appliance itself. And that's always been the strategy. But giving customers that flexibility to consume networking hardware in the form factor of a hardware appliance; a virtual appliance as a container; and in some instances, as a service; and shearing capacity, in some instances, across those different types of form factors. That's really our strategy to be able to address a number of, let's call it different secular trends that are going on in networking entirely. So it will continue to move more towards software. I think that should be the expectation, but it'll be more gradual than on the Workspace business."

It's those types of things. But it also includes platform evolution. So I'd say that, that's one of many. In terms of DaaS, we actually don't compete in DaaS today. We've announced that we are building a DaaS product on top of Azure virtual desktop, which we'll talk about a little bit later in the year. But it's a different category than we've competed in historically. And we do think it's important. That's one of the reasons why we're doing this natively on top of Microsoft. We're actually becoming a cloud service provider so that we can bundle certain capabilities in the infrastructure together with our solution, the idea to really focus on customer simplicity and simplification. And that's going to be our strategy going forward. We've been embracing and extending the Microsoft platform for 30 years now.

Hopefully, everybody has had a chance to read through our quarterly results summary and all the new disclosures that we're going to be breaking out going forward.

Before we get started, though, I want to welcome Jessica Soisson to the call. She's my long-term colleague, our current Chief Accounting Officer, and as Traci said, Interim CFO as Drew is leaving to pursue other opportunities. 
So as you saw in the summary, we had a really good quarter. We exceeded forecast on both revenue and EPS. And frankly, can boil it down into 3 key areas. First one is that the strength is coming from the Workspace. Workspace revenue in total is up 13% year-on-year. This is the fastest growth we've seen in many, many years. 
Second is that total SaaS revenue for the company was up 43%, and this is due to the strength of our ongoing subscription bookings. In fact, the strength in subscription drove future committed revenue, which consists of deferred and unbilled up 21% from last year. In fact, the subscription mix is running ahead of plan, and I expect that to be the case throughout the year.
Third item is, as we've talked about a couple of times, the strategic service provider customers. Really, those 3 historically largest hyperscale networking customers just continue to be a headwind to revenue due to timing. We expect this to persist into the second quarter, as I've previously stated. 
However, when you exclude these 3 SSP customers, revenue for the rest of the company was just under $700 million, which is up 10% year-over-year. So all in, just really happy with the performance of the quarter. 
And so now let's open it up for Q&A."

I'd say, overall, the business is continuing the trends that we've seen over the last -- probably the last 6, 8 quarters in a row now. I mean, more specifically, we've been talking about the Workspace in broader terms than we ever had in the past. I mean, we created virtualization years and years ago, and we still have an amazing business in that area. But what's really resonating with customers is the broader vision around providing a holistic workspace for all application types, whether those are virtualized, SaaS, mobile, and really making that something that can help engage employees, drive productivity, simplify the infrastructure, et cetera. 
And so that's a lot of what we've been talking about, and we're getting a lot of great response from customers. That's allowed us to sign more and more up for longer-term subscription deals, generate a higher number of large enterprise deals. And so we feel good about it. Right now, we've got -- I'd say the amount of revenue coming from subscriptions is significantly higher than that of perpetual license, and that should continue. The growth rate will move around a little bit quarter-to-quarter just based on mix. It's still -- whether it's perpetual license or on-premise term that can tend to have a little higher rev rec. So directionally, it's up in the right, but I would expect it to bounce around a little bit along that trend."

Still expecting full year guidance of about 4% top line growth, margin up to about 32 points and $6 of EPS. And I'd say the only thing that I'm thinking about in terms of the full year is that subscription mix is running hotter towards subscription, so that causes a little bit of a headwind. Specific to Q2, we've never given 2Q guidance before. Q2, if you look back over the last couple of years, tends to be our lowest-margin quarter because it's our highest expense quarter. And the reason that is, is Q2 is a lot of seasonal items like our big Synergy conference, that's when we do merit increases. And correspondingly, that's our highest marketing quarter historically. So it tends to pop, and then come back down in Q3 and Q4. And I would expect that to be the case in this year as well."

So when we're talking about the SSP business, let me remind everybody. It's about 3% of total revenue. It's not a big number. But it is subject to both cyclical and secular pressures. Cyclically, it's lumpy, and it's always been that way. If you look at last year, there was about $100 million of business in the first half of the year and $50 million in the second half. And the year prior had similar lumpiness. And so as I've stated many times over the years, we have pretty good visibility into the full year, but the quarterization is a little harder. And that's the primary reason why we're going to break it out going forward. And so that everybody can look past it with a lot of clarity to understand their -- when it's hurting and where it's contributing to the quarter. So on the broader secular trend, yes, it's been declining at a rate of about 10% for several years now. And so it's very consistent with the way we've talked about it.

Help me think about the pace by which you think you can pivot networking business into subscription.

Workspace is a software product, and it's a much more natural transition there. On networking, I think it's important to take a little bit of a step back and think about strategically what we're driving. I mean, we're a software company by nature. That's what we do. And so our approach to networking has been to really disaggregate the functionality from the hardware appliance itself. And that's always been the strategy. But giving customers that flexibility to consume networking hardware in the form factor of a hardware appliance; a virtual appliance as a container; and in some instances, as a service; and shearing capacity, in some instances, across those different types of form factors. That's really our strategy to be able to address a number of, let's call it different secular trends that are going on in networking entirely. So it will continue to move more towards software. I think that should be the expectation, but it'll be more gradual than on the Workspace business."

It's those types of things. But it also includes platform evolution. So I'd say that, that's one of many. In terms of DaaS, we actually don't compete in DaaS today. We've announced that we are building a DaaS product on top of Azure virtual desktop, which we'll talk about a little bit later in the year. But it's a different category than we've competed in historically. And we do think it's important. That's one of the reasons why we're doing this natively on top of Microsoft. We're actually becoming a cloud service provider so that we can bundle certain capabilities in the infrastructure together with our solution, the idea to really focus on customer simplicity and simplification.

Hopefully, everybody has had a chance to read through our quarterly results summary and all the new disclosures that we're going to be breaking out going forward.

Before we get started, though, I want to welcome Jessica Soisson to the call. She's my long-term colleague, our current Chief Accounting Officer, and as Traci said, Interim CFO as Drew is leaving to pursue other opportunities. 
So as you saw in the summary, we had a really good quarter. We exceeded forecast on both revenue and EPS. And frankly, can boil it down into 3 key areas. First one is that the strength is coming from the Workspace. Workspace revenue in total is up 13% year-on-year. This is the fastest growth we've seen in many, many years. 
Second is that total SaaS revenue for the company was up 43%, and this is due to the strength of our ongoing subscription bookings. In fact, the strength in subscription drove future committed revenue, which consists of deferred and unbilled up 21% from last year. In fact, the subscription mix is running ahead of plan, and I expect that to be the case throughout the year.
Third item is, as we've talked about a couple of times, the strategic service provider customers. Really, those 3 historically largest hyperscale networking customers just continue to be a headwind to revenue due to timing. We expect this to persist into the second quarter, as I've previously stated. 
However, when you exclude these 3 SSP customers, revenue for the rest of the company was just under $700 million, which is up 10% year-over-year. So all in, just really happy with the performance of the quarter. 
And so now let's open it up for Q&A."

I'd say, overall, the business is continuing the trends that we've seen over the last -- probably the last 6, 8 quarters in a row now. I mean more specifically, we've been talking about the Workspace in broader terms than we ever had in the past. I mean we created virtualization years and years ago, and we still have an amazing business in that area. But what's really resonating with customers is the broader vision around providing a holistic workspace for all application types, whether those are virtualized, SaaS, mobile, and really making that something that can help engage employees, drive productivity, simplify the infrastructure, et cetera. 
And so that's a lot of what we've been talking about, and we're getting a lot of great response from customers. That's allowed us to sign more and more up for longer-term subscription deals, generate a higher number of large enterprise deals. And so we feel good about it. Right now, we've got -- I'd say the amount of revenue coming from subscriptions is significantly higher than that of perpetual license, and that should continue. The growth rate will move around a little bit quarter-to-quarter just based on mix. It's still -- whether it's perpetual license or on-premise term that can tend to have a little higher rev rec. So directionally, it's up in the right, but I would expect it to bounce around a little bit along that trend."

And I'd say the only thing that I'm thinking about in terms of the full year is that subscription mix is running hotter towards subscription, so that causes a little bit of a headwind. Specific to Q2, we've never given 2Q guidance before. Q2, if you look back over the last couple of years, tends to be our lowest-margin quarter because it's our highest expense quarter. And the reason that is, is Q2 is a lot of seasonal items like our big Synergy conference, that's when we do merit increases. And correspondingly, that's our highest marketing quarter historically. So it tends to pop, and then come back down in Q3 and Q4. And I would expect that to be the case in this year as well."

So when we're talking about the SSP business, let me remind everybody. It's about 3% of total revenue. It's not a big number. But it is subject to both cyclical and secular pressures. Cyclically, it's lumpy, and it's always been that way. If you look at last year, there was about $100 million of business in the first half of the year and $50 million in the second half. And the year prior had similar lumpiness. And so as I've stated many times over the years, we have pretty good visibility into the full year, but the quarterization is a little harder. And that's the primary reason why we're going to break it out going forward. And so that everybody can look past it with a lot of clarity to understand their -- when it's hurting and where it's contributing to the quarter. So on the broader secular trend, yes, it's been declining at a rate of about 10% for several years now. And so it's very consistent with the way we've talked about it. And that's just the normal scaling that the 3 big hyperscales are going to have."

Help me think about the pace by which you think you can pivot networking business into subscription.

Workspace is a software product, and it's a much more natural transition there. On networking, I think it's important to take a little bit of a step back and think about strategically what we're driving. I mean we're a software company by nature. That's what we do. And so our approach to networking has been to really disaggregate the functionality from the hardware appliance itself. And that's always been the strategy. But giving customers that flexibility to consume networking hardware in the form factor of a hardware appliance; a virtual appliance as a container; and in some instances, as a service; and shearing capacity, in some instances, across those different types of form factors. That's really our strategy to be able to address a number of, let's call it different secular trends that are going on in networking entirely. So it will continue to move more towards software. I think that should be the expectation, but it'll be more gradual than on the Workspace business."

It's those types of things. But it also includes platform evolution. So I'd say that, that's one of many. In terms of DaaS, we actually don't compete in DaaS today. We've announced that we are building a DaaS product on top of Azure virtual desktop, which we'll talk about a little bit later in the year. But it's a different category than we've competed in historically. And we do think it's important. That's one of the reasons why we're doing this natively on top of Microsoft. We're actually becoming a cloud service provider so that we can bundle certain capabilities in the infrastructure together with our solution, the idea to really focus on customer simplicity and simplification. And that's going to be our strategy going forward. We've been embracing and extending the Microsoft platform for 30 years now.

Thanks to everybody for joining the call. I hope everybody had an opportunity to review the earnings letter that we posted to our IR site. And similar to last quarter, I'm going to keep my opening remarks really brief so",659,"Thanks, Traci, and good afternoon. Thanks to everybody for joining the call. I hope everybody had an opportunity to review the earnings letter that we posted to our IR site. And similar to last quarter, I'm going to keep my opening remarks really brief so we can jump right into Q&A, and I thought it would be important to provide a little bit of context of the business overall. 
So I think all in, we're really happy with our performance in the second quarter. Demand across our products and our geos was remarkably consistent throughout the quarter. The only real difference was mix. Now we clearly underestimated the demand for subscription licensing in the quarter. The subscription transition for new licensing is really happen faster than we forecasted across both of our major businesses, which is strategically where we're driving the company. 
We expected this accelerated pace will continue for the full year. The obvious consequence here of the faster shift is revenue, margins, earnings and cash flow are going to be impacted in the short term with the offset represented in unbilled and deferred revenue in particular. Just to be really clear here. So the mix shift explains in the entire difference between our reported second quarter results and our guidance. We have guided a midpoint mix of about 52%, and the actual was 62%. Within this result, we also saw a record subscription booking levels in both of our businesses. The Workspace product mix jumped up to 71% from 58 a year ago while Networking moved from 11% last year up to 35% in Q2. We'll talk more about the demand drivers once we get into the Q&A. 
It's important to point out again that for all of our financial statements going to be impacted by the business transition including cash flow because we typically bill annually for subscription contracts rather than everything upfront like we typically do in perpetual license deal so less cash is collected in the current period, more cash is going to be collected in future periods. So in other words, the strength that we're seeing in subscription bookings serve to improve our predictability and certainly accelerate our growth in future periods. And that's the primary reason why we've introduced future committed revenues, one of our new metrics. Hopefully, you saw that, that balance is now up to $2.2 billion. It's up $290 million or 15% from last year. It's the easiest way to just think about the transition. 
But to make the full year transition really simple for everybody, I'll just give you a quick rule of thumb, that is for every 1 percentage point change in mix, it's equal to roughly $10 million to $12 million in recognized revenue for a full year basis. This offset to the decrease in recognized revenue in the period is generally the corresponding increase to unbilled or deferred revenue. So that when you look at our full year guidance, we now expect the subscription mix of new product bookings of at least 60% to 65%. This compared to 50, 55 earlier. This is a change from our prior guidance to current guidance. 
Finally, this quarter, we are introducing ARR, or annualized recurring revenue, as probably the most important KPI for our business. The way we calculated this is a bottoms-up, contract-based metrics, which we believe is really the most important way to measure the performance in this transition. You'll see a 5-quarter history in our earnings letter. I'll point out for Q2, total subscription ARR was $614 million, and that's up 33% year-on-year while the SaaS-only ARR was $418 million, and that's up nearly 50% year-over-year. As we continue to move through the business model transformation, we expect to see very strong continued growth in both of these metrics. 
So let me stop there with that and turn it back over to the operator so that we can open it up and take your questions."

The other 2 businesses that show up in the other subscription you pointed out CSP, which for everybody is the consumption-based subscription that we have mostly through our partners. That business is north of $100 million run rate now, continues to grow nicely. 
And then the on-premise term, I'd say on-premise term is a bridge for a lot of customers as they're moving from a perpetual license to a true subscription. A lot of those tend to be hybrid licenses where they're working through the transition of their own interests infrastructure. Long term, we actually want to highlight much more SaaS-driven so on-prem term is a bridge in between the 2, but the fastest growing part of the business is pure SaaS."

That's like those numbers, those are new product mix and so there's 2 things going on. We have been leading the market for years around desktop virtualization, just pure virtualization. I think that part of the overall business a nice resurgence in the last couple of years because customers are really focused on building and security in those types of opportunities. But really, what's most important for us and probably most exciting is the message that we're driving customers right now about the intelligent Workspace and how we can move those capabilities not just for those focused on virtualization but really add value to everybody inside the enterprise. And we introduced a number of those capabilities and -- at our Synergy conference a couple of months ago we'll be shipping those in the back half of the year so I think our message is resonating, and it will allow us over a long period of time to really expand our available TAM, drive incremental penetration within our installed base and also look for net new customers that really are not using any form of virtualization. So that's where we're taking the product line. That one is clearly leading the subscription transition, and I would expect it to be close to 80% by the end of the year."

In the longer term, it's just huge opportunity for customers to continue to move their Citrix workflows onto Azure, and that's why it works so well with them. 
Specific to your question about individual products, yes, Brad was with us at Synergy, and we announced a number of new things. For example, the support of their new platform, which they call Windows Virtual Desktop. Now we've integrated that with Citrix Cloud so customers can look at that at as one more place to render workloads giving them really unprecedented flexibility across Citrix Cloud. We also announced the Citrix Managed Desktops, which is really a  service on top of that platform. We're doing that with Microsoft, and we'll be able to bundle Azure capacity a little create a turnkey. We also announced a number of other areas, I'm sure I'm going to forget all of them, but optimization is for Windows -- for Office 365, for SD-WAN. You can do a lot of really cool things to accelerate the performance of Office, optimization for teams, SD-WAN more broadly for Windows Virtual Desktop, adding performance and resiliency as well as a number of other areas.

We do need to talk about those things in the context of a longer discussion so. I think as everybody knows each year, we update long-term targets as we've been moving through this transition, and that's based on actual results customer feedback and the outlook. We're going to do that again this year are our analyst meeting in a couple of months, but let's take a bit of a step back for a minute. And so we're 2 years into this transition. I think we made really good progress all in. But unlike other model transitions that we've seen across the industry, we've never really seen any material impact on the P&L up to this point. I think that's been for 2 reasons. First is that we have just a better internal execution, a really good product story so we've sold more. We've sold more and we've just been trying to balance the impact to that point. So phase 1 has been focused really on net new, largely focused So last year, we moved about 42% of the net new subscriptions. This year, as I've said, we're looking at 60%, 65% so that's a big increase. The numbers are now large enough that it's creating this headwind that you're seeing over the course of Q2 and the balance of this year, the really the reported P&L. Again, like I mentioned a minute ago, the offset is going to show up in deferred and unbilled plus these new metrics for everybody has The way I'm thinking about the next couple of years is phase 2 is going to bring much more focus on transitioning on really big installed base. So it started out this year. We've seen a nice uplift in kind of annualized dollars those customers are paying for those we've transitioned so far, and so this is a big incremental opportunity. That's hundreds of millions of dollars annually. That's going to start to become a priority in 2020, and that's why to help understand this, we've delivered these new metrics, unbilled revenue, ARR, in particular, so that everybody can really see how that impacts beyond reported P&L. 
So we'll talk about all that in -- at our next analyst meeting make sure we have complete perspective. Again, we're providing the metrics you can measure along the way, look much more like a traditional subscription transition and looking forward to having that in-depth conversation."

And then I just wanted to follow up because I know the question about Microsoft. My question is just more related to Windows 10. There's been some people wondering how much of a driver that's been for the whole Workspace so how does that, that filling -- the to the Windows 10 which has to be done by mid-January, does that become a headwind when you start to think about calendar '20 top line?"

I think desktop isn't driver that it would've been for major projects like it was a decade ago. I'd say it's one of the many projects our customers are looking at, and it's one of the things that we can engage in. I'd say that more broadly speaking, when you're talking to customers, every customer meeting I had throughout Q2 was focused, I'd say, first on security on how they're looking at managing an increasingly complex infrastructure; second, on mobility around just finally enabling devices to be used in the enterprise in a secure, simple way across what is usually hundreds of applications in the enterprises. And then the lastly, this idea that a little more about our roadmap and our vision about embracing employee productivity and driving engagement things will just make them -- their teams more productive. And so I'd say, that's probably the bigger driver than any one-off like a Win 10 migration. 
Back to the other question about the installed base. Yes, it's been -- we've actually seen really good success with those customers so far. I'd say it's a limited I wouldn't read too far into it, but the average uplift we saw in Q2 was like 40% from what they have been paying on a typical maintenance contract. And again, that's because it's not just a like-for-like, but this whole migration opportunity is about moving them from what might have been a virtual app sale to a more broad Workspace sale. And so we'll get that uplift as we do that but also provides that platform for us to start expanding more horizontally into untapped that customer so it's really a dual strategy. So we're really happy with what we're seeing so far. We just had to scale that out. It's one of the reasons why we've unified our motions globally now.

It's actually a really interesting dynamic that's happening right now. I'd say I think, as everybody would understand, there are secular changes going on in Networking in general really driven by the adoption of cloud more than anything else. And so what you've seen over the last quarters is a more pronounced moved to software versus hardware, and that's simply because customers are looking for more flexibility, more choices in a way that they deploy their capabilities. The good news for Citrix, in particular, is that were a software company, and we can deploy our networking hardware in a physical appliance, virtual container, a container as a service and a number of other things, and that's what gives customers flexibility. So the dynamic were seeing right now is the customers that may be in the past would've thought about the hardware refresh cycle, now they're looking at it as a software refresh cycle where buy in our licensing terms our capacity license that can be shared across an on-premise infrastructure, any form of hybrid in the cloud and the container, et cetera, we've got this a great Control Plane and that allows you to help manage that in a reasonably seamless way customers have a lot more flexibility. That's something that we've got unique capabilities, and we're that in the market fairly aggressively, and customers responded. I think 35% of the mix in one quarter is a little higher than I would have expected. That's up from just over 10 a year ago, but that's a trend I expect to continue."

That business will continue to move up. Obviously, the gains will start to slow down on an incremental space because And then Networking as it's moved up much more materially from 10 a year ago to 35 now, that's the biggest change. 
We will still continue to sell a fair bit of hardware so I do not expect that in the next 12 months, let's say, to get north of 50%. But I think the rate that we're at right now is probably a pretty good floor, and it'll move up from here. And it's a function of 2 things.

If you're coming back to the Microsoft question, think about Windows Virtual Desktop as a platform, very similar to the way people of thought about Remote Desktop services over the years, which is part of Windows I think that's the easiest way to conceptualize it. And so as a platform, it's a multiuser version of Win 10. And so for a lot of our customers, they look at that as maybe a use case that makes sense and part of their business alongside everything else they're trying to accomplish. Our average customers delivering over 500 applications across all different app types and so for us to be able to open up Windows virtual desktop is another resource known or another type of capability that could be managed inside of Citrix Cloud very similar to the way you would be managing, for example, an on-premise application or maybe published SaaS application. So for a lot of customers, that just provides more flexibility. From a platform standpoint, Citrix building a DaaS service on top of that really just embraces and extends a lot of the capabilities to be much more feature-rich on the Enterprise side. So that's probably the easiest way to think about that. It's a component of a broader -- a broader infrastructure from a typical Citrix customer.

From a revenue standpoint, you're not selling the box along with it so we may have a little bit of lower revenue headwind in the short term, but getting customers to build this out from a the software standpoint I think is going to drive stickiness. So had to go back and look at is probably a little more case-by-case than in the aggregate, but I'd say that breakeven from gross margin and really the extension of gross margin dollars is relatively short term."

We're driving the business towards a subscription model probably faster than we would've anticipated over the course of the last several quarters. I mean Q2 was a great example of that performance shift with relative to guidance, and that's why we updated the back half of the year. 
We're delivering all these incremental metrics to make sure you can look at the business holistically whether that's ARR, with subscription ARR of 33% of SaaS ARR of nearly 50%. So that was the most important way to lead the business on a go-forward basis. 
Hopefully, everybody can join us at our upcoming analyst meeting the next couple of months. Look forward to seeing you there. And if not, talk to you again in 3 months. Thank you."

26524,629094834,1777967,"Citrix Systems, Inc., Q2 2019 Earnings Call, Jul 24, 2019",2019-07-24,"Earnings Calls","Citrix Systems, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Traci, and good afternoon.

I hope everybody had an opportunity to review the earnings letter that we posted to our IR site. Similar to last quarter, I'm going to keep my opening remarks really brief so we can jump right into Q&A, but I thought it'd be important to provide a little bit of context on the business overall. 
So I think all in, I'm really happy with our performance in the second quarter. Demand across our products and our geos was remarkably consistent throughout the quarter. The only real difference was mix. We clearly underestimated the demand for subscription licensing in the quarter. The subscription transition for new licensing is really happening faster than we forecasted across both of our major businesses, which is strategically where we're driving the company. 
We expected this accelerated pace to really continue for the full year. The obvious consequence here of the faster shift is that revenue, margins, earnings and cash flow are going to be impacted in the short term, with the offset represented in unbilled and deferred revenue in particular. 
Just to be really clear here. So the mix shift explains the entire difference between our reported second quarter results and our guidance. We had guided a midpoint mix of about 52%, and the actual was 62%. Within this result, we also saw record subscription booking levels in both of our businesses. The Workspace product mix jumped up to 71% from 58% a year ago, while Networking moved from 11% last year up to 35% in Q2. And I can talk much more about the demand drivers once we get into Q&A. 
It's important to point out again that for all of our financial statements are going to be impacted by the business transition, including cash flow, because we typically bill annually for subscription contracts rather than everything upfront like we typically do in a perpetual license deal. So less cash is collected in the current period, more cash is going to be collected in future periods. So in other words, the strength that we're seeing in subscription bookings serve to improve our predictability and certainly accelerate our growth in future period. That's the primary reason why we've introduced future committed revenues, one of our new metrics. Hopefully, you saw that, that balance is now up to $2.2 billion. It's up $290 million or 15% from last year. It's really the easiest way to think about the transition. 
But to make the full year transition math really simple for everybody, let me just give you a quick rule of thumb. That is for every 1 percentage point change in mix, it's equal to roughly $10 million to $12 million in recognized revenue for a full year basis. This offset to the decrease in recognized revenue in the period is generally the corresponding increase to unbilled or deferred revenue. So that when you look at our full year guidance, we now expect a subscription mix of new product bookings of at least 60% to 65%. This compared to 50%, 55% earlier. This is a change from our prior guidance to our current guidance. 
Finally, this quarter, we are introducing ARR, or annualized recurring revenue, as probably the most important KPI for our business. The way we've calculated this is a bottoms-up, contract-based metrics, which we believe is really the most important way to measure the performance of this transition. You'll see a 5-quarter history in our earnings letter. And I'll point out, for Q2, total subscription ARR was $614 million, and that's up 33% year-on-year. While the SaaS-only ARR was $418 million, and that's up nearly 50% year-over-year. As we continue to move through the business model transformation, we expect to see very strong continued growth in both of these metrics. 
So let me stop there with that and turn it back over to the operator so that we can open it up and take your questions. Ashley?"

The other 2 businesses that show up and the other subscription you pointed out, CSP, which for everybody is the consumption-based subscription that we have mostly through our partners, that business is north of $100 million run rate now, continues to grow nicely. 
And then on-premise term. And I'd say on-premise term is a bridge for a lot of customers as they're moving from a perpetual license to a true subscription. A lot of those tend to be hybrid licenses, where they're working through the transition of their own infrastructure. Long term, we actually want to highlight much more SaaS-driven. And so on-prem term is -- I look at that as a bit of a bridge in between the 2, but the fastest-growing part of the business is pure SaaS."

Those are new product mix and so there's 2 things going on. I mean we have been leading the market for years around desktop and app virtualization, just pure virtualization. And I think that part of the overall business has seen a nice resurgence in the last couple of years because customers are really focused on mobility and security and those types of opportunities. 
But really, what's most important for us and probably most exciting is the message that we're driving with customers right now about the intelligent Workspace and how we can move those capabilities not just for those users that are focused on virtualization, but really add value to everybody inside the enterprise. And we introduced a number of those capabilities in -- at our Synergy Conference a couple of months ago. We'll be shipping those in the back half of the year. So I think our message is resonating, and it'll allow us over a long period of time to really expand our available TAM, drive incremental penetration within our installed base and also look for net new customers that really are not using any form of virtualization. So that's where we're taking the product line. That one is clearly leading the subscription transition, and I would expect it to be close to 80% by the end of the year."

In the longer term, it's a huge opportunity for customers to continue to move their Citrix workflows onto Azure or one of the other major cloud properties, and that's why we work so well with them. 
Specific to your question about individual products. Yes, Brad was with us at Synergy, and we announced a number of new things. For example, the support of their new platform, which they call Windows Virtual Desktop. Now we've integrated that with Citrix Cloud so that customers can look at that at as one more place to run their workloads, giving them really unprecedented flexibility across Citrix Cloud. 
We also announced the Citrix Managed Desktops, which is really a DaaS service sitting on top of that platform. And we're doing that with Microsoft, and we'll be able to bundle Azure capacity and really create a clean turnkey. 
We also announced a number of other areas, and I'm sure I'm going to forget all of them, but optimizations for Windows -- excuse me, for Office 365, for SD-WAN. We can do a lot of really cool things to accelerate the performance of Office, HDX optimizations for Teams, SD-WAN more broadly for Windows Virtual Desktop, adding performance and resiliency as well as a number of other areas. So I'd say the partnership is as broad as it's certainly been in any time in my 17 years."

So I think as everybody knows, each year we update long-term targets as we've been moving through this transition, and that's based on actual results, customer feedback and the outlook. And we're going to do that again this year at our Analyst Meeting in a couple of months. But let's take a bit of a step back for a minute. 
So we're 2 years into this transition. I think we made really good progress all in. But unlike other model transitions that we've seen across the industry, we've never really seen any material impact on the P&L up to this point. I think that's been for 2 reasons. First is that we've just had better internal execution and a really good product story so we've sold more. We've sold more and we've just been trying to balance the impact up to that point. And so Phase 1 has been focused really on net new, largely due to capacity and focus. And so last year, we moved about 42% of the net new mix to subscription. This year, as I said, we're looking at 60%, 65%. So that's a big increase. The numbers are now large enough that it's creating this headwind that you're seeing over the course of Q2 and the balance of this year really in the reported P&L. Again, like I mentioned a minute ago, the offset is going to show up in deferred and unbilled, plus these new metrics. So everybody has complete visibility. 
The way I'm thinking about the next couple of years, though, is Phase 2 is going to bring much more focus on transitioning our really big installed base. So we've started that this year. We've seen a nice uplift in kind of the annualized dollars that those customers are paying for those we've transitioned so far, and so this is a big incremental opportunity. That's hundreds of millions of dollars annually. That's going to start to become a priority in 2020, and that's why to help everybody understand this, we've delivered these new metrics, unbilled revenue, ARR, in particular, so that everybody can really just see how that -- it impacts beyond reported P&L. 
So we'll talk about all that in -- at our next Analyst Meeting, make sure that you have complete perspective. Again, we're providing the metrics so you can measure us along the way, look much more like a traditional subscription transition and looking forward to having that in-depth conversation."

I'd say that more broadly speaking, when we're talking to customers today, and every customer meeting I had throughout Q2, was focused, I'd say, first on security, on how they're looking at managing an increasingly complex infrastructure. 
Second, on mobility around just finally enabling devices to be used in the enterprise in a secure, simple way across what is usually hundreds of applications in most enterprises. 
And then lastly, this idea that's a little bit more about our road map and our vision about really embracing employee productivity and driving engagement, things that will just make them -- their teams more productive. And so I'd say that's probably the bigger driver than any one-off like a Win 10 migration. 
Back to the other question about the installed base. Yes, it's been -- we've actually seen really good success with those customers that we've updated so far. I'd say it's a limited set. So I wouldn't read too far into it, but the average uplift that we saw in Q2 was like 40% from what they had been paying on a typical maintenance contract. And again, that's because it's not just a like-for-like, but this whole migration opportunity is about moving them from what might have been a virtual app sale to a more broad Workspace sale. And so we'll get that uplift as we do that, but it also provides that platform for us to start expanding more horizontally into untapped seats inside that customer. So it's really a dual strategy. So we're really happy with what we're seeing so far. And we just have to scale that up. And it's one of the reasons why we've unified our renewal promotions globally now. We have introduced a new COO into the company, an existing employee, and help focus on really driving this Phase 2 in the next couple of years."

One important point to point out is that we are still selling perpetual licenses and so the installed base, as you define it, is still moving. It's still growing so it's not static necessarily. But that said, I'd say it's less than 10% at this point. And that's been intentional. I mean -- and we wanted to make sure that we get this whole process moving around and focused around net new and I think that's important. And once we have that going, and you've seen this really driving the business over the last couple of years, this gives us a much better framework to go and drive installed base. And I also think it's also given us an opportunity to really make sure the product sets across Citrix Cloud, across intelligent Workspace and all these new initiatives so that it's not just a migrate-to-cloud story, it's a much broader opportunity to talk about employee productivity and ways that we can help really drive what, in marketing terms, we call the future of work but a holistic strategy for customers."

It's actually a really interesting dynamic that's happening right now. I'd say I think as everybody would understand, there are secular changes going on in Networking in general, really driven by the adoption of cloud more than anything else. And so what we've seen over the last few quarters is a more pronounced move to software versus hardware, and that's simply because customers are looking for more flexibility, more choices in the way that they deploy their capabilities. 
And the good news for Citrix, in particular, is that we're a software company and we can deploy our networking hardware on a physical appliance, in a virtual container, a in docker container as a service and a number of other things, and that's what gives customers flexibility. So the dynamic we're seeing right now is that customers that may be in the past would have thought about a hardware refresh cycle, now they're looking at it as, why don't I do a software refresh cycle where I can buy, in our licensing terms, a pooled capacity license that could be shared across an on-premise infrastructure, any form of hybrid in a cloud, in a container, et cetera. We've got this great control plane that allows you to help manage that in a reasonably seamless way. So it just gives customers a lot more flexibility. That's something that we've got as pretty unique capabilities, and we're pushing that in the market fairly aggressively, and customers are responding. I think 35% of the mix in one quarter is a little higher than I would have expected. That's up from just over 10 a year ago, but that's a trend I expect to continue."

As I pointed out, you can see in our letter, 71% of Workspace mix is now coming via subscription. That was up about 10 points from Q1 and 15 points or so year-on-year. That business will continue to move up. Obviously, the gains will start to slow down on an incremental mix basis because it's so rich. And then Networking, as it's moved up much more materially from 10% a year ago to 35% now, that's the biggest change. 
We will still continue to sell a fair bit of hardware so I do not expect that in the next 12 months, let's say, to get north of 50%. But I think the rate that we're at right now is probably a pretty good floor, and it'll move up from here. And it's a function of 2 things. I think we have tried as a company to balance the transition, actively balance that over the last 6, 8 quarters while giving customers the choice that they want.

I mean if you're coming back to the Microsoft-specific question, think about Windows Virtual Desktop as a platform, very similar to the way people have thought about Remote Desktop Services over the years, which was part of Windows Server. I think that's the easiest way to conceptualize it. And so as a platform, it's a multiuser version of Win 10. And so for a lot of our customers, they look at that as maybe a use case that makes sense in part of their business alongside everything else they're trying to accomplish. Our average customer is delivering over 500 applications across all different app types. And so for us to be able to open up Windows Virtual Desktop is another resource zone or another type of capability that could be managed inside of Citrix Cloud very similar to the way you would be managing, for example, an on-premise application or maybe a published SaaS application. So for a lot of customers, it just provides more flexibility. 
From a platform standpoint, Citrix building a DaaS service on top of that really just embraces and extends a lot of the capabilities to be much more feature-rich on the enterprise side. So those are -- that's probably the easiest way to think about that. It's a component of a broader infrastructure from a typical Citrix customer standpoint.

On the CFO search, it's going well. We've met with a number of external candidates. We have some great internal candidates as well, and we're just going through the process very methodically.

We're driving the business towards a subscription model probably faster than we would've anticipated over the course of the last several quarters. I mean Q2 was a great example of that performance shift relative to guidance, and that's why we updated the back half of the year. 
We're delivering all these incremental metrics to make sure that you can look at the business holistically, whether that's ARR, with subscription ARR up 33% and SaaS ARR up nearly 50%. So that will be the most important way to lead the business on a go-forward basis.

I hope everybody had an opportunity to review the earnings letter that we posted to our IR site. Similar to last quarter, I'm going to keep my opening remarks really brief so we can jump right into Q&A, but I thought it'd be important to provide a little bit of context on the business overall. 
So I think all in, I'm really happy with our performance in the second quarter. Demand across our products and our geos was remarkably consistent throughout the quarter. The only real difference was mix. We clearly underestimated the demand for subscription licensing in the quarter. The subscription transition for new licensing is really happening faster than we forecasted across both of our major businesses, which is strategically where we're driving the company. 
We expected this accelerated pace to really continue for the full year. The obvious consequence here of the faster shift is that revenue, margins, earnings and cash flow are going to be impacted in the short term, with the offset represented in unbilled and deferred revenue in particular. 
Just to be really clear here. So the mix shift explains the entire difference between our reported second quarter results and our guidance. We had guided a midpoint mix of about 52%, and the actual was 62%. Within this result, we also saw record subscription booking levels in both of our businesses. The Workspace product mix jumped up to 71% from 58% a year ago, while Networking moved from 11% last year up to 35% in Q2. And I can talk much more about the demand drivers once we get into Q&A. 
It's important to point out again that for all of our financial statements are going to be impacted by the business transition, including cash flow, because we typically bill annually for subscription contracts rather than everything upfront like we typically do in a perpetual license deal. So less cash is collected in the current period, more cash is going to be collected in future periods. So in other words, the strength that we're seeing in subscription bookings serve to improve our predictability and certainly accelerate our growth in future period. That's the primary reason why we've introduced future committed revenues, one of our new metrics. Hopefully, you saw that, that balance is now up to $2.2 billion. It's up $290 million or 15% from last year. It's really the easiest way to think about the transition. 
But to make the full year transition math really simple for everybody, let me just give you a quick rule of thumb. That is for every 1 percentage point change in mix, it's equal to roughly $10 million to $12 million in recognized revenue for a full year basis. This offset to the decrease in recognized revenue in the period is generally the corresponding increase to unbilled or deferred revenue. So that when you look at our full year guidance, we now expect a subscription mix of new product bookings of at least 60% to 65%. This compared to 50%, 55% earlier. This is a change from our prior guidance to our current guidance. 
Finally, this quarter, we are introducing ARR, or annualized recurring revenue, as probably the most important KPI for our business. The way we've calculated this is a bottoms-up, contract-based metrics, which we believe is really the most important way to measure the performance of this transition. You'll see a 5-quarter history in our earnings letter. And I'll point out, for Q2, total subscription ARR was $614 million, and that's up 33% year-on-year. While the SaaS-only ARR was $418 million, and that's up nearly 50% year-over-year. As we continue to move through the business model transformation, we expect to see very strong continued growth in both of these metrics. 
So let me stop there with that and turn it back over to the operator so that we can open it up and take your questions. Ashley?"

The other 2 businesses that show up and the other subscription you pointed out, CSP, which for everybody is the consumption-based subscription that we have mostly through our partners, that business is north of $100 million run rate now, continues to grow nicely. 
And then on-premise term. And I'd say on-premise term is a bridge for a lot of customers as they're moving from a perpetual license to a true subscription. A lot of those tend to be hybrid licenses, where they're working through the transition of their own infrastructure. Long term, we actually want to highlight much more SaaS-driven. And so on-prem term is -- I look at that as a bit of a bridge in between the 2, but the fastest-growing part of the business is pure SaaS."

Those are new product mix and so there's 2 things going on. I mean we have been leading the market for years around desktop and app virtualization, just pure virtualization. And I think that part of the overall business has seen a nice resurgence in the last couple of years because customers are really focused on mobility and security and those types of opportunities. 
But really, what's most important for us and probably most exciting is the message that we're driving with customers right now about the intelligent Workspace and how we can move those capabilities not just for those users that are focused on virtualization, but really add value to everybody inside the enterprise. And we introduced a number of those capabilities in -- at our Synergy Conference a couple of months ago. We'll be shipping those in the back half of the year. So I think our message is resonating, and it'll allow us over a long period of time to really expand our available TAM, drive incremental penetration within our installed base and also look for net new customers that really are not using any form of virtualization. So that's where we're taking the product line. That one is clearly leading the subscription transition, and I would expect it to be close to 80% by the end of the year."

And we've -- we can joint sell with Microsoft and really help support a lot of those capabilities, and so that's been very positive. In the longer term, it's a huge opportunity for customers to continue to move their Citrix workflows onto Azure or one of the other major cloud properties, and that's why we work so well with them. 
Specific to your question about individual products. Yes, Brad was with us at Synergy, and we announced a number of new things. For example, the support of their new platform, which they call Windows Virtual Desktop. Now we've integrated that with Citrix Cloud so that customers can look at that at as one more place to run their workloads, giving them really unprecedented flexibility across Citrix Cloud. 
We also announced the Citrix Managed Desktops, which is really a DaaS service sitting on top of that platform. And we're doing that with Microsoft, and we'll be able to bundle Azure capacity and really create a clean turnkey. 
We also announced a number of other areas, and I'm sure I'm going to forget all of them, but optimizations for Windows -- excuse me, for Office 365, for SD-WAN. We can do a lot of really cool things to accelerate the performance of Office, HDX optimizations for Teams, SD-WAN more broadly for Windows Virtual Desktop, adding performance and resiliency as well as a number of other areas. So I'd say the partnership is as broad as it's certainly been in any time in my 17 years."

We do need to talk about those things in the context of a longer discussion. So I think as everybody knows, each year we update long-term targets as we've been moving through this transition, and that's based on actual results, customer feedback and the outlook. And we're going to do that again this year at our Analyst Meeting in a couple of months. But let's take a bit of a step back for a minute. 
So we're 2 years into this transition. I think we made really good progress all in. But unlike other model transitions that we've seen across the industry, we've never really seen any material impact on the P&L up to this point. I think that's been for 2 reasons. First is that we've just had better internal execution and a really good product story so we've sold more. We've sold more and we've just been trying to balance the impact up to that point. And so Phase 1 has been focused really on net new, largely due to capacity and focus. And so last year, we moved about 42% of the net new mix to subscription. This year, as I said, we're looking at 60%, 65%. So that's a big increase. The numbers are now large enough that it's creating this headwind that you're seeing over the course of Q2 and the balance of this year really in the reported P&L. Again, like I mentioned a minute ago, the offset is going to show up in deferred and unbilled, plus these new metrics. So everybody has complete visibility. 
The way I'm thinking about the next couple of years, though, is Phase 2 is going to bring much more focus on transitioning our really big installed base. So we've started that this year. We've seen a nice uplift in kind of the annualized dollars that those customers are paying for those we've transitioned so far, and so this is a big incremental opportunity. That's hundreds of millions of dollars annually. That's going to start to become a priority in 2020, and that's why to help everybody understand this, we've delivered these new metrics, unbilled revenue, ARR, in particular, so that everybody can really just see how that -- it impacts beyond reported P&L. 
So we'll talk about all that in -- at our next Analyst Meeting, make sure that you have complete perspective. Again, we're providing the metrics so you can measure us along the way, look much more like a traditional subscription transition and looking forward to having that in-depth conversation."

Just on the point that you just mentioned in terms of Phase 2 of the transition of the installed base, any comments you could mention about churn thus far as you've been seeing those big customers transition and kind of what the level of uplift is that you're getting on pricing for those that are staying and kind of what the price realization is? 
And then I just wanted to follow up because I know Phil asked a question about Microsoft. My question is just more related to Windows 10. There's been some people wondering how much of a driver that's been to the whole Workspace services improvements. And how does that filling -- the migration from Windows 7 to Windows 10, which has to be done by mid-January, does that become a headwind when you start to think about calendar '20 top line?"

I think desktop no less isn't the driver that it would've been for a major project like it was a decade ago. 
I'd say it's one of the many projects that customers are looking at, and it's one of the things that we can engage in. I'd say that more broadly speaking, when we're talking to customers today, and every customer meeting I had throughout Q2, was focused, I'd say, first on security, on how they're looking at managing an increasingly complex infrastructure. 
Second, on mobility around just finally enabling devices to be used in the enterprise in a secure, simple way across what is usually hundreds of applications in most enterprises. 
And then lastly, this idea that's a little bit more about our road map and our vision about really embracing employee productivity and driving engagement, things that will just make them -- their teams more productive. And so I'd say that's probably the bigger driver than any one-off like a Win 10 migration. 
Back to the other question about the installed base. Yes, it's been -- we've actually seen really good success with those customers that we've updated so far. I'd say it's a limited set. So I wouldn't read too far into it, but the average uplift that we saw in Q2 was like 40% from what they had been paying on a typical maintenance contract. And again, that's because it's not just a like-for-like, but this whole migration opportunity is about moving them from what might have been a virtual app sale to a more broad Workspace sale. And so we'll get that uplift as we do that, but it also provides that platform for us to start expanding more horizontally into untapped seats inside that customer. So it's really a dual strategy. So we're really happy with what we're seeing so far. And we just have to scale that up. And it's one of the reasons why we've unified our renewal promotions globally now. We have introduced a new COO into the company, an existing employee, and help focus on really driving this Phase 2 in the next couple of years."

We've -- we're looking at less than -- I'd say less than 10% of the installed base has moved at this point in time. 
One important point to point out is that we are still selling perpetual licenses and so the installed base, as you define it, is still moving. It's still growing so it's not static necessarily. But that said, I'd say it's less than 10% at this point. And that's been intentional. I mean -- and we wanted to make sure that we get this whole process moving around and focused around net new and I think that's important. And once we have that going, and you've seen this really driving the business over the last couple of years, this gives us a much better framework to go and drive installed base. And I also think it's also given us an opportunity to really make sure the product sets across Citrix Cloud, across intelligent Workspace and all these new initiatives so that it's not just a migrate-to-cloud story, it's a much broader opportunity to talk about employee productivity and ways that we can help really drive what, in marketing terms, we call the future of work but a holistic strategy for customers."

It's actually a really interesting dynamic that's happening right now. I'd say I think as everybody would understand, there are secular changes going on in Networking in general, really driven by the adoption of cloud more than anything else. And so what we've seen over the last few quarters is a more pronounced move to software versus hardware, and that's simply because customers are looking for more flexibility, more choices in the way that they deploy their capabilities. 
And the good news for Citrix, in particular, is that we're a software company and we can deploy our networking hardware on a physical appliance, in a virtual container, in a docker container as a service and a number of other things, and that's what gives customers flexibility. So the dynamic we're seeing right now is that customers that maybe in the past would have thought about a hardware refresh cycle, now they're looking at it as, why don't I do a software refresh cycle where I can buy, in our licensing terms, a pooled capacity license that could be shared across an on-premise infrastructure, any form of hybrid in a cloud, in a container, et cetera. We've got this great control plane that allows you to help manage that in a reasonably seamless way. So it just gives customers a lot more flexibility. That's something that we've got as pretty unique capabilities, and we're pushing that in the market fairly aggressively, and customers are responding. I think 35% of the mix in one quarter is a little higher than I would have expected. That's up from just over 10 a year ago, but that's a trend I expect to continue."

As I pointed out, you can see in our letter, 71% of Workspace mix is now coming via subscription. That was up about 10 points from Q1 and 15 points or so year-on-year. That business will continue to move up. Obviously, the gains will start to slow down on an incremental mix basis because it's so rich. And then Networking, as it's moved up much more materially from 10% a year ago to 35% now, that's the biggest change. 
We will still continue to sell a fair bit of hardware so I do not expect that in the next 12 months, let's say, to get north of 50%. But I think the rate that we're at right now is probably a pretty good floor, and it'll move up from here. And it's a function of 2 things.

I mean if you're coming back to the Microsoft-specific question, think about Windows Virtual Desktop as a platform, very similar to the way people have thought about Remote Desktop Services over the years, which was part of Windows Server. I think that's the easiest way to conceptualize it. And so as a platform, it's a multiuser version of Win 10. And so for a lot of our customers, they look at that as maybe a use case that makes sense in part of their business alongside everything else they're trying to accomplish. Our average customer is delivering over 500 applications across all different app types. And so for us to be able to open up Windows Virtual Desktop is another resource zone or another type of capability that could be managed inside of Citrix Cloud very similar to the way you would be managing, for example, an on-premise application or maybe a published SaaS application. So for a lot of customers, it just provides more flexibility. 
From a platform standpoint, Citrix building a DaaS service on top of that really just embraces and extends a lot of the capabilities to be much more feature-rich on the enterprise side. So those are -- that's probably the easiest way to think about that. It's a component of a broader infrastructure from a typical Citrix customer standpoint.

We're driving the business towards a subscription model probably faster than we would've anticipated over the course of the last several quarters. I mean Q2 is a great example of that performance shift relative to guidance, and that's why we updated the back half of the year. 
We're delivering all these incremental metrics to make sure that you can look at the business holistically, whether that's ARR, with subscription ARR up 33% and SaaS ARR up nearly 50%. So that will be the most important way to lead the business on a go-forward basis.

26524,629094834,1780178,"Citrix Systems, Inc., Q2 2019 Earnings Call, Jul 24, 2019",2019-07-24,"Earnings Calls","Citrix Systems, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Traci, and good afternoon.

I hope everybody had an opportunity to review the earnings letter that we posted to our IR site. Similar to last quarter, I'm going to keep my opening remarks really brief so we can jump right into Q&A, but I thought it'd be important to provide a little bit of context on the business overall. 
So I think all in, I'm really happy with our performance in the second quarter. Demand across our products and our geos was remarkably consistent throughout the quarter. The only real difference was mix. We clearly underestimated the demand for subscription licensing in the quarter. The subscription transition for new licensing is really happening faster than we forecasted across both of our major businesses, which is strategically where we're driving the company. 
We expected this accelerated pace to really continue for the full year. The obvious consequence here of the faster shift is that revenue, margins, earnings and cash flow are going to be impacted in the short term, with the offset represented in unbilled and deferred revenue in particular. 
Just to be really clear here. So the mix shift explains the entire difference between our reported second quarter results and our guidance. We had guided a midpoint mix of about 52%, and the actual was 62%. Within this result, we also saw record subscription booking levels in both of our businesses. The Workspace product mix jumped up to 71% from 58% a year ago, while Networking moved from 11% last year up to 35% in Q2. And I can talk much more about the demand drivers once we get into Q&A. 
It's important to point out again that for all of our financial statements are going to be impacted by the business transition, including cash flow because we typically bill annually for subscription contracts rather than everything upfront like we typically do in a perpetual license deal. So less cash is collected in the current period, more cash is going to be collected in future periods. So in other words, the strength that we're seeing in subscription bookings serve to improve our predictability and certainly accelerate our growth in future period. That's the primary reason why we've introduced future committed revenues, one of our new metrics. Hopefully, you saw that, that balance is now up to $2.2 billion. It's up $290 million or 15% from last year. It's really the easiest way to think about the transition. 
But to make the full year transition math really simple for everybody, let me just give you a quick rule of thumb. That is for every 1 percentage point change in mix, it's equal to roughly $10 million to $12 million in recognized revenue for a full year basis. This offset to the decrease in recognized revenue in the period is generally the corresponding increase to unbilled or deferred revenue. So that when you look at our full year guidance, we now expect a subscription mix of new product bookings of at least 60% to 65%. This compared to 50%, 55% earlier. This is a change from our prior guidance to our current guidance. 
Finally, this quarter, we are introducing ARR, or annualized recurring revenue, as probably the most important KPI for our business. The way we've calculated this is a bottoms-up, contract-based metrics, which we believe is really the most important way to measure the performance of this transition. You'll see a 5-quarter history in our earnings letter. And I'll point out, for Q2, total subscription ARR was $614 million, and that's up 33% year-on-year. While the SaaS-only ARR was $418 million, and that's up nearly 50% year-over-year. As we continue to move through the business model transformation, we expect to see very strong continued growth in both of these metrics. 
So let me stop there with that and turn it back over to the operator so that we can open it up and take your questions. Ashley?"

The other 2 businesses that show up and the other subscription you pointed out, CSP, which for everybody is the consumption-based subscription that we have mostly through our partners, that business is north of $100 million run rate now, continues to grow nicely. 
And then on-premise term. And I'd say on-premise term is a bridge for a lot of customers as they're moving from a perpetual license to a true subscription. A lot of those tend to be hybrid licenses, where they're working through the transition of their own infrastructure. Long term, we actually want to highlight much more SaaS-driven. And so on-prem term is -- I look at that as a bit of a bridge in between the 2, but the fastest-growing part of the business is pure SaaS."

Those are new product mix and so there's 2 things going on. I mean we have been leading the market for years around desktop and app virtualization, just pure virtualization. And I think that part of the overall business has seen a nice resurgence in the last couple of years because customers are really focused on mobility and security and those types of opportunities. 
But really, what's most important for us and probably most exciting is the message that we're driving with customers right now about the intelligent Workspace and how we can move those capabilities not just for those users that are focused on virtualization, but really add value to everybody inside the enterprise. And we introduced a number of those capabilities in -- at our Synergy Conference a couple of months ago. We'll be shipping those in the back half of the year. So I think our message is resonating, and it'll allow us over a long period of time to really expand our available TAM, drive incremental penetration within our installed base and also look for net new customers that really are not using any form of virtualization. So that's where we're taking the product line. That one is clearly leading the subscription transition, and I would expect it to be close to 80% by the end of the year."

In the longer term, it's a huge opportunity for customers to continue to move their Citrix workflows onto Azure or one of the other major cloud properties, and that's why we work so well with them. 
Specific to your question about individual products. Yes, Brad was with us at Synergy, and we announced a number of new things. For example, the support of their new platform, which they call Windows Virtual Desktop. Now we've integrated that with Citrix Cloud so that customers can look at that at as one more place to run their workloads, giving them really unprecedented flexibility across Citrix Cloud. 
We also announced the Citrix Managed Desktops, which is really a DaaS service sitting on top of that platform. And we're doing that with Microsoft, and we'll be able to bundle Azure capacity and really create a clean turnkey. 
We also announced a number of other areas, and I'm sure I'm going to forget all of them, but optimizations for Windows -- excuse me, for Office 365, for SD-WAN. We can do a lot of really cool things to accelerate the performance of Office, HDX optimizations for Teams, SD-WAN more broadly for Windows Virtual Desktop, adding performance and resiliency as well as a number of other areas. So I'd say the partnership is as broad as it's certainly been in any time in my 17 years."

We do need to talk about those things in the context of a longer discussion. So I think as everybody knows, each year we update long-term targets as we've been moving through this transition, and that's based on actual results, customer feedback and the outlook. And we're going to do that again this year at our Analyst Meeting in a couple of months. But let's take a bit of a step back for a minute. 
So we're 2 years into this transition. I think we made really good progress all in. But unlike other model transitions that we've seen across the industry, we've never really seen any material impact on the P&L up to this point. I think that's been for 2 reasons. First is that we've just had better internal execution and a really good product story so we've sold more. We've sold more and we've just been trying to balance the impact up to that point. And so Phase 1 has been focused really on net new, largely due to capacity and focus. And so last year, we moved about 42% of the net new mix to subscription. This year, as I said, we're looking at 60%, 65%. So that's a big increase. The numbers are now large enough that it's creating this headwind that you're seeing over the course of Q2 and the balance of this year really in the reported P&L. Again, like I mentioned a minute ago, the offset is going to show up in deferred and unbilled, plus these new metrics. So everybody has complete visibility. 
The way I'm thinking about the next couple of years, though, is Phase 2 is going to bring much more focus on transitioning our really big installed base. So we've started that this year. We've seen a nice uplift in kind of the annualized dollars that those customers are paying for those we've transitioned so far, and so this is a big incremental opportunity. That's hundreds of millions of dollars annually. That's going to start to become a priority in 2020, and that's why to help everybody understand this, we've delivered these new metrics, unbilled revenue, ARR, in particular, so that everybody can really just see how that -- it impacts beyond reported P&L. 
So we'll talk about all that in -- at our next Analyst Meeting, make sure that you have complete perspective. Again, we're providing the metrics so you can measure us along the way, look much more like a traditional subscription transition and looking forward to having that in-depth conversation."

Just on the point that you just mentioned in terms of Phase 2 of the transition of the installed base, any comments you could mention about churn thus far as you've been seeing those big customers transition and kind of what the level of uplift is that you're getting on pricing for those that are staying and kind of what the price realization is? 
And then I just wanted to follow up because I know Phil asked a question about Microsoft. My question is just more related to Windows 10. There's been some people wondering how much of a driver that's been to the whole Workspace services improvements. And how does that filling -- the migration from Windows 7 to Windows 10, which has to be done by mid-January, does that become a headwind when you start to think about calendar '20 top line?"

I think desktop no less isn't the driver that it would've been for a major project like it was a decade ago. 
I'd say it's one of the many projects that customers are looking at, and it's one of the things that we can engage in. I'd say that more broadly speaking, when we're talking to customers today, and every customer meeting I had throughout Q2, was focused, I'd say, first on security, on how they're looking at managing an increasingly complex infrastructure. 
Second, on mobility around just finally enabling devices to be used in the enterprise in a secure, simple way across what is usually hundreds of applications in most enterprises. 
And then lastly, this idea that's a little bit more about our road map and our vision about really embracing employee productivity and driving engagement, things that will just make them -- their teams more productive. And so I'd say that's probably the bigger driver than any one-off like a Win 10 migration. 
Back to the other question about the installed base. Yes, it's been -- we've actually seen really good success with those customers that we've updated so far. I'd say it's a limited set. So I wouldn't read too far into it, but the average uplift that we saw in Q2 was like 40% from what they had been paying on a typical maintenance contract. And again, that's because it's not just a like-for-like, but this whole migration opportunity is about moving them from what might have been a virtual app sale to a more broad Workspace sale. And so we'll get that uplift as we do that, but it also provides that platform for us to start expanding more horizontally into untapped seats inside that customer. So it's really a dual strategy. So we're really happy with what we're seeing so far. And we just have to scale that up. And it's one of the reasons why we've unified our renewal promotions globally now. We have introduced a new COO into the company, an existing employee, and help focus on really driving this Phase 2 in the next couple of years."

We've -- we're looking at less than -- I'd say less than 10% of the installed base has moved at this point in time. 
One important point to point out is that we are still selling perpetual licenses and so the installed base, as you define it, is still moving. It's still growing so it's not static necessarily. But that said, I'd say it's less than 10% at this point. And that's been intentional. I mean -- and we wanted to make sure that we get this whole process moving around and focused around net new and I think that's important. And once we have that going, and you've seen this really driving the business over the last couple of years, this gives us a much better framework to go and drive installed base. And I also think it's also given us an opportunity to really make sure the product sets across Citrix Cloud, across intelligent Workspace and all these new initiatives so that it's not just a migrate-to-cloud story, it's a much broader opportunity to talk about employee productivity and ways that we can help really drive what, in marketing terms, we call the future of work but a holistic strategy for customers."

It's actually a really interesting dynamic that's happening right now. I'd say I think as everybody would understand, there are secular changes going on in Networking in general, really driven by the adoption of cloud more than anything else. And so what we've seen over the last few quarters is a more pronounced move to software versus hardware, and that's simply because customers are looking for more flexibility, more choices in the way that they deploy their capabilities. 
And the good news for Citrix, in particular, is that we're a software company and we can deploy our networking hardware on a physical appliance, in a virtual container, in a docker container as a service and a number of other things, and that's what gives customers flexibility. So the dynamic we're seeing right now is that customers that maybe in the past would have thought about a hardware refresh cycle, now they're looking at it as, why don't I do a software refresh cycle where I can buy, in our licensing terms, a pooled capacity license that could be shared across an on-premise infrastructure, any form of hybrid in a cloud, in a container, et cetera. We've got this great control plane that allows you to help manage that in a reasonably seamless way. So it just gives customers a lot more flexibility. That's something that we've got as pretty unique capabilities, and we're pushing that in the market fairly aggressively, and customers are responding. I think 35% of the mix in one quarter is a little higher than I would have expected. That's up from just over 10 a year ago, but that's a trend I expect to continue."

As I pointed out, you can see in our letter, 71% of Workspace mix is now coming via subscription. That was up about 10 points from Q1 and 15 points or so year-on-year. That business will continue to move up. Obviously, the gains will start to slow down on an incremental mix basis because it's so rich. And then Networking, as it's moved up much more materially from 10% a year ago to 35% now, that's the biggest change. 
We will still continue to sell a fair bit of hardware so I do not expect that in the next 12 months, let's say, to get north of 50%. But I think the rate that we're at right now is probably a pretty good floor, and it'll move up from here. And it's a function of 2 things.

I mean if you're coming back to the Microsoft-specific question, think about Windows Virtual Desktop as a platform, very similar to the way people have thought about Remote Desktop Services over the years, which was part of Windows Server. I think that's the easiest way to conceptualize it. And so as a platform, it's a multiuser version of Win 10. And so for a lot of our customers, they look at that as maybe a use case that makes sense in part of their business alongside everything else they're trying to accomplish. Our average customer is delivering over 500 applications across all different app types. And so for us to be able to open up Windows Virtual Desktop is another resource zone or another type of capability that could be managed inside of Citrix Cloud very similar to the way you would be managing, for example, an on-premise application or maybe a published SaaS application. So for a lot of customers, it just provides more flexibility. 
From a platform standpoint, Citrix building a DaaS service on top of that really just embraces and extends a lot of the capabilities to be much more feature-rich on the enterprise side.

So that's the seasonal play. 
The other is most of your growth is coming in unbilled right now instead of deferred because the contracts are moving to SaaS. And SaaS are 3-year deals on average, 1-year billed upfront. And that's why we didn't have unbilled a year ago, and now it's $380 million I think. And so that's the primary offset."

I'd say that with the benefit of hindsight, we've probably been holding it back a little bit in prior quarters in what was the normal customer motion, and so we're just letting it happen much more naturally. And I think that's representative of what you're seeing right now. And given the scale of the business, it's time to really lean in and embrace the transition and drive it more aggressively than we have been. So I'd say that that's easiest way to think about that and why we want to drive this expectation over the balance of the year, start looking a little bit more like a typical subscription transition that people are used to seeing across companies. 
On the CFO search, it's going well. We've met with a number of external candidates. We have some great internal candidates as well, and we're just going through the process very methodically. We've got such a solid team right now that I feel comfortable where we are, but I'm more focused on making the right decision than making a quick decision. That said, hopefully, we get this wrapped up fairly quickly."

Gross margin is going to be higher because we're selling software that looks more like a typical software gross margin than a hardware gross margin. So the change is probably got a higher gross margin dollars. From a revenue standpoint, you're not selling the box along with it so you may have a little bit of a revenue headwind in the short term. But getting customers to build this out from a software standpoint as part of their infrastructure I think is going to drive really good stickiness. So I have to go back and look at it on a -- just probably a little bit more case-by-case than in the aggregate, but I'd say that the breakeven from gross margin and really the extension of gross margin dollars is relatively short term."

I just want to reiterate a couple of things as we go through this. 
We're driving the business towards a subscription model probably faster than we would've anticipated over the course of the last several quarters. I mean Q2 is a great example of that performance shift relative to guidance, and that's why we updated the back half of the year. 
We're delivering all these incremental metrics to make sure that you can look at the business holistically, whether that's ARR, with subscription ARR up 33% and SaaS ARR up nearly 50%. So that will be the most important way to lead the business on a go-forward basis. 
Hopefully, everybody can join us at our upcoming Analyst Meeting in the next couple of months. Look forward to seeing you there. And if not, talk to you again in 3 months. Thank you."
