As you can imagine, this has been a painful and difficult time for our family and our company. Blake's impact around here is immeasurable. He loved this business and was so good at it. I think the most important impact Blake had on our company was with our people. In many ways, he brought our culture and values to life. He was the most genuine person I have ever known, and his authenticity helped him make real connections with people inside and outside of our company, many of you included. Pete, Blake and I worked closely as a gleam our entire lives, most especially over the last 20 years and most recently as co-presidents. We miss Blake terribly but are inspired by his example, and all of us are committed to keeping his legacy alive by being the best retailer we can be, particularly me and Pete. Lastly, Pete and I would like to thank those of you who have reached out with your condolences and stories about Blake. It is greatly appreciated.
Okay. I'd like to start out by saying that we are confident in our strategy to serve customers and drive market share gains. Our unique business model is a key point of difference that allows us to serve customers in multiple ways through stores, online, Full-Price and Off-Price with meaningful synergies across Nordstrom. Heading into 2019, we're focused on leveraging our digital and physical assets to provide our customers with a best-in-class experience. 
While we have the right strategies in place, we are not satisfied with our current financial results. We planned 2018 as the inflection point for improved profitability, and we missed this objective. We have a high sense of urgency to deliver on our profit margin expectations, this means executing our levers to drive our top and bottom line. We're focused on getting back on track with our profitability goals, and we reaffirm our financial targets that we laid out during Investor Day last July. 
Turning now to our fourth quarter results. We had a slightly positive comp sales increase, driven by momentum in Off-Price. In Full-Price, we saw an unexpected slowdown in full-line store traffic during and after the holidays. This resulted in softness across most merchandise categories, with Women's Apparel being the most challenging. We're taking immediate action to improve our merchandise assortment by leveraging data analytics for inventory and allocation planning.
At Investor Day, we outlined a number of initiatives supporting our customer strategy. First, we're encouraged by our customer trends. Of our 35 million customers, nearly 10 million shopped across our multiple channels over the past year. We expect this to lead to incremental customer spend of 4 to 11x. During 2018, more than 7 million new customers were introduced to Nordstrom through our Off-Price business, our largest source of customer acquisition. This is impactful because 1/3 of these customers are expected to cross shop in our Full-Price business within a year.
Second, our early investments to build a robust digital business gives us a competitive advantage. Digital sales made up 30% of our business in 2018. As we shared during Investor Day, Nordstrom.com has achieve scale with contribution margins at parity with full-line stores. Customers are increasingly engaging with us across stores and online. As an example, we've seen annualized sales growth of 40% from Buy Online Pick Up In Store over the past 5 years.
Third, we continue to leverage our strategic brand partnerships to offer customers newness and a sense of discovery. These partnerships include emerging brands such as Reformation and Something Navy as well as established partners like Lamere and Birkenstock. We also have successful limited-time launches of digitally native brands like Away and ALLBIRDS, with more coming this year. Our strategic brands delivered growth of 9% and made up more than 40% of our Full-Price sales.
Finally, we're pleased with our team's execution in Off-Price to build momentum over the past year. Through focused efforts to strengthen our merchandise offering, we delivered improved top line trends and faster inventory turns. We continued our expansion into Canada with the introduction of 6 Nordstrom Rack stores that have outperformed our expectations. Similar to our U.S. business, we've already seen synergies between Nordstrom and Rack stores. For example, the Rack serves as an exhaust for full-line stores, enabling more newness and improving product margin in Canada. 
This year, we have 2 key priority to drive sales and market share gains: our local market strategy and the Nordy Club Loyalty Program. 
Beginning with our local market strategy. We're leveraging inventory, along with digital and store capabilities, to serve customers in new and relevant ways. We launched this strategy in Los Angeles as a proof-of-concept. The outsized share gains in this market give us confidence as we continue to scale. Our Get It Fast feature offers customers an expanded selection of merchandise available next day. We also opened 2 more Nordstrom local neighborhood hubs. We're experiencing higher customer engagement through services such as alterations and personal styling, which lead to an exponential lift in customer spend. In the L.A. market, demand for Buy Online Pick Up In Store increased by 4x. Customers who visit Nordstrom Local spend 2.5x more on average. 
This year, we're planning to reach scale in L.A. by leveraging our inventory. Our supply chain investments will give customers greater access to merchandise selection with faster delivery and at a lower cost to us. This spring, we plan to open a local omnichannel hub in L.A. to accelerate inventory efficiencies. We also plan to open a 1 million square-foot supply chain facility in the fall. This will enable faster delivery to the West Coast, which represents 40% of our customer base. 
We're looking forward to expanding our presence in New York City. We introduced our Men's Store last spring and plan to open our Women's Store this October. This flagship will be the biggest and best statement of the Nordstrom brand in one of the world's top retail markets. We expect that our flagship, coupled with our digital presence, will contribute a meaningful sales lift in the New York City market. 
Our second key priority is to leverage our loyalty program. We continued to evolve our program to remain relevant with customers. In 2018, our loyalty customers contributed more than half of our sales. Last fall, we launched our enhanced program, the Nordy Club. Cardmembers are now earning 3 points, up from 2, for every dollar they spend. We also added experiential elements such as exclusive access to services and experiences. For example, we offered our loyalty customers early access to our recent Something Navy Drop. Going forward, we are pursuing additional opportunities to further personalize the customer experience and drive increased spend.
In closing, we're well positioned for success through our unique business model that enables us to serve customers in differentiated ways. As we focus on delivering our profitability goals this year, we're prepared to take further action to drive our top and bottom line. 
I'll now turn the call over to Anne, who will provide additional insights into our results and expectations for 2019."

To reiterate, we're disappointed that we missed our EBIT margin inflection point in 2018. We're focused on getting back on track through our levers around inventory and expense.

We're focused on getting back on track through our levers around inventory and expense. As we approach the end of our heavy investment cycle this year, we expect our generational investments and digital capabilities to further scale and contribute to improved profitability. In addition, our strong financial position enables us to remain agile in changing business conditions.
Turning to our fourth quarter performance. From an EBIT perspective, our results were generally consistent with our updated expectations and our holiday preannouncement. While Full-Price sales came in lower than expected, this was offset by strong expense management. 
Full-Price comp sales decreased 1.6%. As Erik mentioned, we saw broad-based declines across most merchandise categories, with the exception of Shoes. To address our opportunities going forward, we took immediate action to edit our assortment, which represented about 10% of our brand portfolio. 
In Off-Price, our comp sales increase of 4% was in line with expectations, with gains across most divisions. This reflected successful efforts throughout the year to improve our merchandise assortment and accelerate inventory turns. 
Our total company gross profit rate decreased 33 basis points over last year. We took higher markdowns due to software Full-Price trends and the response to an elevated promotional environment. We ended the year in a solid inventory position overall, with a decrease of approximately 2.5%. That said, we have some pockets of elevated levels based on our current sales trends.
Our SG&A rate was down 23 basis points over last year. We managed expenses well, outperforming our expectations. We continued to bend the curve as our annual expense growth moderated to 4%, below the 5-year historical average of 7%. This was driven by productivity gains in our digital capabilities, particularly in marketing and technology. 
Our fourth quarter earnings also reflected a favorable income tax impact associated with our deferred tax assets. This included a $0.05 EPS benefit related to prior periods, in addition to reduced effective tax rate beginning in 2018. 
As we look back on the year, our strong financial position is a key differentiator in the marketplace. We have a healthy balance sheet and generated annual operating cash flow of more than $1 billion for the 10th consecutive year. Our consistent and balanced capital allocation approach enabled us to return $1 billion to shareholders during the year and maintain an investment-grade credit rating.
As we shared during Investor Day, we are targeting increased shareholder returns through the following financial priorities: drive market share gains, improve profitability and returns and continue our disciplined capital allocation approach. We're focused on achieving our long-term financial targets, and in fact, sales, ROIC and free cash flow performed in line with our goals. 
While we fell short of our EBIT margin expectations in 2018, we're confident that we can achieve our long-term targets. We're focused on scaling our generational investments, leveraging our digital capabilities and strengthening our product margin. 
Inventory is our biggest near-term lever of profitability. We've positioned our inventory plans below our sales trends, giving us flexibility to chase demand. We're also further leveraging data analytics to inform our merchandise levels and allocation. 
Our second lever of improved profitability is expense. Relative to long-term targets, we are planning incremental savings between $150 million to $200 million related to efficiency initiatives across our company. 
Turning to our 2019 guidance. Our EPS range of $3.65 to $3.90 is based on net sales growth of 1% to 2%. This assumes consistent trends in Off-Price and gradual improvement in Full-Price throughout the year. 
As we have mentioned before, we're measuring success through sales, customer and market metrics. In 2019, we expect net sales growth to approximate comps due to the ongoing shift from stores to digital. As a result, beginning this year, we will only report net sales growth.
For EBIT, we expect a range of $915 million to $970 million. This implies an EBIT margin range of 5.9% to 6.1%, tracking toward our 2020 goal of 6.3% to 6.5%. Relative to our long-term targets, we have assumed lower sales growth in 2019, offset by incremental expense initiatives. 
From a gross profit perspective, we're planning modest expansion through efforts to increase inventory turn and grow strategic brands. Our occupancy rate is expected to be flat. 
Moving to SG&A. We're planning for modest deleverage when excluding the estimated credit charge in 2018. This includes $150 million to $200 million of expense savings in ongoing productivity gains in our digital capabilities. Excluding our West Coast supply chain investments, we expect to maintain a mid-single-digit expense growth for digital capabilities. 
Another lever of improved profitability is our generational investments. In 2018, they contributed nearly $2 billion to our top line and exceeded our bottom line expectations. Nordstromrack.com and HauteLook became our fastest business to hit $1 billion in sales. Trunk Club sales grew 35% for the year, on track to reach its market potential of more than $500 million. In 2019, we're planning for our generational investments to deliver sales of roughly $2.2 billion, with an EBIT improvement of approximately $15 million over last year.
In terms of our quarterly cadence, we expect EBIT for the first quarter to decrease from the prior year. This assumes a continuation of current sales trends with higher markdowns to clear up pockets of excess inventory. From an expense standpoint, we assume greater deleverage on fixed expenses resulting from lower volume in the first quarter relative to the year. We're planning for EBIT margin to leverage beginning in the second quarter. In addition, we estimate $35 million in preopening costs for our New York flagship leading up to our planned October opening. 
From a CapEx perspective, there are no material changes to our 5-year plan. We're estimating approximately $900 million of investments in 2019 or nearly 6% of sales. This includes a shift of around $100 million in projects from last year. We're investing in our key priorities, with 50% of our plan for technology and supply chain and 30% for the New York flagship. As we near the end of our generational investment cycle, we expect CapEx levels to moderate in 2020. 
Through our unique business model and strong financial position, we believe we have the appropriate plans in place to succeed. Together as an experienced team, we're prepared to make hard choices and pull additional levers around inventory and expenses to drive improvement in our business. Heading into 2019, we're focused on delivering our profitability expectations and long-term financial targets.

It's interesting that you're guiding to sales up 1% to 2%, yet you're still able to increase the EBIT margin. Is the message that you're seeing investments pay off, the generational investments and you're able to do things around inventory? Or is it more that sales are a little bit slower and you're finding new places to sort of cut costs that maybe you didn't expect before? And if you could sort of maybe divide between the 2 where the margin improvement is coming from, that would be helpful."

So I think we'll step back and broadly look at how we set the plan for '19 and where we set our guidance. So as you mentioned, the top line of 1% to 2%, I think if you focus on -- I'm going to talk about the midpoint of our guidance. As you can see from the midpoint of our guidance, we're actually expecting to get inflection in an EBIT rate. And the way we're getting there is modest improvement in our margin through inventory turn, tighter discipline in inventory and strategic partnerships. On the SG&A side, it's a slight deleverage, but between the 2, they kind of moderate out. So what you're seeing is flow-through from the top line. I would emphasize, on the SG&A piece to it, we -- it's kind of a combination of both. We're getting a lot more leverage, both in the top line and the flow-through from our generational investments. We're getting scale and productivity out of the investments we've been making in our digital capabilities. And additionally, we are finding additional ways to drive productivity in the organization. In general, when I look at our SG&A rate, as we're coming out of our heavy investment cycle, the good news is if you pull out what we're investing in our West Coast supply chain, our SG&A rate would be relatively flat from a rate basis year-over-year. So we're really starting to see that scale and productivity becoming through the business."

Again, we've been making investments in things like the supply chain in West Coast. So that's actually helping us not only serve our customers in a better way, but it's also allowing us to open up inventory and also be more cost-efficient in how we serve the customer. So we're finding ways to offset some of those increases. From a digital capability perspective, Erik talked about supply chain in his remarks. Erik, do you want to add anything else to the capabilities?"

I would start with inventory. Being able to leverage the inventory that we have that's close to our customers, mainly in our stores but also starting this year with the local omnichannel hub that I mentioned in L.A., Allows us to do a lot with the customers. And so it's the digital investments to leverage that inventory. It's also the digital investments that allow the customer to access the inventory in very efficient ways. So the result of that is a significant increase in selection for the customer. And we execute it with our local market strategy, especially same-day, next-day, 2-day, the amount of selection we can bring to customer is significant. The speed increases dramatically as well. Right now, our 2 fulfillment centers, one is in Iowa and one's in Pennsylvania, our delivery times to our West Coast customers, will improve significantly. And the third thing that our digital investments around inventory provide us -- for us at a much lower cost. We're able to get this increased selection faster and at a lower cost. So it's very meaningful. The other part, our digital capabilities, I would lump them together to be able to serve customers better. And a lot of that has to do with stitching together these experiences, digital experiences we've invested in the last several years. A lot of these capabilities, we've tested and we know they resonate with customers, but they especially are meaningful to the business when we can connect them together. So it can be as, I guess, old world services like alterations of making that experience in setting up appointments online. That's an important piece of engagement for us, and our digital investments help with that."

So yes, it was -- it has been abrupt in terms of what happened in women's and somewhat unusual that it happened pretty much across the board. And there's explanations for all of it if you really kind of get into it. But it is troubling that we had that challenge across the board. So the thing that we've got going for us, to your point about the data analytics, is we've got really good information about what's working and what's not. And so we're actually right in the middle of understanding better just things like our averaging at retail and what's happening in different classifications. So the first thing we did is we had to take our inventory levels down so that we weren't taking too many markdowns. And as such, we ended out about 10% of the brands that we offer in Women's. So part of that gets us rightsized, and the part of that creates some Open-To-Buy for us to go and buy new things that hopefully are going to be more compelling. I think we tend to always gravitate -- we've been doing this a long time. We're in the fashion business like if it's not working, it's probably because our offer is not compelling enough, and it sounds kind of obvious. But we've got a team of people that are currently in market right now just trying to figure out a way to improve our offer. There were some things that worked well in Women's. As an example, like our Topshop business is really strong still. So there may be some things to learn about that. I mean, I would -- that would  suggest to us that new product, fashion product, maybe a price sensibility, there's, I think, some indicators there that should help us as we continue to work through this."

And one of the great advantages we have is being able to open the Men's Store in advance of the women store. It did initially start out, but that was our plan. But once we knew we were able to open it sooner, we made a decision because we knew we'd be able to get some learnings and when the Women's Store opened really be able to leverage that. And that's been true. We've been able to prove ourselves that we can hire really nice people that give great service. That's been super positive. We've proved that consumers are responding super well to the integrated physical and digital experiences we have such as express returns and same-day delivery and the 24/7 Buy Online Pick Up In Store. In fact, a lot of women shoppers are using the Men's Store as hub to do returns. We've also proven that we get a big online lift in the market when we have a physical store there. The New York market is already, but before we opened the physical store, our biggest online market. So we know that once the Women's Store opened, that's going to be great. The other thing that we confirmed to ourselves is the synergy of having everything all located next to each other helps. So we have planned this, but we've confirmed that without the Women Store's opening, the Men's Store, whilst doing well in meeting our plans in both ways, it's going to be a lot better when the Women's Store opens because we just get that left without many more customers. I mean for example, in our regular Full-Price, I think it's something like 48% of all things sold in the men's department sold to a woman buying it for a man. And it's obviously quite a bit less since we don't have the Women Store's across the street. So I think we're feeling super encouraged by that. The other thing I would tell you is we've got a reputation, legacy and a foundational element around shoes. Shoes has been the best-performing category in Men's. We've got a lot of shoe inventories square footage plan in Women's and in Kids and everything [indiscernible] the new tower. We're feeling really confident about that. The other thing that we've done in the tower is we've dedicated more inventory and the floor space to Designer. Designer's been the best performing kind of as a price classification in Men's and, we anticipate that, that's going to carry the Women's. So I guess I've used long-winded answers, but we confirmed a lot of things that we knew and we are feeling really great about opening up in October."

A lot of it is we've got what we call preferred and strategic brands, and these are brands that have limited distribution. But all these brands are retailers as well. And one of the things that we've seen is a fair amount of them pulled a promotional trigger there in December. So we're actually having to compete in price of some of these brands that result in terms of their vertical presence as retailers. I think that everyone really is committed in our orbit of -- and universe of brands to work with on a full-price business but there's some practical reality that come in there. So it's evolved and changed over the years so just a straight markdown to things like buy more, save more and a lot of clever ways of getting promotional activity in there. So I guess what we could tell you without declaring anything here specifically is that we've got a lot of really good data about that, and we want to make sure that our strategy is as competitive as it can be. And obviously, we can't pretend that the promotional thing doesn't exist. So we continue to work on that."

So for us, we're on top of that as best we can be, and we paid the price a little bit to get ourselves in line. But we started the year in a pretty healthy position with inventory positions, even though we missed our sales plan. And even as we go forward, we're going to be down about 5% in our plans and receipts, if not more. I mean, we've got respond to that. It's as time goes on. So I don't know. I think, increasingly, it strikes as that our relationship with the brands, particularly as we become more edited in our offer, is much more strategic than it is transactional. And often times, we're trying to solve for the same issues. These guys have big retail initiatives, and it doesn't serve them well to run a super promotional business either. I mean, it used to be the biggest cry that they would have as we were super promotional with the business. So we know it's corrosive to the brand value that they have. So I think the biggest thing is for us to work upfront with brands to be clear about what we see in terms of sales trends, transplanting the business right, ensuring that we've got good flow. So that's keeping ourselves nimble and agile by having relatively lean inventories. These have been fundamental practices that we've worked on for years, but it feels like it's coming into sharper focus. And I could just tell you from my personal interacting with the leaders different brands we do business with, they are largely very interested in partnering with us in ways that they haven't in the past about how to flow inventory. So works to our mutual benefit."

He was the most genuine person I have ever known, and his authenticity helped him make real connections with people inside and outside of our company, many of you included. Pete, Blake and I worked closely as a team our entire lives, but especially over the last 20 years and most recently as co-presidents.

Okay. I'd like to start out by saying that we are confident in our strategy to serve customers and drive market share gains. Our unique business model is a key point of difference that allows us to serve customers in multiple ways through stores, online, Full-Price and Off-Price with meaningful synergies across Nordstrom. Heading into 2019, we're focused on leveraging our digital and physical assets to provide our customers with a best-in-class experience. 
While we have the right strategies in place, we are not satisfied with our current financial results. We planned 2018 as the inflection point for improved profitability, and we missed this objective. We have a high sense of urgency to deliver on our profit margin expectations. This means executing our levers to drive our top and bottom line. We're focused on getting back on track with our profitability goals, and we reaffirm our financial targets that we laid out during Investor Day last July. 
Turning now to our fourth quarter results. We had a slightly positive comp sales increase, driven by momentum in Off-Price. In Full-Price, we saw an unexpected slowdown in full-line store traffic during and after the holidays. This resulted in softness across most merchandise categories, with Women's Apparel being the most challenging. We're taking immediate action to improve our merchandise assortment by leveraging data analytics for inventory and allocation planning.
At Investor Day, we outlined a number of initiatives supporting our customer strategy. First, we're encouraged by our customer trends. Of our 35 million customers, nearly 10 million shopped across our multiple channels over the past year. We expect this to lead to incremental customer spend of 4 to 11x. During 2018, more than 7 million new customers were introduced to Nordstrom through our Off-Price business, our largest source of customer acquisition. This is impactful because 1/3 of these customers are expected to cross shop in our Full-Price business within a year.
Second, our early investments to build a robust digital business gives us a competitive advantage. Digital sales made up 30% of our business in 2018. As we shared during Investor Day, Nordstrom.com has achieved scale with contribution margins at parity with full-line stores. Customers are increasingly engaging with us across stores and online. As an example, we've seen annualized sales growth of 40% from Buy Online, Pick Up In Store over the past 5 years.
Third, we continue to leverage our strategic brand partnerships to offer customers newness and a sense of discovery. These partnerships include emerging brands such as Reformation and Something Navy as well as established partners like La Mer and Birkenstock. We also have successful limited-time launches of digitally native brands like Away and Allbirds, with more coming this year. Our strategic brands delivered growth of 9% and made up more than 40% of our Full-Price sales.
Finally, we're pleased with our team's execution in Off-Price to build momentum over the past year. Through focused efforts to strengthen our merchandise offering, we delivered improved top line trends and faster inventory turns. We continued our expansion into Canada with the introduction of 6 Nordstrom Rack stores that have outperformed our expectations. Similar to our U.S. business, we've already seen synergies between Nordstrom and Rack stores. For example, the Rack serves as an exhaust for full-line stores, enabling more newness and improving product margin in Canada. 
This year, we have 2 key priorities to drive sales and market share gains: our local market strategy and the Nordy Club loyalty program. 
Beginning with our local market strategy, we're leveraging inventory, along with digital and store capabilities, to serve customers in new and relevant ways. We launched this strategy in Los Angeles as a proof-of-concept. The outsized share gains in this market give us confidence as we continue to scale. Our Get It Fast feature offers customers an expanded selection of merchandise available next day. We also opened 2 more Nordstrom local neighborhood hubs. We're experiencing higher customer engagement through services such as alterations and personal styling, which lead to an exponential lift in customer spend. In the L.A. market, demand for Buy Online, Pick Up In Store increased by 4x. Customers who visit Nordstrom Local spend 2.5x more on average. 
This year, we're planning to reach scale in L.A. by leveraging our inventory. Our supply chain investments will give customers greater access to merchandise selection with faster delivery and at a lower cost to us. This spring, we plan to open a local omnichannel hub in L.A. to accelerate inventory efficiencies. We also plan to open a 1 million square-foot supply chain facility in the fall. This will enable faster delivery to the West Coast, which represents 40% of our customer base. 
We're looking forward to expanding our presence in New York City. We introduced our Men's Store last spring and plan to open our Women's Store this October. This flagship will be the biggest and best statement of the Nordstrom brand in one of the world's top retail markets. We expect that our flagship, coupled with our digital presence, will contribute a meaningful sales lift in the New York City market. 
Our second key priority is to leverage our loyalty program. We continue to evolve our program to remain relevant with customers. In 2018, our loyalty customers contributed more than 1/2 of our sales. Last fall, we launched our enhanced program, the Nordy Club. Cardmembers are now earning 3 points, up from 2, for every dollar they spend. We also added experiential elements such as exclusive access to services and experiences. For example, we offered our loyalty customers early access to our recent Something Navy Drop. Going forward, we are pursuing additional opportunities to further personalize the customer experience and drive increased spend.
In closing, we're well positioned for success through our unique business model that enables us to serve customers in differentiated ways. As we focus on delivering our profitability goals this year, we're prepared to take further action to drive our top and bottom line. 
I'll now turn the call over to Anne, who will provide additional insights into our results and expectations for 2019."

We're focused on getting back on track through our levers around inventory and expense. As we approach the end of our heavy investment cycle this year, we expect our generational investments and digital capabilities to further scale and contribute to improved profitability. In addition, our strong financial position enables us to remain agile in changing business conditions.
Turning to our fourth quarter performance. From an EBIT perspective, our results were generally consistent with our updated expectations and our holiday preannouncement. While Full-Price sales came in lower than expected, this was offset by strong expense management. 
Full-Price comp sales decreased 1.6%. As Erik mentioned, we saw broad-based declines across most merchandise categories, with the exception of Shoes. To address our opportunities going forward, we took immediate action to edit our assortment, which represented about 10% of our brand portfolio. 
In Off-Price, our comp sales increase of 4% was in line with expectations, with gains across most divisions. This reflected successful efforts throughout the year to improve our merchandise assortment and accelerate inventory turns. 
Our total company gross profit rate decreased 33 basis points over last year. We took higher markdowns due to softer Full-Price trends and in response to an elevated promotional environment. We ended the year in a solid inventory position overall, with a decrease of approximately 2.5%. That said, we have some pockets of elevated levels based on our current sales trends.
Our SG&A rate was down 23 basis points over last year. We managed expenses well, outperforming our expectations. We continued to bend the curve as our annual expense growth moderated to 4%, below the 5-year historical average of 7%. This was driven by productivity gains in our digital capabilities, particularly in marketing and technology. 
Our fourth quarter earnings also reflected a favorable income tax impact associated with our deferred tax assets. This included a $0.05 EPS benefit related to prior periods, in addition to a reduced effective tax rate beginning in 2018. 
As we look back on the year, our strong financial position is a key differentiator in the marketplace. We have a healthy balance sheet and generated annual operating cash flow of more than $1 billion for the 10th consecutive year. Our consistent and balanced capital allocation approach enabled us to return $1 billion to shareholders during the year and maintain an investment-grade credit rating.
As we shared during Investor Day, we are targeting increased shareholder returns through the following financial priorities: drive market share gains, improve profitability and returns and continue our disciplined capital allocation approach. We're focused on achieving our long-term financial targets, and in fact, sales, ROIC and free cash flow performed in line with our goals. 
While we fell short of our EBIT margin expectations in 2018, we're confident that we can achieve our long-term targets. We're focused on scaling our generational investments, leveraging our digital capabilities and strengthening our product margin. 
Inventory is our biggest near-term lever of profitability. We've positioned our inventory plans below our sales trends, giving us flexibility to chase demand. We're also further leveraging data analytics to inform our merchandise levels and allocation. 
Our second lever of improved profitability is expense. Relative to long-term targets, we are planning incremental savings between $150 million to $200 million related to efficiency initiatives across our company. 
Turning to our 2019 guidance. Our EPS range of $3.65 to $3.90 is based on net sales growth of 1% to 2%. This assumes consistent trends in Off-Price and gradual improvement in Full-Price throughout the year. 
As we have mentioned before, we're measuring success through sales, customer and market metrics. In 2019, we expect net sales growth to approximate comps due to the ongoing shift from stores to digital. As a result, beginning this year, we will only report net sales growth.
For EBIT, we expect a range of $915 million to $970 million. This implies an EBIT margin range of 5.9% to 6.1%, tracking toward our 2020 goal of 6.3% to 6.5%. Relative to our long-term targets, we have assumed lower sales growth in 2019, offset by incremental expense initiatives. 
From a gross profit perspective, we're planning modest expansion through efforts to increase inventory turns and grow strategic brands. Our occupancy rate is expected to be flat. 
Moving to SG&A. We're planning for modest deleverage when excluding the estimated credit charge in 2018. This includes $150 million to $200 million of expense savings in ongoing productivity gains in our digital capabilities. Excluding our West Coast supply chain investments, we expect to maintain a mid-single-digit expense growth for digital capabilities. 
Another lever of improved profitability is our generational investments. In 2018, they contributed nearly $2 billion to our top line and exceeded our bottom line expectations. Nordstromrack.com and HauteLook became our fastest business to hit $1 billion in sales. Trunk Club sales grew 35% for the year, on track to reach its market potential of more than $500 million. In 2019, we're planning for our generational investments to deliver sales of roughly $2.2 billion, with an EBIT improvement of approximately $15 million over last year.
In terms of our quarterly cadence, we expect EBIT for the first quarter to decrease from the prior year. This assumes a continuation of current sales trends with higher markdowns to clear out pockets of excess inventory. From an expense standpoint, we assume greater deleverage on fixed expenses resulting from lower volume in the first quarter relative to the year. We're planning for EBIT margin to leverage beginning in the second quarter. In addition, we estimate $35 million in preopening costs for our New York flagship leading up to our planned October opening. 
From a CapEx perspective, there are no material changes to our 5-year plan. We're estimating approximately $900 million of investments in 2019 or nearly 6% of sales. This includes a shift of around $100 million in projects from last year. We're investing in our key priorities, with 50% of our plan for technology and supply chain and 30% for the New York flagship. As we near the end of our generational investment cycle, we expect CapEx levels to moderate in 2020. 
Through our unique business model and strong financial position, we believe we have the appropriate plans in place to succeed. Together as an experienced team, we're prepared to make hard choices and pull additional levers around inventory and expenses to drive improvement in our business. Heading into 2019, we're focused on delivering our profitability expectations and long-term financial targets.

It's interesting that you're guiding to sales up 1% to 2%, yet you're still able to increase the EBIT margin. Is the message that you're seeing investments pay off, the generational investments and you're able to do things around inventory?

So I think we'll step back and broadly look at how we set the plan for '19 and where we set our guidance. So as you mentioned, the top line of 1% to 2%, I think if you focus on -- I'm going to talk about the midpoint of our guidance. As you can see from the midpoint of our guidance, we're actually expecting to get inflection in an EBIT rate. And the way we're getting there is modest improvement in our margin through inventory turn, tighter discipline in inventory and strategic partnerships. On the SG&A side, it's a slight deleverage, but between the 2, they kind of moderate out. So what you're seeing is flow-through from the top line. I would emphasize, on the SG&A piece to it, we -- it's kind of a combination of both. We are getting a lot more leverage, both in the top line and the flow-through from our generational investments. We're getting scale and productivity out of the investments we've been making in our digital capabilities. And additionally, we are finding additional ways to drive productivity in the organization. In general, when I look at our SG&A rate, as we're coming out of our heavy investment cycle, the good news is if you pull out what we're investing in our West Coast supply chain, our SG&A rate would be relatively flat from a rate basis year-over-year. So we're really starting to see that scale and productivity coming through the business."

What I would say is as you're hearing from everybody in the market, there is wage inflation and freight costs are going up. However, as part of our guidance, we're finding ways to offset that. Again, we've been making investments in things like the supply chain in West Coast. So that's actually helping us not only serve our customers in a better way, but it's also allowing us to open up inventory and also to be more cost-efficient in how we serve the customer. So we're finding ways to offset some of those increases. From a digital capability perspective, Erik talked about supply chain in his remarks.

I would start with inventory. Being able to leverage the inventory that we have that's close to our customers, mainly in our stores but also starting this year with the local omnichannel hub that I mentioned in L.A., Allows us to do a lot with customers. And so it's the digital investments to leverage that inventory. It's also the digital investments that allow the customer to access the inventory in very efficient ways. So the result of that is a significant increase in selection for the customer. And we execute it with our local market strategy, especially same-day, next-day, 2-day, the amount of selection we can bring the customer is significant. The speed increases dramatically as well. Right now, our 2 fulfillment centers, one is in Iowa and one's in Pennsylvania, our delivery times to our West Coast customers, will improve significantly. And the third thing that our digital investments around inventory provide us -- for us at a much lower cost. We're able to get this increased selection faster and at a lower cost. So it's very meaningful. The other part, our digital capabilities, I would lump them together as being able to serve customers better. And a lot of that has to do with stitching together these experiences, digital experiences we've invested in the last several years. A lot of these capabilities, we've tested and we know they resonate with customers, but they especially are meaningful to the business when we can connect them together. So it can be as, I guess, old world services like alterations of making that experience in setting up appointments online -- that's an important piece of engagement for us, and our digital investments help with that."

So yes, it was -- it was a bit abrupt in terms of what happened in Women's and somewhat unusual that it happened pretty much across the board. And there's explanations for all of it if you really kind of get into it. But it is troubling that we had that challenge across the board. So the thing that we've got going for us, to your point about the data analytics, is we've got really good information about what's working and what's not. And so we're actually right in the middle of understanding better just things like our -- averaging at retail and some of it's happening in the different classifications. So the first thing we did is we had to take our inventory levels down so that we weren't taking too many markdowns. And as such, we edited out about 10% of the brands that we offer in Women's. So part of that gets us rightsized. The other part that, that does is that creates some Open-To-Buy for us to go and buy new things that hopefully are going to be more compelling. I think we tend to always gravitate -- we've been doing this a long time. We're in the fashion business. Like if it's not working, it's probably because our offer is just not compelling enough. And I know that sounds kind of obvious, but we've got a team of people that are currently in market right now just trying to figure out a way to improve our offer. There were some things that worked well in Women's. As an example, like our Topshop business is really strong still. So there may be some things to learn about that. I mean, I would -- that would suggest to us that flow, new product, fashion product, maybe a price sensibility. There's, I think, some indicators there that should help us as we continue to work through this."

I will say that, given the fact that this is opening in the fourth quarter, as you can imagine, it will slightly skew some of our guidance or our EBIT delivery and top line delivery to the fourth quarter of the second half of the year versus normal. Not materially but slightly."

And one of the great advantages we've had is being able to open the Men's Store in advance of the Women's store. It didn't initially start out that, that was our plan, but once we knew we were able to open it sooner, we made a decision because we knew we'd be able to get some learnings and when the Women's Store opened really be able to leverage that. And that's been true. We've been able to prove to ourselves that we can hire really nice people that give great service. That's been super positive. We've proved that customers are responding super well to the integrated physical and digital experiences we have such as express returns and same-day delivery and the 24/7 Buy Online, Pick Up In Store. In fact, a lot of women shoppers are using the Men's Store as a hub to do returns. We've also proven that we get a big online lift in the market when we have a physical store there. The New York market is already, but before we opened the physical store, our biggest online market. So we know that once the Women's Store opens, that's going to be great. The other thing that we confirmed to ourselves is the synergy of having everything all located next to each other helps. So we'd planned this, but we've confirmed that, that -- without the Women Store's opening, the Men's Store, whilst doing well in meeting our plans in both ways, it's going to be a lot better when the Women's Store opens because we just get that lift of that many more customers. I mean for example, in our regular Full-Price business, I think it's something like 48% of all things sold in the Men's department sold to a woman buying it for a man. And it's obviously quite a bit less since we don't have the Women's Store across the street. So I think we're feeling super encouraged by that. The other thing I would tell you is we've got a reputation, a legacy and a foundational element around Shoes. Shoes has been the best-performing category in Men's. We've got a lot of shoe inventory square footage planned in Women's and in Kids and everything that's opening up in that new tower. We're feeling really confident about that. The other thing that we've done in the tower is we've dedicated more inventory and floor space to Designer. Designer's been the best performing, kind of as a price classification, in Men's and, we anticipate that, that's going to carry for Women's. So I guess I've used a long way of answers, but I think we've confirmed a lot of things that we knew and we're feeling really great about opening up in October."

But all these brands are retailers as well. And one of the things that we've seen is a fair amount of them pulled a promotional trigger there in December. So we were actually having to compete on price with some of these brands that we sell just in terms of their vertical presence as retailers. I think that everyone really is committed in our orbit of -- in the universe of brands we work with. We try to run a full-price business, but there's some practical reality that come in there. So it's evolved and changed over the years from just a straight markdown to things like buy more, save more and a lot of kind of clever ways of getting promotional activity in there. So I guess what we could tell you without declaring anything here specifically is that we've got a lot of really good data about that, and we want to make sure that our strategy is as competitive as it can be. And obviously, we can't pretend that the promotional thing doesn't exist. So we continue to work on that."

So for us, we're on top of that as best we can be, and we paid the price a little bit to get ourselves in line. But we started the year in a pretty healthy position with inventory positions, even though we missed our sales plans. And even as we go forward, we're going to be down about 5% in our plans and receipts, if not more. I mean, we've got respond to that as time goes on. So I don't know. And I think, increasingly, it strikes us that our relationships with the brands, particularly as we become more edited in our offer, is much more strategic than it is transactional. And often times, we're trying to solve for the same issues. These guys have big retail initiatives, and it doesn't serve them well to run a super promotional business either. I mean, it used to be the biggest cry that they would have if we were super promotional with their business. So they know it's corrosive to the brand value that they have. So I think the biggest thing is for us to work up front with brands to be clear about what we see in terms of sales trends, planning the business right, ensuring that we've got good flow. So that's keeping ourselves nimble and agile by having relatively lean inventories. These have been fundamental practices that we've worked on for years, but it feels like it's coming into sharper focus. And I could just tell you from my personal experience of interacting with the leaders of these different brands we do business with, they are largely very interested in partnering with us in ways that they haven't in the past about how to flow inventory so it works to our mutual benefit."

But the good news is we've been able to have success really across the board regionally with new Rack store opening. So again, I would read too much into that. I think we're going to continue to be opportunistic. We believe we can have more Rack stores successfully.

As you can imagine, this has been a painful and difficult time for our family and our company. Blake's impact around here is immeasurable. He loved this business and was so good at it. I think the most important impact Blake had on our company was with our people. In many ways, he brought our culture and values to life. He was the most genuine person I have ever known, and his authenticity helped him make real connections with people inside and outside of our company, many of you included. Pete, Blake and I worked closely as a team our entire lives, but especially over the last 20 years and most recently as co-presidents. We miss Blake terribly but are inspired by his example, and all of us are committed to keeping his legacy alive by being the best retailer we can be, particularly me and Pete. Lastly, Pete and I would like to thank those of you who have reached out with your condolences and stories about Blake. It is greatly appreciated.
Okay. I'd like to start out by saying that we are confident in our strategy to serve customers and drive market share gains. Our unique business model is a key point of difference that allows us to serve customers in multiple ways through stores, online, Full-Price and Off-Price with meaningful synergies across Nordstrom. Heading into 2019, we're focused on leveraging our digital and physical assets to provide our customers with a best-in-class experience. 
While we have the right strategies in place, we are not satisfied with our current financial results. We planned 2018 as the inflection point for improved profitability, and we missed this objective. We have a high sense of urgency to deliver on our profit margin expectations. This means executing our levers to drive our top and bottom line. We're focused on getting back on track with our profitability goals, and we reaffirm our financial targets that we laid out during Investor Day last July. 
Turning now to our fourth quarter results. We had a slightly positive comp sales increase, driven by momentum in Off-Price. In Full-Price, we saw an unexpected slowdown in full-line store traffic during and after the holidays. This resulted in softness across most merchandise categories, with Women's Apparel being the most challenging. We're taking immediate action to improve our merchandise assortment by leveraging data analytics for inventory and allocation planning.
At Investor Day, we outlined a number of initiatives supporting our customer strategy. First, we're encouraged by our customer trends. Of our 35 million customers, nearly 10 million shopped across our multiple channels over the past year. We expect this to lead to incremental customer spend of 4 to 11x. During 2018, more than 7 million new customers were introduced to Nordstrom through our Off-Price business, our largest source of customer acquisition. This is impactful because 1/3 of these customers are expected to cross shop in our Full-Price business within a year.
Second, our early investments to build a robust digital business gives us a competitive advantage. Digital sales made up 30% of our business in 2018. As we shared during Investor Day, Nordstrom.com has achieved scale with contribution margins at parity with full-line stores. Customers are increasingly engaging with us across stores and online. As an example, we've seen annualized sales growth of 40% from Buy Online, Pick Up In Store over the past 5 years.
Third, we continue to leverage our strategic brand partnerships to offer customers newness and a sense of discovery. These partnerships include emerging brands such as Reformation and Something Navy as well as established partners like La Mer and Birkenstock. We also have successful limited-time launches of digitally native brands like Away and Allbirds, with more coming this year. Our strategic brands delivered growth of 9% and made up more than 40% of our Full-Price sales.
Finally, we're pleased with our team's execution in Off-Price to build momentum over the past year. Through focused efforts to strengthen our merchandise offering, we delivered improved top line trends and faster inventory turns. We continued our expansion into Canada with the introduction of 6 Nordstrom Rack stores that have outperformed our expectations. Similar to our U.S. business, we've already seen synergies between Nordstrom and Rack stores. For example, the Rack serves as an exhaust for full-line stores, enabling more newness and improving product margin in Canada. 
This year, we have 2 key priorities to drive sales and market share gains: our local market strategy and the Nordy Club loyalty program. 
Beginning with our local market strategy, we're leveraging inventory, along with digital and store capabilities, to serve customers in new and relevant ways. We launched this strategy in Los Angeles as a proof-of-concept. The outsized share gains in this market give us confidence as we continue to scale. Our Get It Fast feature offers customers an expanded selection of merchandise available next day. We also opened 2 more Nordstrom local neighborhood hubs. We're experiencing higher customer engagement through services such as alterations and personal styling, which lead to an exponential lift in customer spend. In the L.A. market, demand for Buy Online, Pick Up In Store increased by 4x. Customers who visit Nordstrom Local spend 2.5x more on average. 
This year, we're planning to reach scale in L.A. by leveraging our inventory. Our supply chain investments will give customers greater access to merchandise selection with faster delivery and at a lower cost to us. This spring, we plan to open a local omnichannel hub in L.A. to accelerate inventory efficiencies. We also plan to open a 1 million square-foot supply chain facility in the fall. This will enable faster delivery to the West Coast, which represents 40% of our customer base. 
We're looking forward to expanding our presence in New York City. We introduced our Men's Store last spring and plan to open our Women's Store this October. This flagship will be the biggest and best statement of the Nordstrom brand in one of the world's top retail markets. We expect that our flagship, coupled with our digital presence, will contribute a meaningful sales lift in the New York City market. 
Our second key priority is to leverage our loyalty program. We continue to evolve our program to remain relevant with customers. In 2018, our loyalty customers contributed more than 1/2 of our sales. Last fall, we launched our enhanced program, the Nordy Club. Cardmembers are now earning 3 points, up from 2, for every dollar they spend. We also added experiential elements such as exclusive access to services and experiences. For example, we offered our loyalty customers early access to our recent Something Navy Drop. Going forward, we are pursuing additional opportunities to further personalize the customer experience and drive increased spend.
In closing, we're well positioned for success through our unique business model that enables us to serve customers in differentiated ways. As we focus on delivering our profitability goals this year, we're prepared to take further action to drive our top and bottom line. 
I'll now turn the call over to Anne, who will provide additional insights into our results and expectations for 2019."

As we approach the end of our heavy investment cycle this ye",1100,"Thank you, Erik. To reiterate, we're disappointed that we missed our EBIT margin inflection point in 2018. We're focused on getting back on track through our levers around inventory and expense. As we approach the end of our heavy investment cycle this year, we expect our generational investments and digital capabilities to further scale and contribute to improved profitability. In addition, our strong financial position enables us to remain agile in changing business conditions.
Turning to our fourth quarter performance. From an EBIT perspective, our results were generally consistent with our updated expectations and our holiday preannouncement. While Full-Price sales came in lower than expected, this was offset by strong expense management. 
Full-Price comp sales decreased 1.6%. As Erik mentioned, we saw broad-based declines across most merchandise categories, with the exception of Shoes. To address our opportunities going forward, we took immediate action to edit our assortment, which represented about 10% of our brand portfolio. 
In Off-Price, our comp sales increase of 4% was in line with expectations, with gains across most divisions. This reflected successful efforts throughout the year to improve our merchandise assortment and accelerate inventory turns. 
Our total company gross profit rate decreased 33 basis points over last year. We took higher markdowns due to softer Full-Price trends and in response to an elevated promotional environment. We ended the year in a solid inventory position overall, with a decrease of approximately 2.5%. That said, we have some pockets of elevated levels based on our current sales trends.
Our SG&A rate was down 23 basis points over last year. We managed expenses well, outperforming our expectations. We continued to bend the curve as our annual expense growth moderated to 4%, below the 5-year historical average of 7%. This was driven by productivity gains in our digital capabilities, particularly in marketing and technology. 
Our fourth quarter earnings also reflected a favorable income tax impact associated with our deferred tax assets. This included a $0.05 EPS benefit related to prior periods, in addition to a reduced effective tax rate beginning in 2018. 
As we look back on the year, our strong financial position is a key differentiator in the marketplace. We have a healthy balance sheet and generated annual operating cash flow of more than $1 billion for the 10th consecutive year. Our consistent and balanced capital allocation approach enabled us to return $1 billion to shareholders during the year and maintain an investment-grade credit rating.
As we shared during Investor Day, we are targeting increased shareholder returns through the following financial priorities: drive market share gains, improve profitability and returns and continue our disciplined capital allocation approach. We're focused on achieving our long-term financial targets, and in fact, sales, ROIC and free cash flow performed in line with our goals. 
While we fell short of our EBIT margin expectations in 2018, we're confident that we can achieve our long-term targets. We're focused on scaling our generational investments, leveraging our digital capabilities and strengthening our product margin. 
Inventory is our biggest near-term lever of profitability. We've positioned our inventory plans below our sales trends, giving us flexibility to chase demand. We're also further leveraging data analytics to inform our merchandise levels and allocation. 
Our second lever of improved profitability is expense. Relative to long-term targets, we are planning incremental savings between $150 million to $200 million related to efficiency initiatives across our company. 
Turning to our 2019 guidance. Our EPS range of $3.65 to $3.90 is based on net sales growth of 1% to 2%. This assumes consistent trends in Off-Price and gradual improvement in Full-Price throughout the year. 
As we have mentioned before, we're measuring success through sales, customer and market metrics. In 2019, we expect net sales growth to approximate comps due to the ongoing shift from stores to digital. As a result, beginning this year, we will only report net sales growth.
For EBIT, we expect a range of $915 million to $970 million. This implies an EBIT margin range of 5.9% to 6.1%, tracking toward our 2020 goal of 6.3% to 6.5%. Relative to our long-term targets, we have assumed lower sales growth in 2019, offset by incremental expense initiatives. 
From a gross profit perspective, we're planning modest expansion through efforts to increase inventory turns and grow strategic brands. Our occupancy rate is expected to be flat. 
Moving to SG&A. We're planning for modest deleverage when excluding the estimated credit charge in 2018. This includes $150 million to $200 million of expense savings in ongoing productivity gains in our digital capabilities. Excluding our West Coast supply chain investments, we expect to maintain a mid-single-digit expense growth for digital capabilities. 
Another lever of improved profitability is our generational investments. In 2018, they contributed nearly $2 billion to our top line and exceeded our bottom line expectations. Nordstromrack.com and HauteLook became our fastest business to hit $1 billion in sales. Trunk Club sales grew 35% for the year, on track to reach its market potential of more than $500 million. In 2019, we're planning for our generational investments to deliver sales of roughly $2.2 billion, with an EBIT improvement of approximately $15 million over last year.
In terms of our quarterly cadence, we expect EBIT for the first quarter to decrease from the prior year. This assumes a continuation of current sales trends with higher markdowns to clear out pockets of excess inventory. From an expense standpoint, we assume greater deleverage on fixed expenses resulting from lower volume in the first quarter relative to the year. We're planning for EBIT margin to leverage beginning in the second quarter. In addition, we estimate $35 million in preopening costs for our New York flagship leading up to our planned October opening. 
From a CapEx perspective, there are no material changes to our 5-year plan. We're estimating approximately $900 million of investments in 2019 or nearly 6% of sales. This includes a shift of around $100 million in projects from last year. We're investing in our key priorities, with 50% of our plan for technology and supply chain and 30% for the New York flagship. As we near the end of our generational investment cycle, we expect CapEx levels to moderate in 2020. 
Through our unique business model and strong financial position, we believe we have the appropriate plans in place to succeed. Together as an experienced team, we're prepared to make hard choices and pull additional levers around inventory and expenses to drive improvement in our business. Heading into 2019, we're focused on delivering our profitability expectations and long-term financial targets.

It's interesting that you're guiding to sales up 1% to 2%, yet you're still able to increase the EBIT margin.

So I think we'll step back and broadly look at how we set the plan for '19 and where we set our guidance. So as you mentioned, the top line of 1% to 2%, I think if you focus on -- I'm going to talk about the midpoint of our guidance. As you can see from the midpoint of our guidance, we're actually expecting to get inflection in an EBIT rate. And the way we're getting there is modest improvement in our margin through inventory turn, tighter discipline in inventory and strategic partnerships. On the SG&A side, it's a slight deleverage, but between the 2, they kind of moderate out. So what you're seeing is flow-through from the top line. I would emphasize, on the SG&A piece to it, we -- it's kind of a combination of both. We are getting a lot more leverage, both in the top line and the flow-through from our generational investments. We're getting scale and productivity out of the investments we've been making in our digital capabilities. And additionally, we are finding additional ways to drive productivity in the organization. In general, when I look at our SG&A rate, as we're coming out of our heavy investment cycle, the good news is if you pull out what we're investing in our West Coast supply chain, our SG&A rate would be relatively flat from a rate basis year-over-year. So we're really starting to see that scale and productivity coming through the business."

What I would say is as you're hearing from everybody in the market, there is wage inflation and freight costs are going up. However, as part of our guidance, we're finding ways to offset that. Again, we've been making investments in things like the supply chain in West Coast. So that's actually helping us not only serve our customers in a better way, but it's also allowing us to open up inventory and also to be more cost-efficient in how we serve the customer. So we're finding ways to offset some of those increases. From a digital capability perspective, Erik talked about supply chain in his remarks. Erik, do you want to add anything else to the capabilities?"

I would start with inventory. Being able to leverage the inventory that we have that's close to our customers, mainly in our stores but also starting this year with the local omnichannel hub that I mentioned in L.A., Allows us to do a lot with customers. And so it's the digital investments to leverage that inventory. It's also the digital investments that allow the customer to access the inventory in very efficient ways. So the result of that is a significant increase in selection for the customer. And we execute it with our local market strategy, especially same-day, next-day, 2-day, the amount of selection we can bring the customer is significant. The speed increases dramatically as well. Right now, our 2 fulfillment centers, one is in Iowa and one's in Pennsylvania, our delivery times to our West Coast customers, will improve significantly. And the third thing that our digital investments around inventory provide us -- for us at a much lower cost. We're able to get this increased selection faster and at a lower cost. So it's very meaningful. The other part, our digital capabilities, I would lump them together as being able to serve customers better. And a lot of that has to do with stitching together these experiences, digital experiences we've invested in the last several years. A lot of these capabilities, we've tested and we know they resonate with customers, but they especially are meaningful to the business when we can connect them together. So it can be as, I guess, old world services like alterations of making that experience in setting up appointments online -- that's an important piece of engagement for us, and our digital investments help with that."

So yes, it was -- it was a bit abrupt in terms of what happened in Women's and somewhat unusual that it happened pretty much across the board. And there's explanations for all of it if you really kind of get into it. But it is troubling that we had that challenge across the board. So the thing that we've got going for us, to your point about the data analytics, is we've got really good information about what's working and what's not. And so we're actually right in the middle of understanding better just things like our -- averaging at retail and some of it's happening in the different classifications. So the first thing we did is we had to take our inventory levels down so that we weren't taking too many markdowns. And as such, we edited out about 10% of the brands that we offer in Women's. So part of that gets us rightsized. The other part that, that does is that creates some Open-To-Buy for us to go and buy new things that hopefully are going to be more compelling. I think we tend to always gravitate -- we've been doing this a long time. We're in the fashion business. Like if it's not working, it's probably because our offer is just not compelling enough. And I know that sounds kind of obvious, but we've got a team of people that are currently in market right now just trying to figure out a way to improve our offer. There were some things that worked well in Women's. As an example, like our Topshop business is really strong still. So there may be some things to learn about that. I mean, I would -- that would suggest to us that flow, new product, fashion product, maybe a price sensibility.

We know that the majority of store visits start online. We know that the majority of our store customers pull out their phone at some point while they're in our stores.

And one of the great advantages we've had is being able to open the Men's Store in advance of the Women's store. It didn't initially start out that, that was our plan, but once we knew we were able to open it sooner, we made a decision because we knew we'd be able to get some learnings and when the Women's Store opened really be able to leverage that. And that's been true. We've been able to prove to ourselves that we can hire really nice people that give great service. That's been super positive. We've proved that customers are responding super well to the integrated physical and digital experiences we have such as express returns and same-day delivery and the 24/7 Buy Online, Pick Up In Store. In fact, a lot of women shoppers are using the Men's Store as a hub to do returns. We've also proven that we get a big online lift in the market when we have a physical store there. The New York market is already, but before we opened the physical store, our biggest online market. So we know that once the Women's Store opens, that's going to be great. The other thing that we confirmed to ourselves is the synergy of having everything all located next to each other helps. So we'd planned this, but we've confirmed that, that -- without the Women Store opening, the Men's Store, whilst doing well in meeting our plans in both ways, it's going to be a lot better when the Women's Store opens because we just get that lift of that many more customers. I mean for example, in our regular Full-Price business, I think it's something like 48% of all things sold in the Men's department sold to a woman buying it for a man. And it's obviously quite a bit less since we don't have the Women's Store across the street. So I think we're feeling super encouraged by that. The other thing I would tell you is we've got a reputation, a legacy and a foundational element around Shoes. Shoes has been the best-performing category in Men's. We've got a lot of shoe inventory square footage planned in Women's and in Kids and everything that's opening up in that new tower. We're feeling really confident about that. The other thing that we've done in the tower is we've dedicated more inventory and floor space to Designer. Designer's been the best performing, kind of as a price classification, in Men's and, we anticipate that, that's going to carry for Women's. So I guess I've used a long way of answers, but I think we've confirmed a lot of things that we knew and we're feeling really great about opening up in October."

But all these brands are retailers as well. And one of the things that we've seen is a fair amount of them pulled a promotional trigger there in December. So we were actually having to compete on price with some of these brands that we sell just in terms of their vertical presence as retailers. I think that everyone really is committed in our orbit of -- in the universe of brands we work with to try to run a full-price business, but there's some practical reality that come in there. So it's evolved and changed over the years from just a straight markdown to things like buy more, save more and a lot of kind of clever ways of getting promotional activity in there. So I guess what we could tell you without declaring anything here specifically is that we've got a lot of really good data about that, and we want to make sure that our strategy is as competitive as it can be. And obviously, we can't pretend that the promotional thing doesn't exist. So we continue to work on that."

So for us, we're on top of that as best we can be, and we paid the price a little bit to get ourselves in line. But we started the year in a pretty healthy position with inventory positions, even though we missed our sales plans. And even as we go forward, we're going to be down about 5% in our plans and receipts, if not more. I mean, we've got respond to that as time goes on. So I don't know. And I think, increasingly, it strikes us that our relationships with the brands, particularly as we become more edited in our offer, is much more strategic than it is transactional. And often times, we're trying to solve for the same issues. These guys have big retail initiatives, and it doesn't serve them well to run a super promotional business either. I mean, it used to be the biggest cry that they would have if we were super promotional with their business. So they know it's corrosive to the brand value that they have. So I think the biggest thing is for us to work up front with brands to be clear about what we see in terms of sales trends, planning the business right, ensuring that we've got good flow. So that's keeping ourselves nimble and agile by having relatively lean inventories. These have been fundamental practices that we've worked on for years, but it feels like it's coming into sharper focus. And I could just tell you from my personal experience of interacting with the leaders of these different brands we do business with, they are largely very interested in partnering with us in ways that they haven't in the past about how to flow inventory so it works to our mutual benefit."

I think, just to be cautious, kind of given the environment we're in terms of what's happening with fiscal brick-and-mortar retailing. But the good news is we've been able to have success really across the board regionally with new Rack store opening. So again, I wouldn't read too much into that.

Okay. I'd like to start out by saying that we are confident in our strategy to serve customers and drive market share gains. Our unique business model is a key point of difference that allows us to serve customers in multiple ways through stores, online, Full-Price and Off-Price with meaningful synergies across Nordstrom. Heading into 2019, we're focused on leveraging our digital and physical assets to provide our customers with a best-in-class experience. 
While we have the right strategies in place, we are not satisfied with our current financial results. We planned 2018 as the inflection point for improved profitability, and we missed this objective. We have a high sense of urgency to deliver on our profit margin expectations. This means executing our levers to drive our top and bottom line. We're focused on getting back on track with our profitability goals, and we reaffirm our financial targets that we laid out during Investor Day last July. 
Turning now to our fourth quarter results. We had a slightly positive comp sales increase, driven by momentum in Off-Price. In Full-Price, we saw an unexpected slowdown in full-line store traffic during and after the holidays. This resulted in softness across most merchandise categories, with Women's Apparel being the most challenging. We're taking immediate action to improve our merchandise assortment by leveraging data analytics for inventory and allocation planning.
At Investor Day, we outlined a number of initiatives supporting our customer strategy. First, we're encouraged by our customer trends. Of our 35 million customers, nearly 10 million shopped across our multiple channels over the past year. We expect this to lead to incremental customer spend of 4 to 11x. During 2018, more than 7 million new customers were introduced to Nordstrom through our Off-Price business, our largest source of customer acquisition. This is impactful because 1/3 of these customers are expected to cross shop in our Full-Price business within a year.
Second, our early investments to build a robust digital business gives us a competitive advantage. Digital sales made up 30% of our business in 2018. As we shared during Investor Day, Nordstrom.com has achieved scale with contribution margins at parity with full-line stores. Customers are increasingly engaging with us across stores and online. As an example, we've seen annualized sales growth of 40% from Buy Online, Pick Up In Store over the past 5 years.
Third, we continue to leverage our strategic brand partnerships to offer customers newness and a sense of discovery. These partnerships include emerging brands such as Reformation and Something Navy as well as established partners like La Mer and Birkenstock. We also have successful limited-time launches of digitally native brands like Away and Allbirds, with more coming this year. Our strategic brands delivered growth of 9% and made up more than 40% of our Full-Price sales.
Finally, we're pleased with our team's execution in Off-Price to build momentum over the past year. Through focused efforts to strengthen our merchandise offering, we delivered improved top line trends and faster inventory turns. We continued our expansion into Canada with the introduction of 6 Nordstrom Rack stores that have outperformed our expectations. Similar to our U.S. business, we've already seen synergies between Nordstrom and Rack stores. For example, the Rack serves as an exhaust for full-line stores, enabling more newness and improving product margin in Canada. 
This year, we have 2 key priorities to drive sales and market share gains: our local market strategy and the Nordy Club loyalty program. Beginning with our local market strategy, we're leveraging inventory, along with digital and store capabilities, to serve customers in new and relevant ways. We launched this strategy in Los Angeles as a proof-of-concept. The outsized share gains in this market give us confidence as we continue to scale. Our Get It Fast feature offers customers an expanded selection of merchandise available next day. We also opened 2 more Nordstrom local neighborhood hubs. We're experiencing higher customer engagement through services such as alterations and personal styling, which lead to an exponential lift in customer spend. In the L.A. market, demand for Buy Online, Pick Up In Store increased by 4x. Customers who visit Nordstrom Local spend 2.5x more on average. 
This year, we're planning to reach scale in L.A. by leveraging our inventory. Our supply chain investments will give customers greater access to merchandise selection with faster delivery and at a lower cost to us. This spring, we plan to open a local omnichannel hub in L.A. to accelerate inventory efficiencies. We also plan to open a 1 million square-foot supply chain facility in the fall. This will enable faster delivery to the West Coast, which represents 40% of our customer base. 
We're looking forward to expanding our presence in New York City. We introduced our Men's Store last spring and plan to open our Women's Store this October. This flagship will be the biggest and best statement of the Nordstrom brand in one of the world's top retail markets. We expect that our flagship, coupled with our digital presence, will contribute a meaningful sales lift in the New York City market. 
Our second key priority is to leverage our loyalty program. We continue to evolve our program to remain relevant with customers. In 2018, our loyalty customers contributed more than 1/2 of our sales. Last fall, we launched our enhanced program, the Nordy Club. Cardmembers are now earning 3 points, up from 2, for every dollar they spend. We also added experiential elements such as exclusive access to services and experiences. For example, we offered our loyalty customers early access to our recent Something Navy Drop. Going forward, we are pursuing additional opportunities to further personalize the customer experience and drive increased spend.
In closing, we're well positioned for success through our unique business model that enables us to serve customers in differentiated ways. As we focus on delivering our profitability goals this year, we're prepared to take further action to drive our top and bottom line. 
I'll now turn the call over to Anne, who will provide additional insights into our results and expectations for 2019."

As we approach the end of our heavy investment cycle this ye",1100,"Thank you, Erik. To reiterate, we're disappointed that we missed our EBIT margin inflection point in 2018. We're focused on getting back on track through our levers around inventory and expense. As we approach the end of our heavy investment cycle this year, we expect our generational investments and digital capabilities to further scale and contribute to improved profitability. In addition, our strong financial position enables us to remain agile in changing business conditions.
Turning to our fourth quarter performance. From an EBIT perspective, our results were generally consistent with our updated expectations and our holiday preannouncement. While Full-Price sales came in lower than expected, this was offset by strong expense management. 
Full-Price comp sales decreased 1.6%. As Erik mentioned, we saw broad-based declines across most merchandise categories, with the exception of Shoes. To address our opportunities going forward, we took immediate action to edit our assortment, which represented about 10% of our brand portfolio. 
In Off-Price, our comp sales increase of 4% was in line with expectations, with gains across most divisions. This reflected successful efforts throughout the year to improve our merchandise assortment and accelerate inventory turns. 
Our total company gross profit rate decreased 33 basis points over last year. We took higher markdowns due to softer Full-Price trends and in response to an elevated promotional environment. We ended the year in a solid inventory position overall, with a decrease of approximately 2.5%. That said, we have some pockets of elevated levels based on our current sales trends.
Our SG&A rate was down 23 basis points over last year. We managed expenses well, outperforming our expectations. We continued to bend the curve as our annual expense growth moderated to 4%, below the 5-year historical average of 7%. This was driven by productivity gains in our digital capabilities, particularly in marketing and technology. 
Our fourth quarter earnings also reflected a favorable income tax impact associated with our deferred tax assets. This included a $0.05 EPS benefit related to prior periods, in addition to a reduced effective tax rate beginning in 2018. 
As we look back on the year, our strong financial position is a key differentiator in the marketplace. We have a healthy balance sheet and generated annual operating cash flow of more than $1 billion for the 10th consecutive year. Our consistent and balanced capital allocation approach enabled us to return $1 billion to shareholders during the year and maintain an investment-grade credit rating.
As we shared during Investor Day, we are targeting increased shareholder returns through the following financial priorities: drive market share gains, improve profitability and returns and continue our disciplined capital allocation approach. We're focused on achieving our long-term financial targets, and in fact, sales, ROIC and free cash flow performed in line with our goals. 
While we fell short of our EBIT margin expectations in 2018, we're confident that we can achieve our long-term targets. We're focused on scaling our generational investments, leveraging our digital capabilities and strengthening our product margin. 
Inventory is our biggest near-term lever of profitability. We've positioned our inventory plans below our sales trends, giving us flexibility to chase demand. We're also further leveraging data analytics to inform our merchandise levels and allocation. 
Our second lever of improved profitability is expense. Relative to long-term targets, we are planning incremental savings between $150 million to $200 million related to efficiency initiatives across our company. 
Turning to our 2019 guidance. Our EPS range of $3.65 to $3.90 is based on net sales growth of 1% to 2%. This assumes consistent trends in Off-Price and gradual improvement in Full-Price throughout the year. 
As we have mentioned before, we're measuring success through sales, customer and market metrics. In 2019, we expect net sales growth to approximate comps due to the ongoing shift from stores to digital. As a result, beginning this year, we will only report net sales growth.
For EBIT, we expect a range of $915 million to $970 million. This implies an EBIT margin range of 5.9% to 6.1%, tracking toward our 2020 goal of 6.3% to 6.5%. Relative to our long-term targets, we have assumed lower sales growth in 2019, offset by incremental expense initiatives. 
From a gross profit perspective, we're planning modest expansion through efforts to increase inventory turns and grow strategic brands. Our occupancy rate is expected to be flat. 
Moving to SG&A. We're planning for modest deleverage when excluding the estimated credit charge in 2018. This includes $150 million to $200 million of expense savings in ongoing productivity gains in our digital capabilities. Excluding our West Coast supply chain investments, we expect to maintain a mid-single-digit expense growth for digital capabilities. 
Another lever of improved profitability is our generational investments. In 2018, they contributed nearly $2 billion to our top line and exceeded our bottom line expectations. Nordstromrack.com and HauteLook became our fastest business to hit $1 billion in sales. Trunk Club sales grew 35% for the year, on track to reach its market potential of more than $500 million. In 2019, we're planning for our generational investments to deliver sales of roughly $2.2 billion, with an EBIT improvement of approximately $15 million over last year.
In terms of our quarterly cadence, we expect EBIT for the first quarter to decrease from the prior year. This assumes a continuation of current sales trends with higher markdowns to clear out pockets of excess inventory. From an expense standpoint, we assume greater deleverage on fixed expenses resulting from lower volume in the first quarter relative to the year. We're planning for EBIT margin to leverage beginning in the second quarter. In addition, we estimate $35 million in preopening costs for our New York flagship leading up to our planned October opening. 
From a CapEx perspective, there are no material changes to our 5-year plan. We're estimating approximately $900 million of investments in 2019 or nearly 6% of sales. This includes a shift of around $100 million in projects from last year. We're investing in our key priorities, with 50% of our plan for technology and supply chain and 30% for the New York flagship. As we near the end of our generational investment cycle, we expect CapEx levels to moderate in 2020. 
Through our unique business model and strong financial position, we believe we have the appropriate plans in place to succeed. Together as an experienced team, we're prepared to make hard choices and pull additional levers around inventory and expenses to drive improvement in our business. Heading into 2019, we're focused on delivering our profitability expectations and long-term financial targets. 
I'll now turn it over to Trina for Q&A."

It's interesting that you're guiding to sales up 1% to 2%, yet you're still able to increase the EBIT margin. Is the message that you're seeing investments pay off, the generational investments and you're able to do things around inventory?

So I think we'll step back and broadly look at how we set the plan for '19 and where we set our guidance. So as you mentioned, the top line of 1% to 2%, I think if you focus on -- I'm going to talk about the midpoint of our guidance. As you can see from the midpoint of our guidance, we're actually expecting to get inflection in an EBIT rate. And the way we're getting there is modest improvement in our margin through inventory turn, tighter discipline in inventory and strategic partnerships. On the SG&A side, it's a slight deleverage, but between the 2, they kind of moderate out. So what you're seeing is flow-through from the top line. I would emphasize, on the SG&A piece to it, we -- it's kind of a combination of both. We are getting a lot more leverage, both in the top line and the flow-through from our generational investments. We're getting scale and productivity out of the investments we've been making in our digital capabilities. And additionally, we are finding additional ways to drive productivity in the organization. In general, when I look at our SG&A rate, as we're coming out of our heavy investment cycle, the good news is if you pull out what we're investing in our West Coast supply chain, our SG&A rate would be relatively flat from a rate basis year-over-year. So we're really starting to see that scale and productivity coming through the business."

What I would say is as you're hearing from everybody in the market, there is wage inflation and freight costs are going up. However, as part of our guidance, we're finding ways to offset that. Again, we've been making investments in things like the supply chain in West Coast. So that's actually helping us not only serve our customers in a better way, but it's also allowing us to open up inventory and also to be more cost-efficient in how we serve the customer. So we're finding ways to offset some of those increases. From a digital capability perspective, Erik talked about supply chain in his remarks. Erik, do you want to add anything else to the capabilities?"

I would start with inventory. Being able to leverage the inventory that we have that's close to our customers, mainly in our stores but also starting this year with the local omnichannel hub that I mentioned in L.A., Allows us to do a lot with customers. And so it's the digital investments to leverage that inventory. It's also the digital investments that allow the customer to access the inventory in very efficient ways. So the result of that is a significant increase in selection for the customer. And we execute it with our local market strategy, especially same-day, next-day, 2-day, the amount of selection we can bring the customer is significant. The speed increases dramatically as well. Right now, our 2 fulfillment centers, one is in Iowa and one's in Pennsylvania, our delivery times to our West Coast customers, will improve significantly. And the third thing that our digital investments around inventory provide us -- for us at a much lower cost. We're able to get this increased selection faster and at a lower cost. So it's very meaningful. The other part, our digital capabilities, I would lump them together as being able to serve customers better. And a lot of that has to do with stitching together these experiences, digital experiences we've invested in the last several years. A lot of these capabilities, we've tested and we know they resonate with customers, but they especially are meaningful to the business when we can connect them together. So it can be as, I guess, old world services like alterations of making that experience in setting up appointments online -- that's an important piece of engagement for us, and our digital investments help with that."

So yes, it was -- it was a bit abrupt in terms of what happened in Women's and somewhat unusual that it happened pretty much across the board. And there's explanations for all of it if you really kind of get into it. But it is troubling that we had that challenge across the board. So the thing that we've got going for us, to your point about the data analytics, is we've got really good information about what's working and what's not. And so we're actually right in the middle of understanding better just things like our -- averaging at retail and some of it's happening in the different classifications. So the first thing we did is we had to take our inventory levels down so that we weren't taking too many markdowns. And as such, we edited out about 10% of the brands that we offer in Women's. So part of that gets us rightsized. The other part that, that does is that creates some Open-To-Buy for us to go and buy new things that hopefully are going to be more compelling. I think we tend to always gravitate -- we've been doing this a long time. We're in the fashion business. Like if it's not working, it's probably because our offer is just not compelling enough. And I know that sounds kind of obvious, but we've got a team of people that are currently in market right now just trying to figure out a way to improve our offer. There were some things that worked well in Women's. As an example, like our Topshop business is really strong still. So there may be some things to learn about that. I mean, I would -- that would suggest to us that flow, new product, fashion product, maybe a price sensibility. There's, I think, some indicators there that should help us as we continue to work through this."

And I would point out, and we talk about things like the cross shop and digital sales penetration. Our business is much more digital than even that suggests. We know that the majority of store visits start online. We know that the majority of our store customers pull out their phone at some point while they're in our stores. And ultimately, that could get captured as a store sale. And it wouldn't be capturing that calculation that you're referring to, but it absolutely is aided by the digital assets that we have."

And one of the great advantages we've had is being able to open the Men's Store in advance of the Women's store. It didn't initially start out that, that was our plan, but once we knew we were able to open it sooner, we made a decision because we knew we'd be able to get some learnings and when the Women's Store opened really be able to leverage that. And that's been true. We've been able to prove to ourselves that we can hire really nice people that give great service. That's been super positive. We've proved that customers are responding super well to the integrated physical and digital experiences we have such as express returns and same-day delivery and the 24/7 Buy Online, Pick Up In Store. In fact, a lot of women shoppers are using the Men's Store as a hub to do returns. We've also proven that we get a big online lift in the market when we have a physical store there. The New York market is already, but before we opened the physical store, our biggest online market. So we know that once the Women's Store opens, that's going to be great. The other thing that we confirmed to ourselves is the synergy of having everything all located next to each other helps. So we'd planned this, but we've confirmed that, that -- without the Women Store opening, the Men's Store, whilst doing well in meeting our plans in both ways, it's going to be a lot better when the Women's Store opens because we just get that lift of that many more customers. I mean for example, in our regular Full-Price business, I think it's something like 48% of all things sold in the Men's department sold to a woman buying it for a man. And it's obviously quite a bit less since we don't have the Women's Store across the street. So I think we're feeling super encouraged by that. The other thing I would tell you is we've got a reputation, a legacy and a foundational element around Shoes. Shoes has been the best-performing category in Men's. We've got a lot of shoe inventory square footage planned in Women's and in Kids and everything that's opening up in that new tower. We're feeling really confident about that. The other thing that we've done in the tower is we've dedicated more inventory and floor space to Designer. Designer's been the best performing, kind of as a price classification, in Men's and, we anticipate that, that's going to carry for Women's. So I guess I've used a long way of answers, but I think we've confirmed a lot of things that we knew and we're feeling really great about opening up in October."

But all these brands are retailers as well. And one of the things that we've seen is a fair amount of them pulled a promotional trigger there in December. So we were actually having to compete on price with some of these brands that we sell just in terms of their vertical presence as retailers. I think that everyone really is committed in our orbit of -- in the universe of brands we work with to try to run a full-price business, but there's some practical reality that come in there. So it's evolved and changed over the years from just a straight markdown to things like buy more, save more and a lot of kind of clever ways of getting promotional activity in there. So I guess what we could tell you without declaring anything here specifically is that we've got a lot of really good data about that, and we want to make sure that our strategy is as competitive as it can be. And obviously, we can't pretend that the promotional thing doesn't exist. So we continue to work on that."

So for us, we're on top of that as best we can be, and we paid the price a little bit to get ourselves in line. But we started the year in a pretty healthy position with inventory positions, even though we missed our sales plans. And even as we go forward, we're going to be down about 5% in our plans and receipts, if not more. I mean, we've got respond to that as time goes on. So I don't know. And I think, increasingly, it strikes us that our relationships with the brands, particularly as we become more edited in our offer, is much more strategic than it is transactional. And often times, we're trying to solve for the same issues. These guys have big retail initiatives, and it doesn't serve them well to run a super promotional business either. I mean, it used to be the biggest cry that they would have if we were super promotional with their business. So they know it's corrosive to the brand value that they have. So I think the biggest thing is for us to work up front with brands to be clear about what we see in terms of sales trends, planning the business right, ensuring that we've got good flow. So that's keeping ourselves nimble and agile by having relatively lean inventories. These have been fundamental practices that we've worked on for years, but it feels like it's coming into sharper focus. And I could just tell you from my personal experience of interacting with the leaders of these different brands we do business with, they are largely very interested in partnering with us in ways that they haven't in the past about how to flow inventory so it works to our mutual benefit."

While we believe our customer strategy and business model position us for long-term success, our first quarter top line results were well below our expectations.

While we believe our customer strategy and business model position us for long-term success, our first quarter top line results were well below our expectations. We had planned for a continuation of soft sales trends from the fourth quarter but saw further deceleration. Relative to the plans we shared at the beginning of the year, we successfully executed on inventory and expense, which helped mitigate our sales mix. We ended the quarter with inventories in solid shape, and our financial position remains strong. We're more confident in our leadership team's ability to better serve customers on their terms and remain focused on achieving profitable growth.
During the first quarter, we had some executional misses with the customer experience that had an impact on sales across Full-Price and Off-Price, both in stores and online. We know we disappointed our customers, and we own it. We have identified 3 factors that contributed to this sales miss: loyalty, digital marketing and merchandise. These areas are within our control to turn around, and we're already taking steps to course correct and drive the top line. I'd like to provide insight into what happens and how we're addressing all 3 areas.
Beginning with loyalty. We have a well-established program with nearly 12 million active customers contributing more than 60% of sales in the first quarter. Last fall, we evolved the program with the introduction of The Nordy Club, which allows customers to earn reward notes faster and provides early access to product and events. However, the execution of our rollout was not as successful as we had planned. As part of our decision to move to a digital-first program, we eliminated paper notes but later discovered that a segment of our customer base relies on receiving these notes by mail. As a result, we saw a reduction in traffic across Full-Price and Off-Price. We are resolving these issues, and our initial results showed improving trends for engagement, traffic and spend from our loyalty customers.
The second factor is related to digital marketing. We deliberately reduced our digital marketing as we shifted resources to loyalty. With The Nordy Club rollout not ramping as we had projected, we experienced incremental traffic declines in our business. We have since increased our investments in digital marketing to drive traffic and sales.
The third factor is merchandise. The breadth of our offering across brands, price points and styles is a key differentiator in serving customers. We have opportunities to rebalance our assortment mix to better resonate with customers in Full-Price and Off-Price. This includes Women's Apparel, which continued to have the toughest results in Full-Price. Beauty was another call-out for the quarter given the highly promotional environment and increased out-of-stock levels. It will take some time to adjust our merchandise assortment, but we have already started this process and expect improvement in the second half of the year.
All 3 factors, loyalty, digital marketing and merchandise, contributed to a slowdown in digital sales growth of 7% in the first quarter relative to last year's annual growth of 16%. We're making the changes we believe are necessary to drive our top line as we continue our aggressive focus on expenses, which Anne will discuss in more detail. 
Our strength is our commitment to the customer, and we know we have areas of improvement. Over the years, we have managed through many cycles, which give us confidence in our ability to adjust our business to better serve customers. Our entire leadership team has a high degree of urgency to improve our top line and profitability. Additionally, the team is focused on executing the following 3 key strategies this year. First, our local market strategy enables increased customer engagement through services and greater access to merchandise selection with faster delivery and at a lower cost to us. Last year, we launched in Los Angeles, our largest market, with 4 full-line stores and 3 Nordstrom Local service hubs. During the first quarter, we continued to see positive outcomes with outsized growth in digital sales and store traffic in this market. In addition, nearly 1/3 of order pickup services are done in our 3 Nordstrom Locals. We're planning to rescale in the L.A. market, including 16 full-line stores by further leveraging inventory through our supply chain investments. 
Moving to our second key strategy. Our market share gains in Los Angeles give us added confidence as we expand our presence in New York City, our largest market for online sales. We are on track to open our flagship on October 24 along with 2 Nordstrom Local hubs this fall. We expect these physical assets to greatly add to our ability to engage with customers across multiple touch points. We know that engaged customers spend more, which is expected to result in a meaningful sales lift for this important market.
With our third strategy, we're focused on improving the customer experience during our 2 key events. Our Anniversary Sale is a unique event, offering brand-new arrivals at reduced prices for a limited time. We're curating our assortment to focus on customers' favorite brands. We're also extending the preshop period for our top loyalty customers. 
For holiday, we're aiming to make Nordstrom more of a gift-giving destination for both new and existing customers. This includes amplifying our gifting assortment across categories and with more accessible price points. 
In closing, we own our results, and we're focused on getting our sales back on track. As always, the customer is at the center of everything we do, and through that lens, we're committed to better serving them on their terms. 
Now Anne will discuss our financial results and outlook."

I'd like to reiterate that we take an immediate action to better serve our customers for our top line and improve profitability. As we continue to focus on making our business more efficient and productive, we're aggressively bending the expense curve and managing our inventory. 
Turning to our top line results. Total company sales were down 3.5% with Full-Price down 5.1% and Off-Price down 0.6%. The drivers of our sales shortfall, loyalty, digital marketing and merchandise, contributed to decelerating trends in our key operating metrics, which includes trips and customer engagement. 
Although we missed our sales expectations by several hundred basis points, we were able to offset roughly half of this miss through our merchandise margins and expense performance. In fact, the sales shortfall in Off-Price was fully offset by the team's ability to control expenses and manage inventory levels down significantly. 
Moving to gross profit. Our rate was down 60 basis points relative to last year due to planned markdowns and occupancy deleverage. We ended the quarter in a solid inventory position with a positive spread of 180 basis points relative to sales. This allows us to be agile in responding to changes in customer expectations. As we continue into the second quarter, we have planned inventory based on current sales trends, and we remain disciplined in our buying as we work to improve our merchandise offering.
From an expense standpoint, our SG&A rate increased 168 basis points relative to last year. This was entirely due to fixed cost deleverage on lower sales. We're making further structural enhancements to our operating model as we implement several efficiency initiatives related to 3 areas: improvements to our store operating model, productivity gains in technology and supply chain and reduced discretionary spend. We expect these initiatives to ramp up over the year, and we're ahead of our plans with $35 million realized in the first quarter. This included operational changes in stores to better align with how customers are shopping. For example, for printing services that have a direct customer impact such as order fulfillment in full-line stores, faster checkout at the Rack. All these initiatives represent permanent reductions in our cost structure, which positions us well for strong EBIT flow-through going forward. 
Another lever of improved profitability is our generational investments. Over the past decade, we've invested thoroughly in our digital capabilities and new markets. This is the last year of our generational investment cycle, and we're already seeing returns. These investments are continuing to scale and are expected to deliver top line growth and improved profitability this year.
Our financial position remains strong, enabling us to be flexible in changing business [indiscernible]. We have a healthy balance sheet and generating annual operating cash flow of more than $1 billion over the last decade. Our consistent and balanced capital allocation approach enables us to maintain an investment-grade credit rating. We also returned approximately $250 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases during the first quarter. 
Moving to our annual outlook. We revised EPS from a range of $3.65 to $3.90 to a range of $3.25 to $3.65. This incorporates a sales decline of 2% to flat growth for the year relative to our prior outlook of 1% to 2% increase. We expect it's going to take some time to see improvement as we further adjust our merchandise offerings and lag the operational issues on [indiscernible]. 
We anticipate first quarter trends to continue into the second quarter with gradual improvement beginning in the second half of the year. For credit revenue, we're planning for a low to mid-single-digit increase based on our current sales trends.
From a bottom line perspective, we expect an EBIT margin range of 5.3% to 5.8% compared to our prior outlook of 5.9% to 6.1%. From a gross profit and SG&A perspective, the change in our assumptions is driven by greater fixed cost deleverage and lower sales expectations. We expect gross profit at the midpoint of our outlook to be relatively flat to last year. This reflects improved merchandise margins offset by occupancy deleverage. 
For SG&A, we expect moderate deleverage when excluding the estimated credit charge in 2018. We've also incorporated expense savings at the high end of our original range of $150 million to $200 million. These savings are expected to be back half-weighted as we make further progress on our various initiatives. 
For the second quarter, we expect our anniversary event to perform in line with our current sales trends, which has been our historical experience. Our second quarter gross profit rate deleverage is planned similar to Q1 due to lower sales. We also expect SG&A to deleverage but, to a lesser extent in Q1, to [ get ] further expense savings. 
Specific to anniversary, we're making changes to improve the overall economics of the event. As a result, we expect extended merchandise margins in the [ first ] quarter to better sell-through at the anniversary product, which should result in lower markdowns. Please also refer to our slides for additional color on our quarterly timing assumptions. 
In closing, we're making hard choices as we focus on better serving customers, driving top line and improving profitability. We know we must demonstrate this commitment with our results in the coming months, and we look forward to updating you on our progress. 
I'll now turn it over to Trina for Q&A."

We have a pretty broad range of customers that we look to serve. And our mix is super important in delivering that. And when we get out of balance, it really affects our top line. So we have those issues in Off-Price. 
The other bucket I'd call out is we did enter the year with a plan to improve our profitability in Off-Price, and part of that plan was eliminating some unprofitable events. Specifically, we reduced the number of flash events that we had on HauteLook. Some of them were not profitable. We reduced our Clear the Racks event in the quarter. And we did eliminate some of the very lowest price points merchandise we had on our Off-Price e-Commerce business. We did get the profitability improvement from those decisions. The effect on top line was greater than we have planned. And we look at that, and we see opportunities to not blow up that strategy but to make some adjustments to it that we can and will help our top line."

We upped the points from 2 points for every dollar spent to 3 points. We added a number of experiences to the program, which is actually resonating really well with the customers. But in having the executional issues around the notes directly affected our digital marketing plan. By investing in loyalty, we moved marketing dollars there and away from retention activation in our digital marketing. So our missteps with the loyalty program exacerbated our issues in digital marketing, and they're certainly connected but not driven by expense. 
Another thing I'd call out is in our stores, both in Racks and in our full-line stores, we have executed some model changes at our stores, again, not driven mainly by expense. But we've been on this journey for a while of, clearly, our model needs to change. Our business model, which is born in bricks-and-mortar stores, and define what the real stores are. We think we have real clarity on that. Our stores still that role of having great sales people who are taking care of 1 customer at a time and making some genuine human connections. That's in our DNA. That's continuing and has to be important. 
But increasingly, stores play a fulfillment role. There's locations where customers can pick up online orders, and there are locations that we fill online orders from. So we have moved our labor model in our stores to reflect what customers want and need. And there are efficiency opportunities in there. But I wouldn't say that it's been a blunt force of getting after expense cuts.

We started in L.A. last year and really started with engagement. How do we engage with customers by leveraging both our digital and physical assets? And that included experimenting with new physical assets in the Nordstrom Local service hubs. That engagement part across services and across channels, and we know we've got a lot of data on that. We know the more we engage with customers across channels and services, the more they spend. That's gone really, really well. 
The second part of the local market strategy is leveraging the inventory that is close to our customers either in our stores or in our supply chain facilities. That's -- we're not as deep into that yet. We started being able to leverage the inventory. Started with our 4 core stores in Los Angeles. And a good example would be BOPUS, Buy Online, Pick Up in Store, where we went from available in refer BOPUS being 1 specific store inventory to connecting the 4 stores and being able to pick it up either at those 4 stores or 1 of the 3 Nordstrom Local service hubs we have. And we've talked about it before, the outsized growth we're seeing in BOPUS across our company. The growth in BOPUS in Los Angeles is about 2x that we're seeing elsewhere in the company.
So here is a massive piece of engagement that customers love, that we think we can do in a fairly unique way and really given our customers terms, that drives higher engagement, drives bigger spend. Ultimately, our local market strategy success metric is gaining market share in these markets, and we have seen that in Los Angeles. We're in the midst right now of expanding our local market services from those core 4 stores to all 16 full-line stores in Los Angeles. We are on pace to bring our learnings to New York when we open the tower. We have 2 Nordstrom Local service hubs planned on the island. And we're well positioned to execute that in New York. And our plan is next year to take that to our biggest markets across our portfolio. 
So that is our model. It leads with service engagement across channels and services, and it leads with leveraging inventory to get customers a greater selection to them faster and adds better economics for us. And we think that's the future of our Full-Price business."

While we believe our customer strategy and business model position us for long-term success, our first quarter top line results were well below our expectations.

While we believe our customer strategy and business model position us for long-term success, our first quarter top line results were well below our expectations. We had planned for a continuation of soft sales trends from the fourth quarter but saw further deceleration. Relative to the plans we shared at the beginning of the year, we successfully executed on inventory and expense, which helped mitigate our sales mix. We ended the quarter with inventories in solid shape, and our financial position remains strong. We're confident in our leadership team's ability to better serve customers on their terms and remain focused on achieving profitable growth.
During the first quarter, we had some executional misses with the customer experience that had an impact on sales across Full-Price and Off-Price both in stores and online. We know we disappointed our customers, and we own it. We have identified 3 factors that contributed to this sales miss: loyalty, digital marketing, and merchandise. These areas are within our control to turn around, and we're already taking steps to course correct and drive the top line. I'd like to provide insight into what happened and how we're addressing all 3 areas.
Beginning with loyalty. We have a well-established program with nearly 12 million active customers contributing more than 60% of sales in the first quarter. Last fall, we evolved the program with the introduction of The Nordy Club, which allows customers to earn reward notes faster and provides early access to product and events. However, the execution of our rollout was not as successful as we had planned. As part of our decision to move to a digital-first program, we eliminated paper notes but later discovered that a segment of our customer base relies on receiving these notes by mail. As a result, we saw a reduction in traffic across Full-Price and Off-Price. We are resolving these issues, and our initial results showed improving trends for engagement, traffic and spend from our loyalty customers.
The second factor is related to digital marketing. We deliberately reduced our digital marketing as we shifted resources to loyalty. With The Nordy Club rollout not ramping as we had projected, we experienced incremental traffic declines in our business. We have since increased our investments in digital marketing to drive traffic and sales.
The third factor is merchandise. The breadth of our offering across brands, price points and styles is a key differentiator in serving customers. We have opportunities to rebalance our assortment mix to better resonate with customers in Full-Price and Off-Price. This includes Women's Apparel, which continued to have the toughest results in Full-Price. Beauty was another call out for the quarter given the highly promotional environment and increased out-of-stock levels. It will take some time to adjust our merchandise assortment, but we have already started this process and expect improvement in the second half of the year.
All 3 factors, loyalty, digital marketing and merchandise, contributed to a slowdown in digital sales growth of 7% in the first quarter relative to last year's annual growth of 16%. We're making the changes we believe are necessary to drive our top line as we continue our aggressive focus on expenses, which Anne will discuss in more detail. 
Our strength is our commitment to the customer, and we know we have areas for improvement. Over the years, we have managed through many cycles, which give us confidence in our ability to adjust our business to better serve customers. Our entire leadership team has a high degree of urgency to improve our top line and profitability. Additionally, the team is focused on executing the following 3 key strategies this year. First, our local market strategy enables increased customer engagement through services and greater access to merchandise selection with faster delivery and at a lower cost to us. Last year, we launched in Los Angeles our largest market with 4 full-line stores and 3 Nordstrom Local service hubs. During the first quarter, we continued to see positive outcomes with outsized growth in digital sales and store traffic in this market. In addition, nearly 1/3 of order pickup services are done in our 3 Nordstrom Locals. We're planning to rescale in the L.A. market, including 16 full-line stores by further leveraging inventory through our supply chain investments. 
Moving to our second key strategy. Our market share gains in Los Angeles give us added confidence as we expand our presence in New York City, our largest market for online sales. We are on track to open our flagship on October 24 along with 2 Nordstrom Local hubs this fall. We expect these physical assets to greatly add to our ability to engage with customers across multiple touch points. We know that engaged customers spend more, which is expected to result in a meaningful sales lift for this important market.
With our third strategy, we're focused on improving the customer experience during our 2 key events. Our Anniversary Sale is a unique event, offering brand-new arrivals at reduced prices for a limited time. We're curating our assortment to focus on customers' favorite brands. We're also extending the preshop period for our top loyalty customers. 
For holiday, we're aiming to make Nordstrom more of a gift-giving destination for both new and existing customers. This includes amplifying our gifting assortment across categories and with more accessible price points. 
In closing, we own our result, and we're focused on getting our sales back on track. As always, the customer is at the center of everything we do, and through that lens, we're committed to better serving them on their terms. 
Now Anne will discuss our financial results and outlook."

I'd like to reiterate that we take an immediate action to better serve our customers for our top line and improve profitability. As we continue to focus on making our business more efficient and productive, we're aggressively bending the expense curve and managing our inventory. 
Turning to our top line results. Total company sales were down 3.5% with Full-Price down 5.1% and Off-Price down 0.6%. The drivers of our sales shortfall, loyalty, digital marketing and merchandise, contributed to decelerating trends in our key operating metrics, which includes trips and customer engagement. 
Although we missed our sales expectations by several hundred basis points, we were able to offset roughly half of this miss through our merchandise margins and expense performance. In fact, the sales shortfall in Off-Price was fully offset by the team's ability to control expenses and manage inventory levels down significantly. 
Moving to gross profit. Our rate was down 60 basis points relative to last year due to planned markdowns and occupancy deleverage. We ended the quarter in a solid inventory position with a positive spread of 180 basis points relative to sales. This allows us to be agile in responding to changes in customer expectations. As we continue into the second quarter, we have planned inventory based on current sales trends, and we remain disciplined in our buys as we work to improve our merchandise offering.
From an expense standpoint, our SG&A rate increased 168 basis points relative to last year. This was entirely due to fixed cost deleverage on lower sales. We're making further structural enhancements to our operating model as we implement several efficiency initiatives related to 3 areas: improvements to our store operating model, productivity gains in technology and supply chain and reduced discretionary spend. We expect these initiatives to ramp up over the year, and we're ahead of our plans with $35 million realized in the first quarter. This included operational changes in stores to better align with how customers are shopping. For example, for printing services that have a direct customer impact such as order fulfillment in full-line stores and faster checkout at the Rack. All these initiatives represent permanent reductions in our cost structure, which positions us well for strong EBIT flow-through going forward. 
Another lever of improved profitability is our generational investments. Over the past decade, we've invested early in our digital capabilities and new markets. This is the last year of our generational investment cycle, and we're already seeing returns. These investments are continuing to scale and are expected to deliver top line growth and improved profitability this year.
Our financial position remains strong, enabling us to be flexible in changing business conditions. We have a healthy balance sheet and generating annual operating cash flow of more than $1 billion over the last decade. Our consistent and balanced capital allocation approach enables us to maintain an investment-grade credit rating. We also returned approximately $250 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases during the first quarter. 
Moving to our annual outlook. We revised EPS from a range of $3.65 to $3.90 to a range of $3.25 to $3.65. This incorporates a sales decline of 2% to flat growth for the year relative to our prior outlook of 1% to 2% increase. We expect it's going to take some time to see improvement as we further adjust our merchandise offerings and lap the operational issues from the Nordy Club rollout. 
We anticipate first quarter trends to continue into the second quarter with gradual improvement beginning in the second half of the year. For credit revenue, we're planning for a low to mid-single-digit increase based on our current sales trends.
From a bottom line perspective, we expect an EBIT margin range of 5.3% to 5.8% compared to our prior outlook of 5.9% to 6.1%. From a gross profit and SG&A perspective, the change in our assumptions is driven by greater fixed cost deleverage and lower sales expectations. We expect gross profit at the midpoint of our outlook to be relatively flat to last year. This reflects improved merchandise margins offset by occupancy deleverage. 
For SG&A, we expect moderate deleverage when excluding the estimated credit charge in 2018. We've also incorporated expense savings at the high end of our original range of $150 million to $200 million. These savings are expected to be back half-weighted as we make further progress on our various initiatives. 
For the second quarter, we expect our anniversary event to perform in line with our current sales trends, which has been our historical experience. Our second quarter gross profit rate deleverage is planned similar to Q1 due to lower sales. We also expect SG&A to deleverage but to a lesser extent in Q1 due to further expense savings. 
Specific to Anniversary, we're making changes to improve the overall economics of the event. As a result, we expect extended merchandise margins in the third quarter for better sell-through at the Anniversary product, which should result in lower markdowns. Please also refer to our slides for additional color on our quarterly timing assumptions. 
In closing, we're making hard choices as we focus on better serving customers, driving top line and improving profitability. We know we must demonstrate this commitment with our results in the coming months, and we look forward to updating you on our progress.

Well, first of all, we'll start with the subject we touched on kind of across Full-Price and Off-Price. So good notes, digital marketing certainly affected our Off-Price business as well both in-store and online. We also have merchandise mix issues to get after within Off-Price as well. When you get into the details, Off-Price is a little different than Full-Price. There are some variance department by department. But that mix, and you know us well, that mix is so vital, that mix we have across Off-Price to Full-Price, that mix of price points that we have, the mix of styles. We have a pretty broad range of customers that we look to serve, and our size mix is super important in delivering that. And when we get out of balance, it really affects our top line. So we have those issues in Off-Price. 
The other bucket I'd call out is we did enter the year with a plan to improve our profitability in Off-Price, and part of that plan was eliminating some unprofitable events. Specifically, we reduced the number of flash events that we had on HauteLook. Some of those were not profitable. We reduced our Clear the Racks event in the quarter. And we did eliminate some of the very lowest price points merchandise we had on our Off-Price e-Commerce business. We did get the profitability improvement from those decisions. The effect on top line was greater than we had planned. And we look at that, and we see opportunities to not blow up that strategy but to make some adjustments to it that we can and will help our top line."

But just heading back and looking at the high-level story. So we would expect to see some gradual improvement that really more towards the back half of second half of the year on the top line component to it. New York is a piece of it as far as the tower opening and entering that market with our local market strategy. But really, the pieces that we're seeing coming through in -- on the EBIT side is really getting more benefit out of the expecting initiative we've got with SG&A and continuing to hold the strategy we have on our merch margins, primarily with Anniversary that I talked about in my opening comments, having a higher sell-through should help particularly in Q3. And then as we exit out the year, we would expect to see the flow-through from that as well as the SG&A savings."

There were some issues there that we think will mostly be behind us here pretty quick. We also had a lot of price promotion issues in Beauty, and that caused some problems with it. But I think Beauty has been such a consistently good performer for us over the years if you kind of look at that track record. We expect that, that will get back on track pretty quickly. 
With Women's Apparel, we have some more broad-based issues. A lot of it has to do with the balanced price that Erik talked a little bit about. I think in particular, finding ways to appeal more to young customers kind of in the range of what we do there in Women's Apparel. I think we know what we need to do there. And the good news is that part of the business turns relatively quickly. But I think in terms of really being able to make the changes we feel like we need to make, that's going to take a few months. 
So I think on the whole, Women's Apparel and Beauty is a subset of all. But I think it's fair to say that more broadly, we definitely have an opportunity to be better connected with customers in terms of the relevance that we have to offer, and the balance of price was probably the biggest lever there."

The only change is the fact that you've got market opening up in Q4, which is slightly higher for the second half [indiscernible] top line. 
So when we look at the overall stack, what we're assuming is that it's going to take a few months to get back on track on the assortment side.

But exiting out of the quarter allows us to very agile, and we're active as we start rebalancing these [indiscernible] to get back to what we need to.

Kimberly, so when I talk about the savings that we're going after, we're actually ahead of our plans and we'll be at the higher end of the $200 million we planned that's better than what we shared at the Investor Day last year. Let me put those in 3 broad buckets that we're going after. 
First is productivity, end-to-end productivity primarily, technological and supply chain. So those are the current structural pieces. It takes some time to work through those. But those are some big buckets that we're going after from a productivity perspective. 
The second piece we've already implemented, which is store operating model changes I talked about in my opening comments. And that was a piece -- it actually gets us back in line with what the customer wants but also helps drive the expense efficiency in the stores as well. 
And then I think the smaller bucket I would talk about is the discretionary spend. It's really not that -- it's the smallest component of what we're looking at in the cost savings that we have. And so that's how I would frame that up. Now what I would also say is that we're continuing to look for opportunities to drive more productivity at the end of the business. 
And so you know us. We will continue to invest in doing the right thing for the customer, and we'll continue to invest in this business. But we're also going to look at how we make sure that our expense structure is safe in line with whatever trends we see in our top line."

We have gotten back into the marketing component, which is taking to our SG&A line. So you can see, we're offsetting that. 
And then on the credit side, we have talked about this in the last call, as you recall, that we are anniversary-ing a credit acquisition or customer acquisition event from last year.

We upped the points from 2 points for every dollar spent to 3 points. We added a number of experiences to the program, which are actually resonating really well with the customers. But in having the executional issues around the notes directly affected our digital marketing plan. By investing in loyalty, we moved marketing dollars there and away from retention activation in our digital marketing. So our missteps with the loyalty program exacerbated our issues in digital marketing, and they're certainly connected but again not driven by expense. 
Another thing I'd call out is in our stores, both in Racks and in our full-line stores, we have executed some model changes at our stores, again, not driven mainly by expense. But we've been on this journey for a while of, clearly, our model needs to change. Our business model, which is born in bricks-and-mortar stores, and define what the real stores are. We think we have road to clarity on that. Our stores still that role of having great sales people who are taking care of 1 customer at a time and making some genuine human connections. That's in our DNA. That's continuing -- it has to be important. 
But increasingly, stores play a fulfillment role. There's locations where customers can pick up online orders, and there are locations that we fill online orders from. So we have moved our labor model in our stores to reflect what customers want and need. And there are efficiency opportunities in there. But I wouldn't say that it's been a blunt force of getting after expense cuts. I would say that, that's been done with, boy, is the customers' needs changing, what are they looking for, how can we leverage the physical assets we have in stores and the people in our stores and the inventory in our stores to better serve them on their terms. And that's actually gone really well this quarter."

We started in L.A. last year and really started with engagement. How do we engage with customers by leveraging both our digital and physical assets? And that included experimenting with new physical assets in the Nordstrom Local service hubs. That engagement part across services and across channels, and we know we've got a lot of data on that. We know the more we engage with customers across channels and services, the more they spend. That's gone really, really well. 
The second part of the local market strategy is leveraging the inventory that is close to our customers, either in our stores or in our supply chain facilities. That's -- we're not as deep into that yet. We started being able to leverage the inventory. Started with our 4 core stores in Los Angeles. And a good example would be BOPUS, Buy Online, Pick Up in Store, where we went from the available inventory for BOPUS being one specific store's inventory to connecting the 4 stores and being able to pick it up either at those 4 stores or 1 of the 3 Nordstrom Local service hubs we have. And we talked about it before, the outsized growth we're seeing in BOPUS across our company. The growth in BOPUS in Los Angeles is about 2x that we're seeing elsewhere in the company.
So here is a massive piece of engagement that customers love, that we think we can do in a fairly unique way and really given our customers terms, that drives higher engagement, drives bigger spend. Ultimately, our local market strategy success metric is gaining market share in these markets, and we have seen that in Los Angeles. We're in the midst right now of expanding our local market services from those core 4 stores to all 16 full-line stores in Los Angeles. We are on pace to bring our learnings to New York when we open the tower. We have 2 Nordstrom Local service hubs planned on the island. And we're well positioned to execute that in New York. And our plan is next year to take that to our biggest markets across our portfolio. 
So that is our model. It leads with service engagement across channels and services, and it leads with leveraging inventory to get customers a greater selection to them faster and adds better economics for us. And we think that's the future of our Full-Price business."

32215,613392808,1744902,"Nordstrom, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, May 21, 2019",2019-05-21,"Earnings Calls","Nordstrom, Inc.","Executives","Thank you for joining us today. While we believe our customer strategy and business model position us for long-term success, our first quarter top line results were well below our expectations. We had planned for a continuation of soft sales trends from t",946,"Thank you for joining us today. While we believe our customer strategy and business model position us for long-term success, our first quarter top line results were well below our expectations. We had planned for a continuation of soft sales trends from the fourth quarter but saw further deceleration. Relative to the plans we shared at the beginning of the year, we successfully executed on inventory and expense, which helped mitigate our sales mix. We ended the quarter with inventories in solid shape, and our financial position remains strong. We're confident in our leadership team's ability to better serve customers on their terms and remain focused on achieving profitable growth.
During the first quarter, we had some executional misses with the customer experience that had an impact on sales across Full-Price and Off-Price both in stores and online. We know we disappointed our customers, and we own it. We have identified 3 factors that contributed to this sales miss: loyalty, digital marketing and merchandise. These areas are within our control to turn around, and we're already taking steps to course correct and drive the top line. I'd like to provide insight into what happened and how we're addressing all 3 areas.
Beginning with loyalty. We have a well-established program with nearly 12 million active customers contributing more than 60% of sales in the first quarter. Last fall, we evolved the program with the introduction of The Nordy Club, which allows customers to earn reward notes faster and provides early access to product and events. However, the execution of our rollout was not as successful as we had planned. As part of our decision to move to a digital-first program, we eliminated paper notes but later discovered that a segment of our customer base relies on receiving these notes by mail. As a result, we saw a reduction in traffic across Full-Price and Off-Price. We are resolving these issues, and our initial results showed improving trends for engagement, traffic and spend from our loyalty customers.
The second factor is related to digital marketing. We deliberately reduced our digital marketing as we shifted resources to loyalty. With The Nordy Club rollout not ramping as we had projected, we experienced incremental traffic declines in our business. We have since increased our investments in digital marketing to drive traffic and sales.
The third factor is merchandise. The breadth of our offering across brands, price points and styles is a key differentiator in serving customers. We have opportunities to rebalance our assortment mix to better resonate with customers in Full-Price and Off-Price. This includes Women's Apparel, which continued to have the toughest results in Full-Price. Beauty was another call out for the quarter given the highly promotional environment and increased out-of-stock levels. It will take some time to adjust our merchandise assortment, but we have already started this process and expect improvement in the second half of the year.
All 3 factors, loyalty, digital marketing and merchandise, contributed to a slowdown in digital sales growth of 7% in the first quarter relative to last year's annual growth of 16%. We're making the changes we believe are necessary to drive our top line as we continue our aggressive focus on expenses, which Anne will discuss in more detail. 
Our strength is our commitment to the customer, and we know we have areas for improvement. Over the years, we have managed through many cycles, which give us confidence in our ability to adjust our business to better serve customers. Our entire leadership team has a high degree of urgency to improve our top line and profitability. Additionally, the team is focused on executing the following 3 key strategies this year. First, our local market strategy enables increased customer engagement through services and greater access to merchandise selection with faster delivery and at a lower cost to us. Last year, we launched in Los Angeles our largest market with 4 full-line stores and 3 Nordstrom Local service hubs. During the first quarter, we continued to see positive outcomes with outsized growth in digital sales and store traffic in this market. In addition, nearly 1/3 of order pickup services are done in our 3 Nordstrom Locals. We're planning to rescale in the L.A. market, including 16 full-line stores by further leveraging inventory through our supply chain investments. 
Moving to our second key strategy. Our market share gains in Los Angeles give us added confidence as we expand our presence in New York City, our largest market for online sales. We are on track to open our flagship on October 24 along with 2 Nordstrom Local hubs this fall. We expect these physical assets to greatly add to our ability to engage with customers across multiple touch points. We know that engaged customers spend more, which is expected to result in a meaningful sales lift for this important market.
With our third strategy, we're focused on improving the customer experience during our 2 key events. Our Anniversary Sale is a unique event, offering brand-new arrivals at reduced prices for a limited time. We're curating our assortment to focus on our customers' favorite brands. We're also extending the preshop period for our top loyalty customers. 
For holiday, we're aiming to make Nordstrom more of a gift-giving destination for both new and existing customers. This includes amplifying our gifting assortment across categories and with more accessible price points. 
In closing, we own our results, and we're focused on getting our sales back on track. As always, the customer is at the center of everything we do, and through that lens, we're committed to better serving them on their terms. 
Now Anne will discuss our financial results and outlook."

I'd like to reiterate that we take an immediate action to better serve our customers for our top line and improve profitability. As we continue to focus on making our business more efficient and productive, we're aggressively bending the expense curve and managing our inventory. 
Turning to our top line results. Total company sales were down 3.5% with Full-Price down 5.1% and Off-Price down 0.6%. The drivers of our sales shortfall, loyalty, digital marketing and merchandise, contributed to decelerating trends in our key operating metrics, which includes trips and customer engagement. 
Although we missed our sales expectations by several hundred basis points, we were able to offset roughly half of this miss through our merchandise margins and expense performance. In fact, the sales shortfall in Off-Price was fully offset by the team's ability to control expenses and manage inventory levels down significantly. 
Moving to gross profit. Our rate was down 60 basis points relative to last year due to planned markdowns and occupancy deleverage. We ended the quarter in a solid inventory position with a positive spread of 180 basis points relative to sales. This allows us to be agile in responding to changes in customer expectations. As we continue into the second quarter, we have planned inventory based on current sales trends, and we remain disciplined in our buys as we work to improve our merchandise offering.
From an expense standpoint, our SG&A rate increased 168 basis points relative to last year. This was entirely due to fixed cost deleverage on lower sales. We're making further structural enhancements to our operating model as we implement several efficiency initiatives related to 3 areas: improvements to our store operating model, productivity gains in technology and supply chain and reduced discretionary spend. We expect these initiatives to ramp up over the year, and we're ahead of our plans with $35 million realized in the first quarter. This included operational changes in stores to better align with how customers are shopping. For example, for printing services that have a direct customer impact such as order fulfillment in full-line stores and faster checkout at the Rack. All these initiatives represent permanent reductions in our cost structure, which positions us well for strong EBIT flow-through going forward. 
Another lever of improved profitability is our generational investments. Over the past decade, we've invested early in our digital capabilities and new markets. This is the last year of our generational investment cycle, and we're already seeing returns. These investments are continuing to scale and are expected to deliver top line growth and improved profitability this year.
Our financial position remains strong, enabling us to be flexible in changing business conditions. We have a healthy balance sheet and generating annual operating cash flow of more than $1 billion over the last decade. Our consistent and balanced capital allocation approach enables us to maintain an investment-grade credit rating. We also returned approximately $250 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases during the first quarter. 
Moving to our annual outlook. We revised EPS from a range of $3.65 to $3.90 to a range of $3.25 to $3.65. This incorporates a sales decline of 2% to flat growth for the year relative to our prior outlook of 1% to 2% increase. We expect it's going to take some time to see improvement as we further adjust our merchandise offerings and lap the operational issues from the Nordy Club rollout. 
We anticipate first quarter trends to continue into the second quarter with gradual improvement beginning in the second half of the year. For credit revenue, we're planning for a low to mid-single-digit increase based on our current sales trends.
From a bottom line perspective, we expect an EBIT margin range of 5.3% to 5.8% compared to our prior outlook of 5.9% to 6.1%. From a gross profit and SG&A perspective, the change in our assumptions is driven by greater fixed cost deleverage and lower sales expectations. We expect gross profit at the midpoint of our outlook to be relatively flat to last year. This reflects improved merchandise margins offset by occupancy deleverage. 
For SG&A, we expect moderate deleverage when excluding the estimated credit charge in 2018. We've also incorporated expense savings at the high end of our original range of $150 million to $200 million. These savings are expected to be back half-weighted as we make further progress on our various initiatives. 
For the second quarter, we expect our anniversary event to perform in line with our current sales trends, which has been our historical experience. Our second quarter gross profit rate deleverage is planned similar to Q1 due to lower sales. We also expect SG&A to deleverage but to a lesser extent in Q1 due to further expense savings. 
Specific to Anniversary, we're making changes to improve the overall economics of the event. As a result, we expect extended merchandise margins in the third quarter for better sell-through at the Anniversary product, which should result in lower markdowns. Please also refer to our slides for additional color on our quarterly timing assumptions. 
In closing, we're making hard choices as we focus on better serving customers, driving top line and improving profitability. We know we must demonstrate this commitment with our results in the coming months, and we look forward to updating you on our progress.

Well, first of all, we'll start with the subject we touched on kind of across Full-Price and Off-Price. So good notes, digital marketing certainly affected our Off-Price business as well both in-store and online. We also have merchandise mix issues to get after within Off-Price as well. When you get into the details, Off-Price is a little different than Full-Price. There are some variance department by department. But that mix, and you know as well, that mix is so vital, that mix we have across Off-Price to Full-Price, that mix of price points that we have, the mix of styles. We have a pretty broad range of customers that we look to serve, and our size mix is super important in delivering that. And when we get out of balance, it really affects our top line. So we have those issues in Off-Price. 
The other bucket I'd call out is we did enter the year with a plan to improve our profitability in Off-Price, and part of that plan was eliminating some unprofitable events. Specifically, we reduced the number of flash events that we had on HauteLook. Some of those were not profitable. We reduced our Clear the Racks event in the quarter. And we did eliminate some of the very lowest price points merchandise we had on our Off-Price e-Commerce business. We did get the profitability improvement from those decisions. The effect on the top line was greater than we had planned. And we look at that, and we see opportunities to not blow up that strategy but to make some adjustments to it that we think can and will help our top line."

So we can talk a little bit about the growth profit levers that we were pulling there. We're proceeding on those and we're getting the terms that we need but we're also accelerating the expense savings specifically on that, making structural changes on that. 
So the good news is, is once we get the top line back on course, the flow-through should actually be greater than what we had signaled in the Investor Day.

New York is a piece of it as far as the tower opening and entering that market with our local market strategy. But really, the pieces that we're seeing coming through in -- on the EBIT side is really getting more benefit out of the expecting initiative we've got with SG&A and continuing to hold the strategy we have on our merch margins, primarily with Anniversary that I talked about in my opening comments, having a higher sell-through should help particularly in Q3.

But I think Beauty has been such a consistently good performer for us over the years if you kind of look at that track record. We expect that, that will get back on track pretty quickly. 
With Women's Apparel, we have some more broad-based issues. A lot of it has to do with the balanced price that Erik talked a little bit about. I think in particular, finding ways to appeal more to young customers kind of in the range of what we do there in Women's Apparel. I think we know what we need to do there. And the good news is that part of the business turns relatively quickly. But I think in terms of really being able to make the changes we feel like we need to make, that's going to take a few months. 
So I think on the whole, Women's Apparel and Beauty is a subset of all. But I think it's fair to say that more broadly, we definitely have an opportunity to be better connected with customers in terms of the relevance that we have to offer, and the balance of price was probably the biggest lever there."

So when we look at the overall stack, what we're assuming is that it's going to take a few months to get back on track on the assortment side.

Kimberly, so when I talk about the savings that we're going after, we're actually ahead of our plans and we'll be at the higher end of the $200 million we planned that's better than what we shared at the Investor Day last year. Let me put those in 3",266,"Yes. Kimberly, so when I talk about the savings that we're going after, we're actually ahead of our plans and we'll be at the higher end of the $200 million we planned that's better than what we shared at the Investor Day last year. Let me put those in 3 broad buckets that we're going after. 
First is productivity, end-to-end productivity primarily, technological and supply chain. So those are the current structural pieces. It takes some time to work through those. But those are some big buckets that we're going after from a productivity perspective. 
The second piece we've already implemented, which was store operating model changes I talked about in my opening comments. And that was a piece -- it actually gets us back in line with what the customer wants but also helps drive the expense efficiency in the stores as well. 
And then I think the smaller bucket I would talk about is the discretionary spend. It's really not that -- it's the smallest component of what we're looking at in the cost savings that we have. And so that's how I would frame that up. Now what I would also say is that we're continuing to look for opportunities to drive more productivity at the end of the business. 
And so you know us. We will continue to invest in doing the right thing for the customer, and we'll continue to invest in this business. But we're also going to look at how we make sure that our expense structure stays in line with whatever trends we see in our top line."

We upped the points from 2 points for every dollar spent to 3 points. We added a number of experiences to the program, which are actually resonating really well with customers. But in having the executional issues around the notes directly affected our digital marketing plan. By investing in loyalty, we moved marketing dollars there and away from retention activation in our digital marketing. So our missteps with the loyalty program exacerbated our issues in digital marketing, and they're certainly connected but again not driven by expense. 
Another thing I'd call out is in our stores, both in Racks and in our full-line stores, we have executed some model changes at our stores, again, not driven mainly by expense. But we've been on this journey for a while of, clearly, our model needs to change. Our business model, of which is born in bricks-and-mortar stores, and define what the real stores are. We think we have real good clarity on that. Our stores still that role of having great sales people who are taking care of 1 customer at a time and making some genuine human connections. That's in our DNA. That's continuing -- it has to be important. 
But increasingly, stores play a fulfillment role. There's locations where customers can pick up online orders, and there are locations that we fill online orders from. So we have moved our labor model in our stores to reflect what customers want and need. And there are efficiency opportunities in there. But I wouldn't say that it's been a blunt force of getting after expense cuts. I would say that, that's been done with, boy, how is the customer's needs changing, what are they looking for, how can we leverage the physical assets we have in stores and the people in our stores and the inventory in our stores to better serve them on their terms. And that's actually gone really well this quarter."

We started in L.A. last year and really started with engagement. How do we engage with customers by leveraging both our digital and physical assets? And that included experimenting with new physical assets in the Nordstrom Local service hubs. That engagement part across services and across channels, and we know we've got a lot of data on that. We know the more we engage with customers across channels and services, the more they spend. That's gone really, really well. 
The second part of the local market strategy is leveraging the inventory that is close to our customers, either in our stores or in our supply chain facilities. That's -- we're not as deep into that yet. We started being able to leverage the inventory. Started with our 4 core stores in Los Angeles. And a good example would be BOPUS, Buy Online, Pick Up in Store, where we went from the available inventory for BOPUS being one specific store's inventory to connecting the 4 stores and being able to pick it up either at those 4 stores or 1 of the 3 Nordstrom Local service hubs we have. And we've talked about it before, the outsized growth we're seeing in BOPUS across our company. The growth in BOPUS in Los Angeles is about 2x that we're seeing elsewhere in the company.
So here is a massive piece of engagement that customers love, that we think we can do in a fairly unique way and really given our customers terms, that drives higher engagement, drives bigger spend. Ultimately, our local market strategy success metric is gaining market share in these markets, and we have seen that in Los Angeles. We're in the midst right now of expanding our local market services from those core 4 stores to all 16 full-line stores in Los Angeles. We are on pace to bring our learnings to New York when we open the tower. We have 2 Nordstrom Local service hubs planned on the island. And we're well positioned to execute that in New York. And then our plan is next year to take that to our biggest markets across our portfolio. 
So that is our model. It leads with service engagement across channels and services, and it leads with leveraging inventory to get customers a greater selection to them faster and adds better economics for us. And we think that's the future of our Full-Price business."

While we believe our customer strategy and business model position us for long-term success, our first quarter top line results were well below our expectations. We had planned for a continuation of soft sales trends from the fourth quarter but saw further deceleration. Relative to the plans we shared at the beginning of the year, we successfully executed on inventory and expense, which helped mitigate our sales mix. We ended the quarter with inventories in solid shape, and our financial position remains strong. We're confident in our leadership team's ability to better serve customers on their terms and remain focused on achieving profitable growth.
During the first quarter, we had some executional misses with the customer experience that had an impact on sales across Full-Price and Off-Price both in stores and online. We know we disappointed our customers, and we own it. We have identified 3 factors that contributed to this sales miss: loyalty, digital marketing and merchandise. These areas are within our control to turn around, and we're already taking steps to course correct and drive the top line. I'd like to provide insight into what happened and how we're addressing all 3 areas.
Beginning with loyalty. We have a well-established program with nearly 12 million active customers contributing more than 60% of sales in the first quarter. Last fall, we evolved the program with the introduction of The Nordy Club, which allows customers to earn reward notes faster and provides early access to product and events. However, the execution of our rollout was not as successful as we had planned. As part of our decision to move to a digital-first program, we eliminated paper notes but later discovered that a segment of our customer base relies on receiving these notes by mail. As a result, we saw a reduction in traffic across Full-Price and Off-Price. We are resolving these issues, and our initial results showed improving trends for engagement, traffic and spend from our loyalty customers.
The second factor is related to digital marketing. We deliberately reduced our digital marketing as we shifted resources to loyalty. With The Nordy Club rollout not ramping as we had projected, we experienced incremental traffic declines in our business. We have since increased our investments in digital marketing to drive traffic and sales.
The third factor is merchandise. The breadth of our offering across brands, price points and styles is a key differentiator in serving customers. We have opportunities to rebalance our assortment mix to better resonate with customers in Full-Price and Off-Price. This includes Women's Apparel, which continued to have the toughest results in Full-Price. Beauty was another call out for the quarter given the highly promotional environment and increased out-of-stock levels. It will take some time to adjust our merchandise assortment, but we have already started this process and expect improvement in the second half of the year.
All 3 factors, loyalty, digital marketing and merchandise, contributed to a slowdown in digital sales growth of 7% in the first quarter relative to last year's annual growth of 16%. We're making the changes we believe are necessary to drive our top line as we continue our aggressive focus on expenses, which Anne will discuss in more detail. 
Our strength is our commitment to the customer, and we know we have areas for improvement. Over the years, we have managed through many cycles, which give us confidence in our ability to adjust our business to better serve customers. Our entire leadership team has a high degree of urgency to improve our top line and profitability. Additionally, the team is focused on executing the following 3 key strategies this year. First, our local market strategy enables increased customer engagement through services and greater access to merchandise selection with faster delivery and at a lower cost to us. Last year, we launched in Los Angeles our largest market with 4 full-line stores and 3 Nordstrom Local service hubs. During the first quarter, we continued to see positive outcomes with outsized growth in digital sales and store traffic in this market. In addition, nearly 1/3 of order pickup services are done in our 3 Nordstrom Locals. We're planning to rescale in the L.A. market, including 16 full-line stores by further leveraging inventory through our supply chain investments. 
Moving to our second key strategy. Our market share gains in Los Angeles give us added confidence as we expand our presence in New York City, our largest market for online sales. We are on track to open our flagship on October 24 along with 2 Nordstrom Local hubs this fall. We expect these physical assets to greatly add to our ability to engage with customers across multiple touch points. We know that engaged customers spend more, which is expected to result in a meaningful sales lift for this important market.
With our third strategy, we're focused on improving the customer experience during our 2 key events. Our Anniversary Sale is a unique event, offering brand-new arrivals at reduced prices for a limited time. We're curating our assortment to focus on our customers' favorite brands. We're also extending the preshop period for our top loyalty customers. 
For holiday, we're aiming to make Nordstrom more of a gift-giving destination for both new and existing customers. This includes amplifying our gifting assortment across categories and with more accessible price points. 
In closing, we own our results, and we're focused on getting our sales back on track. As always, the customer is at the center of everything we do, and through that lens, we're committed to better serving them on their terms. 
Now Anne will discuss our financial results and outlook."

I'd like to reiterate that we take an immediate action to better serve our customers for our top line and improve profitability. As we continue to focus on making our business more efficient and productive, we're aggressively bending the expense curve and managing our inventory. 
Turning to our top line results. Total company sales were down 3.5% with Full-Price down 5.1% and Off-Price down 0.6%. The drivers of our sales shortfall, loyalty, digital marketing and merchandise, contributed to decelerating trends in our key operating metrics, which includes trips and customer engagement. 
Although we missed our sales expectations by several hundred basis points, we were able to offset roughly half of this miss through our merchandise margins and expense performance. In fact, the sales shortfall in Off-Price was fully offset by the team's ability to control expenses and manage inventory levels down significantly. 
Moving to gross profit. Our rate was down 60 basis points relative to last year due to planned markdowns and occupancy deleverage. We ended the quarter in a solid inventory position with a positive spread of 180 basis points relative to sales. This allows us to be agile in responding to changes in customer expectations. As we continue into the second quarter, we have planned inventory based on current sales trends, and we remain disciplined in our buys as we work to improve our merchandise offering.
From an expense standpoint, our SG&A rate increased 168 basis points relative to last year. This was entirely due to fixed cost deleverage on lower sales. We're making further structural enhancements to our operating model as we implement several efficiency initiatives related to 3 areas: improvements to our store operating model, productivity gains in technology and supply chain and reduced discretionary spend. We expect these initiatives to ramp up over the year, and we're ahead of our plans with $35 million realized in the first quarter. This included operational changes in stores to better align with how customers are shopping. For example, for printing services that have a direct customer impact such as order fulfillment in full-line stores and faster checkout at the Rack. All these initiatives represent permanent reductions in our cost structure, which positions us well for strong EBIT flow-through going forward. 
Another lever of improved profitability is our generational investments. Over the past decade, we've invested early in our digital capabilities and new markets. This is the last year of our generational investment cycle, and we're already seeing returns. These investments are continuing to scale and are expected to deliver top line growth and improved profitability this year.
Our financial position remains strong, enabling us to be flexible in changing business conditions. We have a healthy balance sheet and generating annual operating cash flow of more than $1 billion over the last decade. Our consistent and balanced capital allocation approach enables us to maintain an investment-grade credit rating. We also returned approximately $250 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases during the first quarter. 
Moving to our annual outlook. We revised EPS from a range of $3.65 to $3.90 to a range of $3.25 to $3.65. This incorporates a sales decline of 2% to flat growth for the year relative to our prior outlook of 1% to 2% increase. We expect it's going to take some time to see improvement as we further adjust our merchandise offerings and lap the operational issues from the Nordy Club rollout. 
We anticipate first quarter trends to continue into the second quarter with gradual improvement beginning in the second half of the year. For credit revenue, we're planning for a low to mid-single-digit increase based on our current sales trends.
From a bottom line perspective, we expect an EBIT margin range of 5.3% to 5.8% compared to our prior outlook of 5.9% to 6.1%. From a gross profit and SG&A perspective, the change in our assumptions is driven by greater fixed cost deleverage and lower sales expectations. We expect gross profit at the midpoint of our outlook to be relatively flat to last year. This reflects improved merchandise margins offset by occupancy deleverage. 
For SG&A, we expect moderate deleverage when excluding the estimated credit charge in 2018. We've also incorporated expense savings at the high end of our original range of $150 million to $200 million. These savings are expected to be back half-weighted as we make further progress on our various initiatives. 
For the second quarter, we expect our anniversary event to perform in line with our current sales trends, which has been our historical experience. Our second quarter gross profit rate deleverage is planned similar to Q1 due to lower sales. We also expect SG&A to deleverage but to a lesser extent in Q1 due to further expense savings. 
Specific to Anniversary, we're making changes to improve the overall economics of the event. As a result, we expect extended merchandise margins in the third quarter for better sell-through at the Anniversary product, which should result in lower markdowns. Please also refer to our slides for additional color on our quarterly timing assumptions. 
In closing, we're making hard choices as we focus on better serving customers, driving top line and improving profitability. We know we must demonstrate this commitment with our results in the coming months, and we look forward to updating you on our progress.

Well, first of all, we'll start with the subject we touched on kind of across Full-Price and Off-Price. So good notes, digital marketing certainly affected our Off-Price business as well both in-store and online. We also have merchandise mix issues to get after within Off-Price as well. When you get into the details, Off-Price is a little different than Full-Price. There are some variance department by department. But that mix, and you know as well, that mix is so vital, that mix we have across Off-Price to Full-Price, that mix of price points that we have, the mix of styles. We have a pretty broad range of customers that we look to serve, and our size mix is super important in delivering that. And when we get out of balance, it really affects our top line. So we have those issues in Off-Price. 
The other bucket I'd call out is we did enter the year with a plan to improve our profitability in Off-Price, and part of that plan was eliminating some unprofitable events. Specifically, we reduced the number of flash events that we had on HauteLook. Some of those were not profitable. We reduced our Clear the Racks event in the quarter. And we did eliminate some of the very lowest price points merchandise we had on our Off-Price e-Commerce business. We did get the profitability improvement from those decisions. The effect on the top line was greater than we had planned. And we look at that, and we see opportunities to not blow up that strategy but to make some adjustments to it that we think can and will help our top line."

New York is a piece of it as far as the tower opening and entering that market with our local market strategy. But really, the pieces that we're seeing coming through in -- on the EBIT side is really getting more benefit out of the expecting initiative we've got with SG&A and continuing to hold the strategy we have on our merch margins, primarily with Anniversary that I talked about in my opening comments, having a higher sell-through should help particularly in Q3.

But I think Beauty has been such a consistently good performer for us over the years if you kind of look at that track record. We expect that, that will get back on track pretty quickly. 
With Women's Apparel, we have some more broad-based issues. A lot of it has to do with the balanced price that Erik talked a little bit about. I think in particular, finding ways to appeal more to young customers kind of in the range of what we do there in Women's Apparel. I think we know what we need to do there. And the good news is that part of the business turns relatively quickly. But I think in terms of really being able to make the changes we feel like we need to make, that's going to take a few months. 
So I think on the whole, Women's Apparel and Beauty is a subset of all. But I think it's fair to say that more broadly, we definitely have an opportunity to be better connected with customers in terms of the relevance that we have to offer, and the balance of price was probably the biggest lever there."

So when we look at the overall stack, what we're assuming is that it's going to take a few months to get back on track on the assortment side.

First is productivity, end-to-end productivity primarily, technological and supply chain. So those are the current structural pieces. It takes some time to work through those. But those are some big buckets that we're going after from a productivity perspective. 
The second piece we've already implemented, which was store operating model changes I talked about in my opening comments. And that was a piece -- it actually gets us back in line with what the customer wants but also helps drive the expense efficiency in the stores as well. 
And then I think the smaller bucket I would talk about is the discretionary spend. It's really not that -- it's the smallest component of what we're looking at in the cost savings that we have. And so that's how I would frame that up. Now what I would also say is that we're continuing to look for opportunities to drive more productivity at the end of the business. 
And so you know us. We will continue to invest in doing the right thing for the customer, and we'll continue to invest in this business. But we're also going to look at how we make sure that our expense structure stays in line with whatever trends we see in our top line."

We have gotten back into the marketing component, which is taking to our SG&A line. So you can see, we're offsetting that. 
And then on the credit side, we had talked about this in the last call, as you recall, that we are anniversary-ing a credit acquisition or customer acquisition event from last year.

We upped the points from 2 points for every dollar spent to 3 points. We added a number of experiences to the program, which are actually resonating really well with customers. But in having the executional issues around the notes directly affected our digital marketing plan. By investing in loyalty, we moved marketing dollars there and away from retention activation in our digital marketing. So our missteps with the loyalty program exacerbated our issues in digital marketing, and they're certainly connected but again not driven by expense. 
Another thing I'd call out is in our stores, both in Racks and in our full-line stores, we have executed some model changes at our stores, again, not driven mainly by expense. But we've been on this journey for a while of, clearly, our model needs to change. Our business model, of which is born in bricks-and-mortar stores, and define what the real stores are. We think we have real good clarity on that. Our stores still that role of having great sales people who are taking care of 1 customer at a time and making some genuine human connections. That's in our DNA. That's continuing -- it has to be important. 
But increasingly, stores play a fulfillment role. There's locations where customers can pick up online orders, and there are locations that we fill online orders from. So we have moved our labor model in our stores to reflect what customers want and need. And there are efficiency opportunities in there. But I wouldn't say that it's been a blunt force of getting after expense cuts. I would say that, that's been done with, boy, how is the customer's needs changing, what are they looking for, how can we leverage the physical assets we have in stores and the people in our stores and the inventory in our stores to better serve them on their terms.

We started in L.A. last year and really started with engagement. How do we engage with customers by leveraging both our digital and physical assets? And that included experimenting with new physical assets in the Nordstrom Local service hubs. That engagement part across services and across channels, and we know we've got a lot of data on that. We know the more we engage with customers across channels and services, the more they spend. That's gone really, really well. 
The second part of the local market strategy is leveraging the inventory that is close to our customers, either in our stores or in our supply chain facilities. That's -- we're not as deep into that yet. We started being able to leverage the inventory. Started with our 4 core stores in Los Angeles. And a good example would be BOPUS, Buy Online, Pick Up in Store, where we went from the available inventory for BOPUS being one specific store's inventory to connecting the 4 stores and being able to pick it up either at those 4 stores or 1 of the 3 Nordstrom Local service hubs we have. And we've talked about it before, the outsized growth we're seeing in BOPUS across our company. The growth in BOPUS in Los Angeles is about 2x that we're seeing elsewhere in the company.
So here is a massive piece of engagement that customers love, that we think we can do in a fairly unique way and really given our customers terms, that drives higher engagement, drives bigger spend. Ultimately, our local market strategy success metric is gaining market share in these markets, and we have seen that in Los Angeles. We're in the midst right now of expanding our local market services from those core 4 stores to all 16 full-line stores in Los Angeles. We are on pace to bring our learnings to New York when we open the tower. We have 2 Nordstrom Local service hubs planned on the island. And we're well positioned to execute that in New York. And then our plan is next year to take that to our biggest markets across our portfolio. 
So that is our model. It leads with service engagement across channels and services, and it leads with leveraging inventory to get customers a greater selection to them faster and adds better economics for us. And we think that's the future of our Full-Price business."

While we believe our customer strategy and business model position us for long-term success, our first quarter top line results were well below our expectations. We had planned for a continuation of soft sales trends from the fourth quarter but saw further deceleration. Relative to the plans we shared at the beginning of the year, we successfully executed on inventory and expense, which helped mitigate our sales mix. We ended the quarter with inventories in solid shape, and our financial position remains strong. We're confident in our leadership team's ability to better serve customers on their terms and remain focused on achieving profitable growth.
During the first quarter, we had some executional misses with the customer experience that had an impact on sales across Full-Price and Off-Price both in stores and online. We know we disappointed our customers, and we own it. We have identified 3 factors that contributed to this sales miss: loyalty, digital marketing and merchandise. These areas are within our control to turn around, and we're already taking steps to course correct and drive the top line. I'd like to provide insight into what happened and how we're addressing all 3 areas.
Beginning with loyalty. We have a well-established program with nearly 12 million active customers contributing more than 60% of sales in the first quarter. Last fall, we evolved the program with the introduction of The Nordy Club, which allows customers to earn reward notes faster and provides early access to product and events. However, the execution of our rollout was not as successful as we had planned. As part of our decision to move to a digital-first program, we eliminated paper notes but later discovered that a segment of our customer base relies on receiving these notes by mail. As a result, we saw a reduction in traffic across Full-Price and Off-Price. We are resolving these issues, and our initial results showed improving trends for engagement, traffic and spend from our loyalty customers.
The second factor is related to digital marketing. We deliberately reduced our digital marketing as we shifted resources to loyalty. With The Nordy Club rollout not ramping as we had projected, we experienced incremental traffic declines in our business. We have since increased our investments in digital marketing to drive traffic and sales.
The third factor is merchandise. The breadth of our offering across brands, price points and styles is a key differentiator in serving customers. We have opportunities to rebalance our assortment mix to better resonate with customers in Full-Price and Off-Price. This includes Women's Apparel, which continued to have the toughest results in Full-Price. Beauty was another call out for the quarter given the highly promotional environment and increased out-of-stock levels. It will take some time to adjust our merchandise assortment, but we have already started this process and expect improvement in the second half of the year.
All 3 factors, loyalty, digital marketing and merchandise, contributed to a slowdown in digital sales growth of 7% in the first quarter relative to last year's annual growth of 16%. We're making the changes we believe are necessary to drive our top line as we continue our aggressive focus on expenses, which Anne will discuss in more detail. 
Our strength is our commitment to the customer, and we know we have areas for improvement. Over the years, we have managed through many cycles, which give us confidence in our ability to adjust our business to better serve customers. Our entire leadership team has a high degree of urgency to improve our top line and profitability. Additionally, the team is focused on executing the following 3 key strategies this year. First, our local market strategy enables increased customer engagement through services and greater access to merchandise selection with faster delivery and at a lower cost to us. Last year, we launched in Los Angeles our largest market with 4 full-line stores and 3 Nordstrom Local service hubs. During the first quarter, we continued to see positive outcomes with outsized growth in digital sales and store traffic in this market. In addition, nearly 1/3 of order pickup services are done in our 3 Nordstrom Locals. We're planning to rescale in the L.A. market, including 16 full-line stores by further leveraging inventory through our supply chain investments. 
Moving to our second key strategy. Our market share gains in Los Angeles give us added confidence as we expand our presence in New York City, our largest market for online sales. We are on track to open our flagship on October 24 along with 2 Nordstrom Local hubs this fall. We expect these physical assets to greatly add to our ability to engage with customers across multiple touch points. We know that engaged customers spend more, which is expected to result in a meaningful sales lift for this important market.
With our third strategy, we're focused on improving the customer experience during our 2 key events. Our Anniversary Sale is a unique event, offering brand-new arrivals at reduced prices for a limited time. We're curating our assortment to focus on our customers' favorite brands. We're also extending the preshop period for our top loyalty customers. 
For holiday, we're aiming to make Nordstrom more of a gift-giving destination for both new and existing customers. This includes amplifying our gifting assortment across categories and with more accessible price points. 
In closing, we own our results, and we're focused on getting our sales back on track. As always, the customer is at the center of everything we do, and through that lens, we're committed to better serving them on their terms. 
Now Anne will discuss our financial results and outlook."

I'd like to reiterate that we take an immediate action to better serve our customers for our top line and improve profitability. As we continue to focus on making our business more efficient and productive, we're aggressively bending the expense curve and managing our inventory. 
Turning to our top line results. Total company sales were down 3.5% with Full-Price down 5.1% and Off-Price down 0.6%. The drivers of our sales shortfall, loyalty, digital marketing and merchandise, contributed to decelerating trends in our key operating metrics, which includes trips and customer engagement. 
Although we missed our sales expectations by several hundred basis points, we were able to offset roughly half of this miss through our merchandise margins and expense performance. In fact, the sales shortfall in Off-Price was fully offset by the team's ability to control expenses and manage inventory levels down significantly. 
Moving to gross profit. Our rate was down 60 basis points relative to last year due to planned markdowns and occupancy deleverage. We ended the quarter in a solid inventory position with a positive spread of 180 basis points relative to sales. This allows us to be agile in responding to changes in customer expectations. As we continue into the second quarter, we have planned inventory based on current sales trends, and we remain disciplined in our buys as we work to improve our merchandise offering.
From an expense standpoint, our SG&A rate increased 168 basis points relative to last year. This was entirely due to fixed cost deleverage on lower sales. We're making further structural enhancements to our operating model as we implement several efficiency initiatives related to 3 areas: improvements to our store operating model, productivity gains in technology and supply chain and reduced discretionary spend. We expect these initiatives to ramp up over the year, and we're ahead of our plans with $35 million realized in the first quarter. This included operational changes in stores to better align with how customers are shopping. For example, for printing services that have a direct customer impact such as order fulfillment in full-line stores and faster checkout at the Rack. All these initiatives represent permanent reductions in our cost structure, which positions us well for strong EBIT flow-through going forward. 
Another lever of improved profitability is our generational investments. Over the past decade, we've invested early in our digital capabilities and new markets. This is the last year of our generational investment cycle, and we're already seeing returns. These investments are continuing to scale and are expected to deliver top line growth and improved profitability this year.
Our financial position remains strong, enabling us to be flexible in changing business conditions. We have a healthy balance sheet and generating annual operating cash flow of more than $1 billion over the last decade. Our consistent and balanced capital allocation approach enables us to maintain an investment-grade credit rating. We also returned approximately $250 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases during the first quarter. 
Moving to our annual outlook. We revised EPS from a range of $3.65 to $3.90 to a range of $3.25 to $3.65. This incorporates a sales decline of 2% to flat growth for the year relative to our prior outlook of 1% to 2% increase. We expect it's going to take some time to see improvement as we further adjust our merchandise offerings and lap the operational issues from the Nordy Club rollout. 
We anticipate first quarter trends to continue into the second quarter with gradual improvement beginning in the second half of the year. For credit revenue, we're planning for a low to mid-single-digit increase based on our current sales trends.
From a bottom line perspective, we expect an EBIT margin range of 5.3% to 5.8% compared to our prior outlook of 5.9% to 6.1%. From a gross profit and SG&A perspective, the change in our assumptions is driven by greater fixed cost deleverage and lower sales expectations. We expect gross profit at the midpoint of our outlook to be relatively flat to last year. This reflects improved merchandise margins offset by occupancy deleverage. 
For SG&A, we expect moderate deleverage when excluding the estimated credit charge in 2018. We've also incorporated expense savings at the high end of our original range of $150 million to $200 million. These savings are expected to be back half-weighted as we make further progress on our various initiatives. 
For the second quarter, we expect our anniversary event to perform in line with our current sales trends, which has been our historical experience. Our second quarter gross profit rate deleverage is planned similar to Q1 due to lower sales. We also expect SG&A to deleverage but to a lesser extent in Q1 due to further expense savings. 
Specific to Anniversary, we're making changes to improve the overall economics of the event. As a result, we expect extended merchandise margins in the third quarter for better sell-through at the Anniversary product, which should result in lower markdowns. Please also refer to our slides for additional color on our quarterly timing assumptions. 
In closing, we're making hard choices as we focus on better serving customers, driving top line and improving profitability. We know we must demonstrate this commitment with our results in the coming months, and we look forward to updating you on our progress.

Well, first of all, we'll start with the subject we touched on kind of across Full-Price and Off-Price. So good notes, digital marketing certainly affected our Off-Price business as well both in-store and online. We also have merchandise mix issues to get after within Off-Price as well. When you get into the details, Off-Price is a little different than Full-Price. There are some variance department by department. But that mix, and you know as well, that mix is so vital, that mix we have across Off-Price to Full-Price, that mix of price points that we have, the mix of styles. We have a pretty broad range of customers that we look to serve, and our size mix is super important in delivering that. And when we get out of balance, it really affects our top line. So we have those issues in Off-Price. 
The other bucket I'd call out is we did enter the year with a plan to improve our profitability in Off-Price, and part of that plan was eliminating some unprofitable events. Specifically, we reduced the number of flash events that we had on HauteLook. Some of those were not profitable. We reduced our Clear the Racks event in the quarter. And we did eliminate some of the very lowest price points merchandise we had on our Off-Price e-Commerce business. We did get the profitability improvement from those decisions. The effect on the top line was greater than we had planned. And we look at that, and we see opportunities to not blow up that strategy but to make some adjustments to it that we think can and will help our top line."

With Beauty, we have some things that happen to us that they're relatively discrete, I think, in nature. We had some out-of-stock issues that was a result of just being in stock, really getting it from the vendor -- our vendor partners there. There were some issues there that we think will mostly be behind us here pretty quick. We also had a lot of price promotion issues in Beauty, and that caused some problems with it. But I think Beauty has been such a consistently good performer for us over the years if you kind of look at that track record. We expect that, that will get back on track pretty quickly. 
With Women's Apparel, we have some more broad-based issues. A lot of it has to do with the balanced price that Erik talked a little bit about. I think in particular, finding ways to appeal more to young customers kind of in the range of what we do there in Women's Apparel. I think we know what we need to do there. And the good news is that part of the business turns relatively quickly. But I think in terms of really being able to make the changes we feel like we need to make, that's going to take a few months. 
So I think on the whole, Women's Apparel and Beauty is a subset of all. But I think it's fair to say that more broadly, we definitely have an opportunity to be better connected with customers in terms of the relevance that we have to offer, and the balance of price was probably the biggest lever there."

So if you think through our midpoint, which is down 1%, the flow-through actually is a little bit better given the fact that we are holding the strategy on our gross margin as well as SG&A. 
So I think if you do the reversed logistics on that, you can see that it's -- over time, as we make these structural changes, you would need less of a top line growth, and we're seeing that flow through."

So when we look at the overall stack, what we're assuming is that it's going to take a few months to get back on track on the assortment side.

First is productivity, end-to-end productivity primarily, technological and supply chain. So those are the current structural pieces. It takes some time to work through those. But those are some big buckets that we're going after from a productivity perspective. 
The second piece we've already implemented, which was store operating model changes I talked about in my opening comments. And that was a piece -- it actually gets us back in line with what the customer wants but also helps drive the expense efficiency in the stores as well. 
And then I think the smaller bucket I would talk about is the discretionary spend. It's really not that -- it's the smallest component of what we're looking at in the cost savings that we have. And so that's how I would frame that up. Now what I would also say is that we're continuing to look for opportunities to drive more productivity at the end of the business. 
And so you know us. We will continue to invest in doing the right thing for the customer, and we'll continue to invest in this business. But we're also going to look at how we make sure that our expense structure stays in line with whatever trends we see in our top line."

We have gotten back into the marketing component, which is taking to our SG&A line. So you can see, we're offsetting that. 
And then on the credit side, we had talked about this in the last call, as you recall, that we are anniversary-ing a credit acquisition or customer acquisition event from last year.

We upped the points from 2 points for every dollar spent to 3 points. We added a number of experiences to the program, which are actually resonating really well with customers. But in having the executional issues around the notes directly affected our digital marketing plan. By investing in loyalty, we moved marketing dollars there and away from retention activation in our digital marketing. So our missteps with the loyalty program exacerbated our issues in digital marketing, and they're certainly connected but again not driven by expense. 
Another thing I'd call out is in our stores, both in Racks and in our full-line stores, we have executed some model changes at our stores, again, not driven mainly by expense. But we've been on this journey for a while of, clearly, our model needs to change. Our business model, of which is born in bricks-and-mortar stores, and define what the real stores are. We think we have real good clarity on that. Our stores still that role of having great sales people who are taking care of 1 customer at a time and making some genuine human connections. That's in our DNA. That's continuing -- it has to be important. 
But increasingly, stores play a fulfillment role. There's locations where customers can pick up online orders, and there are locations that we fill online orders from. So we have moved our labor model in our stores to reflect what customers want and need. And there are efficiency opportunities in there. But I wouldn't say that it's been a blunt force of getting after expense cuts. I would say that, that's been done with, boy, how is the customer's needs changing, what are they looking for, how can we leverage the physical assets we have in stores and the people in our stores and the inventory in our stores to better serve them on their terms. And that's actually gone really well this quarter."

We started in L.A. last year and really started with engagement. How do we engage with customers by leveraging both our digital and physical assets? And that included experimenting with new physical assets in the Nordstrom Local service hubs. That engagement part across services and across channels, and we know we've got a lot of data on that. We know the more we engage with customers across channels and services, the more they spend. That's gone really, really well. 
The second part of the local market strategy is leveraging the inventory that is close to our customers, either in our stores or in our supply chain facilities. That's -- we're not as deep into that yet. We started being able to leverage the inventory. Started with our 4 core stores in Los Angeles. And a good example would be BOPUS, Buy Online, Pick Up in Store, where we went from the available inventory for BOPUS being one specific store's inventory to connecting the 4 stores and being able to pick it up either at those 4 stores or 1 of the 3 Nordstrom Local service hubs we have. And we've talked about it before, the outsized growth we're seeing in BOPUS across our company. The growth in BOPUS in Los Angeles is about 2x that we're seeing elsewhere in the company.
So here is a massive piece of engagement that customers love, that we think we can do in a fairly unique way and really given our customers terms, that drives higher engagement, drives bigger spend. Ultimately, our local market strategy success metric is gaining market share in these markets, and we have seen that in Los Angeles. We're in the midst right now of expanding our local market services from those core 4 stores to all 16 full-line stores in Los Angeles. We are on pace to bring our learnings to New York when we open the tower. We have 2 Nordstrom Local service hubs planned on the island. And we're well positioned to execute that in New York. And then our plan is next year to take that to our biggest markets across our portfolio. 
So that is our model. It leads with service engagement across channels and services, and it leads with leveraging inventory to get customers a greater selection to them faster and adds better economics for us. And we think that's the future of our Full-Price business."

In the second quarter, we delivered strong bottom line results, demonstrating our inventory and expense execution. We exited the quarter with inventory levels in a favorable position and made significant strides in productivity. We are implementing key learnings from the quarter to drive our top line and deliver bottom line results. 
In the second quarter, sales were down 5.1%, which was around the low end of our expectations. Full-Price decreased 6.5%, and Off-Price decreased 1.9%. We anticipated first quarter trends to continue. However, we had a slow start to the second quarter and softer results in both Full-Price and Off-Price. 
Last quarter, we emphasized our top line focus related to loyalty, digital marketing and merchandising. We've seen good outcomes from our efforts, including improvement in Nordstrom note redemptions. From a merchandise perspective, we're improving our in-stock levels and addressing a gap between our opening and higher price points. We ended the quarter in a strong inventory position, giving us the ability to better align our assortment in the second half of the year. 
Now I'd like to provide insight into 2 drivers of our business performance, our Full-Price Anniversary Sale and our Off-Price business. Starting with the anniversary. This is a unique event featuring new arrivals at reduced prices for a limited time. Our anniversary strategy focused on 3 objectives: increasing customer satisfaction, driving sales and improving the economics of the event. We are seeing early indications that our event resonated well with customers. That said, we planned anniversary consistent with current trends, but sales were softer than expected.
Based on customer feedback, we curated our anniversary assortment to highlight their favorite brands, which drove higher sell-through of anniversary product relative to last year. We expect this to benefit merchandise margins in the third quarter, and we'll have a complete assessment of our overall anniversary results at that time. 
While we increased depth in top brands, it has become even more concentrated around key items. We did not have enough depth in key items, and we are actively addressing this in the second half, particularly with our top gift ideas for the holidays. During anniversary, we improved our operational metrics around satisfaction scores, delivery times in key markets and site performance. This includes initial survey feedback from our top loyalty customers who value the enhanced benefits such as earlier access to merchandise. We also leveraged our digital and physical assets through Buy Online, Pick Up in Store, which increases customer engagement and is one of our most profitable transactions. During anniversary, sales from order pick up more than doubled over last year with nearly half coming from customers using the service for the first time. Customers who engage through order pickup tend to double their overall spend.
Turning to Off-Price. We are pleased with our profitability results. However, sales fell short of our expectations. Earlier this year, we made changes to improve our bottom line, which included reducing less profitable flash events. Because these events help drive meaningful traffic to our Nordstrom Rack and HauteLook sites, we are increasing the number of high-quality flash events in the second half. We are also accelerating our marketing efforts to drive traffic such as the upcoming launch of our Nordstrom Rack television brand campaign. 
The Off-Price business ended the quarter in a strong inventory position, improving turns across all merchandise positions. As we head into the second half, we are being opportunistic in the marketplace with plans to accelerate fall receipts. 
In this dynamic retail environment, we are evolving our business to create a seamless shopping journey. Historically, we know that more than 1/3 of customers who place an online order will have visited the store to help inform that purchase, and half of our customers to make a purchase in our store will first spend time in one of our digital properties. Our local market strategy leverages our physical and digital assets to provide greater access to merchandise selection with faster delivery and at a lower cost to us. This strategy focuses on gaining market share in our most important markets by leveraging inventory and increasing customer engagement through the services we offer. 
Our business is highly concentrated in our top markets with the top 10 accounting for 60% of our sales. This year, we scaled our local market strategy in Los Angeles, our largest market. We're seeing compelling results in predictive metrics for customer engagement and inventory efficiencies. We're seeing higher customer engagement and spend at our Nordstrom local neighborhood service hub. Customers spend 2.5x more on average. These service hubs account for 30% of order pickup, and alterations increased by more than 10%. In addition, product returns are coming in 8 days faster, driving greater inventory efficiencies.
To leverage inventory across the broader L.A. market, we began offering customers up to 7x more selection that's available next day. This contributed to sales from order pickup nearly tripling in July. We are pleased with our results in L.A. and are accelerating key elements of our local market strategy in more the of our top markets. 
Our next milestone is expanding our presence in New York City, currently our largest market for online sales. This fall, we will significantly expand our presence with the opening of our flagship store and 2 Nordstrom locals. We anticipate that the combination of our physical and digital assets will drive a meaningful sales lift in this important market. We will also leverage our 7 locations in New York City, including Nordstrom Rack and Trunk Club locations, to take care of our customers through services such as returns, order pickup and alterations. 
In closing, we're focused on driving our top and bottom line results, and we are well positioned for the second half. Nordstrom has managed through many cycles, and we will continue to evolve our business to better serve customers on their terms no matter how they choose to shop. 
I'll now turn it over to Anne to provide additional color on our financial performance and outlook."

Our second quarter earnings demonstrated our continued inventory and expense discipline. We are in a strong position to rebalance our merchandise assortment with customers across price points and key items. We also made significant progress",979,"Thanks, Erik. Our second quarter earnings demonstrated our continued inventory and expense discipline. We are in a strong position to rebalance our merchandise assortment with customers across price points and key items. We also made significant progress in bending the expense curve, mitigating our sales shortfall.
Second quarter sales reflect a consistent traffic trend, while conversion was softer relative to the first quarter. Heading into the second half, we continue to take aggressive actions related to loyalty, digital marketing and merchandise. Our progress in the second quarter and plans for the second half give us confidence in our ability to turnaround our current trend.
Beginning with loyalty. We continue to grow the program with 12 million active customers, increasing 12% over last year and making up 64% of second quarter sales. We have addressed the execution related to Nordstrom notes, and redemptions are in line with expectations. Enrollments are up over last year, and importantly, we saw a significant improvement in customer satisfaction scores during the quarter. 
With respect the digital marketing, we increased our level of investment in Full-Price and have further plans to accelerate Off-Price. For example, in the first half, we had a 25% year-over-year reduction of flash events and plan to get back to prior year level with high-quality events. And third, in merchandising, we made initial investments in Women's Apparel to address the gap in our assortment from a price point perspective. We are encouraged by the sell-through performance, and we're accelerating plans for the second half. 
In addition, we're applying our anniversary learnings to increase depth in key items. Specifically, for the holidays, we're amplifying our that are no assortment across categories and increasing the mix of more accessible price points. 
With the second quarter, our gross profit rate decreased 50 basis points from last year due to occupancy deleverage. Q2 merchandise margin rate relative to last year improved sequentially from Q1, and markdown levels were consistent with our expectations. We ended the quarter in a solid inventory position, reflecting 2 consecutive quarters for the positive spread in sales. 
Expense performance well exceeded our expectations. Our SG&A rate in Q2 increased modestly by 26 basis points, reflecting fixed cost deleverage on lower sales volumes. SG&A expense was down 4% compared to the previous year. This was primarily due to our expense savings in addition to performance-related adjustments. Today, we have delivered expense savings of $100 million, tracking ahead of our annual plan for $150 million to $200 million. Our efficiency initiatives include realignment of our support structure in stores, end-to-end process improvement in supply chain and technology and lower discretionary spend. These initiatives represent permanent reductions to our cost structure that position us well for strong EBIT flow-through. 
During the second quarter, we also managed [indiscernible] expenses well in a tough sales environment and maintained flat overhead expenses. Expenses related to digital capabilities, marketing, technology and supply chain were relatively flat to last year. Our 2Q EBIT margin of 5.7% deleveraged by 47 basis points over last year, a meaningful improvement from Q1. EBIT from investments met our expectations. 
Moving to the full year. We lowered the top end of our prior outlook for revised EPS range of $3.25 to $3.50. We expect a sales decline of approximately 2% for the year versus the prior outlook range between a 2% decrease to flat growth. The impact of tariffs has not been incorporated into our outlook, but we believe it will be relatively immaterial for the year. 
Now I'd like to provide color on our assumptions for the second half. Sales are expected to be flat at the midpoint, reflecting roughly a 400 basis point improvement from the first half. This incorporates 4 sales drivers, all of which are weighted equally. First, our merchandise plan includes rebalancing our assortment, increasing depth of key items and accelerating opportunistic buys for Off-Price. Second, we are accelerating our marketing efforts, including our Nordstrom Rack television brand campaign and additional flash events in off-price while continuing digital marketing investments in Full-Price. Third, we will lap last year's Nordy Club launch with respect to Nordstrom notes with most of the impact in the fourth quarter. And fourth, sales in the New York flagship opening on October 24 will primarily benefit the fourth quarter. 
For the third quarter, we expect sales to improve modestly from the first half. We expect gross profit rate expansion from improved sell-through of the anniversary product. We also expect our SG&A rate to deleverage from fixed costs, which includes preopening expenses for our New York flagship. Third quarter EBIT margin is expected to be relatively flat, including last year's estimated credit-related charge. For the fourth quarter, we expect the New York City flagship opening to contribute sales in the fourth quarter as well as occupancy deleverage. 
Taking a step back, our framework to drive shareholder value remains consistent: gain market share, improve profitability and returns and maintain a disciplined capital allocation approach. We're focused on driving the top line, leveraging inventory and bending the expense curve. Over time, we expect our generational investments to further scale and contribute to improved profitability and returns on invested capital. 
We have a strong balance sheet and maintain a consistent approach to capital allocation. As we exit this year's heavy investment cycle, we expect moderating CapEx and accelerating free cash flow beyond 2019. CapEx levels are expected to moderate from 6% this year to 3% to 4% of sales, an appropriate level to fund our strategic objective. 
In terms of the long-term financial targets we shared a year ago, we're focused on delivering on our current your expectations and intend to revisit those targets as we finish the year. 
In closing, our priorities are to drive our top line, improve profitability and execute key strategies to enhance the customer experience.

We headed out some of the long tail of our brands and went deeper into our customers' favorite brands. That being said, we didn't go far enough. We simply ran out of our top items. Obviously, we have a long history with Anniversary Sale. There was a change this year in customer behavior. Certainly, we always see a highly disproportionate amount of demand on our top items. What was different this year was how deep that disproportionate amount was. We saw more demand on our top items than we've seen previously. And we simply ran out faster of our top items than we had planned. 
So we're encouraged that I think our buyers did a great job of picking the right items and putting the dollars in the best items.

There's clearly -- be able to have a broad selection that customers are accustomed to online, but being able to pick it up in stores resonates with lots and lots of customers. Just looking at a lot of retailers results last couple of weeks, there's a pretty common thread their of some successes in various categories of doing this. We've had capabilities for quite some time. We did make some changes, and most impactfully in Los Angeles, we greatly increased the selection that customers have in doing a Buy Online, Pick Up in Store for next day. Specifically, we were able to leverage the entire market's inventory that we have in stores and the customer choose where they want to pick it up. We're able to move around that inventory very efficiently between our stores and the market, get it there quickly, and customers love it. Our customer satisfaction scores on that service are amongst the highest we have of anything to do. 
And you mentioned the inventory implications of that. Part of our local market strategy is getting to a different level of inventory efficiency, in particular, having the capabilities of holding back inventory and allocating it as needed to be it stores or be it to customers' home. We haven't done that yet. We are still working on that. We've done some testing. We're getting in position to do that. But we certainly think that, that's the next step of Nordstrom Local is getting even bigger selection to customers, having fewer out-of-stocks and, for us, reaching another level of inventory efficiency."

And we just -- we're going to be more purposeful at having the proper amount of inventory, first of all, in the gift classification that makes sense but also at prices that work. And for us, really, more of the $50 to $150 or $200 kind of price points. So we have a pretty broad range of prices that we have to offer, and it doesn't service kind of a democratic approach across every category that we're in. We need to step back and figure out where to invest the money to be a better gift destination for customers. I get to tell you, our experience of being around, it feels like the most purposeful attempt for us to prove in terms of being gift destination. So we think we've learned a lot. And as Erik mentioned, anniversary, I think, was helpful kind of understanding depth of stuff. So we feel good about our chance to have a good holiday as a result of that. 
And as you talked about price and what happens in Off-Price and Full-Price, it's the version of that's applicable in both places, and we're trying to be thoughtful in surgical about how we're doing it. So I just think it puts extra focus on our ability to be good editors and curators, something we've been able to approach with some more objective information. We have better data than we've ever had before. So again, I think from our point of view, it feels like it less opinion days, it's much more purposeful around objective information."

They talk about Buy Online, Pick Up in Store, we know customers who use that service spend double those that don't use it. Talk about alterations before. Alterations is something that can't be done digitally, and it's something we're really good at. We're the largest employer of tailors in North America. I think we have the best tailors there are out there. And customers are engaged in our alterations area, they spend triples. When a customer engages with the stylist, their spend goes up 5x. So that engagement is really what we're looking for, be it with services, be it across channels. We know the more engagement we get with customers, the better it is.

So we are seeing will be originally have thought in Q1. So that's how you get to the reconciliation at this point. 
On gross margin, as we mentioned, our merch margins were actually in line with our expectations as far as markdowns. The only thing we had was deleverage on our occupancy expenses and sales volume. As we go through the rest of the year, we really didn't change any of our guidance assumptions on margins. As Erik had talked about how we thought about Anniversary Sale as far as having better margin in the [ first ] quarter, the anniversary product, we are -- that was the plan that we made, and we're continuing to progress on that. So the only thing that's changed in our overall guidance is the top line."

As Erik mentioned, I think we did a good job of identifying the key items and brands and styles that, that customer's responding to. So we've always had a pretty aggressive program on trying to identify and amplify emerging brands. I guess what I can tell you is change is that the cycle on all that stuff is shorter than it's ever been. So one of the things we need to do is identify new emerging brands and amplify them quickly. It isn't a matter of test and learn over a couple of years, a couple of stores and time. So I guess what I can say just more broadly is that I think we have more confidence in our ability to be able to get the gaps when things are working well, and the same holds true for, perhaps, some legacy brands that are declining. And we have some very big built-up established businesses with some legacy brands where it's going the wrong way. So I just -- our teams have to be really good editors. They got to be [indiscernible], and they can't really use last year or so much as a guide. So the other thing I would say is thematically, really understanding the way price impacts classifications, and just getting sharper about that has helped.
So it's been kind of tough goal for a while in women's apparel, but I think it's fair to say that we have optimism about our ability to make some improvements there, particularly starting back half of the year.

The loyalty, as we mentioned, good progress over the quarter. So we like the [ situation ] that we're there. The digital marketing, we're a little further behind in Off-Price than we are in Full-Price. We do have still some traffic opportunities in Off-Price. We feel much better about that. In particular, what's unique about Off-Price is we touch our comments is flash. We did a deep dive at the end of last year in all our flash events. We had a number of flash events that were: one, categories that we don't care in our stores, and with the majority of our online returns coming back to our stores, that creates issues; but number two, they were unprofitable events. So we did a lot of editing these flash events. The flip side is what's really a plus about the flash model is the traffic generation, engagement, mainly through e-mail that we give our customers who sign up at these flash events is terrific. It helps us not only on the flash side but helps us on the Rack.com site as well. So we felt the reduction in traffic from cutting back on those events. We started the last about 3 weeks back on more of a normal cadence there of flash events, and the key to there is not just quantity of flash events. It's the quality of flash events. And we feel really good about that. So feel good about flash events going forward, that it's going to be differentiated in the first half. We feel good about the marketing that's going to be differentiated in the first half. 
The other point that [indiscernible] is the inventory position. I mean we're sitting here midway through the year with lots of open close by cross company, but particularly in Off-Price. In Off-Price, the biggest driver of the Off-Price businesses having great merchandise and being opportunistic, especially in times like now that are tough for the industry, we're really excited about the position we're in to pick up some compelling merchandise for our customers and get them into our Rack brand."

Our NPT area did very well, our own product that showed some improvement. That's good to see. And then lastly, I'd say that the laundry in active areas in women's performed relatively better. That tougher areas for us is we had some slowdown in shoes. I think that represented a moment in time. We shall see, but that was a bit of a depth from where it was that shoes have been performing strong. Men's had some challenges. I would say the biggest driver there that we've noticed, and this is not a surprise in our industry, but the continued kind of casualization of America. That impacts the men's business quite a bit. And so while we are still serving a lot of men and selling them things, the average price of what we're selling often times less than it was when they were buying suits and ties and things of that nature. So there's adjustments we need to continue to make, but I think that those kind of represent stronger-performing categories relative to the last quarter."

In the second quarter, we delivered strong bottom line results, demonstrating our inventory and expense execution. We exited the quarter with inventory levels in a favorable position and made significant strides in productivity. We are implementing key learnings from the quarter to drive our top line and deliver bottom line results.
In the second quarter, sales were down 5.1%, which was around the low end of our expectations. Full-Price decreased 6.5% and Off-Price decreased 1.9%. We anticipated first quarter trends to continue, however, we had a slow start to the second quarter and softer results in both Full-Price and Off-Price.
Last quarter, we emphasized our top line focus related to loyalty, digital marketing and merchandising. We've seen good outcomes from our efforts, including improvement in Nordstrom Note redemptions. From a merchandise perspective, we're improving our in-stock levels and addressing a gap between our opening and higher price points. We ended the quarter in a strong inventory position, giving us the ability to better align our assortment in the second half of the year.
Now I'd like to provide insight into 2 drivers of our business performance, our Full-Price Anniversary Sale and our Off-Price business. Starting with the anniversary. This is a unique event featuring new arrivals at reduced prices for a limited time. Our anniversary strategy focused on 3 objectives: increasing customer satisfaction, driving sales and improving the economics of the event. We're seeing early indications that our event resonated well with customers. That said, we planned anniversary consistent with current trends, but sales were softer than expected.
Based on customer feedback, we curated our anniversary assortment to highlight their favorite brands, which drove higher sell-through of anniversary product relative to last year. We expect this to benefit merchandise margins in the third quarter, and we'll have a complete assessment of our overall anniversary results at that time. 
While we increased depth in top brands, it has become even more concentrated around key items. We did not have enough depth in key items, and we are actively addressing this in the second half, particularly with our top gift ideas for the holidays. 
During anniversary, we improved our operational metrics around satisfaction scores, delivery times in key markets and site performance. This includes initial survey feedback from our top loyalty customers who value the enhanced benefits such as earlier access to merchandise. We also leveraged our digital and physical assets through Buy Online, Pick Up in Store, which increases customer engagement and is one of our most profitable transactions. During anniversary, sales from order pickup more than doubled over last year with nearly half coming from customers using this service for the first time. Customers who engage through order pickup tend to double their overall spend.
Turning to Off-Price. We are pleased with our profitability results. However, sales fell short of our expectations. Earlier this year, we made changes to improve our bottom line, which included reducing less profitable flash events. Because these events help drive meaningful traffic to our Nordstrom Rack and HauteLook sites, we are increasing the number of high-quality flash events in the second half. We are also accelerating our marketing efforts to drive traffic such as the upcoming launch of our Nordstrom Rack television brand campaign.
The Off-Price business ended the quarter in a strong inventory position, improving turns across all merchandise positions. As we head into the second half, we are being opportunistic in the marketplace with plans to accelerate fall receipts.
In this dynamic retail environment, we are evolving our business to create a seamless shopping journey. Historically, we know that more than 1/3 of customers who place an online order will have visited the store to help inform that purchase, and half of our customers who make a purchase in our store will first spend time on one of our digital properties. Our local market strategy leverages our physical and digital assets to provide greater access to merchandise selection with faster delivery and at a lower cost to us. This strategy focuses on gaining market share in our most important markets by leveraging inventory and increasing customer engagement through the services we offer.
Our business is highly concentrated in our top markets with the top 10 accounting for 60% of our sales. This year, we scaled our local market strategy in Los Angeles, our largest market. We're seeing compelling results and predictive metrics for customer engagement and inventory efficiencies. We're seeing higher customer engagement and spend at our Nordstrom Local neighborhood service hub. Customers spend 2.5x more on average. These service hubs account for 30% of order pickup, and alterations increased by more than 10%. In addition, product returns are coming in 8 days faster, driving greater inventory efficiencies.
To leverage inventory across the broader L.A. market, we began offering customers up to 7x more selection that's available next day. This contributed to sales from order pickup nearly tripling in July. We are pleased with our results in L.A. and are accelerating key elements of our local market strategy in more of our top markets.
Our next milestone is expanding our presence in New York City, currently our largest market for online sales. This fall, we will significantly expand our presence with the opening of our flagship store and 2 Nordstrom Locals. We anticipate that the combination of our physical and digital assets will drive a meaningful sales lift in this important market. We will also leverage our 7 locations in New York City, including Nordstrom Rack and Trunk Club locations, to take care of our customers through services such as returns, order pickup and alterations.
In closing, we're focused on driving our top and bottom line results, and we are well positioned for the second half. Nordstrom has managed through many cycles, and we will continue to evolve our business to better serve customers on their terms no matter how they choose to shop.
I'll now turn it over to Anne to provide additional color on our financial performance and outlook."

Enrollments are up over last year, and importantly, we saw a significant improvement in customer satisfaction scores during the quarter.
With respect to digital marketing, we increased our level of investment in Full-Price and have further plans to accelerate Off-Price. For example, in the first half, we had a 25% year-over-year reduction of flash events and plan to get back to prior year level with high-quality events. And third, in merchandising, we made initial investments in Women's Apparel to address the gap in our assortment from a price point perspective. We are encouraged by the sell-through performance, and we're accelerating plans for the second half.
In addition, we're applying our anniversary learnings to increase depth in key items. Specifically, for the holidays, we're amplifying our gift assortment across categories and increasing the mix of more accessible price points.
For the second quarter, our gross profit rate decreased 50 basis points from last year due to occupancy deleverage. Q2 merchandise margin rate relative to last year improved sequentially from Q1, and markdown levels were consistent with our expectations. We ended the quarter in a solid inventory position, reflecting 2 consecutive quarters with a positive spread to sales.
Expense performance well exceeded our expectations. Our SG&A rate in Q2 increased modestly by 26 basis points, reflecting fixed-cost deleverage on lower sales volumes. SG&A expense was down 4% compared to the previous year. This was primarily due to our expense savings in addition to performance-related adjustments. Today, we have delivered expense savings of $100 million, tracking ahead of our annual plan for $150 million to $200 million. Our efficiency initiatives include realignment of our support structure in stores, end-to-end process improvement in supply chain and technology and lower discretionary spend. These initiatives represent permanent reductions to our cost structure that position us well for strong EBIT flow-through.
During the second quarter, we also managed variable expenses well in a tough sales environment and maintained flat overhead expenses. Expenses related to digital capabilities, marketing, technology and supply chain were relatively flat to last year. Our 2Q EBIT margin of 5.7% deleveraged by 47 basis points over last year, a meaningful improvement from Q1. EBIT from generational investments met our expectations.
Moving to the full year. We lowered the top end of our prior outlook to a revised EPS range of $3.25 to $3.50. We expect a sales decline of approximately 2% for the year versus the prior outlook range between a 2% decrease to flat growth. The impact of tariffs has not been incorporated into our outlook, but we believe it will be relatively immaterial for the year.
Now I'd like to provide color on our assumptions for the second half. Sales are expected to be flat at the midpoint, reflecting roughly a 400 basis point improvement from the first half. This incorporates 4 sales drivers, all of which are weighted equally. First, our merchandise plans include rebalancing our assortment, increasing depth of key items and accelerating opportunistic buys for Off-Price. Second, we are accelerating our marketing efforts, including our Nordstrom Rack television brand campaign and additional flash events in Off-Price while continuing digital marketing investments in Full-Price. Third, we will lap last year's Nordy Club launch with respect to Nordstrom Notes with most of the impact in the fourth quarter. And fourth, sales in the New York flagship opening on October 24 will primarily benefit the fourth quarter.
For the third quarter, we expect sales to improve modestly from the first half. We expect gross profit rate expansion from improved sell-through of anniversary product. We also expect our SG&A rate to deleverage from fixed costs, which includes preopening expenses for our New York flagship. Third quarter EBIT margin is expected to be relatively flat, including last year's estimated credit-related charge. For the fourth quarter, we expect the New York City flagship opening to contribute sales in the fourth quarter as well as occupancy deleverage.
Taking a step back, our framework to drive shareholder value remains consistent: gain market share, improve profitability and returns and maintain a disciplined capital allocation approach. We're focused on driving the top line, leveraging inventory and bending the expense curve. Over time, we expect our generational investments to further scale and contribute to improved profitability and return on invested capital.
We have a strong balance sheet and maintain a consistent approach to capital allocation. As we exit this year's heavy investment cycle, we expect moderating CapEx and accelerating free cash flow beyond 2019. CapEx levels are expected to moderate from 6% this year to 3% to 4% of sales, an appropriate level to fund our strategic objective.  In terms of the long-term financial targets we shared a year ago, we're focused on delivering on our current year expectations and intend to revisit those targets after we finish the year.
In closing, our priorities are to drive our top line, improve profitability and execute key strategies to enhance the customer experience.
I'll now turn it over to Trina for Q&A."

We headed it out some of the long tail of our brands and went deeper in our customers' favorite brands. That being said, we didn't go far enough. We simply ran out of our top items. Obviously, we have a long history with Anniversary Sale. There was a change this year in customer behavior. Certainly, we always see a highly disproportionate amount of demand on our top items. What was different this year was how deep that disproportionate amount was. We saw more demand on our top items than we've seen previously. And we simply ran out faster of our top items than we had planned.
So we're encouraged that I think our buyers did a great job of picking the right items and putting the dollars in the best items. We just should have, could have done a better job of going deeper on those top items.
And another point, you brought up the Early Access portion. As we mentioned, we had a lot of good customer feedback on the changes we've made this year. But again, I think what could we have done better, we could have had deeper positions on our top items."

There's clearly -- being able to have the broad selection that customers are coming or accustomed to online, but being able to pick it up in store resonates with lots and lots of customers. Just looking at a lot of retailers results this last couple of weeks, seems to me there's a pretty common thread there of some successes in various categories of probably doing this. We've had BOPUS capabilities for quite some time. We did make some changes. And most impactfully in Los Angeles, we greatly increased the selection that customers have in doing a Buy Online, Pick Up in Store for next day. Specifically, we're able to leverage the entire market's inventory that we have in stores and let the customer choose where they want to pick it up. We're able to move around that inventory very efficiently between our stores in the market, get it there quickly. And customers love it. Our customer satisfaction scores on that service are amongst the highest we have of anything we do.
And you mentioned the inventory implications of that. Part of our local market strategy is getting to a different level of inventory efficiency, in particular, having the capabilities of holding back inventory and allocating it as needed to -- be it stores or be it to customers' home. We haven't done that yet. We're still working on that. We've done some testing. We're getting in a position to do that. But we certainly think that, that's the next step of Nordstrom Local is getting even a bigger selection to customers, having fewer out-of-stocks and, for us, reaching another level of inventory efficiency."

And we just -- we're going to be much more purposeful at having the proper amount of inventory, first of all, in the gift classification that makes sense, but also at prices that work. And for us, really more of that $50 to $150 or $200 kind of price points, and so we have a pretty broad range of prices that we have to offer. And it doesn't serve us well just to have kind of a democratic approach across every category that we're in. We need to step back and figure out where to invest the money to be a better gift destination for customers. And I can just tell you, in our experience of being around, it feels like the most purposeful attempt for us to improve in terms of being a gift destination. So we think we've learned a lot. And as Erik mentioned, anniversary, I think, was helpful in kind of understanding depth of stuff. So we feel good about our chance to have a good holiday as a result of that.
As you talked about price and what happens in Off-Price and Full-Price, it is a version of it that's applicable in both places, and we're trying to be thoughtful and surgical about how we're doing it. So I just think it puts extra focus on our ability to be good editors and curators, something we've been able to approach with some more objective information. We have better data than we've ever had before. So again, I think from our point of view, it feels like less opinion-based thing and it's much more purposeful around objective information."

We started last year in L.A. really to do a lot of testing with customers, a lot of listening of how we can connect our digital and physical assets to better serve customers.

We've now expanded in particular that Buy Online, Pick Up in Store, greater selection for next-day delivery across 16 stores in Los Angeles, Orange County as well as our 3 local stores. And we're seeing really tremendous traction on that service in particular. 
But stepping back, it's looking at our physical assets as points of engagement as much as they are points of sale. We really don't care where the sale gets rung up. And we continue to learn that those physical assets that when leveraged really how customers want make a tremendous difference. We've talked about Buy Online, Pick Up in Store. We know our customers who use that service spend double those that don't use it.
I think others talked about alterations before. Alterations is obviously something that can't be done digitally, and it's something we're really good at. We're the largest employer of tailors in North America. I think we have the best tailors that are out there. And we know that customers who are engaged in our alterations area, their spend triples. When a customer engages with a stylist, their spend goes up 5x.
So that engagement is really what we're looking for, be it with services, be it across channels. We know the more engagement we get with the customers, the better it is. And through our local market strategy in particular, we feel really good that we've got some ways to leverage these physical assets that really resonate with customers."

Our stores -- if we're going to leverage the inventory we have in our stores to better serve customers, it means our stores are increasingly becoming fulfillment centers as well as selling directly to the customers. So we have had changes in our model and our store there to do that. We need more people handling both online orders that are being built as well as returns coming back, getting that inventory sellable as quickly as possible. That's gone really well. And in particular, our anniversary was such an intense period of demand. We saw significant improvement in our fulfillment rates in our stores as well as the speed of delivery to customers in our key markets. So we feel really good about that."

There's not a lot that you can easily quantify at this point, but I think certainly creating a road map for the future for us to bend the curve there. As Erik mentioned, I think we did a good job of identifying the key items and brands and styles that, that customers are responding to. So we've always had a pretty aggressive program on trying to identify and amplify emerging brands.
I guess what I can tell you is change is -- the cycle on all that stuff is shorter than it's ever been. So one of the things we need to do is identify new emerging brands and amplify them quickly. It isn't a matter of test and learn over a couple of years, a couple of stores in time. So I guess what I can say just more broadly is that I think we have more confidence in our ability to be able to pour on the gaps when things are working well. And the same holds true for, perhaps, some legacy brands that are declining. And we have some very big, built-up, established businesses with some legacy brands where it's going the wrong way. So I just -- our teams have to be really good editors. They've got to be curious and they can't really use last year so much as a guide.
So the other thing I would say is thematically, really understanding the way price impacts classifications and just getting sharper about that has helped. So it's been kind of a tough goal for a while in Women's Apparel, but I think it's fair to say that we have optimism about our ability to make some improvements there, particularly starting in the back half of the year.
And then the other one was about -- I'm sorry, about New York specifically, Dana?"

I would say, though, if you're asking us particularly in the near term how we're going to view the success, I think it's really along the lines of can we deliver a great customer experience there in all the ways that I think customers would expect from Nordstrom entering a market. There's plenty of places to buy things in New York. And if we're really successful there, it's because we do the little things better and the little things that are actually big things, just the way that we serve customers, a more relevant, a more convenient way, and we've heard that theme a lot. And we've got a good team of leaders that are ready to take that challenge on.

I would mainly point to those issues we've had across our Full-Price business, in fact, our Off-Price business as well: the loyalty, digital marketing and merchandise assortment. The loyalty, as we mentioned, we have good progress over the quarter. So we like the situation that we're there. The digital marketing, we're a little further behind in Off-Price than we are in Full-Price. We do have still some traffic opportunities in Off-Price. We feel much better about that.
In particular, what's unique about Off-Price, as we touched on our comments, is flash. We did a deep dive at the end of last year in all our flash events. We had a number of flash events that were, one, categories that we don't carry in our stores. And with the majority of our online returns coming back to our stores, that creates issues. But number two, they were unprofitable events. So we did a lot of editing, these flash events.
The flip side is what's really a plus about the flash model is the traffic generation, engagement mainly through e-mail that we give our customers who sign up at these flash events is terrific and helps us not only on the flash side, but helps us on our Rack.com site as well. So we felt the reduction in traffic from cutting back on those events. We started the last about 3 weeks back on more of our normal cadence there of flash events. And the key to there is not just quantity of flash events, it's the quality of flash events. And we feel really good about that. So feel good about flash events going forward that it's going to be differentiated in the first half. We feel good about the marketing that it's going to be differentiated in the first half.
The other point that [indiscernible] is the inventory position. I mean we're sitting here midway through the year with lots of open to buy across our company, but particularly in Off-Price. In Off-Price, the biggest driver of Off-Price business is having great merchandise and being opportunistic, especially in times like now that are tough for the industry. We're really excited about the position we're in to really pick up some compelling merchandise for our customers and get them into our Rack brand."

I think we mentioned that before that we had some out-of-stock issues that, at the beginning of the year, hurt us. And so we bent the curve there, and beauty improved quite a bit. To me, it's been a consistent story for quite some time as our Designer business across all categories, positive, continues to be a good growth opportunity for us. Our MPG area did very well, our own product, that showed some improvement. That's good to see. And then lastly, I'd say that the lingerie and active areas in women's performed relatively better. 
The tougher areas for us is we had some slowdown in shoes. I think that represented a moment in time. We shall see. But that was a bit of a dip from where it was -- that shoes have been performing strongly. Men's had some challenges. I would say the biggest driver there that we've noticed, and this is not a surprise to those who follow our industry, but the continued kind of casualization of America. That impacts the men's business quite a bit. And so while we're still serving a lot of men and selling them things, the average price of what we're selling them oftentimes is less than it was when they were buying suits and ties and things of that nature. So there's adjustments we need to continue to make, but I think that those kind of represent the stronger-performing categories relative to the -- [ what each is ] performing from last quarter."

In the second quarter, we delivered strong bottom line results, demonstrating our inventory and expense execution. We exited the quarter with inventory levels in a favorable position and made significant strides in productivity. We are implementing key learnings from the quarter to drive our top line and deliver bottom line results.
In the second quarter, sales were down 5.1%, which was around the low end of our expectations. Full-Price decreased 6.5% and Off-Price decreased 1.9%. We anticipated first quarter trends to continue, however, we had a slow start to the second quarter and softer results in both Full-Price and Off-Price.
Last quarter, we emphasized our top line focus related to loyalty, digital marketing and merchandising. We've seen good outcomes from our efforts, including improvement in Nordstrom Note redemptions. From a merchandise perspective, we're improving our in-stock levels and addressing a gap between our opening and higher price points. We ended the quarter in a strong inventory position, giving us the ability to better align our assortment in the second half of the year.
Now I'd like to provide insight into 2 drivers of our business performance, our Full-Price Anniversary Sale and our Off-Price business. Starting with the anniversary. This is a unique event featuring new arrivals at reduced prices for a limited time. Our anniversary strategy focused on 3 objectives: increasing customer satisfaction, driving sales and improving the economics of the event. We're seeing early indications that our event resonated well with customers. That said, we planned anniversary consistent with current trends, but sales were softer than expected.
Based on customer feedback, we curated our anniversary assortment to highlight their favorite brands, which drove higher sell-through of anniversary product relative to last year. We expect this to benefit merchandise margins in the third quarter, and we'll have a complete assessment of our overall anniversary results at that time. 
While we increased depth in top brands, it has become even more concentrated around key items. We did not have enough depth in key items, and we are actively addressing this in the second half, particularly with our top gift ideas for the holidays. 
During anniversary, we improved our operational metrics around satisfaction scores, delivery times in key markets and site performance. This includes initial survey feedback from our top loyalty customers who value the enhanced benefits such as earlier access to merchandise. We also leveraged our digital and physical assets through Buy Online Pick Up in Store, which increases customer engagement and is one of our most profitable transaction. During anniversary, sales from order pickup more than doubled over last year with nearly half coming from customers using this service for the first time. Customers who engage through order pickup tend to double their overall spend.
Turning to Off-Price. We are pleased with our profitability results. However, sales fell short of our expectations. Earlier this year, we made changes to improve our bottom line, which included reducing less profitable flash events. Because these events help drive meaningful traffic to our Nordstrom Rack and HauteLook sites, we are increasing the number of high-quality flash events in the second half. We are also accelerating our marketing efforts to drive traffic such as the upcoming launch of our Nordstrom Rack television brand campaign.
The Off-Price business ended the quarter in a strong inventory position, improving turns across all merchandise divisions. As we head into the second half, we are being opportunistic in the marketplace with plans to accelerate fall receipts.
In this dynamic retail environment, we are evolving our business to create a seamless shopping journey. Historically, we know that more than 1/3 of customers who place an online order will have visited the store to help inform that purchase, and half of our customers who make a purchase in our store will first spend time on one of our digital properties. Our local market strategy leverages our physical and digital assets to provide greater access to merchandise selection with faster delivery and at a lower cost to us. This strategy focuses on gaining market share in our most important markets by leveraging inventory and increasing customer engagement through the services we offer.
Our business is highly concentrated in our top markets with the top 10 accounting for 60% of our sales. This year, we scaled our local market strategy in Los Angeles, our largest market. We're seeing compelling results and predictive metrics for customer engagement and inventory efficiencies. We're seeing higher customer engagement and spend at our Nordstrom Local neighborhood service hub. Customers spend 2.5x more on average. These service hubs account for 30% of order pickup, and alterations increased by more than 10%. In addition, product returns are coming in 8 days faster, driving greater inventory efficiencies.
To leverage inventory across the broader L.A. market, we began offering customers up to 7x more selection that's available next day. This contributed to sales from order pickup nearly tripling in July. We are pleased with our results in L.A. and are accelerating key elements of our local market strategy in more of our top markets.
Our next milestone is expanding our presence in New York City, currently our largest market for online sales. This fall, we will significantly expand our presence with the opening of our flagship store and 2 Nordstrom Locals. We anticipate that the combination of our physical and digital assets will drive a meaningful sales lift in this important market. We will also leverage our 7 locations in New York City, including Nordstrom Rack and Trunk Club locations, to take care of our customers through services such as returns, order pickup and alterations.
In closing, we're focused on driving our top and bottom line results, and we are well positioned for the second half. Nordstrom has managed through many cycles, and we will continue to evolve our business to better serve customers on their terms no matter how they choose to shop.
I'll now turn it over to Anne to provide additional color on our financial performance and outlook."

Our second quarter earnings demonstrated our continued inventory and expense discipline. We are in a strong position to rebalance our merchandise assortment with customer demand across price points and key items. We also made significant progress in bending the expense curve, mitigating our sales shortfall.
Second quarter sales reflect a consistent traffic trend while conversion was softer relative to the first quarter. Heading into the second half, we continue to take aggressive actions related to loyalty, digital marketing and merchandise. Our progress in the second quarter and plans for the second half give us confidence in our ability to turn around our current trend.
Beginning with loyalty. We continue to grow the program with 12 million active customers, increasing 12% over last year and making up 64% of second quarter sales. We have addressed the execution related to Nordstrom Notes, and redemptions are in line with expectations. Enrollments are up over last year, and importantly, we saw a significant improvement in customer satisfaction scores during the quarter.
With respect to digital marketing, we increased our level of investment in Full-Price and have further plans to accelerate Off-Price. For example, in the first half, we had a 25% year-over-year reduction of flash events and plan to get back to prior year level with high-quality events. And third, in merchandising, we made initial investments in Women's Apparel to address the gap in our assortment from a price point perspective. We are encouraged by the sell-through performance, and we're accelerating plans for the second half.
In addition, we're applying our anniversary learnings to increase depth of key items. Specifically, for the holidays, we're amplifying our gift assortment across categories and increasing the mix of more accessible price points.
For the second quarter, our gross profit rate decreased 50 basis points from last year due to occupancy deleverage. Q2 merchandise margin rate relative to last year improved sequentially from Q1, and markdown levels were consistent with our expectations. We ended the quarter in a solid inventory position, reflecting 2 consecutive quarters with a positive spread to sales.
Expense performance well exceeded our expectations. Our SG&A rate in Q2 increased modestly by 26 basis points, reflecting fixed-cost deleverage on lower sales volumes. SG&A expense was down 4% compared to the previous year. This was primarily due to our expense savings in addition to performance-related adjustments. Today, we have delivered expense savings of $100 million, tracking ahead of our annual plan for $150 million to $200 million. Our efficiency initiatives include realignment of our support structure in stores, end-to-end process improvement in supply chain and technology and lower discretionary spend. These initiatives represent permanent reductions to our cost structure that position us well for strong EBIT flow-through.
During the second quarter, we also managed variable expenses well in a tough sales environment and maintained flat overhead expenses. Expenses related to digital capabilities, marketing, technology and supply chain were relatively flat to last year. Our 2Q EBIT margin of 5.7% deleveraged by 47 basis points over last year, a meaningful improvement from Q1. EBIT for our generational investments met our expectations.
Moving to the full year. We lowered the top end of our prior outlook for a revised EPS range of $3.25 to $3.50. We expect a sales decline of approximately 2% for the year versus the prior outlook range between a 2% decrease to flat growth. The impact of tariffs has not been incorporated into our outlook, but we believe it will be relatively immaterial for the year.
Now I'd like to provide color on our assumptions for the second half. Sales are expected to be flat at the midpoint, reflecting roughly a 400 basis point improvement from the first half. This incorporates 4 sales drivers, all of which are weighted equally. First, our merchandise plans include rebalancing our assortment, increasing depth of key items and accelerating opportunistic buys for Off-Price. Second, we are accelerating our marketing efforts, including our Nordstrom Rack television brand campaign and additional flash events in Off-Price while continuing digital marketing investments in Full-Price. Third, we will lap last year's Nordy Club launch with respect to Nordstrom Notes with most of the impact in the fourth quarter. And fourth, sales in the New York flagship opening on October 24 will primarily benefit the fourth quarter.
For the third quarter, we expect sales to improve modestly from the first half. We expect gross profit rate expansion from improved sell-through of anniversary product. We also expect our SG&A rate to deleverage from fixed costs, which includes preopening expenses for our New York flagship. Third quarter EBIT margin is expected to be relatively flat when excluding last year's estimated credit-related charge. For the fourth quarter, we expect the New York City flagship opening to contribute sales in the fourth quarter as well as occupancy deleverage.
Taking a step back, our framework to drive shareholder value remains consistent: gain market share, improve profitability and returns and maintain a disciplined capital allocation approach. We're focused on driving the top line, leveraging inventory and bending the expense curve. Over time, we expect our generational investments to further scale and contribute to improved profitability and return on invested capital.
We have a strong balance sheet and maintain a consistent approach to capital allocation. As we exit this year's heavy investment cycle, we expect moderating CapEx and accelerating free cash flow beyond 2019. CapEx levels are expected to moderate from 6% this year to 3% to 4% of sales, an appropriate level to fund our strategic objective.  In terms of the long-term financial targets we shared a year ago, we're focused on delivering on our current year expectations and intend to revisit those targets after we finish the year.
In closing, our priorities are to drive our top line, improve profitability and execute key strategies to enhance the customer experience.
I'll now turn it over to Trina for Q&A."

We edited out some of the long tail of our brands and went deeper in our customers' favorite brands. That being said, we didn't go far enough. We simply ran out of our top items. Obviously, we have a long history with Anniversary Sale. There was a change this year in customer behavior. Certainly, we always see highly disproportionate amount of demand on our top items. What was different this year was how deep that disproportionate amount was. We saw more demand on our top items than we've seen previously. And we simply ran out faster of our top items than we had planned.
So we're encouraged that I think our buyers did a great job of picking the right items and putting the dollars in the best items. We just should have, could have done a better job of going deeper on those top items.

There's clearly -- being able to have a broad selection that customers are coming or accustomed to online, but being able to pick it up in stores resonates with lots and lots of customers. Just looking at a lot of retailers results these last couple of weeks, it seems to me there's a pretty common thread there of some successes in various categories of probably doing this. We've had BOPUS capabilities for quite some time. We did make some changes. And most impactfully in Los Angeles, we greatly increased the selection that customers have in doing a Buy Online Pick Up in Store for next day. Specifically, we're able to leverage the entire market's inventory that we have in stores and let the customer choose where they want to pick it up. We're able to move around that inventory very efficiently between our stores in the market, get it there quickly. And customers love it. Our customer satisfaction scores on that service are amongst the highest we have of anything we do.
And you mentioned the inventory implications of that. Part of our local market strategy is getting to a different level of inventory efficiency, in particular, having the capabilities of holding back inventory and allocating it as needed to -- be it stores or be it to customers' home. We haven't done that yet. We're still working on that. We've done some testing. We're getting in a position to do that. But we certainly think that, that's the next step of Nordstrom Local is getting even a bigger selection to customers, having fewer out-of-stocks and, for us, reaching another level of inventory efficiency."

And we just -- we're going to be much more purposeful at having the proper amount of inventory, first of all, in the gift classification that makes sense, but also at prices that work. And for us, really more of that $50 to $150 or $200 kind of price points, and so we have a pretty broad range of prices that we have to offer. And it doesn't serve us well just to have kind of a democratic approach across every category that we're in. We need to step back and figure out where to invest the money to be a better gift destination for customers. And I can just tell you, in our experience of being around, it feels like the most purposeful attempt for us to improve in terms of being a gift destination. So we think we've learned a lot. And as Erik mentioned, anniversary, I think, was helpful in kind of understanding depth of stuff. So we feel good about our chance to have a good holiday as a result of that.
As you talked about price and what happens in Off-Price and Full-Price, it is a version of it that's applicable in both places, and we're trying to be thoughtful and surgical about how we're doing it. So I just think it puts extra focus on our ability to be good editors and curators, something we've been able to approach with some more objective information. We have better data than we've ever had before. So again, I think from our point of view, it feels like a less opinion-based thing and it's much more purposeful around objective information."

We started last year in L.A. really to do a lot of testing with customers, a lot of listening of how we can connect our digital and physical assets to better serve customers. This year, it's really been about scaling it in L.A. We started with our 4 stores in L.A. We've now expanded in particular that Buy Online Pick Up in Store, greater selection for next-day delivery across 16 stores in Los Angeles, Orange County as well as our 3 local stores. And we're seeing really tremendous traction on that service in particular. 
But stepping back, it's looking at our physical assets as points of engagement as much as they are points of sale. We really don't care where the sale gets rung up. And we continue to learn that those physical assets that when leveraged really how customers want make a tremendous difference. We've talked about Buy Online Pick Up in Store. We know our customers who use that service spend double those that don't use it.
I talked about alterations before. Alterations obviously something that can't be done digitally, and it's something we're really good at. We're the largest employer of tailors in North America. I think we have the best tailors that are out there. And we know that customers who are engaged in our alterations area, their spend triples. When a customer engages with a stylist, their spend goes up 5x.
So that engagement is really what we're looking for, be it with services, be it across channels. We know the more engagement we get with the customers, the better it is.

There's not a lot that you can easily quantify at this point, but I think certainly creating a road map for the future for us to bend the curve there. As Erik mentioned, I think we did a good job of identifying the key items and brands and styles that, that customers are responding to. So we've always had a pretty aggressive program on trying to identify and amplify emerging brands.
I guess what I can tell you is change is -- the cycle on all that stuff is shorter than it's ever been. So one of the things we need to do is identify new emerging brands and amplify them quickly. It isn't a matter of test and learn over a couple of years, a couple of stores in time. So I guess what I can say just more broadly is that I think we have more confidence in our ability to be able to pour on the gas when things are working well. And the same holds true for, perhaps, some legacy brands that are declining. And we have some very big, built-up, established businesses with some legacy brands where it's going the wrong way. So I just -- our teams have to be really good editors. They've got to be curious and they can't really use last year so much as a guide.
So the other thing I would say is thematically, really understanding the way price impacts classifications and just getting sharper about that has helped. So it's been kind of a tough goal for a while in Women's Apparel, but I think it's fair to say that we have optimism about our ability to make some improvements there, particularly starting in the back half of the year.
And then the other one was about -- I'm sorry, about New York specifically, Dana, so what was it?"

So we'll probably have more to say about that as we get in, but I think ultimately, the way you guys should be keeping score at is looking for us to -- look at it in terms of a market.
I would say, though, if you're asking us particularly in the near term how we're going to view the success, I think it's really along the lines of can we deliver a great customer experience there in all the ways that I think customers would expect from Nordstrom entering a market. There's plenty of places to buy things in New York. And if we're really successful there, it's because we do the little things better and the little things that are actually big things, just the way that we serve customers, a more relevant, a more convenient way, and we've heard that theme a lot. And we've got a good team of leaders that are ready to take that challenge on. So I think we'll be getting a lot of indications about our ultimate ability to be successful there based on the reaction that we get from customers and our ability to step up and do -- and deliver something that's best."

I would mainly point to those issues we've had across our Full-Price business, in fact, our Off-Price business as well: the loyalty, digital marketing and merchandise assortment. The loyalty, as we mentioned, we have good progress over the quarter. So we like the impression that we're there. The digital marketing, we're a little further behind in Off-Price than we are in Full-Price. We do have still some traffic opportunities in Off-Price. We feel much better about that.
In particular, what's unique about Off-Price, as we touched on our comments, is flash. We did a deep dive at the end of last year in all our flash events. We had a number of flash events that were, one, categories that we don't carry in our stores. And with the majority of our online returns coming back to our stores, that creates issues. But number two, they were unprofitable events. So we did a lot of editing, these flash events.
The flip side is what's really a plus about the flash model is the traffic generation, engagement mainly through e-mail that we give our customers who sign up at these flash events is terrific and helps us not only on the flash side, but helps us on our Rack.com site as well. So we felt the reduction in traffic from cutting back on those events. We started the last about 3 weeks back on more of our normal cadence there of flash events. And the key to there is not just quantity of flash events, it's the quality of flash events. And we feel really good about that. So feel good about flash events going forward that it's going to be differentiated in the first half. We feel good about the marketing that it's going to be differentiated in the first half.
The other point that [indiscernible] noticed here is the inventory position. I mean we're sitting here midway through the year with lots of open to buy across our company, but particularly in Off-Price. In Off-Price, the biggest driver of Off-Price business is having great merchandise and being opportunistic, especially in times like now that are tough for the industry. We're really excited about the position we're in to really pick up some compelling merchandise for our customers and get them into our Rack brand."

I think we mentioned that before that we had some out-of-stock issues that, at the beginning of the year, hurt us. And so we bent the curve there, and beauty improved quite a bit. To me, it has been a consistent story for quite some time as our Designer business across all categories, is positive, continues to be a good growth opportunity for us. Our MPG area did very well, our own product, that showed some improvement. That's good to see. And then lastly, I'd say that the lingerie and active areas in women's performed relatively better. 
The tougher areas for us is we had some slowdown in shoes. I think that represented a moment in time. We shall see. But that was a bit of a dip from where it was -- that shoes have been performing strongly. Men's had some challenges. I would say the biggest driver there that we've noticed, and this is not a surprise to those who follow our industry, but the continued kind of casualization of America. That impacts the men's business quite a bit. And so while we're still serving a lot of men and selling them things, the average price of what we're selling them oftentimes is less than it was when they were buying suits and ties and things of that nature. So there's adjustments we need to continue to make, but I think that -- those kind of represent the stronger-performing categories relative to the -- what we be performing from last quarter."

I mean -- and just to remind you, Q4 will actually have the occupancy from New York City baked into it. So I think from that, you can kind of baked it into your model.
As far as the Nordstrom Note, we gave that split roughly evenly for the second half. You can probably imagine if you are anniversary-ing that note redemption and the time it takes for people to accumulate and redeem, there's a cumulative effect. So it's not going to be completely even across the 2 quarters. But for the second half, it's roughly [indiscernible]."

In the second quarter, we delivered strong bottom line results, demonstrating our inventory and expense execution. We exited the quarter with inventory levels in a favorable position and made significant strides in productivity. We are implementing key learnings from the quarter to drive our top line and deliver bottom line results.
In the second quarter, sales were down 5.1%, which was around the low end of our expectations. Full-Price decreased 6.5% and Off-Price decreased 1.9%. We anticipated first quarter trends to continue, however, we had a slow start to the second quarter and softer results in both Full-Price and Off-Price.
Last quarter, we emphasized our top line focus related to loyalty, digital marketing and merchandising. We've seen good outcomes from our efforts, including improvement in Nordstrom Note redemptions. From a merchandise perspective, we're improving our in-stock levels and addressing a gap between our opening and higher price points. We ended the quarter in a strong inventory position, giving us the ability to better align our assortment in the second half of the year.
Now I'd like to provide insight into 2 drivers of our business performance, our Full-Price Anniversary Sale and our Off-Price business. Starting with the anniversary. This is a unique event featuring new arrivals at reduced prices for a limited time. Our anniversary strategy focused on 3 objectives: increasing customer satisfaction, driving sales and improving the economics of the event. We're seeing early indications that our event resonated well with customers. That said, we planned anniversary consistent with current trends, but sales were softer than expected.
Based on customer feedback, we curated our anniversary assortment to highlight their favorite brands, which drove higher sell-through of anniversary product relative to last year. We expect this to benefit merchandise margins in the third quarter, and we'll have a complete assessment of our overall anniversary results at that time. 
While we increased depth in top brands, it has become even more concentrated around key items. We did not have enough depth in key items, and we are actively addressing this in the second half, particularly with our top gift ideas for the holidays. 
During anniversary, we improved our operational metrics around satisfaction scores, delivery times in key markets and site performance. This includes initial survey feedback from our top loyalty customers who value the enhanced benefits such as earlier access to merchandise. We also leveraged our digital and physical assets through Buy Online Pick Up in Store, which increases customer engagement and is one of our most profitable transaction. During anniversary, sales from order pickup more than doubled over last year with nearly half coming from customers using this service for the first time. Customers who engage through order pickup tend to double their overall spend.
Turning to Off-Price. We are pleased with our profitability results. However, sales fell short of our expectations. Earlier this year, we made changes to improve our bottom line, which included reducing less profitable flash events. Because these events help drive meaningful traffic to our Nordstrom Rack and HauteLook sites, we are increasing the number of high-quality flash events in the second half. We are also accelerating our marketing efforts to drive traffic such as the upcoming launch of our Nordstrom Rack television brand campaign.
The Off-Price business ended the quarter in a strong inventory position, improving turns across all merchandise divisions. As we head into the second half, we are being opportunistic in the marketplace with plans to accelerate fall receipts.
In this dynamic retail environment, we are evolving our business to create a seamless shopping journey. Historically, we know that more than 1/3 of customers who place an online order will have visited the store to help inform that purchase, and half of our customers who make a purchase in our store will first spend time on one of our digital properties. Our local market strategy leverages our physical and digital assets to provide greater access to merchandise selection with faster delivery and at a lower cost to us. This strategy focuses on gaining market share in our most important markets by leveraging inventory and increasing customer engagement through the services we offer.
Our business is highly concentrated in our top markets with the top 10 accounting for 60% of our sales. This year, we scaled our local market strategy in Los Angeles, our largest market. We're seeing compelling results and predictive metrics for customer engagement and inventory efficiencies. We're seeing higher customer engagement and spend at our Nordstrom Local neighborhood service hub. Customers spend 2.5x more on average. These service hubs account for 30% of order pickup, and alterations increased by more than 10%. In addition, product returns are coming in 8 days faster, driving greater inventory efficiencies.
To leverage inventory across the broader L.A. market, we began offering customers up to 7x more selection that's available next day. This contributed to sales from order pickup nearly tripling in July. We are pleased with our results in L.A. and are accelerating key elements of our local market strategy in more of our top markets.
Our next milestone is expanding our presence in New York City, currently our largest market for online sales. This fall, we will significantly expand our presence with the opening of our flagship store and 2 Nordstrom Locals. We anticipate that the combination of our physical and digital assets will drive a meaningful sales lift in this important market. We will also leverage our 7 locations in New York City, including Nordstrom Rack and Trunk Club locations, to take care of our customers through services such as returns, order pickup and alterations.
In closing, we're focused on driving our top and bottom line results, and we are well positioned for the second half. Nordstrom has managed through many cycles, and we will continue to evolve our business to better serve customers on their terms no matter how they choose to shop.
I'll now turn it over to Anne to provide additional color on our financial performance and outlook."

Our second quarter earnings demonstrated our continued inventory and expense discipline.

Our second quarter earnings demonstrated our continued inventory and expense discipline. We are in a strong position to rebalance our merchandise assortment with customer demand across price points and key items. We also made significant progress in bending the expense curve, mitigating our sales shortfall.
Second quarter sales reflect a consistent traffic trend while conversion was softer relative to the first quarter. Heading into the second half, we continue to take aggressive actions related to loyalty, digital marketing and merchandise. Our progress in the second quarter and plans for the second half give us confidence in our ability to turn around our current trend.
Beginning with loyalty. We continue to grow the program with 12 million active customers, increasing 12% over last year and making up 64% of second quarter sales. We have addressed the execution related to Nordstrom Notes, and redemptions are in line with expectations. Enrollments are up over last year, and importantly, we saw a significant improvement in customer satisfaction scores during the quarter.
With respect to digital marketing, we increased our level of investment in Full-Price and have further plans to accelerate Off-Price. For example, in the first half, we had a 25% year-over-year reduction of flash events and plan to get back to prior year level with high-quality events. And third, in merchandising, we made initial investments in Women's Apparel to address the gap in our assortment from a price point perspective. We are encouraged by the sell-through performance, and we're accelerating plans for the second half.
In addition, we're applying our anniversary learnings to increase depth of key items. Specifically, for the holidays, we're amplifying our gift assortment across categories and increasing the mix of more accessible price points.
For the second quarter, our gross profit rate decreased 50 basis points from last year due to occupancy deleverage. Q2 merchandise margin rate relative to last year improved sequentially from Q1, and markdown levels were consistent with our expectations. We ended the quarter in a solid inventory position, reflecting 2 consecutive quarters with a positive spread to sales.
Expense performance well exceeded our expectations. Our SG&A rate in Q2 increased modestly by 26 basis points, reflecting fixed-cost deleverage on lower sales volumes. SG&A expense was down 4% compared to the previous year. This was primarily due to our expense savings in addition to performance-related adjustments. Today, we have delivered expense savings of $100 million, tracking ahead of our annual plan for $150 million to $200 million. Our efficiency initiatives include realignment of our support structure in stores, end-to-end process improvement in supply chain and technology and lower discretionary spend. These initiatives represent permanent reductions to our cost structure that position us well for strong EBIT flow-through.
During the second quarter, we also managed variable expenses well in a tough sales environment and maintained flat overhead expenses. Expenses related to digital capabilities, marketing, technology and supply chain were relatively flat to last year. Our 2Q EBIT margin of 5.7% deleveraged by 47 basis points over last year, a meaningful improvement from Q1. EBIT for our generational investments met our expectations.
Moving to the full year. We lowered the top end of our prior outlook for a revised EPS range of $3.25 to $3.50. We expect a sales decline of approximately 2% for the year versus the prior outlook range between a 2% decrease to flat growth. The impact of tariffs has not been incorporated into our outlook, but we believe it will be relatively immaterial for the year.
Now I'd like to provide color on our assumptions for the second half. Sales are expected to be flat at the midpoint, reflecting roughly a 400 basis point improvement from the first half. This incorporates 4 sales drivers, all of which are weighted equally. First, our merchandise plans include rebalancing our assortment, increasing depth of key items and accelerating opportunistic buys for Off-Price. Second, we are accelerating our marketing efforts, including our Nordstrom Rack television brand campaign and additional flash events in Off-Price while continuing digital marketing investments in Full-Price. Third, we will lap last year's Nordy Club launch with respect to Nordstrom Notes with most of the impact in the fourth quarter. And fourth, sales in the New York flagship opening on October 24 will primarily benefit the fourth quarter.
For the third quarter, we expect sales to improve modestly from the first half. We expect gross profit rate expansion from improved sell-through of anniversary product. We also expect our SG&A rate to deleverage from fixed costs, which includes preopening expenses for our New York flagship. Third quarter EBIT margin is expected to be relatively flat when excluding last year's estimated credit-related charge. For the fourth quarter, we expect the New York City flagship opening to contribute sales in the fourth quarter as well as occupancy deleverage.
Taking a step back, our framework to drive shareholder value remains consistent: gain market share, improve profitability and returns and maintain a disciplined capital allocation approach. We're focused on driving the top line, leveraging inventory and bending the expense curve. Over time, we expect our generational investments to further scale and contribute to improved profitability and return on invested capital.
We have a strong balance sheet and maintain a consistent approach to capital allocation. As we exit this year's heavy investment cycle, we expect moderating CapEx and accelerating free cash flow beyond 2019. CapEx levels are expected to moderate from 6% this year to 3% to 4% of sales, an appropriate level to fund our strategic objective. In terms of the long-term financial targets we shared a year ago, we're focused on delivering on our current year expectations and intend to revisit those targets after we finish the year.
In closing, our priorities are to drive our top line, improve profitability and execute key strategies to enhance the customer experience.
I'll now turn it over to Trina for Q&A."

We edited out some of the long tail of our brands and went deeper in our customers' favorite brands. That being said, we didn't go far enough. We simply ran out of our top items. Obviously, we have a long history with Anniversary Sale. There was a change this year in customer behavior. Certainly, we always see highly disproportionate amount of demand on our top items. What was different this year was how deep that disproportionate amount was. We saw more demand on our top items than we've seen previously. And we simply ran out faster of our top items than we had planned.
So we're encouraged that I think our buyers did a great job of picking the right items and putting the dollars in the best items. We just should have, could have done a better job of going deeper on those top items.
And another point, you brought up the Early Access portion. As we mentioned, we got a lot of good customer feedback on the changes we've made this year. But again, I think what could we have done better, we could have had deeper positions on our top items."

There's clearly -- being able to have a broad selection that customers are coming or accustomed to online, but being able to pick it up in stores resonates with lots and lots of customers. Just looking at a lot of retailers results these last couple of weeks, it seems to me there's a pretty common thread there of some successes in various categories of probably doing this. We've had BOPUS capabilities for quite some time. We did make some changes. And most impactfully in Los Angeles, we greatly increased the selection that customers have in doing a Buy Online Pick Up in Store for next day. Specifically, we're able to leverage the entire market's inventory that we have in stores and let the customer choose where they want to pick it up. We're able to move around that inventory very efficiently between our stores in the market, get it there quickly. And customers love it. Our customer satisfaction scores on that service are amongst the highest we have of anything we do.
And you mentioned the inventory implications of that. Part of our local market strategy is getting to a different level of inventory efficiency, in particular, having the capabilities of holding back inventory and allocating it as needed to -- be it stores or be it to customers' home. We haven't done that yet. We're still working on that. We've done some testing. We're getting in a position to do that. But we certainly think that, that's the next step of Nordstrom Local is getting even a bigger selection to customers, having fewer out-of-stocks and, for us, reaching another level of inventory efficiency."

And we just -- we're going to be much more purposeful at having the proper amount of inventory, first of all, in the gift classification that makes sense, but also at prices that work. And for us, really more of that $50 to $150 or $200 kind of price points, and so we have a pretty broad range of prices that we have to offer. And it doesn't serve us well just to have kind of a democratic approach across every category that we're in. We need to step back and figure out where to invest the money to be a better gift destination for customers. And I can just tell you, in our experience of being around, it feels like the most purposeful attempt for us to improve in terms of being a gift destination. So we think we've learned a lot. And as Erik mentioned, anniversary, I think, was helpful in kind of understanding depth of stuff. So we feel good about our chance to have a good holiday as a result of that.
As you talked about price and what happens in Off-Price and Full-Price, it is a version of it that's applicable in both places, and we're trying to be thoughtful and surgical about how we're doing it. So I just think it puts extra focus on our ability to be good editors and curators, something we've been able to approach with some more objective information. We have better data than we've ever had before. So again, I think from our point of view, it feels like a less opinion-based thing and it's much more purposeful around objective information."

We started last year in L.A. really to do a lot of testing with customers, a lot of listening of how we can connect our digital and physical assets to better serve customers. This year, it's really been about scaling it in L.A. We started with our 4 stores in L.A. We've now expanded in particular that Buy Online Pick Up in Store, greater selection for next-day delivery across 16 stores in Los Angeles, Orange County as well as our 3 local stores. And we're seeing really tremendous traction on that service in particular. 
But stepping back, it's looking at our physical assets as points of engagement as much as they are points of sale. We really don't care where the sale gets rung up. And we continue to learn that those physical assets that when leveraged really how customers want make a tremendous difference. We've talked about Buy Online Pick Up in Store. We know our customers who use that service spend double those that don't use it.
I talked about alterations before. Alterations obviously something that can't be done digitally, and it's something we're really good at. We're the largest employer of tailors in North America. I think we have the best tailors that are out there. And we know that customers who are engaged in our alterations area, their spend triples. When a customer engages with a stylist, their spend goes up 5x.
So that engagement is really what we're looking for, be it with services, be it across channels. We know the more engagement we get with the customers, the better it is. And through our local market strategy in particular, we feel really good that we've got some ways to leverage these physical assets that really resonate with customers."

There's not a lot that you can easily quantify at this point, but I think certainly creating a road map for the future for us to bend the curve there. As Erik mentioned, I think we did a good job of identifying the key items and brands and styles that, that customers are responding to. So we've always had a pretty aggressive program on trying to identify and amplify emerging brands.
I guess what I can tell you is change is -- the cycle on all that stuff is shorter than it's ever been. So one of the things we need to do is identify new emerging brands and amplify them quickly. It isn't a matter of test and learn over a couple of years, a couple of stores in time. So I guess what I can say just more broadly is that I think we have more confidence in our ability to be able to pour on the gas when things are working well. And the same holds true for, perhaps, some legacy brands that are declining. And we have some very big, built-up, established businesses with some legacy brands where it's going the wrong way. So I just -- our teams have to be really good editors. They've got to be curious and they can't really use last year so much as a guide.
So the other thing I would say is thematically, really understanding the way price impacts classifications and just getting sharper about that has helped. So it's been kind of a tough goal for a while in Women's Apparel, but I think it's fair to say that we have optimism about our ability to make some improvements there, particularly starting in the back half of the year.
And then the other one was about -- I'm sorry, about New York specifically, Dana, so what was it?"

But I think what Anne mentioned, really, the way that we look at it is by market. I think as we mentioned all the way long, already it's our largest online market. And we know when we have physical assets to a market like that, that we grow our online business considerably as well adding stores -- the sales in the physical stores as well. So we'll probably have more to say about that as we get in, but I think ultimately, the way you guys should be keeping score at is looking for us to -- look at it in terms of a market.
I would say, though, if you're asking us particularly in the near term how we're going to view the success, I think it's really along the lines of can we deliver a great customer experience there in all the ways that I think customers would expect from Nordstrom entering a market. There's plenty of places to buy things in New York. And if we're really successful there, it's because we do the little things better and the little things that are actually big things, just the way that we serve customers, a more relevant, a more convenient way, and we've heard that theme a lot. And we've got a good team of leaders that are ready to take that challenge on. So I think we'll be getting a lot of indications about our ultimate ability to be successful there based on the reaction that we get from customers and our ability to step up and do -- and deliver something that's best."

I would mainly point to those issues we've had across our Full-Price business, in fact, our Off-Price business as well: the loyalty, digital marketing and merchandise assortment. The loyalty, as we mentioned, we have good progress over the quarter. So we like the impression that we're there. The digital marketing, we're a little further behind in Off-Price than we are in Full-Price. We do have still some traffic opportunities in Off-Price. We feel much better about that.
In particular, what's unique about Off-Price, as we touched on our comments, is flash. We did a deep dive at the end of last year in all our flash events. We had a number of flash events that were, one, categories that we don't carry in our stores. And with the majority of our online returns coming back to our stores, that creates issues. But number two, they were unprofitable events. So we did a lot of editing, these flash events.
The flip side is what's really a plus about the flash model is the traffic generation, engagement mainly through e-mail that we give our customers who sign up at these flash events is terrific and helps us not only on the flash side, but helps us on our Rack.com site as well. So we felt the reduction in traffic from cutting back on those events. We started the last about 3 weeks back on more of our normal cadence there of flash events. And the key to there is not just quantity of flash events, it's the quality of flash events. And we feel really good about that. So feel good about flash events going forward that it's going to be differentiated in the first half. We feel good about the marketing that it's going to be differentiated in the first half.
The other point that [indiscernible] noticed here is the inventory position. I mean we're sitting here midway through the year with lots of open to buy across our company, but particularly in Off-Price. In Off-Price, the biggest driver of Off-Price business is having great merchandise and being opportunistic, especially in times like now that are tough for the industry. We're really excited about the position we're in to really pick up some compelling merchandise for our customers and get them into our Rack brand."

I think we mentioned that before that we had some out-of-stock issues that, at the beginning of the year, hurt us. And so we bent the curve there, and beauty improved quite a bit. To me, it has been a consistent story for quite some time as our Designer business across all categories, is positive, continues to be a good growth opportunity for us. Our MPG area did very well, our own product, that showed some improvement. That's good to see. And then lastly, I'd say that the lingerie and active areas in women's performed relatively better. 
The tougher areas for us is we had some slowdown in shoes. I think that represented a moment in time. We shall see. But that was a bit of a dip from where it was -- that shoes have been performing strongly. Men's had some challenges. I would say the biggest driver there that we've noticed, and this is not a surprise to those who follow our industry, but the continued kind of casualization of America. That impacts the men's business quite a bit. And so while we're still serving a lot of men and selling them things, the average price of what we're selling them oftentimes is less than it was when they were buying suits and ties and things of that nature. So there's adjustments we need to continue to make, but I think that -- those kind of represent the stronger-performing categories relative to the -- what we be performing from last quarter."

I mean -- and just to remind you, Q4 will actually have the occupancy from New York City baked into it. So I think from that, you can kind of baked it into your model.
As far as the Nordstrom Note, we gave that split roughly evenly for the second half. You can probably imagine if you are anniversary-ing that note redemption and the time it takes for people to accumulate and redeem, there's a cumulative effect.

Our market strategy is transforming our business model and how we're serving customers. We have a unique mix of assets, Full-Price, Off-Price, stores and online, and we are further linking our businesses to serve customers in new and differentiated ways. The success of our strategy in Los Angeles, adds to our confidence as we expand to our top 10 markets. We recently achieved an important milestone with the opening of the New York City flagship store, significantly increasing our presence in the world's top retail market. 
Turning to our third quarter results. Our earnings exceeded expectations, demonstrating substantial progress in the delivery of our strategy and strength of our operating discipline. Through our customer focus, we drove broad-based improvement and top line trend of more than 200 basis points relative to first half of the year. In particular, the Off-Price business delivered positive sales growth and increased profitability through strong inventory and expense execution. We're encouraged by the momentum in our Full-Price and Off-Price businesses as we execute our holiday strategy to establish Nordstrom as the gifting destination for customers. 
Through our focus on driving top and bottom line, we've made notable changes to 2 key events: our anniversary sale and holiday. As we discussed previously, the priorities for anniversary are to improve customer satisfaction, drive sales and increase profitability. Customer feedback from this year's event was positive, significantly raising satisfaction scores. We curated the assortment by building more depth in key brands and items, driving higher sell-throughs. As a result, we had fewer markdowns on anniversary product in the third quarter, which contributed substantially to merchandise margins. 
For the holidays, we're meaningfully expanding our gifting offer across Full-Price and Off-Price, and making it easier for customers to find gifts by recipient and price point. We're also making shopping more convenient with services such as free next day shipping, 24/7 order pickup and complementary gift wrapping. The momentum in our Off-Price business delivered positive sales growth on less inventory. We also increased turns for the eighth consecutive quarter and exceeded bottom line expectations. We've been purposeful about improving inventory flow, refining product allocation and emphasizing merchandise that's seasonally relevant. Our favorable inventory position allows us to be opportunistic in the marketplace and leads to having a good flow of new product for customers to discover. 
Another way we're leveraging inventory is through our market strategy. Investments in digital capabilities, along with assets of people, product and place enable us to serve customers on their terms. Our goal is to gain market share while driving customer engagement and inventory efficiencies. There are 2 elements to this strategy. First, we're giving customers greater merchandise selection with faster delivery without increasing inventory levels. Second, we're engaging with customers by offering express services such as order pickup, returns and alterations at additional locations. We first launched our market strategy in Los Angeles, our largest market, where results are exceeding expectations. Third quarter sales growth outpaced other markets by 100 basis points. In L.A., the growth in customers shopping in stores and online was also 100 basis points higher than our average. We anticipate that these customers will increase their spend by 4x. Additionally, merchandise sell-throughs were higher in these stores than in other markets, contributing to profitability. We recently rolled out our market strategy in New York City, San Francisco, Chicago and Dallas. In the broader New York City market, customers now have faster access to inventory across 8 full-line stores, including our flagship and our fulfillment center. This represents 7x more selection available for same-day pickup or next-day delivery. 
Leveraging existing store assets and digital capabilities enabled us to implement this shared inventory approach without making additional material investments. Order pickup is our most profitable transaction, and the fourth quarter accounts for 40% of its volume. This represents a meaningful opportunity to increase convenience for customers during the holidays and at a lower cost for us. Going forward, we're accelerating this strategy to our remaining top 10 markets by the end of 2020 through a continued focus on shared inventory and access to services. This includes plans to open more Nordstrom local service hubs in Los Angeles and New York. We will leverage additional Rack locations to offer express services such as order pickup, returns and alterations. And finally, we opened our New York City flagship store on October 24. We've seen strong customer response with 85,000 visits during the opening weekend alone. New York City represents our largest online market, and we expect to see a halo effect when we open a physical location. Already, the sales uptake in the men's store is exceeding expectations. In addition, 1 of Nordstrom's key points of difference is the breadth of our merchandise assortment, which creates an inclusive shopping experience. Customers at this store have responded to our offering and top-performing brands include Nordstrom-Made Labels, Topshop, Nike, Canada Goose, Louis Vuitton and Valentino. Opening this flagship has been perhaps the most important milestone in our company's long history is the culmination of efforts across so many people, and we are grateful to them all. First of all, the many Nordstrom alumni who, over the years, established the reputation with customers and as an employer that allowed us opportunity be there for us. And to our current team across the company our business is about team, and this has never been more true. We are proud of their dedication and passion in bringing this store to life. Pete and I feel most fortunate to work with so many talented, caring and hard working people. I'll now turn it over to Anne to discuss our financial results and expectations for the remainder of the year."

We made meaningful progress in improving the customer service and continuing our operational discipline. The consistent strength of our inventory and expense execution contributed to EBIT margin expansion for the quarter. We are delivering on our strategy while driving top and bottom line goals. 
Third quarter sales decreased 2.2%, in line with expectations. Full-Price decreased 4.1% and Off-Price increased 1.2%. Sales trends improved by more than 200 basis points from the first half of the year. We saw broad-based improvement across Full-Price and Off-Price driven by actions we're taking related to loyalty, digital marketing and merchandise assortment. Digital sales represented 34% of our business, up 300 basis points from a year ago. We saw sequential improvement in digital trends throughout the quarter, most notably at nordstrom.com. 
Customer satisfaction scores on our loyalty program continued to rebound, and digital marketing efforts are driving traffic. As we rebalance our merchandise assortment, we are increasing depth in key items in Full-Price and accelerating seasonal receipts in Off-Price. All merchandise divisions in both businesses improved relative to the first half of the year. Our gross profit rate increased by 100 basis points over last year. We had fewer markdowns as a result of disciplined inventory management and Off-Price and higher sell-through of anniversary product in Full-Price. We ended the quarter in a favorable inventory position, down 2.7%, and we maintain a positive spread between sales and inventory for the third consecutive quarter. 
Our strong expense discipline drove our third quarter earnings beat. Expenses were down 2% from last year, excluding the credit charge in 2018, and preopening expenses for the New York City flagship. As a reminder, we planned $35 million in preopening expenses, of which roughly $10 million was incurred in the first half and $25 million in Q3. We continue to reduce our fixed cost by realigning our support structure in stores, making end-to-end process improvements in supply chain and technology and minimizing discretionary spend. 
Year-to-date, we have achieved $107 million in savings and expect to well exceed our plan of $150 million to $200 million for the year. Our financial position remains strong. We apply a consistent approach that balances reinvesting in the business and returning capital to shareholders. For the past several years, we have made significant investments in new markets and in digital capabilities to fuel future growth. With the opening of the New York City flagship, we're exiting this generational investment cycle. As a result, we expect CapEx to slow down from 6% of sales this year to 3% to 4% beginning in 2020. This reflects a normalized level inclusive of our market strategy investments related to technology, supply chain and additional Nordstrom. We anticipate that moderating CapEx will accelerate free cash flow next year. 
We remain committed to our investment-grade credit rating. Adjusted debt to EBITDAR was 2.8x, and we expect it to be roughly 2.7x by the end of the year, in line with 2018. On November 6, we issued $500 million in debt, and in early December, we expect to use the proceeds to fully retire the outstanding May 2020 notes. A onetime financing charge of approximately $0.04 in the fourth quarter is not included in our revised EPS outlook. 
Turning to our expectations for the full year, we updated our EPS outlook by raising the low end of our range by $0.05. We're maintaining our annual expectations for a sales decrease of approximately 2%. We expect SG&A dollars to be down roughly 1% for the year when excluding last year's credit charge, gross profit rate is expected to be relatively flat. 
As you may recall, we planned sales growth in the second half to reflect a 400 basis point improvement from the first half, and we are on track to meet these expectations. For the fourth quarter, the New York City flagship is expected to contribute approximately 150 basis points of growth, and the remainder is evenly weighted across 3 drivers. Merchandise assortment, loyalty and digital Marketing. As a reminder, gross profit is expected to deleverage from occupancy costs for the New York City flagship. Merchandise margin rate is planned flat, which contemplates a continued promotional environment. 
To wrap up, we're pleased with our third quarter results. We made significant strides in delivering on our strategy, and we're encouraged by the customer response. Our achievements, including strong Off-Price execution, improved anniversary economics, success of our market strategy and the New York City flagship reflect continued focus on the customer and operating discipline.

What's different in New York-based from what you've learned in Los Angeles? And it seems to be really feeding into this kind of overall improvement in the profitability of the company as these capabilities come online. Is that the right way to think about it into next year as you expand to even further market, in new markets?"

I mean, none of these strategies work if it doesn't resonate with customers. A lot of customers, certainly, all customers like more selection, and we receive things faster. But a good chunk of customers like the control of picking up in store, be it an apartment without a doorman or things you can store at their porch or they want to try it on before they take it home, having that alternative means a lot. Secondly, how you should think about after relevance. It's really about leveraging, for the most part, existing assets that we have to serve the customers better. So it's really efficient for us. Our biggest investment is inventory and inventory in stores, in particular, and that inventory store is close to customers. So being able to leverage that inventory to give customers bigger selection at a faster delivery is terrific, but also helps efficiency of our inventory significantly. 
I think as what we learned in New York, so far, and I think that makes sense. But it's -- we opened 2 local service hubs in September. And the traffic to those have ramped both those has ramped up much faster than what we saw in Los Angeles. It's just more intuitive to customers who live in New York, that they're not getting in their SUV and driving to a parking lot. So to be able to have a neighborhood service where they can do returns and receive pickups and alterations, customers get it immediately. Our traffic in those locations of the locals have been very strong. And it's also, we're utilizing our Manhattan Rack locations as well for those services and the uptake on those services has significantly exceeded our expectations."

In terms of balancing our assortments and relative to price points and I guess, what I would say about that is we're really in the early innings of it because we really landed on the strategy and tactically got after it a couple of months ago, but the lead time is pretty long, particularly in the Full-Price part of the business.

Digital marketing is becoming more productive for us. We're seeing increased traffic online, and we believe there's still some runway there. The merchandise piece, having the right balance Pete just touched on. The other comment I'd just make on our digital sales is we view digital sales as a mean to an end as opposed to the end, in and of itself. And what that means is we look at our digital assets like our other assets, how do we get so we can serve customers better, and often in unique ways. And going to tie back to our market strategy. And I think some good examples of how much order pickup in stores is driving online sales growth. So overall, for the quarter, 1/2 of our digital sales growth came from order pickup. And in Los Angeles, where we're most advanced in our market strategy, it was 2/3 of our digital sales growth came from in-store order pickup. So that's going to be a big part moving forward.

And that's really reflected in what we're seeing in the top line and bottom line results. So we talked about that, we also talked about the fact in Q3, the sell-through in our anniversary product, we have fewer markets and sell-through was really high, which is very intentional part of our anniversary strategy, so that certainly help our merchandise margin rate for Q3. And we did see a highly promotional environment, but those 2 factors between anniversary markdown and our Off-Price business really helped offset any promotional headwinds we might have seen in that quarter. In the fourth quarter, going in to it from a holiday perspective, we've actually pulled forward some of our holiday receipts. We've set holiday gifting, if you go on our site or on our stores, you'll see that we have a very deliberate message on gifting at certain price points just for the customer and what they're looking for because we know from our customer feedback, people buy at certain times for certain people at certain price points really tailored the strategy and the inventory levels to match that. And so you're seeing that both in our Off-Price business and in our Full-Price business. And so we're -- and I was about say that we've got -- we're very encouraged by the early reads we're seeing in our gifting strategy as we earlier than we did last year."

And you would think that, that practical experience, which is all we need, but the changing landscape relative to how much more online business we've done in the past, and it is -- and it grows disproportionately, and we have more online business. At that time, that happens, the anniversary also happens with holiday that it impacts really the profitability of the event. So it felt great that we went into it with a plan and to improve really the bottom line performance, and that has worked. I will tell you that we weren't able to get after this plan early enough to fully impact, I think, what's possible with that event. So I think the good news is that the event went very well, and there's a lot of reason to believe that we will be able to improve upon it again for next year because we have the full year to be able to plan for it. So I think what that implies for holiday, there's a lot of similarities in that they're time-bound events. And there's very specific actions related to price in the category that are applicable from anniversary to the holiday time. So we believe that we've got some proof there that we're on the right track and with the right strategy and it's nice to see kind of how our teams responded to all that. And their confidence about how to attack all being again anniversary next year on the heels of what was the successful anniversary. So it's all been positive so far."

And in New York, we expand that to not only be able to do returns from any of our businesses, but to order pickups from any of our businesses. So nordstrom.com, buy online, pickup in store, and we have alterations available as well. The response to that is has exceeded our expectations. We thought the point if you good. It's been especially good, so we're putting a plan together to roll that out to more Racks, and we'll share that with you once we have that set. The other piece I would just remind you, again, it's -- everything starts with giving customers things they like. And a lot of customers, the convenience of going into a Rack, they really appreciate. But on the business side, getting customer engagement across channels drives a lot of value. When a customer goes from engaging with us in 1 of our businesses to 2, their spend with us increases 4x.

Our market strategy is transforming our business model and how we're serving customers. We have a unique mix of assets, Full-Price, Off-Price, stores and online, and we are further linking our businesses to serve customers in new and differentiated ways. The success of our strategy in Los Angeles adds to our confidence as we expand to our top 10 markets. We recently achieved an important milestone with the opening of the New York City flagship store, significantly increasing our presence in the world's top retail market. 
Turning to our third quarter results. Our earnings exceeded expectations, demonstrating substantial progress in the delivery of our strategy and strength of our operating discipline. Through our customer focus, we drove broad-based improvement and top line trend of more than 200 basis points relative to first half of the year. In particular, the Off-Price business delivered positive sales growth and increased profitability through strong inventory and expense execution. We're encouraged by the momentum in our Full-Price and Off-Price businesses as we execute our holiday strategy to establish Nordstrom as a gifting destination for customers. 
Through our focus on driving top and bottom line, we've made notable changes to 2 key events: our Anniversary Sale and holiday. As we discussed previously, the priorities for Anniversary are to improve customer satisfaction, drive sales and increase profitability. Customer feedback from this year's event was positive, significantly raising satisfaction scores. We curated the assortment by building more depth in key brands and items, driving higher sell-throughs. As a result, we had fewer markdowns on Anniversary product in the third quarter, which contributed substantially to merchandise margins. 
For the holidays, we're meaningfully expanding our gifting offer across Full-Price and Off-Price, and making it easier for customers to find gifts by recipient and price point. We're also making shopping more convenient with services such as free next day shipping, 24/7 order pickup and complementary gift wrapping. The momentum in our Off-Price business delivered positive sales growth on less inventory. We also increased turns for the eighth consecutive quarter and exceeded bottom line expectations. We've been purposeful about improving inventory flow, refining product allocation and emphasizing merchandise that's seasonally relevant. Our favorable inventory position allows us to be opportunistic in the marketplace and leads to having a good flow of new product for customers to discover. 
Another way we're leveraging inventory is through our market strategy. Investments in digital capabilities, along with assets of people, product and place, enable us to serve customers on their terms. Our goal is to gain market share while driving customer engagement and inventory efficiencies. There are 2 elements to this strategy. First, we're giving customers greater merchandise selection with faster delivery without increasing inventory levels. Second, we're engaging with customers by offering express services such as order pickup, returns and alterations at additional locations. We first launched our market strategy in Los Angeles, our largest market, where results are exceeding expectations. Third quarter sales growth outpaced other markets by 100 basis points. In L.A., the growth in customers shopping in stores and online was also 100 basis points higher than our average. We anticipate that these customers will increase their spend by 4x. Additionally, merchandise sell-throughs were higher in these stores than in other markets, contributing to profitability. We recently rolled out our market strategy in New York City, San Francisco, Chicago and Dallas. In the broader New York City market, customers now have faster access to inventory across 8 full-line stores, including our flagship and our fulfillment center. This represents 7x more selection available for same-day pickup or next-day delivery. 
Leveraging existing store assets and digital capabilities enabled us to implement this shared inventory approach without making additional material investments. Order pickup is our most profitable transaction, and the fourth quarter accounts for 40% of its volume. This represents a meaningful opportunity to increase convenience for customers during the holidays and at a lower cost for us. Going forward, we're accelerating this strategy to our remaining top 10 markets by the end of 2020 through a continued focus on shared inventory and access to services. This includes plans to open more Nordstrom local service hubs in Los Angeles and New York. We will leverage additional Rack locations to offer express services such as order pickup, returns and alterations. And finally, we opened our New York City flagship store on October 24. We've seen strong customer response with 85,000 visits during the opening weekend alone. New York City represents our largest online market, and we expect to see a halo effect when we open a physical location. Already, the sales uptick in the men's store is exceeding expectations. In addition, 1 of Nordstrom's key points of difference is the breadth of our merchandise assortment, which creates an inclusive shopping experience. Customers at this store have responded to our offering and top-performing brands include Nordstrom-made labels, Topshop, Nike, Canada Goose, Louis Vuitton and Valentino. Opening this flagship has been perhaps the most important milestone in our company's long history. It is the culmination of efforts across so many people, and we are grateful to them all. First of all, the many Nordstrom alumni who, over the years, established a reputation with customers and as an employer that allowed opportunity to be there for us. And to our current team across the company, our business is about team, and this has never been more true. We are proud of their dedication and passion in bringing this store to life. Pete and I feel most fortunate to work with so many talented, caring and hardworking people. I'll now turn it over to Anne to discuss our financial results and expectations for the remainder of the year."

We made meaningful progress in improving the customer service and continuing our operational discipline. The consistent strength of our inventory and expense execution contributed to EBIT margin expansion for the quarter. We are delivering on our strategy while driving top and bottom line results. 
Third quarter sales decreased 2.2%, in line with expectations. Full-Price decreased 4.1% and Off-Price increased 1.2%. Sales trends improved by more than 200 basis points from the first half of the year. We saw broad-based improvement across Full-Price and Off-Price, driven by actions we're taking related to loyalty, digital marketing and merchandise assortment. Digital sales represented 34% of our business, up 300 basis points from a year ago. We saw sequential improvement in digital trends throughout the quarter, most notably at nordstrom.com. 
Customer satisfaction scores on our loyalty program continue to rebound, and digital marketing efforts are driving traffic. As we rebalance our merchandise assortment, we are increasing depth in key items in Full-Price and accelerating seasonal receipts in Off-Price. All merchandise divisions in both businesses improved relative to the first half of the year. Our gross profit rate increased by 100 basis points over last year. We had fewer markdowns as the result of disciplined inventory management in Off-Price and higher sell-through of Anniversary product in Full-Price. We ended the quarter in a favorable inventory position, down 2.7%, and we maintained a positive spread between sales and inventory for the third consecutive quarter. 
Our strong expense discipline drove our third quarter earnings [ beat ] . Expenses were down 2% from last year, excluding the credit charge in 2018, and preopening expenses for the New York City flagship. As a reminder, we planned $35 million in preopening expenses, of which roughly $10 million was incurred in the first half and $25 million in Q3. We continue to reduce our fixed cost by realigning our support structure in stores, making end-to-end process improvements in supply chain and technology and minimizing discretionary spend. 
Year-to-date, we have achieved $107 million in savings and expect to well exceed our plan of $150 million to $200 million for the year. Our financial position remains strong. We apply a consistent approach that balances reinvesting in the business and returning capital to shareholders. For the past several years, we have made significant investments in new markets and in digital capabilities to fuel future growth. With the opening of the New York City flagship, we're exiting this generational investment cycle. As a result, we expect CapEx to slow down from 6% of sales this year to 3% to 4% beginning in 2020. This reflects a normalized level inclusive of our market strategy investments related to technology, supply chain and additional Nordstrom locals. We anticipate that moderating CapEx will accelerate free cash flow next year. 
We remain committed to our investment-grade credit rating. Adjusted debt to EBITDAR was 2.8x, and we expect it to be roughly 2.7x by the end of the year, in line with 2018. On November 6, we issued $500 million in debt, and in early December, we expect to use the proceeds to fully retire the outstanding May 2020 notes. A onetime financing charge of approximately $0.04 in the fourth quarter is not included in our revised EPS outlook. 
Turning to our expectations for the full year, we updated our EPS outlook by raising the low end of our range by $0.05. We're maintaining our annual expectations for a sales decrease of approximately 2%. We expect SG&A dollars to be down roughly 1% for the year when excluding last year's credit charge. Gross profit rate is expected to be relatively flat. 
As you may recall, we planned sales growth in the second half to reflect a 400 basis point improvement from the first half, and we are on track to meet these expectations. For the fourth quarter, the New York City flagship is expected to contribute approximately 150 basis points of growth, and the remainder is evenly weighted across 3 drivers: merchandise assortment, loyalty and digital marketing. As a reminder, gross profit is expected to deleverage from occupancy cost for the New York City flagship. Merchandise margin rate is planned flat, which contemplates a continued promotional environment. 
To wrap up, we're pleased with our third quarter results. We made significant strides in delivering on our strategy, and we're encouraged by the customer response. Our achievements, including strong Off-Price execution, improved Anniversary economics, success of our market strategy and the New York City flagship reflect continued focus on the customer and operating discipline.

I wanted to ask some follow-ups around the omnichannel initiatives, what you're seeing in the local market strategy, dive in a little bit deeper on New York, and I think you'd now rolled out San Francisco, Dallas, Chicago. What's different in New York, base it from what you've learned in Los Angeles?

I mean, none of these strategies work if it doesn't resonate with customers. A lot of customers, certainly, all customers like more selection, and receiving things faster. But a good chunk of customers like the control of picking up in store, be it an apartment without a doorman, or things you can -- store them at their porch, or they want to try it on before they take it home, having that alternative means a lot. Secondly, how you should think about after, kind of relevance. It's really about leveraging, for the most part, existing assets that we have to serve the customers better. So it's really efficient for us. Our biggest investment is inventory, and inventory in stores, in particular, and that inventory store is close to customers. So being able to leverage that inventory to give customers bigger selection at a faster delivery is terrific, but it also helps the efficiency of our inventory significantly. 
I think you asked what we learned in New York so far, and I think this makes sense. But it's -- we opened 2 local service hubs in September. And the traffic to those has ramped -- both of those has ramped up much faster than what we saw in Los Angeles. It's just more intuitive to customers who live in New York, that they're not getting in their SUV and driving to a parking lot. So to be able to have a neighborhood service hub where they can do returns and roadside pickups and alterations, customers get it immediately. Our traffic in those locations, with the locals has been very strong. And it's also, we're utilizing our Manhattan Rack locations as well for those services and the uptake on those services has significantly exceeded our expectations."

Hey Oliver, it's Pete. In terms of balancing our assortments and relative to price points and I guess, what I would say about that is we're really in the early innings of it because we really landed on the strategy and tactically got after it a couple of months ago, but the lead time's pretty long, particularly in the Full-Price part of the business. And it's not something you can affect in a very short-term because largely what you're dealing with are MSRP's, and so it's not how we bring in and choose to market down. It's coming in at regular price. And so what we have to do with the assortment and the selection upfront. I think as long as we, and we will do this, continue to ground our efforts and actions around customer data so that we have a more objective view and I think it's good -- I think it's the right place. And what you should expect to see is continuous improvement on those lines over the next several months. We're not here to declare victory, that we get all A's at this moment.

Digital marketing is becoming more productive for us. We're seeing increased traffic online, and we believe there's still some runway there. The merchandise piece, having the right balance Pete just touched on. The other comment I'd just make on our digital sales is, we view digital sales as a mean to an end as opposed to the end, in and of itself. And what that means is, we look at our digital assets like our other assets, how do we get to -- before we can serve customers better, and in often in unique ways. And it kind of ties back to our market strategy. And I think some good examples of how much order pickup in stores is driving online sales growth. So overall, for the quarter, 1/2 of our digital sales growth came from order pickup. And in Los Angeles, where we're most advanced in our market strategy, it was 2/3 of our digital sales growth came from in-store order pickup. So that's going to be a big part moving forward. And we are like barely in the first inning on that one."

So I guess what I can tell you about that is we pay close attention, we're monitoring what's going on everywhere. And we're working closely with vendors to make sure that whatever adjustments we need to make, we can make them quickly, and so that customers feel like they can trust our pricing and everything, so it's just part of our ongoing long-term strategy about making sure that we're really staying close to it.

So coming into our inventory position. Overall, we're very, very pleased. I think, as both Erik and I referred to in our comments, in particular, our Off-Price business has done a remarkable job of increasing their inventory turn, a much, I think, more fluid flow model and being very opportunistic in the marketplace as far as seasonal relevant goods in the Off-Price space. And that's really reflected in what we're seeing in the top line and the bottom line results. So we talked about that, we also talked about the fact in Q3, the sell-through in our Anniversary product, we had fewer mark-ups and sell-through was really high, which was very intentional on part of our Anniversary strategy, so that certainly helped our merchandise margin rate for Q3. And we did see a highly promotional environment, but those 2 factors, between Anniversary markdown and our Off-Price business really helped to offset any promotional headwinds we might have seen in that quarter. In the fourth quarter, going in to it from a holiday perspective, we've actually pulled forward some of our holiday receipts. We've set holiday gifting, if you go on our site or in our stores, you'll see that we have a very deliberate message on gifting at certain price points just for the customer and what they're looking for, because we know from our customer feedback, people buy at certain times for certain people at certain price points, so we've really tailored the strategy and the inventory levels to match that. And so you're seeing that both in our Off-Price business and in our Full-Price business. And so we're real -- and I would also say that we've got -- we're very encouraged by the early reads we're seeing in our gifting strategy as we set that earlier than we did last year."

We're early days on it, but we're seeing so far, when we can connect our whole market's worth of inventory. Proportionally, the small stores benefit the most. And I think it makes sense. It's the biggest increase in inventory, what's available for next-day delivery or next-day buy in store, buy online, pickup in store. So I think the point there is, is we're learning a lot. And the fate of small stores is not sealed or determined. And it's part of what we're excited about with our market strategy is, the convenience, the kind of intimacy of a smaller store that customers like, if we can materially change the selections available to them, then those stores could be on a different trajectory. And so we still need to play that out and see what happens there."

At that time, if that happens, and the Anniversary also happens at holiday, that it impacts really the profitability of the event. So it felt great that we went into it with a plan and to improve really the bottom line performance, and that has worked. I will tell you that we weren't able to get after this plan early enough to fully impact, I think, what's possible with that event. So I think the good news is that event went very well, and there's a lot of reason to believe that we will be able to improve upon it again for next year because we have the full year to be able to plan for it. And so I think what that implies for holiday, there's a lot of similarities in that they're time-bound events. And there's very specific actions related to price in the category that are applicable from anniversary to the holiday time. So we believe that we've got some proof there that we're on the right track and with the right strategy and it's nice to see kind of how our teams respond to all that. And their confidence about how to attack holiday and get Anniversary next year, on the heels of what was a successful Anniversary. So it's all been positive so far."

Now Appalachian store is a tremendous asset to add to the market. But it's, as we mentioned, Manhattan is our largest market for online sales. We opened 2 local service hubs. We had 2 Rack stores there, as well as a Trunk Club clubhouse. So we've been expanding for a bit now of having express returns in Rack stores, where customers can return Full-Price merchandise. And in New York, we expand that to not only be able to do returns from any of our businesses, but to do order pickups from any of our businesses. So nordstrom.com, buy online, pickup in store, and we have alterations available as well. The response to that has exceeded our expectations. We thought [indiscernible] would be good.

And a lot of customers, the convenience of going into a Rack, they really appreciate. But on the business side, getting customer engagement across channels drives a lot of value. When a customer goes from engaging with us in 1 of our businesses to 2, their spend with us increases 4x.

Our market strategy is transforming our business model and how we're serving customers. We have a unique mix of assets, Full-Price, Off-Price, stores and online, and we are further linking our businesses to serve customers in new and differentiated ways. The success of our strategy in Los Angeles adds to our confidence as we expand to our top 10 markets. We recently achieved an important milestone with the opening of the New York City flagship store, significantly increasing our presence in the world's top retail market. 
Turning to our third quarter results. Our earnings exceeded expectations, demonstrating substantial progress in the delivery of our strategy and strength of our operating discipline. Through our customer focus, we drove broad-based improvement and top line trend of more than 200 basis points relative to first half of the year. In particular, the Off-Price business delivered positive sales growth and increased profitability through strong inventory and expense execution. We're encouraged by the momentum in our Full-Price and Off-Price businesses as we execute our holiday strategy to establish Nordstrom as a gifting destination for customers. 
Through our focus on driving top and bottom line, we've made notable changes to 2 key events: our Anniversary Sale and holiday. As we discussed previously, the priorities for Anniversary are to improve customer satisfaction, drive sales and increase profitability. Customer feedback from this year's event was positive, significantly raising satisfaction scores. We curated the assortment by building more depth in key brands and items, driving higher sell-throughs. As a result, we had fewer markdowns on Anniversary product in the third quarter, which contributed substantially to merchandise margins. 
For the holidays, we're meaningfully expanding our gifting offer across Full-Price and Off-Price, and making it easier for customers to find gifts by recipient and price point. We're also making shopping more convenient with services such as free next-day shipping, 24/7 order pickup and complimentary gift wrapping. The momentum in our Off-Price business delivered positive sales growth on less inventory. We also increased turns for the eighth consecutive quarter and exceeded bottom line expectations. We've been purposeful about improving inventory flow, refining product allocation and emphasizing merchandise that's seasonally relevant. Our favorable inventory position allows us to be opportunistic in the marketplace and leads to having a good flow of new product for customers to discover. 
Another way we're leveraging inventory is through our market strategy. Investments in digital capabilities, along with assets of people, product and place, enable us to serve customers on their terms. Our goal is to gain market share while driving customer engagement and inventory efficiencies. There are 2 elements to this strategy: first, we're giving customers greater merchandise selection with faster delivery without increasing inventory levels; second, we're engaging with customers by offering express services such as order pickup, returns and alterations at additional locations. We first launched our market strategy in Los Angeles, our largest market, where results are exceeding expectations. Third quarter sales growth outpaced other markets by 100 basis points. In L.A., the growth in customers shopping in stores and online was also 100 basis points higher than our average. We anticipate that these customers will increase their spend by 4x. Additionally, merchandise sell-throughs were higher in these stores than in other markets, contributing to profitability. We recently rolled out our market strategy in New York City, San Francisco, Chicago and Dallas. In the broader New York City market, customers now have faster access to inventory across 8 full-line stores, including our flagship and our fulfillment center. This represents 7x more selection available for same-day pickup or next-day delivery. 
Leveraging existing store assets and digital capabilities enabled us to implement this shared inventory approach without making additional material investments. Order pickup is our most profitable transaction, and the fourth quarter accounts for 40% of its volume. This represents a meaningful opportunity to increase convenience for customers during the holidays and at a lower cost for us. Going forward, we're accelerating this strategy to our remaining top 10 markets by the end of 2020 through a continued focus on shared inventory and access to services. This includes plans to open more Nordstrom local service hubs in Los Angeles and New York. We will leverage additional Rack locations to offer express services such as order pickup, returns and alterations. And finally, we opened our New York City flagship store on October 24. We've seen strong customer response with 85,000 visits during the opening weekend alone. New York City represents our largest online market, and we expect to see a halo effect when we open a physical location. Already, the sales uptick in the men's store is exceeding expectations. In addition, 1 of Nordstrom's key points of difference is the breadth of our merchandise assortment, which creates an inclusive shopping experience. Customers at this store have responded to our offering and top-performing brands include Nordstrom-made labels, Topshop, Nike, Canada Goose, Louis Vuitton and Valentino. Opening this flagship has been perhaps the most important milestone in our company's long history. It is the culmination of efforts across so many people, and we are grateful to them all. First of all, the many Nordstrom alumni who, over the years, established a reputation with customers and as an employer that allowed this opportunity to be there for us. And to our current team across the company, our business is about team, and this has never been more true. We are proud of their dedication and passion in bringing this store to life. Pete and I feel most fortunate to work with so many talented, caring and hardworking people. I'll now turn it over to Anne to discuss our financial results and expectations for the remainder of the year."

We made meaningful progress in improving the customer service and continuing our operational discipline. The consistent strength of our inventory and expense execution contributed to EBIT margin expansion for the quarter. We are delivering on our strategy while driving top and bottom line results. 
Third quarter sales decreased 2.2%, in line with expectations. Full-Price decreased 4.1% and Off-Price increased 1.2%. Sales trends improved by more than 200 basis points from the first half of the year. We saw broad-based improvement across Full-Price and Off-Price, driven by actions we're taking related to loyalty, digital marketing and merchandise assortment. Digital sales represented 34% of our business, up 300 basis points from a year ago. We saw sequential improvement in digital trends throughout the quarter, most notably at nordstrom.com. 
Customer satisfaction scores on our loyalty program continue to rebound, and digital marketing efforts are driving traffic. As we rebalance our merchandise assortment, we are increasing depth in key items in Full-Price and accelerating seasonal receipts in Off-Price. All merchandise divisions in both businesses improved relative to the first half of the year. Our gross profit rate increased by 100 basis points over last year. We had fewer markdowns as a result of disciplined inventory management in Off-Price and higher sell-through of Anniversary product in Full-Price. We ended the quarter in a favorable inventory position, down 2.7%, and we maintained a positive spread between sales and inventory for the third consecutive quarter. 
Our strong expense discipline drove our third quarter earnings beat. Expenses were down 2% from last year, excluding the credit charge in 2018, and preopening expenses for the New York City flagship. As a reminder, we planned $35 million in preopening expenses, of which roughly $10 million was incurred in the first half and $25 million in Q3. We continue to reduce our fixed cost by realigning our support structure in stores, making end-to-end process improvements in supply chain and technology and minimizing discretionary spend. 
Year-to-date, we have achieved $170 million in savings and expect to well exceed our plan of $150 million to $200 million for the year. Our financial position remains strong. We apply a consistent approach that balances reinvesting in the business and returning capital to shareholders. For the past several years, we have made significant investments in new markets and in digital capabilities to fuel future growth. With the opening of the New York City flagship, we're exiting this generational investment cycle. As a result, we expect CapEx to slow down from 6% of sales this year to 3% to 4% beginning in 2020. This reflects a normalized level inclusive of our market strategy investments related to technology, supply chain and additional Nordstrom locals. We anticipate that moderating CapEx will accelerate free cash flow next year. 
We remain committed to our investment-grade credit rating. Adjusted debt to EBITDAR was 2.8x, and we expect it to be roughly 2.7x by the end of the year, in line with 2018. On November 6, we issued $500 million in debt, and in early December, we expect to use the proceeds to fully retire the outstanding May 2020 notes. A onetime financing charge of approximately $0.04 in the fourth quarter is not included in our revised EPS outlook. 
Turning to our expectations for the full year, we updated our EPS outlook by raising the low end of our range by $0.05. We're maintaining our annual expectations for a sales decrease of approximately 2%. We expect SG&A dollars to be down roughly 1% for the year when excluding last year's credit charge. Gross profit rate is expected to be relatively flat. 
As you may recall, we planned sales growth in the second half to reflect a 400 basis point improvement from the first half, and we are on track to meet these expectations. For the fourth quarter, the New York City flagship is expected to contribute approximately 150 basis points of growth, and the remainder is evenly weighted across 3 drivers: merchandise assortment, loyalty and digital marketing. As a reminder, gross profit is expected to deleverage from occupancy cost for the New York City flagship. Merchandise margin rate is planned flat, which contemplates a continued promotional environment. 
To wrap up, we're pleased with our third quarter results. We made significant strides in delivering on our strategy, and we're encouraged by the customer response. Our achievements, including strong Off-Price execution, improved Anniversary economics, success of our market strategy and the New York City flagship reflect continued focus on the customer and operating discipline. I'll now turn it over to Trina for Q&A."

I mean, none of these strategies work if it doesn't resonate with customers. A lot of customers, certainly, all customers like more selection and receiving things faster. But a good chunk of customers like the control of picking up in store, be it having an apartment without a doorman, or things can get stolen off their porch or they want to try it on before they take it home, having that alternative means a lot. Secondly, how you should think about after -- customer relevance. It's really about leveraging, for the most part, existing assets that we have to serve the customers better. So it's really efficient for us. Our biggest investment is inventory, and inventory in stores, in particular, and that inventory in store is close to customers. So being able to leverage that inventory to give customers bigger selection at a faster delivery is terrific, but it also helps the efficiency of our inventory significantly. 
I think you asked what we learned in New York so far, and I think this makes sense. But it's -- we opened 2 local service hubs in September. And the traffic to those has ramped -- both of those has ramped up much faster than what we saw in Los Angeles. It's just more intuitive to customers who live in New York, that they're not getting in their SUV and driving to a parking lot. So to be able to have a neighborhood service hub where they can do returns and merchandise pickups and alterations, customers get it immediately. And our traffic in those locations with the locals has been very strong. And it's also, we're utilizing our Manhattan Rack locations as well for those services and the uptake on those services has significantly exceeded our expectations."

Hey Oliver, it's Pete. In terms of balancing our assortments and relative to price points and I guess, what I would say about that is we're really in the early innings of it because we really landed on the strategy and tactically got after it a couple of months ago, but the lead times are pretty long, particularly in the Full-Price part of the business. And it's not something you can affect on very short-term because largely what you're dealing with are MSRPs and stuff, it's not how we bring in and choose to market down. It's coming in at regular price. And so it really has to do with the assortment and the selection upfront. I think as long as we -- and we will do this, is continue to ground our efforts and actions around customer data so that we have a more objective view and I think it's going to take us to the right place. And what you should expect to see is continuous improvement on those lines over the next several months. We're not here to declare victory, that we got it all aced at this moment, but we -- I think we have a clear understanding of how to more surgically implement our buys in a way that's going to benefit the business.

Digital marketing is becoming more productive for us. We're seeing increased traffic online, and we believe there's still some runway there. The merchandise piece, having the right balance Pete just touched on. The other comment I'd just make on our digital sales is, we view digital sales as a mean to an end as opposed to the end in and of itself. And what that means is, we look at our digital assets like our other assets, how do we get to -- before we can serve customers better and in -- often in unique ways. And it kind of ties back to our market strategy. And I think some good examples of how much order pickup in stores is driving online sales growth. So overall, for the quarter, 1/2 of our digital sales growth came from order pickup. And in Los Angeles, where we're most advanced with our market strategy, it was 2/3 of our digital sales growth came from in-store order pickup. So that's going to be a big part moving forward.

So coming into our inventory position, overall, we're very, very pleased. I think, as both Erik and I referred to in our comments, in particular, our Off-Price business has done a remarkable job of increasing their inventory turns, a much, I think, more fluid flow model and being very opportunistic in the marketplace as far as seasonal relevant goods in the Off-Price space. And that's really reflected in what we're seeing in the top line and the bottom line results. So we talked about that, we also talked about the fact in Q3, the sell-through in our Anniversary product, we had fewer mark-ups and sell-through was really high, which was very intentional on part of our Anniversary strategy, so that certainly helped our merchandise margin rate for Q3. We did see a highly promotional environment, but those 2 factors, between Anniversary markdown and our Off-Price business really helped to offset any promotional headwinds we might have seen in that quarter. 
In the fourth quarter, going into it from a holiday perspective, we've actually pulled forward some of our holiday receipts. We've set holiday gifting, if you go on our site or in our stores, you'll see that we have a very deliberate message on gifting at certain price points just for the customer and what they're looking for, because we know from our customer feedback, people buy at certain times for certain people at certain price points, so we've really tailored the strategy and the inventory levels to match that. And so you're seeing that both in our Off-Price business and in our Full-Price business. And so we're real -- and I would also say that we've got -- we're very encouraged by the early reads we're seeing in our gifting strategy as we set that earlier than we did last year."

We did call out that we saw demand improvement throughout the quarter, particularly in nordstrom.com. And so as we -- when we look at closing stores, we -- I think we've talked to you guys about how we look at this, but it's generally at the end of an operating covenant or operating model, we look at the return we get as we invest in that store. We also look what's going on in that market. We look at what's going on in that mall. So typically, the stores that get closed are pretty small volume stores, and so it's not a significant impact to the top line overall for the company. I would also remind you that our stores, all of our stores are cash flow positive. So from a contribution margin, they actually -- we don't have any that would be -- are cash flow negative, even the ones that we closed."

I would just add to it and connect it to our market strategy. We're early days on it, but we're seeing so far, when we can connect our whole market's worth of inventory, proportionally, the small stores benefit the most. And I think it makes sense. It's the biggest increase in inventory, what's available for next-day delivery or next-day buy in store, buy online, pickup in store. So I think the point there is, is we're learning a lot. And the fate of small stores is not sealed or determined. And it's part of what we're excited about with our market strategy is, the convenience, the kind of intimacy of a smaller store that customers like, if we can materially change the selections available to them, then those stores could be on a different trajectory. And so we still need to play that out and see what happens there."

At that time, if that happens -- and the Anniversary also happens at holiday, that it impacts, really, the profitability of the event. So it felt great that we went into it with a plan and to improve really the bottom line performance, and that has worked. I will tell you that we weren't able to get after this plan early enough to fully impact, I think, what's possible with that event. So I think the good news is that event went very well, and there's a lot of reason to believe that we will be able to improve upon it again for next year because we have the full year to be able to plan for it. And so I think what that implies for holiday, there's a lot of similarities in that they're time-bound events. And there's very specific actions related to price in category that are applicable from Anniversary to the holiday time. So we believe that we've got some proof there that we're on the right track and with the right strategy and it's nice to see kind of how our teams respond to all that. And their confidence about how to attack holiday and again, Anniversary next year, on the heels of what was a successful Anniversary. So it's all been positive so far."

To add a little color to my comment on store -- the role our Rack stores can play with our market strategy. We did, in New York -- I'd step back and say, we approached New York as expanding our market capabilities versus opening a 4-wall store. Now our flagship store is a tremendous asset to add to the market. But it's, as we mentioned, Manhattan is our largest market for online sales. We opened 2 local service hubs. We had 2 Rack stores there as well as a Trunk Club clubhouse. So we've been expanding for a bit now of having express returns in Rack stores, where customers can return Full-Price merchandise. And in New York, we expand that to not only be able to do returns from any of our businesses, but to do order pickups from any of our businesses. So nordstrom.com, buy online, pickup in store, and we have alterations available as well. The response to that has exceeded our expectations. We thought it was going to be good, it's been especially good, so we're putting a plan together to roll that out to more Racks, and we'll share that with you once we have that set. The -- another piece I would just remind you, again, it's -- like everything, it starts with giving customers things they like. And a lot of customers, the convenience of going into a Rack they really appreciate. But on the business side, getting customer engagement across channels drives a lot of value. When a customer goes from engaging with us in 1 of our businesses to 2, their spend with us increases 4x. And if we get engagement in all 4, that's full-line stores, nordstrom.com, Rack stores, rack.com, their spend goes up 11x. So there's a lot of value there that we're excited about."

Our market strategy is transforming our business model and how we're serving customers. We have a unique mix of assets, Full-Price, Off-Price, stores and online, and we are further linking our businesses to serve customers in new and differentiated ways. The success of our strategy in Los Angeles adds to our confidence as we expand to our top 10 markets. We recently achieved an important milestone with the opening of the New York City flagship store, significantly increasing our presence in the world's top retail market. 
Turning to our third quarter results. Our earnings exceeded expectations, demonstrating substantial progress in the delivery of our strategy and strength of our operating discipline. Through our customer focus, we drove broad-based improvement and top line trend of more than 200 basis points relative to first half of the year. In particular, the Off-Price business delivered positive sales growth and increased profitability through strong inventory and expense execution. We're encouraged by the momentum in our Full-Price and Off-Price businesses as we execute our holiday strategy to establish Nordstrom as a gifting destination for customers. 
Through our focus on driving top and bottom line, we've made notable changes to 2 key events: our Anniversary Sale and holiday. As we discussed previously, the priorities for Anniversary are to improve customer satisfaction, drive sales and increase profitability. Customer feedback from this year's event was positive, significantly raising satisfaction scores. We curated the assortment by building more depth in key brands and items, driving higher sell-throughs. As a result, we had fewer markdowns on Anniversary product in the third quarter, which contributed substantially to merchandise margins. 
For the holidays, we're meaningfully expanding our gifting offer across Full-Price and Off-Price, and making it easier for customers to find gifts by recipient and price point. We're also making shopping more convenient with services such as free next-day shipping, 24/7 order pickup and complimentary gift wrapping. The momentum in our Off-Price business delivered positive sales growth on less inventory. We also increased turns for the eighth consecutive quarter and exceeded bottom line expectations. We've been purposeful about improving inventory flow, refining product allocation and emphasizing merchandise that's seasonally relevant. Our favorable inventory position allows us to be opportunistic in the marketplace and leads to having a good flow of new product for customers to discover. 
Another way we're leveraging inventory is through our market strategy. Investments in digital capabilities, along with assets of people, product and place, enable us to serve customers on their terms. Our goal is to gain market share while driving customer engagement and inventory efficiencies. There are 2 elements to this strategy: first, we're giving customers greater merchandise selection with faster delivery without increasing inventory levels; second, we're engaging with customers by offering express services such as order pickup, returns and alterations at additional locations. We first launched our market strategy in Los Angeles, our largest market, where results are exceeding expectations. Third quarter sales growth outpaced other markets by 100 basis points. In L.A., the growth in customers shopping in stores and online was also 100 basis points higher than our average. We anticipate that these customers will increase their spend by 4x. Additionally, merchandise sell-throughs were higher in these stores than in other markets, contributing to profitability. We recently rolled out our market strategy in New York City, San Francisco, Chicago and Dallas. In the broader New York City market, customers now have faster access to inventory across 8 full-line stores, including our flagship and our fulfillment center. This represents 7x more selection available for same-day pickup or next-day delivery. 
Leveraging existing store assets and digital capabilities enabled us to implement this shared inventory approach without making additional material investments. Order pickup is our most profitable transaction, and the fourth quarter accounts for 40% of its volume. This represents a meaningful opportunity to increase convenience for customers during the holidays and at a lower cost for us. Going forward, we're accelerating this strategy to our remaining top 10 markets by the end of 2020 through a continued focus on shared inventory and access to services. This includes plans to open more Nordstrom local service hubs in Los Angeles and New York. We will leverage additional Rack locations to offer express services such as order pickup, returns and alterations. And finally, we opened our New York City flagship store on October 24. We've seen strong customer response with 85,000 visits during the opening weekend alone. New York City represents our largest online market, and we expect to see a halo effect when we open a physical location. Already, the sales uptick in the men's store is exceeding expectations. In addition, 1 of Nordstrom's key points of difference is the breadth of our merchandise assortment, which creates an inclusive shopping experience. Customers at this store have responded to our offering and top-performing brands include Nordstrom-made labels, Topshop, Nike, Canada Goose, Louis Vuitton and Valentino. Opening this flagship has been perhaps the most important milestone in our company's long history. It is the culmination of efforts across so many people, and we are grateful to them all. First of all, the many Nordstrom alumni who, over the years, established a reputation with customers and as an employer that allowed this opportunity to be there for us. And to our current team across the company, our business is about team, and this has never been more true. We are proud of their dedication and passion in bringing this store to life. Pete and I feel most fortunate to work with so many talented, caring and hardworking people. I'll now turn it over to Anne to discuss our financial results and expectations for the remainder of the year."

We made meaningful progress in improving the customer service and continuing our operational discipline. The consistent strength of our inventory and expense execution contributed to EBIT margin expansion for the quarter. We are delivering on our strategy while driving top and bottom line results. 
Third quarter sales decreased 2.2%, in line with expectations. Full-Price decreased 4.1% and Off-Price increased 1.2%. Sales trends improved by more than 200 basis points from the first half of the year. We saw broad-based improvement across Full-Price and Off-Price, driven by actions we're taking related to loyalty, digital marketing and merchandise assortment. Digital sales represented 34% of our business, up 300 basis points from a year ago. We saw sequential improvement in digital trends throughout the quarter, most notably at nordstrom.com. 
Customer satisfaction scores on our loyalty program continue to rebound, and digital marketing efforts are driving traffic. As we rebalance our merchandise assortment, we are increasing depth in key items in Full-Price and accelerating seasonal receipts in Off-Price. All merchandise divisions in both businesses improved relative to the first half of the year. Our gross profit rate increased by 100 basis points over last year. We had fewer markdowns as a result of disciplined inventory management in Off-Price and higher sell-through of Anniversary product in Full-Price. We ended the quarter in a favorable inventory position, down 2.7%, and we maintained a positive spread between sales and inventory for the third consecutive quarter. 
Our strong expense discipline drove our third quarter earnings beat. Expenses were down 2% from last year, excluding the credit charge in 2018, and preopening expenses for the New York City flagship. As a reminder, we planned $35 million in preopening expenses, of which roughly $10 million was incurred in the first half and $25 million in Q3. We continue to reduce our fixed cost by realigning our support structure in stores, making end-to-end process improvements in supply chain and technology and minimizing discretionary spend. 
Year-to-date, we have achieved $170 million in savings and expect to well exceed our plan of $150 million to $200 million for the year. Our financial position remains strong. We apply a consistent approach that balances reinvesting in the business and returning capital to shareholders. For the past several years, we have made significant investments in new markets and in digital capabilities to fuel future growth. With the opening of the New York City flagship, we're exiting this generational investment cycle. As a result, we expect CapEx to slow down from 6% of sales this year to 3% to 4% beginning in 2020. This reflects a normalized level inclusive of our market strategy investments related to technology, supply chain and additional Nordstrom locals. We anticipate that moderating CapEx will accelerate free cash flow next year. 
We remain committed to our investment-grade credit rating. Adjusted debt to EBITDAR was 2.8x, and we expect it to be roughly 2.7x by the end of the year, in line with 2018. On November 6, we issued $500 million in debt, and in early December, we expect to use the proceeds to fully retire the outstanding May 2020 notes. A onetime financing charge of approximately $0.04 in the fourth quarter is not included in our revised EPS outlook. 
Turning to our expectations for the full year, we updated our EPS outlook by raising the low end of our range by $0.05. We're maintaining our annual expectations for a sales decrease of approximately 2%. We expect SG&A dollars to be down roughly 1% for the year when excluding last year's credit charge. Gross profit rate is expected to be relatively flat. 
As you may recall, we planned sales growth in the second half to reflect a 400 basis point improvement from the first half, and we are on track to meet these expectations. For the fourth quarter, the New York City flagship is expected to contribute approximately 150 basis points of growth, and the remainder is evenly weighted across 3 drivers: merchandise assortment, loyalty and digital marketing. As a reminder, gross profit is expected to deleverage from occupancy cost for the New York City flagship. Merchandise margin rate is planned flat, which contemplates a continued promotional environment. 
To wrap up, we're pleased with our third quarter results. We made significant strides in delivering on our strategy, and we're encouraged by the customer response. Our achievements, including strong Off-Price execution, improved Anniversary economics, success of our market strategy and the New York City flagship reflect continued focus on the customer and operating discipline. I'll now turn it over to Trina for Q&A."

I mean, none of these strategies work if it doesn't resonate with customers. A lot of customers, certainly, all customers like more selection and receiving things faster. But a good chunk of customers like the control of picking up in store, be it having an apartment without a doorman, or things can get stolen off their porch or they want to try it on before they take it home, having that alternative means a lot. Secondly, how you should think about after -- customer relevance. It's really about leveraging, for the most part, existing assets that we have to serve the customers better. So it's really efficient for us. Our biggest investment is inventory, and inventory in stores, in particular, and that inventory in store is close to customers. So being able to leverage that inventory to give customers bigger selection at a faster delivery is terrific, but it also helps the efficiency of our inventory significantly. 
I think you asked what we learned in New York so far, and I think this makes sense. But it's -- we opened 2 local service hubs in September. And the traffic to those has ramped -- both of those has ramped up much faster than what we saw in Los Angeles. It's just more intuitive to customers who live in New York, that they're not getting in their SUV and driving to a parking lot. So to be able to have a neighborhood service hub where they can do returns and merchandise pickups and alterations, customers get it immediately. And our traffic in those locations with the locals has been very strong. And it's also, we're utilizing our Manhattan Rack locations as well for those services and the uptake on those services has significantly exceeded our expectations."

Hey Oliver, it's Pete. In terms of balancing our assortments and relative to price points and I guess, what I would say about that is we're really in the early innings of it because we really landed on the strategy and tactically got after it a couple of months ago, but the lead times are pretty long, particularly in the Full-Price part of the business. And it's not something you can affect on very short-term because largely what you're dealing with are MSRPs and stuff, it's not how we bring in and choose to market down. It's coming in at regular price. And so it really has to do with the assortment and the selection upfront. I think as long as we -- and we will do this, is continue to ground our efforts and actions around customer data so that we have a more objective view and I think it's going to take us to the right place. And what you should expect to see is continuous improvement on those lines over the next several months. We're not here to declare victory, that we got it all aced at this moment, but we -- I think we have a clear understanding of how to more surgically implement our buys in a way that's going to benefit the business.

Digital marketing is becoming more productive for us. We're seeing increased traffic online, and we believe there's still some runway there. The merchandise piece, having the right balance Pete just touched on. The other comment I'd just make on our digital sales is, we view digital sales as a mean to an end as opposed to the end in and of itself. And what that means is, we look at our digital assets like our other assets, how do we get to -- before we can serve customers better and in -- often in unique ways. And it kind of ties back to our market strategy. And I think some good examples of how much order pickup in stores is driving online sales growth. So overall, for the quarter, 1/2 of our digital sales growth came from order pickup. And in Los Angeles, where we're most advanced with our market strategy, it was 2/3 of our digital sales growth came from in-store order pickup. So that's going to be a big part moving forward.

So coming into our inventory position, overall, we're very, very pleased. I think, as both Erik and I referred to in our comments, in particular, our Off-Price business has done a remarkable job of increasing their inventory turns, a much, I think, more fluid flow model and being very opportunistic in the marketplace as far as seasonal relevant goods in the Off-Price space. And that's really reflected in what we're seeing in the top line and the bottom line results. So we talked about that, we also talked about the fact in Q3, the sell-through in our Anniversary product, we had fewer mark-ups and sell-through was really high, which was very intentional on part of our Anniversary strategy, so that certainly helped our merchandise margin rate for Q3. We did see a highly promotional environment, but those 2 factors, between Anniversary markdown and our Off-Price business really helped to offset any promotional headwinds we might have seen in that quarter. 
In the fourth quarter, going into it from a holiday perspective, we've actually pulled forward some of our holiday receipts. We've set holiday gifting, if you go on our site or in our stores, you'll see that we have a very deliberate message on gifting at certain price points just for the customer and what they're looking for, because we know from our customer feedback, people buy at certain times for certain people at certain price points, so we've really tailored the strategy and the inventory levels to match that. And so you're seeing that both in our Off-Price business and in our Full-Price business. And so we're real -- and I would also say that we've got -- we're very encouraged by the early reads we're seeing in our gifting strategy as we set that earlier than we did last year."

Because otherwise, it looks like the Full-Price stores were down like high-singles and sort of wondering if that's like the real run rate, or if that's sort of a combination of different factors that don't really represent the comp, which is obviously something that people are going to think about?"

So let me just -- so the digital sales number that we gave was for total JWN, so that includes -- beyond our Full-Price, it also includes our Off-Price business as well. We did call out that we saw demand improvement throughout the quarter, particularly in nordstrom.com. And so as we -- when we look at closing stores, we -- I think we've talked to you guys about how we look at this, but it's generally at the end of an operating covenant or operating model, we look at the return we get as we invest in that store. We also look what's going on in that market. We look at what's going on in that mall. So typically, the stores that get closed are pretty small volume stores, and so it's not a significant impact to the top line overall for the company. I would also remind you that our stores, all of our stores are cash flow positive. So from a contribution margin, they actually -- we don't have any that would be -- are cash flow negative, even the ones that we closed."

I would just add to it and connect it to our market strategy. We're early days on it, but we're seeing so far, when we can connect our whole market's worth of inventory, proportionally, the small stores benefit the most. And I think it makes sense. It's the biggest increase in inventory, what's available for next-day delivery or next-day buy in store, buy online, pickup in store. So I think the point there is, is we're learning a lot. And the fate of small stores is not sealed or determined. And it's part of what we're excited about with our market strategy is, the convenience, the kind of intimacy of a smaller store that customers like, if we can materially change the selections available to them, then those stores could be on a different trajectory. And so we still need to play that out and see what happens there."

I think it's another example of where we use objective data and analysis to make smarter decisions. We've been doing the Anniversary thing for a long time. And you would think that, that practical experience, would give us all we need, but the changing landscape, relative to how much more online business we've done in the past, and it is -- and it grows disproportionately, and we have more online business. At that time, if that happens -- and the Anniversary also happens at holiday, that it impacts, really, the profitability of the event. So it felt great that we went into it with a plan and to improve really the bottom line performance, and that has worked. I will tell you that we weren't able to get after this plan early enough to fully impact, I think, what's possible with that event. So I think the good news is that event went very well, and there's a lot of reason to believe that we will be able to improve upon it again for next year because we have the full year to be able to plan for it. And so I think what that implies for holiday, there's a lot of similarities in that they're time-bound events. And there's very specific actions related to price in category that are applicable from Anniversary to the holiday time. So we believe that we've got some proof there that we're on the right track and with the right strategy and it's nice to see kind of how our teams respond to all that. And their confidence about how to attack holiday and again, Anniversary next year, on the heels of what was a successful Anniversary. So it's all been positive so far."

To add a little color to my comment on store -- the role our Rack stores can play with our market strategy. We did, in New York -- I'd step back and say, we approached New York as expanding our market capabilities versus opening a 4-wall store. Now our flagship store is a tremendous asset to add to the market. But it's, as we mentioned, Manhattan is our largest market for online sales. We opened 2 local service hubs. We had 2 Rack stores there as well as a Trunk Club clubhouse. So we've been expanding for a bit now of having express returns in Rack stores, where customers can return Full-Price merchandise. And in New York, we expand that to not only be able to do returns from any of our businesses, but to do order pickups from any of our businesses. So nordstrom.com, buy online, pickup in store, and we have alterations available as well. The response to that has exceeded our expectations. We thought it was going to be good, it's been especially good, so we're putting a plan together to roll that out to more Racks, and we'll share that with you once we have that set. The -- another piece I would just remind you, again, it's -- like everything, it starts with giving customers things they like. And a lot of customers, the convenience of going into a Rack they really appreciate. But on the business side, getting customer engagement across channels drives a lot of value. When a customer goes from engaging with us in 1 of our businesses to 2, their spend with us increases 4x. And if we get engagement in all 4, that's full-line stores, nordstrom.com, Rack stores, rack.com, their spend goes up 11x. So there's a lot of value there that we're excited about."
