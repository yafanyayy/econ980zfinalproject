I'm pleased to report our 7th consecutive year strong top line growth, margin expansion and double-digit adjusted EPS growth. Our Label and Graphic Materials business delivered strong performance in the year of sign",1348,"Thanks, Cindy,  and good day, everyone. I'm pleased to report our 7th consecutive year strong top line growth, margin expansion and double-digit adjusted EPS growth. Our Label and Graphic Materials business delivered strong performance in the year of significant raw material inflation, Retail Branding and Information Solutions posted both strong top line growth and significant margin expansion and Industrial and Healthcare Materials made solid progress with its margin turnaround in the back half. 
2018 marked an important milestone for the company, as the final year of measurement for the 5-year financial targets we communicated in early 2014. This is the second long-term performance cycle we've completed since first introducing this discipline back in 2012, and I'm pleased to report that we once again achieved our company goals. Importantly, we are also on track to achieve our 5-year goes through 2021. 
Our consistent performance reflects the resilience of our industry-leading market positions, the strategic foundations we've laid and our agile and talented workforce. Our strategic playbook continue to work for us as we focus on 4 overarching priorities driving outsized growth in high-value product categories, growing profitably in our base businesses, relentlessly pursuing attitude improvement and remaining disciplined in our approach to capital management. 
In 2018, we made good progress on all 4 of these strategic pillars. We delivered organic growth of 5.5%, reflecting continued solid growth in our base businesses and continuing about average volume growth from emerging markets and high-value categories such as specialty labels and RFID. Emerging markets and high-value categories remain our 2 key catalysts for GDP plus growth across our entire portfolio. Roughly half of our total sales are linked to one or both of these catalysts. 
In 2018, high-value categories continue to grow at a high single-digit pace with RFID now contributing nearly a full point to total company sales growth. emerging market volume once again grew faster than average. Importantly, our end market exposure in emerging regions is quite broad-based with relatively even balanced among China, South Asia and a combination of Latin America and Eastern Europe. Equally important top line results, we also maintained our strong focus on continuous productivity improvement. The combination of product reengineering, restructuring and the deployment of lean operating principles contributed significantly to our results in 2018. This focus remains key to our long-term success, not just as a means to extend margins, but to enhance our competitiveness and to provide a funding source for reinvestment. Now looking at how these strategies played out in each of our segments.
Label and Graphic Materials delivered another year of solid top line growth, reflecting above-average volume growth in emerging markets and high-value categories as well as pricing. Specialty labels led the way for LGM's high-value categories with organic growth of roughly 10%, while Graphics and Reflectives grew at a solid mid-single-digit pace. Strength in emerging markets was led by South Asia and Latin America, while China was up mid-single digits. Mature regions delivered solid organic growth in 2018. 
Now while organic growth was strong overall for the year, our volume growth did moderate a bit in both Europe and China in the second half. This trend is reflected in our guidance assumptions for LGM for 2019. LGM's operating margin remained strong in this high return business, a significant result given that raw material inflation came in much higher than we anticipated at the start of the year. Keeping up with significant and persistent inflation required multiple price increases in every region of the world over the past 18 months as well as, of course, our continued focus on innovative product reengineering. Overall, another strong year for LGM.
Retail Branding and Information Solutions delivered both strong top line growth and significant margin expansion, driven by continued execution of our transformation strategy and continued strength in RFID. In the base business, sales increased across all product categories, reflecting broad-based growth in performance athletic, premium and the value channels. Our ability to grow our base business here in the face of a challenging retail environment underscores the success of our multiyear transformation strategy as our improvements in service, flexibility and speed continue to resonate with our customers and RFID grew by more than 20% in 2018, topping $300 million for the year. 
As you know, apparel represents the vast majority of our total RFID sales today, driving most of the growth last year. Outside of apparel, we're seeing early-stage traction in multiple categories, including food, beauty and aviation, which collectively contributed 2 points of growth for the year in RFID. Our pipeline continues to expand across all categories. Driving our confidence that RFID will continue to deliver 15% to 20% plus growth annually. We continue to increase our level of investment to support this growth as we build out our intelligent labels platform to enable the future where every item can have a digital twin and a digital life. 
RBIS's adjusted operating our margin expanded another 170 basis points, not only beating the high-end of our long-term 2018 target range but also hitting in the middle of our 2021 target range ahead of schedule. The team has done a tremendous job of transforming RBIS into a simpler, faster and more competitive business over the past 3 years and we're pleased with the momentum that we're seeing here.
Turning to Industrial and Healthcare Materials. As you know, there was a challenging year for IHM and results short of our goals. That said, our top line challenge is mostly limited to the business serving the China auto market. Elsewhere, we progressed well. Our industrial businesses in both North America and Europe grew organically at mid-single digit rate with improved profitability in the second half and our medical business part of the total healthcare category and grew high single digits organically. We obviously have more work to do to achieve our 2021 targets we've set for IHM. I remain confident we'll achieve these goals just as I was with RBIS a few years back. I've covered the first 3 of our strategic playlists, driving outsized growth in high-value products, growing profitably in the base and relentlessly pursuing productivity gains. 
Now I'll cover the fourth pillar, highly disciplined capital management. In terms of the investments we're making for organic growth and productivity, our primary focus has been capacity as an emerging regions for LGM, recapitalizing LGM's European and North American footprint and investing in both capacity and business development globally for RFID. 
Carefully planned and executed M&A is another key element of our disciplined capital allocation strategy, but we didn't complete any acquisitions in 2018, our strategy here has not changed. We look forward opportunities to increase our exposure to high value-add segments as well as to expand and leverage our core capabilities. 
And finally we continue to be disciplined in our approach to returning cash to shareholders and as a result significantly accelerated stock buyback in the fourth quarter. In addition to the progress we made toward our 2021 strategic and financial goals, we're also making solid progress towards our 2025 sustainability goals. Just to hit a few highlights. We've reduced our greenhouse gas emissions by 25% since our 2015, roughly 80% of our paper is now forced to counsel certified and more than 90% of our operations are not landfill free. 
Looking ahead, we are focused on tackling industry-wide challenges with a particular focus on packaging recyclability by leveraging our existing products and capabilities and developing new opportunities in collaboration with our customers and partners.
Summing up, I'm pleased with the progress we've made towards our long-term goals, as we continue to deliver consistent GDP-plus organic growth and top quartile returns on capital. For 2019, we will continue to make progress towards these goals with the midpoint of our adjusted EPS range of 12% before the headwind from currency translation. Now while we expect the external environment may prove more challenging this year, we are prepared for it commercially, operationally and financially, and we will seek opportunities to lean forward even as others may pull back. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Greg."
252978,598585258,1643051,"Avery Dennison Corporation, Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Jan 30, 2019",2019-01-30,"Earnings Calls","Avery Dennison Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Mitch, and hello, everybody. I'll first provide some additional color on performance against our long-term goals and then walk you through fourth quarter performance and our outlook for 2019. As Mitch said, 2018 was an important milestone for the",1644,"Thanks, Mitch, and hello, everybody. I'll first provide some additional color on performance against our long-term goals and then walk you through fourth quarter performance and our outlook for 2019. As Mitch said, 2018 was an important milestone for the company as the final year of measurement for the 5-year financial targets we communicated in early 2014.  And as you noted, we achieved all of our targets. 
If we turn to Slide 7 of the supplemental materials, you will see our scorecard. Sales grew more than 4% organically and reported operating margin hit 10% or 11% on an adjusted basis. And adjusted EPS grew 18% annually over the past 5 years. And at the same time, we expanded our return on total capital over this period by 8 full points to 19% in 2018. And our balance sheet remained strong, but our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio on the low end of our targeted range for 2018. 
In March of 2017, we introduced a new set of long-term targets, extending our planned horizon through 2021. As you can see on Slide 8, now 2 years into the cycle, we are on pace to achieve these goals as well. Given the diversity of our end markets, our strong competitive advantages and our resilience as an organization to adjust course when needed, we are confident in our ability to deliver to a wide range of business cycles. At the same time that we communicated our financial target through 2021, we also laid out a 5-year plan for capital allocation, which you can see on Slide 9. We put a total of $1.7 billion to work over the first 2 years of the cycle, allocating that very much in line with our long-term plan. This plan reflects our goal to deliver top quartile returns relative to capital market peers, a position we have maintained while increasing our pace of investment for both organic growth and M&A. 
And further, our current leverage position gives us ample capacity to continue investing in organic growth and acquisitions, while also continuing to return cash to shareholders in a disciplined way, and we are clearly in excellent shape to take advantage of any dislocations in the market should they occur over the next few years.
Now let's focus on the fourth quarter. Overall, our financial results were solid. Reported earnings per share was $1.11, including a net $0.37 hit from the combined effects of the pension settlement and tax benefits from the discrete tax planning action in TCJA estimate revision. Adjusted earnings per share was $1.52, a few cents better than our expectations and up 14% compared to prior year, driven by both sales growth and margin expansion. We grew sales up by 4.8% on an organic basis as currency translation reduced reported sales growth by 2.9 points in the quarter. 
Currency translation represented roughly $0.06 headwind to EPS compared to the same period last year, which by the way exactly offset the benefit from the lower adjusted tax rate. Adjusted operating margin increased by 50 basis points to 11.1% as the benefits from higher volume and productivity were partially offset by higher employee-related costs, and we realized $5 million of net restructuring savings in the quarter. Gross savings most of which benefited RBIS were partially offset by roughly $4 million of transition cost for LGM's footprint action in Europe. And note while we incurring additional $10 million of transition costs in the first half of 2019 for this project with savings ramping up in the second half. 
So turning now to cash generation and allocation, excluding the $200 million contribution to the U.S. pension plan, free cash flow for the full year was $429 million, up by roughly $8 million compared to the prior year. As we've discussed, we've increased our pace of fixed capital in IT-related spending this year with gross capital spending by about $30 million to support both organic growth and margin expansion.
And we continue to read and cash to shareholders with a higher dividend and share repurchases. We significantly accelerated the pace of share buyback during the fourth quarter to $218 million. For the full year, we repurchased roughly 4 million shares at an aggregate cost of $393 million and paid $175 million in dividends. So collectively we returned a total of $568 million to shareholders in 2018, roughly 2x the amount we distributed the year before. 
So let me now turn to the segment results for the quarter. Label and Graphic Materials sales increased by 4.7% on an organic basis, driven largely by price. High-value categories once again grew faster than the base business. Breaking down LGM's organic growth in the quarter by region, North America was up high single digits and Western Europe grew at a low single-digit rate. Growth in emerging markets was mid-single digits with continued strength in South Asia and Latin America and China grew mid-single digits, including a benefit from the timing of sales due to pre-buyers in the prior year. 
On a normalized basis, the trend in China slowed relative to the first half. Operating margin for the segment was strong, up 40 basis points on an adjusted basis to 12.9%, as the benefits of productivity, increased volume and the net impact of pricing and raw material cost more than offset the higher employee-related expense and transition cost associated with the European restructuring. 
Looking sequentially, raw material input costs were relatively stable in the fourth quarter, and we realized that benefit from our pricing actions driving much of the anticipated rebound in our margin from the Q3 level. With the benefit of recent pricing actions, we expect to substantially cover the effect of the past 18 months of inflation. 
Shifting now to Retail Branding and Information Solutions, RBIS delivering another quarter of strong top line growth, up 6.9% on an organic basis driven by both RFID and the base business. Total RFID sales were up 20% for the quarter, the vast majority of which benefited RBIS, driven largely by European brands and retailers. 
Adjusted operating margin for the segment expanded by 10 basis points to 12.2%, as the benefits from increased volume and productivity were largely offset by higher employee-related costs and growth-related investments, which ramped up over the course of the year. And finally, turning to the Industrial and Healthcare Materials segment, sales grew 0.7% on an organic basis, as mid-single-digit organic growth for industrial categories in North America and Europe as well as for healthcare globally was mostly offset by weakness in industrial products for the China market. 
Though this category represents only about 10% of IHM's total sales, that is less than 1% of the company's total sales, we experienced a significant decline in these products due to the drop in Chinese auto production. We made good progress on our margin front IHM. Adjusted operating margin increased by 170 basis points to 9.66%, driven by productivity improvement. We faced a modest headwind for raw material cost net of pricing in the quarter, but expect to realize sufficient price increases in 2019 to cover this GAAP. I spend a lot of time in meeting with our teams in IHM over the past 6 months. We're shopping our commercial capabilities, improving our cost position, simplifying our organization structure and further aligning our operations teams with LGM to leverage our strengths there. And I remain confident in our ability to achieve our long-term goals of 4% to 5% plus organic growth operating margin gradually expanding to LGM's level or better by 2021. 
So turning now to our outlook for 2019. We anticipate adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $6.45 to $6.70. The midpoint of our range reflects organic growth for LGM near the lower end of its long-term target range. While we assume RBIS come in above the high-end of its long-term range reflecting continued strength in RFID. We have outlined some of the key contributing factors to this guidance on Slide 15 of our supplemental presentation materials. We estimate that organic sales growth will be approximately 4% and currency translation will be at roughly 2.5 point headwind to reported sales growth with a pretax operating income head of $25 million. And we estimate the incremental pretax savings from restructuring net of transition costs will contribute about $35 million. Due to the timing of these actions and related transition costs, roughly 75% of the full year net savings from restructuring will be realized in the back half of the year. And we expect an adjusted tax rate in the mid-20s in line with 2018. And with the large noncash charge associated with the pension termination, we'll likely see a low single-digit reported effective tax rate. And we expect interest expense of roughly $75 million to $80 million, reflecting higher debt at the end of 2018 due to the pension contribution in Q3 and accelerated share buyback in the fourth quarter as well as the higher-average interest rate on total debt. And we anticipate spending $275 million to $285 million on fixed capital and IT projects consistent with our 5-year capital allocation plan. And we estimate average shares outstanding assuming dilution of $84 million to $85 million. 
As previously discussed, we expect to complete the process of terminating our U.S. pension plan resulting in a pretax noncash charge estimated at $490 million during the first quarter with an estimated after-tax EPS of roughly $3.55. And finally, given the timing of the impacts from currency translation and restructuring actions, our projected earnings growth is significantly waited to the back half of the year. In summary, we're pleased with the strategic and financial progress we made against our long-term goals in 2018, and we are committed to delivering exceptional value to our strategies for long-term profitable growth and disciplined capital allocation. Now we'll open up the call for your questions."

We expect the long-term should return to a mid-single-digit growth market overall. So we're seeing that in the second half of 2018. So we would expect that to kind of continue at least as we tougher comps in Q1 and the first half, but obviously we have limited visibility. So that's kind of what we're seeing and what we're thinking. China automotive, very small part of the business, down pretty significantly. We'll come through that year after the first quarter or so. And I know the Chinese government is putting a new incentives around automobile manufacturing and so forth as we speak. So that's something else that may have an impact. So overall, we expect China continue to behave long-term a very good market for us here in the near term growing, but at a lower pace. Europe, we see volumes and growth to moderate a bit in the second half and we are expecting that may continue here in the first part of the year with Brexit and everything else going. And then if you think about long-term Europe up until a year or so ago had been growing faster than we would otherwise expect, I'm talking at the market level and now, it's growing the low single-digit level, which is what we've consistently expected up until and again, the last 4 months or so when it's gotten a very low single digits,  if you will.

Clearly, when you go through a period of change like this and we've maintained or gained share in the key regions where we have visibility in the market data for the full year '18 versus '17. But as you go through price increases and so forth, you will see share positions particular in some of the less differentiated categories, had a little bit variability throughout the course of the year and we saw that, but that is just part of the normal practice.

So there is something we will continue to pursue, but we continue to see opportunities within LGM as well, a little bit less in just given the size and dynamics of that market.

I'm pleased to report our seventh consecutive year of strong top line growth, margin expansion and double-digit adjusted EPS growth. Our Label and Graphic Materials business delivered strong performance in a year of",1351,"Thanks, Cindy, and good day, everyone. I'm pleased to report our seventh consecutive year of strong top line growth, margin expansion and double-digit adjusted EPS growth. Our Label and Graphic Materials business delivered strong performance in a year of significant raw material inflation, Retail Branding and Information Solutions posted both strong top line growth and significant margin expansion and Industrial and Healthcare Materials made solid progress with its margin turnaround in the back half.
2018 marked an important milestone for the company, as the final year of measurement for the 5-year financial targets we communicated in early 2014. This is the second long-term performance cycle we've completed since first introducing this discipline back in 2012, and I'm pleased to report that we once again achieved our company goals. Importantly, we are also on track to achieve our 5-year goals through 2021.
Our consistent performance reflects the resilience of our industry-leading market positions, the strategic foundations we've laid and our agile and talented workforce. Our strategic playbook continue to work for us as we focus on 4 overarching priorities driving outsized growth in high-value product categories, growing profitably in our base businesses, relentlessly pursuing productivity improvement and remaining disciplined in our approach to capital management.
In 2018, we made good progress on all 4 of these strategic pillars. We delivered organic growth of 5.5%, reflecting continued solid growth in our base businesses and continuing above-average volume growth from emerging markets and high-value categories such as specialty labels and RFID. Emerging markets and high-value categories remain our 2 key catalysts for GDP-plus growth across our entire portfolio. Roughly half of our total sales are linked to one or both of these catalysts.
In 2018, high-value categories continue to grow at a high single-digit pace with RFID now contributing nearly a full point to total company sales growth. And the emerging market volume once again grew faster than average. Importantly, our end market exposure in emerging regions is quite broad based with relatively even balance among China, South Asia and a combination of Latin America and Eastern Europe. Equally important to top line results, we also maintained our strong focus on continuous productivity improvement. The combination of product reengineering, restructuring and the deployment of lean operating principles contributed significantly to our results in 2018. This focus remains key to our long-term success, not just as a means to expand margins, but to enhance our competitiveness and to provide a funding source for reinvestment. 
Now looking at how these strategies played out in each of our segments. Label and Graphic Materials delivered another year of strong top line growth, reflecting above-average volume growth in emerging markets and high-value categories as well as pricing. Specialty labels led the way for LGM's high-value categories with organic growth of roughly 10%, while Graphics and Reflective grew at a solid mid-single-digit pace. Strength in emerging markets was led by South Asia and Latin America, while China was up mid-single digits. Mature regions delivered solid organic growth in 2018.
Now, while organic growth was strong overall for the year, our volume growth did moderate a bit in both Europe and China in the second half. This trend is reflected in our guidance assumptions for LGM for 2019. LGM's operating margin remained strong in this high return business, a significant result given that raw material inflation came in much higher than we anticipated at the start of the year. Keeping up with significant and persistent inflation required multiple price increases in every region of the world over the past 18 months as well as, of course, our continued focus on innovative product reengineering. Overall, another strong year for LGM.
Retail Branding and Information Solutions delivered both strong top line growth and significant margin expansion, driven by continued execution of our transformation strategy and continued strength in RFID. In the base business, sales increased across all product categories, reflecting broad-based growth in performance athletic, premium and the value channels. Our ability to grow our base business here in the face of a challenging retail environment underscores the success of our multiyear transformation strategy as our improvements in service, flexibility and speed continue to resonate with our customers, and RFID grew by more than 20% in 2018, topping $300 million for the year.
As you know, apparel represents the vast majority of our total RFID sales today, driving most of the growth last year. Outside of apparel, we're seeing early-stage traction in multiple categories, including food, beauty and aviation, which collectively contributed 2 points of growth for the year in RFID. Our pipeline continues to expand across all categories, driving our confidence that RFID will continue to deliver 15% to 20% plus growth annually. We continue to increase our level of investment to support this growth as we build out our Intelligent Labels platform to enable a future, where every item can have a digital twin and a digital life.
RBIS's adjusted operating margin expanded another 170 basis points, not only beating the high end of our long-term 2018 target range, but also hitting the middle of our 2021 target range ahead of schedule. The team has done a tremendous job transforming RBIS into a simpler, faster and more competitive business over the past 3 years, and we're pleased with the momentum that we're seeing here.
Turning to Industrial and Healthcare Materials. As you know, it was a challenging year for IHM and results fell short of our goals. That said, our top line challenge is mostly limited to the business serving the China auto market. Elsewhere, we progressed well. Our industrial businesses in both North America and Europe grew organically at mid-single digit rate with improved profitability in the second half and our medical business part of the total health care category grew high single digits organically. We obviously have more work to do to achieve our 2021 targets we've set for IHM. I remain confident we'll achieve these goals just as I was with RBIS a few years back. And I've covered the first 3 of our strategic pillars, driving outsized growth in high-value products, growing profitably in the base and relentlessly pursuing productivity gains.
Now I'll cover the fourth pillar, highly disciplined capital management. In terms of the investments we're making for organic growth and productivity, our primary focus has been capacity adds in emerging regions for LGM, recapitalizing LGM's European and North American footprint and investing in both capacity and business development globally for RFID.
Carefully planned and executed M&A is another key element of our disciplined capital allocation strategy. Though we didn't complete any acquisitions in 2018, our strategy here has not changed. We look for opportunities to increase our exposure to high value-add segments as well as to expand and leverage our core capabilities.
And finally, we continue to be disciplined in our approach to returning cash to shareholders and as a result, significantly accelerated stock buyback in the fourth quarter. In addition to the progress we made toward our 2021 strategic and financial goals, we are also making solid progress towards our 2025 sustainability goals. Just to hit a few highlights. We've reduced our greenhouse gas emissions by 25% since 2015, roughly 80% of our paper is now Forest Stewardship Council certified and more than 90% of our operations are now landfill free.
Looking ahead, we are focused on tackling industry-wide challenges with a particular focus on packaging recyclability by leveraging our existing products and capabilities and developing new opportunities through collaboration with our customers and partners.
Summing up, I'm pleased with the progress we've made toward our long-term goals, as we continue to deliver consistent GDP-plus organic growth and top quartile returns on capital. For 2019, we will continue to make progress towards these goals with the midpoint of our adjusted EPS range up 12% before the headwind from currency translation. Now while we expect the external environment may prove more challenging this year, we are prepared for it commercially, operationally and financially, and we will seek opportunities to lean forward even as others may pull back.
Now I'll turn the call over to Greg."
252978,598585258,1643177,"Avery Dennison Corporation, Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Jan 30, 2019",2019-01-30,"Earnings Calls","Avery Dennison Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Mitch, and hello, everybody. I'll first provide some additional color on performance against our long-term goals and then walk you through fourth quarter performance and our outlook for 2019. As Mitch said, 2018 was an important milestone for the",1649,"Thanks, Mitch, and hello, everybody. I'll first provide some additional color on performance against our long-term goals and then walk you through fourth quarter performance and our outlook for 2019. As Mitch said, 2018 was an important milestone for the company as the final year of measurement for the 5-year financial targets we communicated in early 2014.  And as you noted, we achieved all of our targets.
If we turn to Slide 7 of the supplemental materials, you will see our scorecard. Sales grew more than 4% organically and reported operating margin hit 10% or 11% on an adjusted basis. And adjusted EPS grew 18% annually over the past 5 years. And at the same time, we expanded return on total capital over this period by 8 full points to 19% in 2018. And our balance sheet remains strong, with our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio on the low end of our targeted range for 2018.
In March of 2017, we introduced a new set of long-term targets, extending our planning horizon to 2021. As you can see on Slide 8, now 2 years into this cycle, we are on pace to achieve these goals as well. Given the diversity of our end markets, our strong competitive advantages and our resilience as an organization to adjust course when needed, we are confident in our ability to deliver to a wide range of business cycles. At the same time that we communicated our financial target through 2021, we also laid out a 5-year plan for capital allocation, which you can see on Slide 9. We put a total of $1.7 billion to work over the first 2 years of this cycle, allocating it very much in line with our long-term plan. This plan reflects our goal to deliver top quartile returns relative to capital market peers, a position we have maintained while increasing our pace of investment for both organic growth and M&A.
And further, our current leverage position gives us ample capacity to continue investing in organic growth and acquisitions, while also continuing to return cash to shareholders in a disciplined way, and we are clearly in excellent shape to take advantage of any dislocations of the market should they occur over the next few years.
Now let's focus on the fourth quarter. Overall, our financial results were solid. Reported earnings per share was $1.11, including a net $0.37 hit from the combined effects of the pension settlement and tax benefits from the discrete tax planning action in TCJA estimate revision. Adjusted earnings per share was $1.52, a few cents better than our expectations and up 14% compared to prior year, driven by both sales growth and margin expansion. We grew sales by 4.8% on an organic basis as currency translation reduced reported sales growth by 2.9 points in the quarter.
Currency translation represented a roughly $0.06 headwind to EPS compared to the same period last year, which by the way exactly offset the benefit from the lower adjusted tax rate. Adjusted operating margin increased by 50 basis points to 11.1% as the benefits from higher volume and productivity were partially offset by higher employee-related costs, and we realized $5 million of net restructuring savings in the quarter. Gross savings most of which benefited RBIS were partially offset by roughly $4 million of transition cost for LGM's footprint action in Europe, and note that while we were incurring additional $10 million of transition costs in the first half of 2019 for this project with savings ramping up in the second half.
So turning now to cash generation and allocation. Excluding the $200 million contribution to the U.S. pension plan, free cash flow for the full year was $429 million, up by roughly $8 million compared to the prior year. As we've discussed, we've increased our pace of fixed capital in IT-related spending this year with gross capital spending up by about $30 million to support both organic growth and margin expansion.
And we continue to return cash to shareholders with a higher dividend and share repurchases. We significantly accelerated the pace of share buyback during the fourth quarter to $218 million. For the full year, we repurchased roughly 4 million shares at an aggregate cost of $393 million and paid $175 million in dividends. So collectively, we returned a total of $568 million to shareholders in 2018, roughly 2x the amount we distributed the year before.
So let me now turn to the segment results for the quarter. Label and Graphic Materials sales increased by 4.7% on an organic basis, driven largely by price. High-value categories once again grew faster than the base business. Breaking down LGM's organic growth in the quarter by region, North America was up high single digits and Western Europe grew at a low single-digit rate. Growth in emerging markets was mid-single digits with continued strength in South Asia and Latin America. China grew mid-single digits, including a benefit from the timing of sales due to prebuys in the prior year.
On a normalized basis, the trend in China slowed relative to the first half. Operating margin for the segment was strong, up 40 basis points on an adjusted basis to 12.9%, as the benefits of productivity, increased volume and the net impact of pricing and raw material cost more than offset the higher employee-related expense and transition cost associated with the European restructuring.
Looking sequentially, raw material input costs were relatively stable in the fourth quarter, and we realized the benefit from our pricing actions driving much of the anticipated rebound in our margin from the Q3 level. With the benefit of recent pricing actions, we expect to substantially cover the effect of the past 18 months of inflation.
Shifting now to Retail Branding and Information Solutions, RBIS delivered another quarter of strong top line growth, up 6.9% on an organic basis driven by both RFID and the base business. Total RFID sales were up 20% for the quarter, the vast majority of which benefited RBIS, driven largely by European brands and retailers.
Adjusted operating margin for the segment expanded by 10 basis points to 12.2%, as the benefits from increased volume and productivity were largely offset by higher employee-related costs and growth-related investments, which ramped up over the course of the year. And finally, turning to the Industrial and Healthcare Materials segment, sales grew 0.7% on an organic basis, as mid-single-digit organic growth for industrial categories in North America and Europe as well as for health care globally was mostly offset by weakness in industrial products for the China market.
Though this category represents only about 10% of IHM's total sales, that is less than 1% of the company's total sales, we experienced a significant decline in these products due to the drop in Chinese auto production. We made good progress on the margin front in IHM. Adjusted operating margin increased by 170 basis points to 9.6%, driven by productivity improvement. We faced a modest headwind for raw material cost net of pricing in the quarter, but expect to realize sufficient price increases in 2019 to cover this gap. I spend a lot of time meeting with our teams in IHM over the past 6 months. We're sharping our commercial focusing capabilities, improving our cost position, simplifying our organization structure and further aligning our operations teams with LGM to leverage our strengths there. And I remain confident in our ability to achieve our long-term goals of 4% to 5% plus organic growth, the operating margin gradually expanding to LGM's level or better by 2021.
So turning now to our outlook for 2019. We anticipate adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $6.45 to $6.70. The midpoint of our range reflects organic growth for LGM near the lower end of its long-term target range, while we assume RBIS will come in above the high end of its long-term range reflecting continued strength in RFID. We have outlined some of the key contributing factors to this guidance on Slide 15 of our supplemental presentation materials. We estimate that organic sales growth will be approximately 4% and currency translation will be a roughly 2.5 point headwind to reported sales growth with a pretax operating income hit of $25 million. And we estimate incremental pretax savings from restructuring net of transition costs will contribute about $35 million. Due to the timing of these actions and related transition costs, roughly 75% of the full year net savings from restructuring will be realized in the back half of the year. And we expect an adjusted tax rate in the mid-20s in line with 2018. And with the large noncash charge associated with the pension termination, we'll likely see a low single-digit reported effective tax rate. And we expect interest expense of roughly $75 million to $80 million, reflecting higher debt at the end of 2018 due to the pension contribution in Q3 and accelerated share buyback in the fourth quarter as well as the higher-average interest rate on total debt. And we anticipate spending $275 million to $285 million on fixed capital in IT projects consistent with our 5-year capital allocation plan, and we estimate average shares outstanding assuming dilution of $84 million to $85 million.
As previously discussed, we expect to complete the process of terminating our U.S. pension plan resulting in a pretax noncash charge estimated at $490 million during the first quarter with an estimated after-tax EPS hit of roughly $3.55. And finally, given the timing of the impacts from currency translation and restructuring actions, our projected earnings growth is significantly weighted to the back half of the year. In summary, we're pleased with the strategic and financial progress we made against our long-term goals in 2018, and we are committed to delivering exceptional value through our strategies for long-term profitable growth and disciplined capital allocation. Now we'll open up the call for your questions."

So overall that's the direction on the 4% growth roughly for LGM in 2019."

I think, if I can step back broadly for 2019, if I think about free cash flow, we'd expect free cash flow to see somewhat of a modest improvement in '19 versus where we were in 2018, as we look it, continue to spend a little bit more on capital investments, as Mitch mentioned earlier in his comments. We also expect to have some of the cash restructuring charges related to that European action that we announced a year ago, much of that cash will hit us in 2019. So we'll see some continued improvement on the profit side as we've talked about and then we'll have some higher CapEx and a little bit higher restructuring costs, overall expect a modest improvement in free cash flow in 2019."

So overall versus what we have seen in years past, I'll talk about them separately. China, we talked about that growing mid to upper single-digit growth trend up until a couple of years ago, and it's been a mid-single-digit growth kind of market since then. And then we saw in the second half, it started to decline to low single-digit levels, reflecting all that we're seeing going on within China. We expect long term this should return to a mid-single-digit growth market overall. So we're seeing that in the second half of 2018. So we'd expect that to kind of continue at least as we comp the tougher comps in Q1 in the first half, but obviously, we have limited forward visibility. So that's kind of what we're seeing and what we're thinking. China automotive, very small part of the business, down pretty significantly, will comp through that here after the first quarter or so. And I know the Chinese government is putting a new incentive around automobile manufacturing and so forth as we speak. So that's something else that may have an impact. So overall, we expect China continue to be long term very good market for us here in the near-term growing, but at a lower pace. Europe, same thing, we saw the volumes growth moderate a bit in the second half and we are expecting that may continue here into the first part of the year with Brexit and everything else going on. And then if you think about long term, Europe up until a year or so ago had been growing faster than we would otherwise expect. I'm talking at the market level. And now, it's growing in the low single-digit level, which is what we've consistently expected up until, again, the last 4 months or so when it's gotten very low single digits, if you will. So that is our -- what we're seeing and we're basically assuming a continuation of that at least for the first part of the year depending on, if you're at the low end of our guidance range, it'd be continuing a little bit longer; if you're at the high end of the guidance range, it would correct itself rather quickly."

So it's broad based, Rosemarie, across the board. And if you look at apparel import unit, they are up roughly 3% so far year-to-date, picked up last couple of months. And if we look at our volume trends, it's still well above that. And then clearly, RFID is a clear value driver in RFID, but, I'd say, it also creates a halo effect across the rest of RBIS as we are clearly the partner to go to for adoption and then just continued rollout of this technology."

And then it's really at the discussion level still. Apparel imports did surge quite a bit in the most recently available months, which may indicate some of what you are referring to. But on the flip side, inventory levels continue to be extremely lean at the retail level and those have actually declined over the last year as retailers continue to get more lean overall. So there is some signs that may be that did happen, I don't think so. It is part of the active discussion we're having with retailers and brands. And I think this level of uncertainty really just increases focus on the importance of having a global presence for us as well as the importance of having lean inventory levels for retailers, which really plays to our strength and the strength of our RFID, which is one of the other reasons we are continuing to see increased pace of focus around RFID adoption within apparel."

And we, as we've discussed in the past, willing to take some near-term share risk during the period of price increase because we know we can recapture share within the near term.

I'm pleased to report our seventh consecutive year of strong top line growth, margin expansion and double-digit adjusted EPS growth. Our Label and Graphic Materials business delivered strong performance in a year of",1347,"Thanks, Cindy, and good day, everyone. I'm pleased to report our seventh consecutive year of strong top line growth, margin expansion and double-digit adjusted EPS growth. Our Label and Graphic Materials business delivered strong performance in a year of significant raw material inflation, Retail Branding and Information Solutions posted both strong top line growth and significant margin expansion and Industrial and Healthcare Materials made solid progress with its margin turnaround in the back half.
2018 marked an important milestone for the company as the final year of measurement for the 5-year financial targets we communicated in early 2014. This is the second long-term performance cycle we've completed since first introducing this discipline back in 2012, and I'm pleased to report that we once again achieved our company goals. Importantly, we are also on track to achieve our 5-year goals through 2021.
Our consistent performance reflects the resilience of our industry-leading market positions, the strategic foundations we've laid and our agile and talented workforce. Our strategic playbook continues to work for us as we focus on 4 overarching priorities: driving outsized growth in high-value product categories, growing profitably in our base businesses, relentlessly pursuing productivity improvement and remaining disciplined in our approach to capital management.
In 2018, we made good progress on all 4 of these strategic pillars. We delivered organic growth of 5.5%, reflecting continued solid growth in our base businesses and continuing above-average volume growth from emerging markets and high-value categories such as specialty labels and RFID. Emerging markets and high-value categories remain our 2 key catalysts for GDP-plus growth across our entire portfolio. Roughly half of our total sales are linked to one or both of these catalysts.
In 2018, high-value categories continued to grow at a high single-digit pace with RFID now contributing nearly a full point to total company sales growth. And the emerging market volume once again grew faster than average. Importantly, our end market exposure in emerging regions is quite broad based with relatively even balance among China, South Asia and a combination of Latin America and Eastern Europe. Equally important to top line results, we also maintained our strong focus on continuous productivity improvement. The combination of product reengineering, restructuring and the deployment of lean operating principles contributed significantly to our results in 2018. This focus remains key to our long-term success, not just as a means to expand margins, but to enhance our competitiveness and to provide a funding source for reinvestment. 
Now looking at how these strategies played out in each of our segments. Label and Graphic Materials delivered another year of strong top line growth, reflecting above-average volume growth in emerging markets and high-value categories as well as pricing. Specialty labels led the way for LGM's high-value categories with organic growth of roughly 10%, while Graphics and Reflective grew at a solid mid-single-digit pace. Strength in emerging markets was led by South Asia and Latin America, while China was up mid-single digits. Mature regions delivered solid organic growth in 2018.
Now, while organic growth was strong overall for the year, our volume growth did moderate a bit in both Europe and China in the second half. This trend is reflected in our guidance assumptions for LGM for 2019. LGM's operating margin remained strong in this high return business, a significant result given that raw material inflation came in much higher than we anticipated at the start of the year. Keeping up with significant and persistent inflation required multiple price increases in every region of the world over the past 18 months as well as, of course, our continued focus on innovative product reengineering. Overall, another strong year for LGM.
Retail Branding and Information Solutions delivered both strong top line growth and significant margin expansion, driven by continued execution of our transformation strategy and continued strength in RFID. In the base business, sales increased across all product categories, reflecting broad-based growth in performance athletic, premium and the value channels. Our ability to grow our base business here in the face of a challenging retail environment underscores the success of our multiyear transformation strategy as our improvements in service, flexibility and speed continue to resonate with our customers, and RFID grew by more than 20% in 2018, topping $300 million for the year.
As you know, apparel represents the vast majority of our total RFID sales today, driving most of the growth last year. Outside of apparel, we're seeing early-stage traction in multiple categories, including food, beauty and aviation, which collectively contributed 2 points of growth for the year in RFID. Our pipeline continues to expand across all categories, driving our confidence that RFID will continue to deliver 15% to 20%-plus growth annually. We continue to increase our level of investment to support this growth as we build out our Intelligent Labels platform to enable a future where every item can have a digital twin and a digital life.
RBIS's adjusted operating margin expanded another 170 basis points, not only beating the high end of our long-term 2018 target range, but also hitting the middle of our 2021 target range ahead of schedule. The team has done a tremendous job transforming RBIS into a simpler, faster and more competitive business over the past 3 years, and we're pleased with the momentum that we're seeing here.
Turning to Industrial and Healthcare Materials. As you know, it was a challenging year for IHM and results fell short of our goals. That said, our top line challenge is mostly limited to the business serving the China auto market. Elsewhere, we progressed well. Our industrial businesses in both North America and Europe grew organically at mid-single-digit rate with improved profitability in the second half and our medical business, part of the total health care category, grew high single digits organically. We obviously have more work to do to achieve our 2021 targets we've set for IHM. I remain confident we'll achieve these goals just as I was with RBIS a few years back. And I've covered the first 3 of our strategic pillars, driving outsized growth in high-value products, growing profitably in the base and relentlessly pursuing productivity gains.
Now I'll cover the fourth pillar, highly disciplined capital management. In terms of the investments we're making for organic growth and productivity, our primary focus has been capacity-adds in emerging regions for LGM, recapitalizing LGM's European and North American footprint and investing in both capacity and business development globally for RFID.
Carefully planned and executed M&A is another key element of our disciplined capital allocation strategy. Though we didn't complete any acquisitions in 2018, our strategy here has not changed. We look for opportunities to increase our exposure to high value-add segments as well as to expand and leverage our core capabilities.
And finally, we continue to be disciplined in our approach to returning cash to shareholders and as a result, significantly accelerated stock buyback in the fourth quarter. In addition to the progress we made toward our 2021 strategic and financial goals, we are also making solid progress towards our 2025 sustainability goals. Just to hit a few highlights. We've reduced our greenhouse gas emissions by 25% since 2015, roughly 80% of our paper is now Forest Stewardship Council certified and more than 90% of our operations are now landfill-free.
Looking ahead, we are focused on tackling industry-wide challenges with a particular focus on packaging recyclability by leveraging our existing products and capabilities and developing new opportunities through collaboration with our customers and partners.
Summing up, I'm pleased with the progress we've made toward our long-term goals, as we continue to deliver consistent GDP-plus organic growth and top quartile returns on capital. For 2019, we will continue to make progress toward these goals with the midpoint of our adjusted EPS range up 12% before the headwind from currency translation. Now while we expect the external environment may prove more challenging this year, we are prepared for it commercially, operationally and financially, and we will seek opportunities to lean forward even as others may pull back.
Now I'll turn the call over to Greg."
252978,598585258,1643324,"Avery Dennison Corporation, Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Jan 30, 2019",2019-01-30,"Earnings Calls","Avery Dennison Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Mitch, and hello, everybody. I'll first provide some additional color on our performance against our long-term goals and then walk you through fourth quarter performance and our outlook for 2019.

I'll first provide some additional color on our performance against our long-term goals and then walk you through fourth quarter performance and our outlook for 2019. As Mitch said, 2018 was an important milestone for the company as the final year of measurement for the 5-year financial targets we communicated in early 2014. And as he noted, we achieved all of our targets.
If we turn to Slide 7 of the supplemental materials, you will see our scorecard. Sales grew more than 4% organically and reported operating margin hit 10% or 11% on an adjusted basis. And adjusted EPS grew 18% annually over the past 5 years. And at the same time, we expanded return on total capital over this period by 8 full points to 19% in 2018. And our balance sheet remains strong, with our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio on the low end of our targeted range for 2018.
In March of 2017, we introduced a new set of long-term targets, extending our planning horizon to 2021. As you can see on Slide 8, now 2 years into this cycle, we are on pace to achieve these goals as well. Given the diversity of our end markets, our strong competitive advantages and our resilience as an organization to adjust course when needed, we are confident in our ability to deliver through a wide range of business cycles. At the same time that we communicated our financial targets through 2021, we also laid out a 5-year plan for capital allocation, which you can see on Slide 9. We put a total of $1.7 billion to work over the first 2 years of this cycle, allocating it very much in line with our long-term plan. This plan reflects our goal to deliver top quartile returns relative to capital market peers, a position we have maintained while increasing our pace of investment for both organic growth and M&A.
And further, our current leverage position gives us ample capacity to continue investing in organic growth and acquisitions, while also continuing to return cash to shareholders in a disciplined way, and we are clearly in excellent shape to take advantage of any dislocations in the market should they occur over the next few years.
Now let's focus on the fourth quarter. Overall, our financial results were solid. Reported earnings per share was $1.11, including a net $0.37 hit from the combined effects of the pension settlement and tax benefits from a discrete tax planning action in TCJA estimate revision. Adjusted earnings per share was $1.52, a few cents better than our expectations and up 14% compared to prior year, driven by both sales growth and margin expansion. We grew sales by 4.8% on an organic basis as currency translation reduced reported sales growth by 2.9 points in the quarter.
Currency translation represented a roughly $0.06 headwind to EPS compared to the same period last year, which by the way exactly offset the benefit from the lower adjusted tax rate. Adjusted operating margin increased by 50 basis points to 11.1% as the benefits from higher volume and productivity were partially offset by higher employee-related costs, and we realized $5 million of net restructuring savings in the quarter. Gross savings most of which benefited RBIS were partially offset by roughly $4 million of transition cost for LGM's footprint action in Europe, and note that while we will incur an additional $10 million of transition costs in the first half of 2019 for this project with savings ramping up in the second half.
So turning now to cash generation and allocation. Excluding the $200 million contribution to the U.S. pension plan, free cash flow for the full year was $429 million, up by roughly $8 million compared to the prior year. As we've discussed, we've increased our pace of fixed capital in IT-related spending this year with gross capital spending up by about $30 million to support both organic growth and margin expansion.
And we continued to return cash to shareholders with a higher dividend and share repurchases. We significantly accelerated the pace of share buyback during the fourth quarter to $218 million. For the full year, we repurchased roughly 4 million shares at an aggregate cost of $393 million and paid $175 million in dividends. So collectively, we returned a total of $568 million to shareholders in 2018, roughly 2x the amount we distributed the year before.
So let me now turn to the segment results for the quarter. Label and Graphic Materials sales increased by 4.7% on an organic basis, driven largely by price. High-value categories once again grew faster than the base business. Breaking down LGM's organic growth in the quarter by region, North America was up high single digits and Western Europe grew at a low single-digit rate. Growth in emerging markets was mid-single digits with continued strength in South Asia and Latin America. China grew mid-single digits, including a benefit from the timing of sales due to prebuys in the prior year.
On a normalized basis, the trend in China slowed relative to the first half. Operating margin for the segment was strong, up 40 basis points on an adjusted basis to 12.9%, as the benefits of productivity, increased volume and the net impact of pricing and raw material costs more than offset the higher employee-related expense and transition costs associated with the European restructuring.
Looking sequentially, raw material input costs were relatively stable in the fourth quarter, and we realized a benefit from our pricing actions driving much of the anticipated rebound in our margin from the Q3 level. With the benefit of recent pricing actions, we expect to have substantially covered the effect of the past 18 months of inflation.
Shifting now to Retail Branding and Information Solutions, RBIS delivered another quarter of strong top line growth, up 6.9% on an organic basis driven by both RFID and the base business. Total RFID sales were up 20% for the quarter, the vast majority of which benefited RBIS, driven largely by European brands and retailers.
Adjusted operating margin for the segment expanded by 10 basis points to 12.2%, as the benefits from increased volume and productivity were largely offset by higher employee-related costs and growth-related investments, which ramped up over the course of the year. And finally, turning to the Industrial and Healthcare Materials segment, sales grew 0.7% on an organic basis, as mid-single-digit organic growth for industrial categories in North America and Europe as well as for health care globally was mostly offset by weakness in industrial products for the China market.
Though this category represents only about 10% of IHM's total sales, that is less than 1% of the company's total sales, we experienced a significant decline in these products due to the drop in Chinese auto production. We made good progress on the margin front in IHM. Adjusted operating margin increased by 170 basis points to 9.6%, driven by productivity improvement. We faced a modest headwind from raw material cost net of pricing in the quarter, but expect to realize sufficient price increases in 2019 to cover this gap. I spent a lot of time meeting with our teams in IHM over the past 6 months. We're sharping our commercial focusing capabilities, improving our cost position, simplifying our organization structure and further aligning our operations teams with LGM to leverage our strengths there. And I remain confident in our ability to achieve our long-term goals of 4% to 5% plus organic growth, with operating margin gradually expanding to LGM's level or better by 2021.
So turning now to our outlook for 2019. We anticipate adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $6.45 to $6.70. The midpoint of our range reflects organic growth for LGM near the lower end of its long-term target range, while we assume RBIS will come in above the high end of its long-term range reflecting continued strength in RFID. We have outlined some of the key contributing factors to this guidance on Slide 15 of our supplemental presentation materials. We estimate that organic sales growth will be approximately 4% and currency translation will be a roughly 2.5 point headwind to reported sales growth with a pretax operating income hit of $25 million. And we estimate incremental pretax savings from restructuring net of transition costs will contribute about $35 million. Due to the timing of these actions and related transition costs, roughly 75% of the full year net savings from restructuring will be realized in the back half of the year. And we expect an adjusted tax rate in the mid-20s in line with 2018. And with the large noncash charge associated with the pension termination, we'll likely see a low single-digit reported effective tax rate. And we expect interest expense of roughly $75 million to $80 million, reflecting higher debt at the end of 2018 due to the pension contribution in Q3 and accelerated share buyback in the fourth quarter as well as the higher-average interest rate on total debt. And we anticipate spending $275 million to $285 million on fixed capital in IT projects consistent with our 5-year capital allocation plan, and we estimate average shares outstanding assuming dilution of $84 million to $85 million.
As previously discussed, we expect to complete the process of terminating our U.S. pension plan resulting in a pretax noncash charge estimated at $490 million during the first quarter with an estimated after-tax EPS hit of roughly $3.55. And finally, given the timing of the impacts from currency translation and restructuring actions, our projected earnings growth is significantly weighted to the back half of the year. In summary, we're pleased with the strategic and financial progress we made against our long-term goals in 2018, and we are committed to delivering exceptional value through our strategies for long-term profitable growth and disciplined capital allocation. Now we'll open up the call for your questions."

So overall versus what we have seen in years past, I'll talk about them separately. China, we'd talked about that growing mid- to upper single-digit growth trend up until a couple of years ago, and it's been a mid-single-digit growth kind of market since then. And then we saw in the second half, it started to decline to low single-digit levels, reflecting all that we're seeing going on within China. We expect long-term this should return to a mid-single-digit growth market overall. So we're seeing that in the second half of 2018. So we'd expect that to kind of continue at least as we comp the tougher comps in Q1 in the first half, but obviously, we have limited forward visibility. So that's kind of what we're seeing and what we're thinking. China automotive, very small part of the business, down pretty significantly. We'll comp through that here after the first quarter or so. And I know the Chinese government is putting in new incentives around automobile manufacturing and so forth as we speak. So that's something else that may have an impact. So overall, we expect China continue to be long-term very good market for us, here in the near-term growing, but at a lower pace. Europe, same thing, we saw the volumes growth moderate a bit in the second half and we are expecting that may continue here into the first part of the year with Brexit and everything else going on. And then if you think about long-term, Europe up until a year or so ago had been growing faster than we would otherwise expect. I'm talking at the market level. And now, it's growing in the low single-digit level, which is what we've consistently expected up until, again, the last 4 months or so when it's gotten very low single digits, if you will. So that is our -- what we're seeing. And we're basically assuming a continuation of that at least for the first part of the year depending on, if you're at the low end of our guidance range, it'd be continuing a little bit longer; if you're at the high end of the guidance range, it would correct itself rather quickly."

So we saw that years ago when there was large migration from Latin America to China as an example. Having said that, I think the pace of migration, I mean, it will depend on what's going on at the trade discussions going on between the various governments. But there is a large footprint within China and there is a huge network benefit of -- cluster benefit within China around this. So I'm not sure how quickly it will exactly move, but we are prepared to work with our partners to move as quickly as they individually wish to do."

Clearly, when you go through a period of change like this, we've maintained or gained share in the key regions where we have visibility of the market data for the full year '18 versus '17. But as you go through price increase and so forth, you will see share positions, particularly in some of the less differentiated categories, have a little bit more variability throughout the course of the year and we saw that, but that is just part of the normal practice. And we, as we've discussed in the past, willing to take some near-term share risk during a period of price increase because we know we can recapture share within the near term. So a little bit more volatility on that, but that is absolutely the norm we've seen over cycles as far as the competitive dynamic."

I'm pleased to report our seventh consecutive year of strong top line growth, margin expansion and double-digit adjusted EPS growth. Our Label and Graphic Materials business delivered strong performance in a year of",1347,"Thanks, Cindy, and good day, everyone. I'm pleased to report our seventh consecutive year of strong top line growth, margin expansion and double-digit adjusted EPS growth. Our Label and Graphic Materials business delivered strong performance in a year of significant raw material inflation, Retail Branding and Information Solutions posted both strong top line growth and significant margin expansion and Industrial and Healthcare Materials made solid progress with its margin turnaround in the back half.
2018 marked an important milestone for the company as the final year of measurement for the 5-year financial targets we communicated in early 2014. This is the second long-term performance cycle we've completed since first introducing this discipline back in 2012, and I'm pleased to report that we once again achieved our company goals. Importantly, we are also on track to achieve our 5-year goals through 2021.
Our consistent performance reflects the resilience of our industry-leading market positions, the strategic foundations we've laid and our agile and talented workforce. Our strategic playbook continues to work for us as we focus on 4 overarching priorities: driving outsized growth in high-value product categories, growing profitably in our base businesses, relentlessly pursuing productivity improvement and remaining disciplined in our approach to capital management.
In 2018, we made good progress on all 4 of these strategic pillars. We delivered organic growth of 5.5%, reflecting continued solid growth in our base businesses and continuing above-average volume growth from emerging markets and high-value categories such as specialty labels and RFID. Emerging markets and high-value categories remain our 2 key catalysts for GDP-plus growth across our entire portfolio. Roughly half of our total sales are linked to one or both of these catalysts.
In 2018, high-value categories continued to grow at a high single-digit pace with RFID now contributing nearly a full point to total company sales growth. And the emerging market volume once again grew faster than average. Importantly, our end market exposure in emerging regions is quite broad based with relatively even balance among China, South Asia and a combination of Latin America and Eastern Europe. Equally important to top line results, we also maintained our strong focus on continuous productivity improvement. The combination of product reengineering, restructuring and the deployment of lean operating principles contributed significantly to our results in 2018. This focus remains key to our long-term success, not just as a means to expand margins, but to enhance our competitiveness and to provide a funding source for reinvestment. 
Now looking at how these strategies played out in each of our segments. Label and Graphic Materials delivered another year of strong top line growth, reflecting above-average volume growth in emerging markets and high-value categories as well as pricing. Specialty labels led the way for LGM's high-value categories with organic growth of roughly 10%, while Graphics and Reflective grew at a solid mid-single-digit pace. Strength in emerging markets was led by South Asia and Latin America, while China was up mid-single digits. Mature regions delivered solid organic growth in 2018.
Now, while organic growth was strong overall for the year, our volume growth did moderate a bit in both Europe and China in the second half. This trend is reflected in our guidance assumptions for LGM for 2019. LGM's operating margin remained strong in this high return business, a significant result given that raw material inflation came in much higher than we anticipated at the start of the year. Keeping up with significant and persistent inflation required multiple price increases in every region of the world over the past 18 months as well as, of course, our continued focus on innovative product reengineering. Overall, another strong year for LGM.
Retail Branding and Information Solutions delivered both strong top line growth and significant margin expansion, driven by continued execution of our transformation strategy and continued strength in RFID. In the base business, sales increased across all product categories, reflecting broad-based growth in performance athletic, premium and the value channels. Our ability to grow our base business here in the face of a challenging retail environment underscores the success of our multiyear transformation strategy as our improvements in service, flexibility and speed continue to resonate with our customers, and RFID grew by more than 20% in 2018, topping $300 million for the year.
As you know, apparel represents the vast majority of our total RFID sales today, driving most of the growth last year. Outside of apparel, we're seeing early-stage traction in multiple categories, including food, beauty and aviation, which collectively contributed 2 points of growth for the year in RFID. Our pipeline continues to expand across all categories, driving our confidence that RFID will continue to deliver 15% to 20%-plus growth annually. We continue to increase our level of investment to support this growth as we build out our Intelligent Labels platform to enable a future where every item can have a digital twin and a digital life.
RBIS's adjusted operating margin expanded another 170 basis points, not only beating the high end of our long-term 2018 target range, but also hitting the middle of our 2021 target range ahead of schedule. The team has done a tremendous job transforming RBIS into a simpler, faster and more competitive business over the past 3 years, and we're pleased with the momentum that we're seeing here.
Turning to Industrial and Healthcare Materials. As you know, it was a challenging year for IHM and results fell short of our goals. That said, our top line challenge is mostly limited to the business serving the China auto market. Elsewhere, we progressed well. Our industrial businesses in both North America and Europe grew organically at mid-single-digit rate with improved profitability in the second half and our medical business, part of the total health care category, grew high single digits organically. We obviously have more work to do to achieve our 2021 targets we've set for IHM. I remain confident we'll achieve these goals just as I was with RBIS a few years back. And I've covered the first 3 of our strategic pillars, driving outsized growth in high-value products, growing profitably in the base and relentlessly pursuing productivity gains.
Now I'll cover the fourth pillar, highly disciplined capital management. In terms of the investments we're making for organic growth and productivity, our primary focus has been capacity-adds in emerging regions for LGM, recapitalizing LGM's European and North American footprint and investing in both capacity and business development globally for RFID.
Carefully planned and executed M&A is another key element of our disciplined capital allocation strategy. Though we didn't complete any acquisitions in 2018, our strategy here has not changed. We look for opportunities to increase our exposure to high value-add segments as well as to expand and leverage our core capabilities.
And finally, we continue to be disciplined in our approach to returning cash to shareholders and as a result, significantly accelerated stock buyback in the fourth quarter. In addition to the progress we made toward our 2021 strategic and financial goals, we are also making solid progress towards our 2025 sustainability goals. Just to hit a few highlights. We've reduced our greenhouse gas emissions by 25% since 2015, roughly 80% of our paper is now Forest Stewardship Council certified and more than 90% of our operations are now landfill-free.
Looking ahead, we are focused on tackling industry-wide challenges with a particular focus on packaging recyclability by leveraging our existing products and capabilities and developing new opportunities through collaboration with our customers and partners.
Summing up, I'm pleased with the progress we've made toward our long-term goals, as we continue to deliver consistent GDP-plus organic growth and top quartile returns on capital. For 2019, we will continue to make progress toward these goals with the midpoint of our adjusted EPS range up 12% before the headwind from currency translation. Now while we expect the external environment may prove more challenging this year, we are prepared for it commercially, operationally and financially, and we will seek opportunities to lean forward even as others may pull back.
Now I'll turn the call over to Greg."
252978,598585258,1643707,"Avery Dennison Corporation, Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Jan 30, 2019",2019-01-30,"Earnings Calls","Avery Dennison Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Mitch, and hello, everybody. I'll first provide some additional color on our performance against our long-term goals and then walk you through fourth quarter performance and our outlook for 2019. As Mitch said, 2018 was an important milestone for",1652,"Thanks, Mitch, and hello, everybody. I'll first provide some additional color on our performance against our long-term goals and then walk you through fourth quarter performance and our outlook for 2019. As Mitch said, 2018 was an important milestone for the company as the final year of measurement for the 5-year financial targets we communicated in early 2014. And as he noted, we achieved all of our targets.
If we turn to Slide 7 of the supplemental materials, you will see our scorecard. Sales grew more than 4% organically and reported operating margin hit 10% or 11% on an adjusted basis. And adjusted EPS grew 18% annually over the past 5 years. And at the same time, we expanded return on total capital over this period by 8 full points to 19% in 2018. And our balance sheet remains strong, with our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio on the low end of our targeted range for 2018.
In March of 2017, we introduced a new set of long-term targets, extending our planning horizon to 2021. As you can see on Slide 8, now 2 years into this cycle, we are on pace to achieve these goals as well. Given the diversity of our end markets, our strong competitive advantages and our resilience as an organization to adjust course when needed, we are confident in our ability to deliver through a wide range of business cycles. At the same time that we communicated our financial targets through 2021, we also laid out a 5-year plan for capital allocation, which you can see on Slide 9. We put a total of $1.7 billion to work over the first 2 years of this cycle, allocating it very much in line with our long-term plan. This plan reflects our goal to deliver top quartile returns relative to capital market peers, a position we have maintained while increasing our pace of investment for both organic growth and M&A.
And further, our current leverage position gives us ample capacity to continue investing in organic growth and acquisitions, while also continuing to return cash to shareholders in a disciplined way, and we are clearly in excellent shape to take advantage of any dislocations in the market should they occur over the next few years.
Now let's focus on the fourth quarter. Overall, our financial results were solid. Reported earnings per share was $1.11, including a net $0.37 hit from the combined effects of the pension settlement and tax benefits from a discrete tax planning action in TCJA estimate revision. Adjusted earnings per share was $1.52, a few cents better than our expectations and up 14% compared to prior year, driven by both sales growth and margin expansion. We grew sales by 4.8% on an organic basis as currency translation reduced reported sales growth by 2.9 points in the quarter.
Currency translation represented a roughly $0.06 headwind to EPS compared to the same period last year, which by the way exactly offset the benefit from the lower adjusted tax rate. Adjusted operating margin increased by 50 basis points to 11.1% as the benefits from higher volume and productivity were partially offset by higher employee-related costs, and we realized $5 million of net restructuring savings in the quarter. Gross savings most of which benefited RBIS were partially offset by roughly $4 million of transition cost for LGM's footprint action in Europe, and note that while we will incur an additional $10 million of transition costs in the first half of 2019 for this project with savings ramping up in the second half.
So turning now to cash generation and allocation. Excluding the $200 million contribution to the U.S. pension plan, free cash flow for the full year was $429 million, up by roughly $8 million compared to the prior year. As we've discussed, we've increased our pace of fixed capital in IT-related spending this year with gross capital spending up by about $30 million to support both organic growth and margin expansion.
And we continued to return cash to shareholders with a higher dividend and share repurchases. We significantly accelerated the pace of share buyback during the fourth quarter to $218 million. For the full year, we repurchased roughly 4 million shares at an aggregate cost of $393 million and paid $175 million in dividends. So collectively, we returned a total of $568 million to shareholders in 2018, roughly 2x the amount we distributed the year before.
So let me now turn to the segment results for the quarter. Label and Graphic Materials sales increased by 4.7% on an organic basis, driven largely by price. High-value categories once again grew faster than the base business. Breaking down LGM's organic growth in the quarter by region, North America was up high single digits and Western Europe grew at a low single-digit rate. Growth in emerging markets was mid-single digits with continued strength in South Asia and Latin America. China grew mid-single digits, including a benefit from the timing of sales due to prebuys in the prior year.
On a normalized basis, the trend in China slowed relative to the first half. Operating margin for the segment was strong, up 40 basis points on an adjusted basis to 12.9%, as the benefits of productivity, increased volume and the net impact of pricing and raw material costs more than offset the higher employee-related expense and transition costs associated with the European restructuring.
Looking sequentially, raw material input costs were relatively stable in the fourth quarter, and we realized a benefit from our pricing actions driving much of the anticipated rebound in our margin from the Q3 level. With the benefit of recent pricing actions, we expect to have substantially covered the effect of the past 18 months of inflation.
Shifting now to Retail Branding and Information Solutions, RBIS delivered another quarter of strong top line growth, up 6.9% on an organic basis driven by both RFID and the base business. Total RFID sales were up 20% for the quarter, the vast majority of which benefited RBIS, driven largely by European brands and retailers.
Adjusted operating margin for the segment expanded by 10 basis points to 12.2%, as the benefits from increased volume and productivity were largely offset by higher employee-related costs and growth-related investments, which ramped up over the course of the year. And finally, turning to the Industrial and Healthcare Materials segment, sales grew 0.7% on an organic basis, as mid-single-digit organic growth for industrial categories in North America and Europe as well as for health care globally was mostly offset by weakness in industrial products for the China market.
Though this category represents only about 10% of IHM's total sales, that is less than 1% of the company's total sales, we experienced a significant decline in these products due to the drop in Chinese auto production. We made good progress on the margin front in IHM. Adjusted operating margin increased by 170 basis points to 9.6%, driven by productivity improvement. We faced a modest headwind from raw material cost net of pricing in the quarter, but expect to realize sufficient price increases in 2019 to cover this gap. I spent a lot of time meeting with our teams in IHM over the past 6 months. We're sharping our commercial focusing capabilities, improving our cost position, simplifying our organization structure and further aligning our operations teams with LGM to leverage our strengths there. And I remain confident in our ability to achieve our long-term goals of 4% to 5% plus organic growth, with operating margin gradually expanding to LGM's level or better by 2021.
So turning now to our outlook for 2019. We anticipate adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $6.45 to $6.70. The midpoint of our range reflects organic growth for LGM near the lower end of its long-term target range, while we assume RBIS will come in above the high end of its long-term range reflecting continued strength in RFID. We have outlined some of the key contributing factors to this guidance on Slide 15 of our supplemental presentation materials. We estimate that organic sales growth will be approximately 4% and currency translation will be a roughly 2.5 point headwind to reported sales growth with a pretax operating income hit of $25 million. And we estimate incremental pretax savings from restructuring net of transition costs will contribute about $35 million. Due to the timing of these actions and related transition costs, roughly 75% of the full year net savings from restructuring will be realized in the back half of the year. And we expect an adjusted tax rate in the mid-20s in line with 2018. And with the large noncash charge associated with the pension termination, we'll likely see a low single-digit reported effective tax rate. And we expect interest expense of roughly $75 million to $80 million, reflecting higher debt at the end of 2018 due to the pension contribution in Q3 and accelerated share buyback in the fourth quarter as well as the higher-average interest rate on total debt. And we anticipate spending $275 million to $285 million on fixed capital in IT projects consistent with our 5-year capital allocation plan, and we estimate average shares outstanding assuming dilution of $84 million to $85 million.
As previously discussed, we expect to complete the process of terminating our U.S. pension plan resulting in a pretax noncash charge estimated at $490 million during the first quarter with an estimated after-tax EPS hit of roughly $3.55. And finally, given the timing of the impacts from currency translation and restructuring actions, our projected earnings growth is significantly weighted to the back half of the year. In summary, we're pleased with the strategic and financial progress we made against our long-term goals in 2018, and we are committed to delivering exceptional value through our strategies for long-term profitable growth and disciplined capital allocation. Now we'll open up the call for your questions."

I think, if I can step back broadly for 2019, if I think about free cash flow, we'd expect free cash flow to see somewhat of a modest improvement in '19 versus where we were in 2018. As we look at continuing to spend a little bit more on capital investments, as Mitch mentioned earlier in his comments. We also expect to have some of the cash restructuring charges related to that European action that we announced a year ago, much of that cash will hit us in 2019. So we'll see some continued improvement on the profit side as we've talked about and then we'll have some higher CapEx and a little bit higher restructuring costs, overall expect a modest improvement in free cash flow in 2019."

So overall versus what we have seen in years past, I'll talk about them separately. China, we'd talked about that growing mid- to upper single-digit growth trend up until a couple of years ago, and it's been a mid-single-digit growth kind of market since then. And then we saw in the second half, it started to decline to low single-digit levels, reflecting all that we're seeing going on within China. We expect long-term this should return to a mid-single-digit growth market overall. So we're seeing that in the second half of 2018. So we'd expect that to kind of continue at least as we comp the tougher comps in Q1 in the first half, but obviously, we have limited forward visibility. So that's kind of what we're seeing and what we're thinking. China automotive, very small part of the business, down pretty significantly. We'll comp through that here after the first quarter or so. And I know the Chinese government is putting in new incentives around automobile manufacturing and so forth as we speak. So that's something else that may have an impact. So overall, we expect China continue to be long-term very good market for us, here in the near-term growing, but at a lower pace. Europe, same thing, we saw the volumes growth moderate a bit in the second half and we are expecting that may continue here into the first part of the year with Brexit and everything else going on. And then if you think about long-term, Europe up until a year or so ago had been growing faster than we would otherwise expect. I'm talking at the market level. And now, it's growing in the low single-digit level, which is what we've consistently expected up until, again, the last 4 months or so when it's gotten very low single digits, if you will. So that is our -- what we're seeing. And we're basically assuming a continuation of that at least for the first part of the year depending on, if you're at the low end of our guidance range, it'd be continuing a little bit longer; if you're at the high end of the guidance range, it would correct itself rather quickly."

So it's broad based, Rosemarie, across the board. And if you look at apparel import unit, they were up roughly 3% so far year-to-date, picked up last couple of months. And if we look at our volume trends, it's still well above that. And then clearly, RFID, it's a clear value driver in RFID, but, I'd say, it also creates a halo effect across the rest of RBIS as we are clearly the partner to go to for adoption and then just continued rollout of this technology."

And then it's really at the discussion level still. Apparel imports did surge quite a bit in the most recently available month, which may indicate some of what you are referring to. But on the flip side, inventory levels continue to be extremely lean at the retail level and those have actually declined over the last year as retailers continue to get more lean overall. So there is some signs that maybe that did happen, I don't think so. It is part of the active discussion we're having with retailers and brands. And I think this level of uncertainty really just increases focus on the importance of having a global presence for us as well as the importance of having lean inventory levels for retailers, which really plays to our strength and the strength of RFID, which is one of the other reasons we are continuing to see increased pace of focus around RFID adoption within apparel."

Clearly, when you go through a period of change like this, we've maintained or gained share in the key regions where we have visibility of the market data for the full year '18 versus '17. But as you go through price increase and so forth, you will see share positions, particularly in some of the less differentiated categories, have a little bit more variability throughout the course of the year and we saw that, but that is just part of the normal practice. And we, as we've discussed in the past, willing to take some near-term share risk during a period of price increase because we know we can recapture share within the near term. So a little bit more volatility on that, but that is absolutely the norm we've seen over cycles as far as the competitive dynamic."

We delivered adjusted EPS in line with our expectations for the first quarter of roughly 10% increase over prior year on a constant-currency basis number, despite organic revenue coming in a bit lower than usual as c",586,"Thanks, Cindy, and good day, everyone. We delivered adjusted EPS in line with our expectations for the first quarter of roughly 10% increase over prior year on a constant-currency basis number, despite organic revenue coming in a bit lower than usual as continued strong performance in RBIS was partially offset by soft volume in our 2 materials businesses. 
Label and Graphic Materials posted roughly 1.5% organic growth for the quarter, driven by pricing. Volumes were down as growth in our high-value categories was offset by declines in our base businesses as we see some share in lower margin less differentiated categories due to our disciplined approach to raising prices to offset inflation. We expect to win much of this business back over the course of the few quarters.
As for underlying market trends for label materials, conditions appear to been relatively soft over the past couple of quarters, not only in Europe and China, as we discussed previously, but in North America as well. We expect our organic growth rate to improve as we move through the year, driven by gradual focus share gain as well as a modest improvement in underlying market demand. Despite the soft top line, productivity effort supported a healthy operating margin for LGM in the quarter, particularly in light of transition costs associated with the European restructuring. We expect LGM's operating margin to improve through the course of the year, driven largely by benefits from the completion of this project in Europe.
Retail Branding and Information Solutions once again delivered both strong top line growth and significant margin expansion. The base business grew by roughly 3% on an organic basis, while enterprise-wide RFID once again grew by more than 20%. As you know, apparel represents the vast majority of RFID sales and was again the key driver of most of our growth here in the quarter. And our pipeline continues to expand, already up roughly 15% from the beginning of this year with engagements in categories of apparel, principally food, beauty and aviation leading the way.
Given the strength of our position, strategies and team, we are confident in our ability to achieve our long-term target for RFID solutions, that is 15% to 20% plus growth. We continue to increase our level of investment to support this growth as we build out our intelligent labels platform to enable a future where every item can have a digital twin and digital life. 
In Industrial and Healthcare Materials, sales declined modestly on an organic basis, driven by the decline in global automobile production, which more than offset solid growth in other industrial categories as well as strong growth in medical. And as for margins, we made good progress in the quarter towards achieving our target for this business.
In short, another solid quarter and we are reaffirming our earnings guidance for the year. While the year starting off more challenging, we are prepared for it. Our relentless focus on productivity continues to enable us to increase our pace of investment high-value segments, increase our competitiveness and grow profitably in our base businesses, while importantly continuing to expand operating margin, which we were able to do again in the first quarter and expect to deliver for the full year.
We remain confident in our ability to achieve our long-term objective, and we will continue to seek opportunities to leverage our positions of strength commercially, operationally and financially and lean forward even as others may pull back. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Greg."

We delivered a solid start to the year with adjusted earnings per share of $1.48 in line with our expectations. As expected, pension settlement charges almost entirely noncash a loss in reported income. Reported earning",1080,"Thanks, Mitch, and hello, everyone. We delivered a solid start to the year with adjusted earnings per share of $1.48 in line with our expectations. As expected, pension settlement charges almost entirely noncash a loss in reported income. Reported earnings per share was a negative $1.74, including a $3.13 per share hit from the pension settlement charges net of tax. We grew sales by 2.4% on organic basis, as currency translation reduced reported sales growth by 4.4 points in the quarter and adjusted operating margin increased by 30 basis points to 10.9%. 
We realized $5 million of net restructuring savings in the quarter in note that we are still incurring transition costs associated with the European restructuring with savings ramping up in the second half of the year. 
Turning now to cash generation and allocation. We generated $7 million of free cash flow in the quarter, which was up roughly $27 million compared to the prior year. And recall that free cash flow in the first quarter is typically negative, driven primarily by the timing of employee incentive and customer rebate payments. 
In the first quarter, we effectively settled the liabilities associated with the termination of our U.S. pension plan. The cash cost to complete this transaction was significantly better than expected, reflecting competitive market conditions for the purchase of annuities. As we discussed, we've increased our pace of fixed capital in IT-related spending for a couple of year period with gross capital spending expected to be up by about $25 million this year compared to last year to support our organic growth and margin expansion plans. We do expect capital spending to then moderate over the next few years consistent with our long-term capital allocation strategy. And we continue to return cash to shareholders as we repurchased roughly 0.9 million shares at an aggregate cost of $89 million and paid $44 million in dividends in the quarter. 
Our balance sheet remained strong. Our current leverage position gives us ample capacity to continue executing our disciplined capital allocation strategy, including investing in organic growth in acquisitions, while continuing to return cash to shareholders. We are well positioned to take advantage of any dislocations in the market, should they occur over the next few years. 
So turning to the segment results for the quarter. Label and Graphic Materials sales increased by 1.4% on organic basis, driven by prior year pricing actions as the volume mix declined modestly. LGM's high-value segments continue to outpace growth of the base business, led by specialty and durable categories, which were collectively up high single digits on organic basis. 
Breaking down LGM's organic growth in the quarter by region, North America was up low single digits, while Western Europe was roughly flat. Emerging markets also grew modestly as strength in South Asia and Latin America was largely offset by organic sales declines in China and Eastern Europe.
Operating margin for the segment was down 50 basis points on an adjusted basis to 12.5%. Due to the margin impact of raising prices to offset the raw material inflation combined with transition costs associated with the European restructuring. Ongoing productivity initiatives, including material reengineering offset the impacts of lower volume and higher employee-related costs. 
At this point, we've covered the cumulative effects of the roughly 18 months of raw material cost inflation that we've experienced through a combination of both pricing actions and material reengineering.
Globally, raw material costs were down modestly on a sequential basis in the first quarter and our outlook assumes relative stability through the balance of the year. 
Shifting now to Retail Branding and Information Solutions. RBS delivered another quarter of strong top line growth, up 7% on an organic basis driven by both RFID and the base business. Total RFID sales were up by more than 20% for the quarter, the vast majority of which benefited the RBS segment with faster growth among European brands and retailers.
Adjusted operating margin for the segment expanded by 220 basis points to 12.4%, as increased volume and lower currency related costs more than offset higher employee-related costs in the quarter. 
Turning to the Industrial and Healthcare Materials segment, sales declined by 1% on an organic basis, driven by the decline in global auto production as automotive applications globally represent about 1/3 of IHM's total sales. Outside of automotive, industrial categories were up mid-single digits on an organic basis and healthcare categories grew low single-digit pace with the mid-teens growth in medical applications. And we made good progress on the margin front in IHM. 
Adjusted operating margin increased by 200 basis points to 9.5%, driven by productivity improvements. Focusing now on our outlook for 2019, we have maintained our guidance for adjusted earnings per share to be between $6.45 and $6.70. We have trimmed our outlook for organic sales growth to roughly 3.5% in light of the softer start to the year. With the midpoint of our EPS guidance range assuming that organic growth for LGM comes in below the long end of its long-term target range or we continue to expect that RBS will come in above the high end of its long-term range reflecting continued strength in RFID. 
We've outlined some of the other key contributing factors to this guidance on Slide 9 of our supplemental presentation materials. In particular and just focusing on the changes from our assumptions in January, at recent exchange rates, currency translation represents roughly 2.5 headwind to reported sales growth for the year with a pretax operating income hit of $27 million. This is up modestly from the $25 million we anticipated previously.
We estimate incremental pretax savings from restructuring, net of transition costs will contribute about $40 million to $45 million, up from our January estimate of $35 million. as we now completed planning that was still in process or the start of the year. Due to the timing of these actions and related transition costs, roughly 70% of the full year net savings from restructuring will be realized in the back half of the year.
And as I mentioned, total pretax charges associated with the settlement of pension liabilities came down to roughly $450 million with an after-tax EPS hit of roughly $3.15, almost entirely in the first quarter. In summary, we delivered another solid quarter and remain confident in our ability to deliver on our long-term goals to achieve GDP-plus growth and top quartile our return on capital.

In IHM, I just said, we feel good about the margin tragically we had in the first quarter. We continue to target 10% margin for the full year this year, and it's a combination of things helping us deliver that. I think, we talked about before may be that we're following factors we used in RBIS few years ago, around simplifying organization structure, moving decision-making closer to our customers and regions where we have that contract with the customer, improving our speed, improving our efficiency from that perspective and then improving our cost.

We delivered adjusted EPS in line with our expectations for the first quarter, a roughly 10% increase over prior year on a constant currency basis number despite organic revenue coming in a bit lower than usual as continued strong performance in RBIS was partially offset by soft volume in our 2 materials businesses.
Label and Graphic Materials posted roughly 1.5% organic growth for the quarter, driven by pricing. Volumes were down as growth in our high-value categories was offset by declines in our base businesses as we ceded some share in lower margin less differentiated categories due to our disciplined approach to raising prices to offset inflation. We expect to win much of this business back over the course of a few quarters.
As for underlying market trends for label materials, conditions appear to have been relatively soft over the past couple of quarters, not only in Europe and China, as we've discussed previously, but in North America as well. We expect our organic growth rate to improve as we move through the year, driven by gradual focused share gain as well as a modest improvement in underlying market demand. Despite the soft top line, productivity efforts supported a healthy operating margin for LGM in the quarter, particularly in light of transition costs associated with the European restructuring. We expect LGM's operating margin to improve through the course of the year, driven largely by benefits from the completion of this project in Europe.
Retail Branding and Information Solutions once again delivered both strong top line growth and significant margin expansion. The base business grew by roughly 3% on an organic basis, while enterprise-wide RFID once again grew by more than 20%. As you know, apparel represents the vast majority of RFID sales and was again the key driver of most of our growth here in the quarter. And our pipeline continue to expand, already up roughly 15% from the beginning of this year, with engagements in categories outside of apparel, principally food, beauty and aviation, leading the way.
Given the strength of our position, strategies and team, we are confident in our ability to achieve our long-term target for RFID solutions, that is 15% to 20% plus growth. We continue to increase our level of investment to support this growth as we build out our intelligent Labels platform to enable a future where every item can have a digital twin and digital life.
In Industrial and Healthcare Materials, sales declined modestly on an organic basis, driven by the decline in global automobile production, which more than offset solid growth in other industrial categories as well as strong growth in medical. And as for margins, we made good progress in the quarter towards achieving our target for this business.
In short, another solid quarter and we are reaffirming our earnings guidance for the year. While the year starting off more challenging, we are prepared for it. Our relentless focus on productivity continues to enable us to increase our pace of investment in high-value segments, increase our competitiveness and grow profitably in our base businesses, while importantly continuing to expand operating margin, which we were able to do again in the first quarter and expect to deliver for the full year.
We remain confident in our ability to achieve our long-term objectives, and we will continue to seek opportunities to leverage our positions of strength commercially, operationally and financially and lean forward even as others may pull back.
Now I'll turn the call over to Greg."
252978,609936517,1704044,"Avery Dennison Corporation, Q1 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2019",2019-04-24,"Earnings Calls","Avery Dennison Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Mitch, and hello, everyone. We delivered a solid start to the year, with adjusted earnings per share of $1.48 in line with our expectations. As expected, pension settlement charges, almost entirely noncash, drove a loss in reported income. Reporte",1084,"Thanks, Mitch, and hello, everyone. We delivered a solid start to the year, with adjusted earnings per share of $1.48 in line with our expectations. As expected, pension settlement charges, almost entirely noncash, drove a loss in reported income. Reported earnings per share was a negative $1.74, including a $3.13 per share hit from the pension settlement charges net of tax. We grew sales by 2.4% on an organic basis, as currency translation reduced reported sales growth by 4.4 points in the quarter and adjusted operating margin increased by 30 basis points to 10.9%.
We realized $5 million of net restructuring savings in the quarter, and note that we are still incurring transition costs associated with the European restructuring with savings ramping up in the second half of the year.
Turning now to cash generation and allocation. We generated $7 million of free cash flow in the quarter, which was up roughly $27 million compared to the prior year. And recall that free cash flow in the first quarter is typically negative, driven primarily by the timing of employee incentive and customer rebate payments.
In the first quarter, we effectively settled the liabilities associated with the termination of our U.S. pension plan. The cash cost to complete this transaction was significantly better than expected, reflecting competitive market conditions for the purchase of annuities.
As we've discussed, we've increased our pace of fixed capital in IT-related spending for a couple of year period, with gross capital spending expected to be up by about $25 million this year compared to last year to support our organic growth and margin expansion plans. We do expect capital spending to then moderate over the next few years consistent with our long-term capital allocation strategy. And we continue to return cash to shareholders as we repurchased roughly 0.9 million shares at an aggregate cost of $89 million and paid $44 million in dividends in the quarter.
Our balance sheet remained strong. Our current leverage position gives us ample capacity to continue executing our disciplined capital allocation strategy, including investing in organic growth and acquisitions, while continuing to return cash to shareholders. We are well positioned to take advantage of any dislocations in the market, should they occur over the next few years.
So turning to the segment results for the quarter. Label and Graphic Materials sales increased by 1.4% on an organic basis, driven by prior year pricing actions as volume mix declined modestly. LGM's high-value segments continue to outpace growth of the base business, led by specialty and durable categories, which are collectively up high single digits on an organic basis.
Breaking down LGM's organic growth in the quarter by region, North America was up low single digits, while Western Europe was roughly flat. Emerging markets also grew modestly as strength in South Asia and Latin America was largely offset by organic sales declines in China and Eastern Europe.
Operating margin for the segment was down 50 basis points on an adjusted basis to 12.5% due to the margin impact of raising prices to offset raw material inflation combined with transition costs associated with the European restructuring. Ongoing productivity initiatives, including material reengineering, offset the impacts of lower volume and higher employee-related costs.
At this point, we've covered the cumulative effects of the roughly 18 months raw material cost inflation that we've experienced through a combination of both pricing actions and material reengineering.
Globally, raw material costs were down modestly on a sequential basis in the first quarter and our outlook assumes relative stability through the balance of the year.
Shifting now to Retail Branding and Information Solutions. RBIS delivered another quarter of strong top line growth, up 7% on an organic basis driven by both RFID and the base business. Total RFID sales were up by more than 20% for the quarter, the vast majority of which benefited the RBIS segment, with faster growth among European brands and retailers.
Adjusted operating margin for the segment expanded by 220 basis points to 12.4%, as increased volume and lower currency-related costs more than offset higher employee-related costs in the quarter.
Turning to the Industrial and Healthcare Materials segment, sales declined by 1% on an organic basis, driven by the decline in global auto production as automotive applications globally represent about 1/3 of IHM's total sales. Outside of automotive, industrial categories were up mid-single digits on an organic basis. And healthcare categories grew at a low single-digit pace with the mid-teens growth in medical applications. And we made good progress on the margin front in IHM. Adjusted operating margin increased by 200 basis points to 9.5%, driven by productivity improvements.
Focusing now on our outlook for 2019, we have maintained our guidance for adjusted earnings per share to be between $6.45 and $6.70. We have trimmed our outlook for organic sales growth to roughly 3.5% in light of the softer start to the year. With the midpoint of our EPS guidance range assuming that organic growth for LGM comes in below the long end of its long-term target range, while we continue to expect that RBIS will come in above the high end of its long-term range reflecting continued strength in RFID.
We've outlined some of the other key contributing factors to this guidance on Slide 9 of our supplemental presentation materials. In particular and just focusing on the changes from our assumptions in January, at recent exchange rates, currency translation represents a roughly 2.5 point headwind to reported sales growth for the year with a pretax operating income hit of $27 million. This is up modestly from the $25 million we anticipated previously.
We estimate incremental pretax savings from restructuring, net of transition costs, will contribute about $40 million to $45 million, up from our January estimate of $35 million as we've now completed planning that was still in process at the start of the year. Due to the timing of these actions and related transition costs, roughly 70% of the full year net savings from restructuring will be realized in the back half of the year.
And as I mentioned, total pretax charges associated with the settlement of pension liabilities came down to roughly $450 million with an after-tax EPS hit of roughly $3.15 almost entirely in the first quarter.
In summary, we delivered another solid quarter and remain confident in our ability to deliver on our long-term goals to achieve GDP-plus growth and top quartile return on capital.
And we'll now open up the call for your questions."

So these are early stage and just like with apparel, the areas outside of apparel will take few years to really get meaningful revenue, but that's how you should think about it is that we see great amount of traction and progress for growth in the coming years around apparel, and we're looking to build the next waves beyond that.

So it's not in one specific action, it's a number of smaller actions spread across both of our materials businesses and regions.
In IHM, as you said, we feel good about the margin trajectory we had in the first quarter. We continue to target 10% margin for the full year this year, and it's a combination of things helping us deliver that. I think, we talked about before maybe that we're following tactics we used in RBIS a few years ago around simplifying organization structure, moving decision-making closer to our customers in the regions where we have that contact with the customer, improving our speed, improving our efficiency from that perspective and improving our cost.

We delivered adjusted EPS in line with our expectations for the first quarter, a roughly 10% increase over prior year on a constant currency basis, despite organic revenue coming in a bit lower than usual as continue",590,"Thanks, Cindy, and good day, everyone. We delivered adjusted EPS in line with our expectations for the first quarter, a roughly 10% increase over prior year on a constant currency basis, despite organic revenue coming in a bit lower than usual as continued strong performance in RBIS was partially offset by soft volume in our 2 materials businesses.
Label and Graphic Materials posted roughly 1.5% organic growth for the quarter, driven by pricing. Volumes were down as growth in our high-value categories was offset by declines in our base businesses as we ceded some share in lower margin less differentiated categories due to our disciplined approach to raising prices to offset inflation. We expect to win much of this business back over the course of a few quarters.
As for underlying market trends for label materials, conditions appear to have been relatively soft over the past couple of quarters, not only in Europe and China, as we've discussed previously, but in North America as well. We expect our organic growth rate to improve as we move through the year, driven by gradual focused share gain as well as a modest improvement in underlying market demand. Despite the soft top line, productivity efforts supported a healthy operating margin for LGM in the quarter, particularly in light of transition costs associated with the European restructuring. We expect LGM's operating margin to improve through the course of the year, driven largely by benefits from the completion of this project in Europe.
Retail Branding and Information Solutions once again delivered both strong top line growth and significant margin expansion. The base business grew by roughly 3% on an organic basis, while enterprise-wide RFID once again grew by more than 20%. As you know, apparel represents the vast majority of RFID sales and was again the key driver of most of our growth here in the quarter. And our pipeline continues to expand, already up roughly 15% from the beginning of this year, with engagements in categories outside of apparel, principally food, beauty and aviation, leading the way.
Given the strength of our position, strategies and team, we are confident in our ability to achieve our long-term target for RFID solutions, that is 15% to 20% plus growth. We continue to increase our level of investment to support this growth as we build out our intelligent Labels platform to enable a future where every item can have a digital twin and digital life.
In Industrial and Healthcare Materials, sales declined modestly on an organic basis, driven by the decline in global automobile production, which more than offset solid growth in other industrial categories as well as strong growth in medical. And as for margins, we made good progress in the quarter towards achieving our target for this business.
In short, another solid quarter and we are reaffirming our earnings guidance for the year. While the year is starting off more challenging, we are prepared for it. Our relentless focus on productivity continues to enable us to increase our pace of investment in high-value segments, increase our competitiveness and grow profitably in our base businesses, while importantly continuing to expand operating margin, which we were able to do again in the first quarter and expect to deliver for the full year.
We remain confident in our ability to achieve our long-term objectives, and we will continue to seek opportunities to leverage our positions of strength commercially, operationally and financially and lean forward even as others may pull back.
Now I'll turn the call over to Greg."
252978,609936517,1704256,"Avery Dennison Corporation, Q1 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2019",2019-04-24,"Earnings Calls","Avery Dennison Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Mitch, and hello, everyone. We delivered a solid start to the year, with adjusted earnings per share of $1.48 in line with our expectations. As expected, pension settlement charges, almost entirely noncash, drove a loss in reported income. Reporte",1084,"Thanks, Mitch, and hello, everyone. We delivered a solid start to the year, with adjusted earnings per share of $1.48 in line with our expectations. As expected, pension settlement charges, almost entirely noncash, drove a loss in reported income. Reported earnings per share was a negative $1.74, including a $3.13 per share hit from the pension settlement charges net of tax. We grew sales by 2.4% on an organic basis, as currency translation reduced reported sales growth by 4.4 points in the quarter and adjusted operating margin increased by 30 basis points to 10.9%.
We realized $5 million of net restructuring savings in the quarter, and note that we are still incurring transition costs associated with the European restructuring with savings ramping up in the second half of the year.
Turning now to cash generation and allocation. We generated $7 million of free cash flow in the quarter, which was up roughly $27 million compared to the prior year. And recall that free cash flow in the first quarter is typically negative, driven primarily by the timing of employee incentive and customer rebate payments.
In the first quarter, we effectively settled the liabilities associated with the termination of our U.S. pension plan. The cash cost to complete this transaction was significantly better than expected, reflecting competitive market conditions for the purchase of annuities.
As we've discussed, we've increased our pace of fixed capital in IT-related spending for a couple year period, with gross capital spending expected to be up by about $25 million this year compared to last year to support our organic growth and margin expansion plans. We do expect capital spending to then moderate over the next few years consistent with our long-term capital allocation strategy. And we continue to return cash to shareholders as we repurchased roughly 0.9 million shares at an aggregate cost of $89 million and paid $44 million in dividends in the quarter.
Our balance sheet remained strong. Our current leverage position gives us ample capacity to continue executing our disciplined capital allocation strategy, including investing in organic growth and acquisitions, while continuing to return cash to shareholders. We are well positioned to take advantage of any dislocations in the market, should they occur over the next few years.
So turning to the segment results for the quarter. Label and Graphic Materials sales increased by 1.4% on an organic basis, driven by prior year pricing actions as volume mix declined modestly. LGM's high-value segments continue to outpace growth of the base business, led by specialty and durable categories, which are collectively up high single digits on an organic basis.
Breaking down LGM's organic growth in the quarter by region, North America was up low single digits, while Western Europe was roughly flat. Emerging markets also grew modestly as strength in South Asia and Latin America was largely offset by organic sales declines in China and Eastern Europe.
Operating margin for the segment was down 50 basis points on an adjusted basis to 12.5% due to the margin impact of raising prices to offset raw material inflation combined with transition costs associated with the European restructuring. Ongoing productivity initiatives, including material reengineering, offset the impacts of lower volume and higher employee-related costs.
At this point, we've covered the cumulative effects of the roughly 18 months of raw material cost inflation that we've experienced through a combination of both pricing actions and material reengineering.
Globally, raw material costs were down modestly on a sequential basis in the first quarter and our outlook assumes relative stability through the balance of the year.
Shifting now to Retail Branding and Information Solutions. RBIS delivered another quarter of strong top line growth, up 7% on an organic basis driven by both RFID and the base business. Total RFID sales were up by more than 20% for the quarter, the vast majority of which benefited the RBIS segment, with faster growth among European brands and retailers.
Adjusted operating margin for the segment expanded by 220 basis points to 12.4%, as increased volume and lower currency-related costs more than offset higher employee-related costs in the quarter.
Turning to the Industrial and Healthcare Materials segment, sales declined by 1% on an organic basis, driven by the decline in global auto production as automotive applications globally represent about 1/3 of IHM's total sales. Outside of automotive, industrial categories were up mid-single digits on an organic basis. And healthcare categories grew at a low single-digit pace with the mid-teens growth in medical applications. And we made good progress on the margin front in IHM. Adjusted operating margin increased by 200 basis points to 9.5%, driven by productivity improvements.
Focusing now on our outlook for 2019, we have maintained our guidance for adjusted earnings per share to be between $6.45 and $6.70. We have trimmed our outlook for organic sales growth to roughly 3.5% in light of the softer start to the year. With the midpoint of our EPS guidance range assuming that organic growth for LGM comes in below the long end of its long-term target range, while we continue to expect that RBIS will come in above the high end of its long-term range reflecting continued strength in RFID.
We've outlined some of the other key contributing factors to this guidance on Slide 9 of our supplemental presentation materials. In particular and just focusing on the changes from our assumptions in January, at recent exchange rates, currency translation represents a roughly 2.5 point headwind to reported sales growth for the year with a pretax operating income hit of $27 million. This is up modestly from the $25 million we anticipated previously.
We estimate incremental pretax savings from restructuring, net of transition costs, will contribute about $40 million to $45 million, up from our January estimate of $35 million as we've now completed planning that was still in process at the start of the year. Due to the timing of these actions and related transition costs, roughly 70% of the full year net savings from restructuring will be realized in the back half of the year.
And as I mentioned, total pretax charges associated with the settlement of pension liabilities came down to roughly $450 million with an after-tax EPS hit of roughly $3.15 almost entirely in the first quarter.
In summary, we delivered another solid quarter and remain confident in our ability to deliver on our long-term goals to achieve GDP-plus growth and top quartile return on capital.
And we'll now open up the call for your questions."

We delivered adjusted EPS in line with our expectations for the first quarter, a roughly 10% increase over prior year on a constant currency basis, despite organic revenue coming in a bit lower than usual as continue",590,"Thanks, Cindy, and good day, everyone. We delivered adjusted EPS in line with our expectations for the first quarter, a roughly 10% increase over prior year on a constant currency basis, despite organic revenue coming in a bit lower than usual as continued strong performance in RBIS was partially offset by soft volume in our 2 materials businesses.
Label and Graphic Materials posted roughly 1.5% organic growth for the quarter, driven by pricing. Volumes were down as growth in our high-value categories was offset by declines in our base businesses as we ceded some share in lower margin less differentiated categories due to our disciplined approach to raising prices to offset inflation. We expect to win much of this business back over the course of a few quarters.
As for underlying market trends for label materials, conditions appear to have been relatively soft over the past couple of quarters, not only in Europe and China, as we've discussed previously, but in North America as well. We expect our organic growth rate to improve as we move through the year, driven by gradual focused share gain as well as a modest improvement in underlying market demand. Despite the soft top line, productivity efforts supported a healthy operating margin for LGM in the quarter, particularly in light of transition costs associated with the European restructuring. We expect LGM's operating margin to improve through the course of the year, driven largely by benefits from the completion of this project in Europe.
Retail Branding and Information Solutions once again delivered both strong top line growth and significant margin expansion. The base business grew by roughly 3% on an organic basis, while enterprise-wide RFID once again grew by more than 20%. As you know, apparel represents the vast majority of RFID sales and was again the key driver of most of our growth here in the quarter. And our pipeline continues to expand, already up roughly 15% from the beginning of this year, with engagements in categories outside of apparel, principally food, beauty and aviation, leading the way.
Given the strength of our position, strategies and team, we are confident in our ability to achieve our long-term target for RFID solutions, that is 15% to 20% plus growth. We continue to increase our level of investment to support this growth as we build out our intelligent Labels platform to enable a future where every item can have a digital twin and digital life.
In Industrial and Healthcare Materials, sales declined modestly on an organic basis, driven by the decline in global automobile production, which more than offset solid growth in other industrial categories as well as strong growth in medical. And as for margins, we made good progress in the quarter towards achieving our target for this business.
In short, another solid quarter and we are reaffirming our earnings guidance for the year. While the year is starting off more challenging, we are prepared for it. Our relentless focus on productivity continues to enable us to increase our pace of investment in high-value segments, increase our competitiveness and grow profitably in our base businesses, while importantly continuing to expand operating margin, which we were able to do again in the first quarter and expect to deliver for the full year.
We remain confident in our ability to achieve our long-term objectives, and we will continue to seek opportunities to leverage our positions of strength commercially, operationally and financially and lean forward even as others may pull back.
Now I'll turn the call over to Greg."
252978,609936517,1706355,"Avery Dennison Corporation, Q1 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2019",2019-04-24,"Earnings Calls","Avery Dennison Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Mitch, and hello, everyone. We delivered a solid start to the year, with adjusted earnings per share of $1.48 in line with our expectations. As expected, pension settlement charges, almost entirely noncash, drove a loss in reported income. Reporte",1084,"Thanks, Mitch, and hello, everyone. We delivered a solid start to the year, with adjusted earnings per share of $1.48 in line with our expectations. As expected, pension settlement charges, almost entirely noncash, drove a loss in reported income. Reported earnings per share was a negative $1.74, including a $3.13 per share hit from the pension settlement charges net of tax. We grew sales by 2.4% on an organic basis, as currency translation reduced reported sales growth by 4.4 points in the quarter and adjusted operating margin increased by 30 basis points to 10.9%.
We realized $5 million of net restructuring savings in the quarter, and note that we are still incurring transition costs associated with the European restructuring with savings ramping up in the second half of the year.
Turning now to cash generation and allocation. We generated $7 million of free cash flow in the quarter, which was up roughly $27 million compared to the prior year. And recall that free cash flow in the first quarter is typically negative, driven primarily by the timing of employee incentive and customer rebate payments.
In the first quarter, we effectively settled the liabilities associated with the termination of our U.S. pension plan. The cash cost to complete this transaction was significantly better than expected, reflecting competitive market conditions for the purchase of annuities.
As we've discussed, we've increased our pace of fixed capital in IT-related spending for a couple year period, with gross capital spending expected to be up by about $25 million this year compared to last year to support our organic growth and margin expansion plans. We do expect capital spending to then moderate over the next few years consistent with our long-term capital allocation strategy. And we continue to return cash to shareholders as we repurchased roughly 0.9 million shares at an aggregate cost of $89 million and paid $44 million in dividends in the quarter.
Our balance sheet remained strong. Our current leverage position gives us ample capacity to continue executing our disciplined capital allocation strategy, including investing in organic growth and acquisitions, while continuing to return cash to shareholders. We are well positioned to take advantage of any dislocations in the market, should they occur over the next few years.
So turning to the segment results for the quarter. Label and Graphic Materials sales increased by 1.4% on an organic basis, driven by prior year pricing actions as volume mix declined modestly. LGM's high-value segments continue to outpace growth of the base business, led by specialty and durable categories, which are collectively up high single digits on an organic basis.
Breaking down LGM's organic growth in the quarter by region, North America was up low single digits, while Western Europe was roughly flat. Emerging markets also grew modestly as strength in South Asia and Latin America was largely offset by organic sales declines in China and Eastern Europe.
Operating margin for the segment was down 50 basis points on an adjusted basis to 12.5% due to the margin impact of raising prices to offset raw material inflation combined with transition costs associated with the European restructuring. Ongoing productivity initiatives, including material reengineering, offset the impacts of lower volume and higher employee-related costs.
At this point, we've covered the cumulative effects of the roughly 18 months of raw material cost inflation that we've experienced through a combination of both pricing actions and material reengineering.
Globally, raw material costs were down modestly on a sequential basis in the first quarter and our outlook assumes relative stability through the balance of the year.
Shifting now to Retail Branding and Information Solutions. RBIS delivered another quarter of strong top line growth, up 7% on an organic basis driven by both RFID and the base business. Total RFID sales were up by more than 20% for the quarter, the vast majority of which benefited the RBIS segment, with faster growth among European brands and retailers.
Adjusted operating margin for the segment expanded by 220 basis points to 12.4%, as increased volume and lower currency-related costs more than offset higher employee-related costs in the quarter.
Turning to the Industrial and Healthcare Materials segment, sales declined by 1% on an organic basis, driven by the decline in global auto production as automotive applications globally represent about 1/3 of IHM's total sales. Outside of automotive, industrial categories were up mid-single digits on an organic basis. And healthcare categories grew at a low single-digit pace with the mid-teens growth in medical applications. And we made good progress on the margin front in IHM. Adjusted operating margin increased by 200 basis points to 9.5%, driven by productivity improvements.
Focusing now on our outlook for 2019, we have maintained our guidance for adjusted earnings per share to be between $6.45 and $6.70. We have trimmed our outlook for organic sales growth to roughly 3.5% in light of the softer start to the year. With the midpoint of our EPS guidance range assuming that organic growth for LGM comes in below the long end of its long-term target range, while we continue to expect that RBIS will come in above the high end of its long-term range reflecting continued strength in RFID.
We've outlined some of the other key contributing factors to this guidance on Slide 9 of our supplemental presentation materials. In particular and just focusing on the changes from our assumptions in January, at recent exchange rates, currency translation represents a roughly 2.5 point headwind to reported sales growth for the year with a pretax operating income hit of $27 million. This is up modestly from the $25 million we anticipated previously.
We estimate incremental pretax savings from restructuring, net of transition costs, will contribute about $40 million to $45 million, up from our January estimate of $35 million as we've now completed planning that was still in process at the start of the year. Due to the timing of these actions and related transition costs, roughly 70% of the full year net savings from restructuring will be realized in the back half of the year.
And as I mentioned, total pretax charges associated with the settlement of pension liabilities came down to roughly $450 million with an after-tax EPS hit of roughly $3.15 almost entirely in the first quarter.
In summary, we delivered another solid quarter and remain confident in our ability to deliver on our long-term goals to achieve GDP-plus growth and top quartile return on capital.
And we'll now open up the call for your questions."

So as far as when we should start to see on the market share perspective, take a couple of quarters to start seeing it and couple of quarters beyond that for it to be recovered, if you will. So that's what you should generally expect to see and what we've seen in the past. As far as the restructuring and having additional restructuring dollars, we basically -- as we were entering the year, we wanted to make sure that we had multiple levers to pull, and we've had a number of restructuring actions and ideas over the coming few years and we look to see how can we accelerate those actions, given the -- what we thought might be a more challenging environment. This is a key strategy for us around driving productivity relentlessly and we've got a number of ideas. And so it's really around acceleration of those. It's not, I would say, in response to the current environment. It's more of an acceleration to ensure we are competitive and can grow profitably in the base and continue to invest in the high-value segments to be able to drive the outsized growth both there as well as in the emerging markets."

252978,629287738,1776384,"Avery Dennison Corporation, Q2 2019 Earnings Call, Jul 23, 2019",2019-07-23,"Earnings Calls","Avery Dennison Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Cindy, and good day, everyone. Earnings in the second quarter met our expectations delivering a roughly 12% increase over prior year on a constant currency basis as we more than offset softer-than-expected growth with increased productivity. Now",765,"Thanks, Cindy, and good day, everyone. Earnings in the second quarter met our expectations delivering a roughly 12% increase over prior year on a constant currency basis as we more than offset softer-than-expected growth with increased productivity. 
Now 2019 is obviously playing out a bit differently than we envisioned at the start of the year. And as you can see from our results, we are once again proving our ability to anticipate shifting market conditions and are responding swiftly. This agility is enabling us to sustain our earnings growth trajectory and maintain the midpoint of our EPS guidance for the year. 
We continue to execute well in driving outsized growth in high-value categories with growth of these products and solutions again outpacing the base business in Q2, and at the same time, our relentless focus on productivity was again a key driver of margin expansion. In sum, we are making good progress against our key strategic priorities and despite the current environment are on track to deliver our long-term financial targets.
Label and Graphic Materials posted roughly a point of organic growth for the quarter driven by pricing with high-value categories again growing faster than the base. Overall, volumes declined modestly, reflecting softer market demand as well as the previously discussed loss of share in less differentiated categories over the preceding couple of quarters. Recall, this share loss resulted from our disciplined execution of pricing actions near the end of the inflationary cycle. We began to recover that share while sustaining the strong margin that we achieved in the same period last year. 
The slower demand trends we saw in Q1 continued into Q2. We've adjusted our full year guidance to reflect these softer market conditions through the balance of the year combined with gradual focused share gains. As I mentioned, productivity efforts supported a strong operating margin for LGM in the quarter. We've been anticipating the possibility of a general market slowdown. And so in addition to some belt tightening, we accelerated restructuring actioned that we had in the pipeline to both further improve our competitiveness in each region as well as to drive long-term sustainable expansion for both margins and returns.
Retail Branding and Information Solutions delivered solid organic growth driven by ongoing strength in RFID while continuing to drive significant margin expansion. RFID grew once again by more than 20% while the pace of the base business slowed. The slowdown in the base reflect a general market softness as well as what appeared to be some choppiness in timing of retail or purchases in light of trade-related uncertainty. While a fair market uncertainty remains, we are well positioned to win year with our unsurpassed global footprint and differentiated product and service capabilities.
The strong growth in RFID continues to be fueled by apparel. While we make great progress in developing other promising verticals, our total pipeline of customer engagements continues to expand now up by more than 30% from just the beginning of this year with engagements in categories outside of apparel including food, beauty, logistics leading the way.
As the leader in ultrahigh frequency RFID, we are positioned extremely well to capture these opportunities with our industry-leading innovation and manufacturing capabilities and the best, most experienced team in the space. We continued to increase our investments in business development and other resources to drive this growth as we build out our Intelligent Labels platform to enable our future where every item can have a digital twin and a digital life.
In Industrial and Healthcare Materials, sales were flat on an organic basis driven by the decline in global auto production, which more than offset solid growth in other industrial categories as well as strong growth in our medical business. And we once again made good progress in the quarter towards achieving our operating margin target for this business. 
In short, another solid quarter and despite a softer top line, we are reaffirming our earnings guidance midpoint for the year. Our strategies to deliver outsized growth in high-value categories are clearly working, and our relentless focus on productivity continues to enable us to increase our pace of investment in these categories, increase our competitiveness overall and grow profitably in our base businesses while importantly continuing to expand operating margin. We are confident in our ability to achieve our long-term objective to drive GDP+ growth and top quartile returns, and we will continue to seek opportunities to leverage our positions of strength commercially, operationally and financially and lean forward even as others may pull back. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Greg."

As Mitch said, we delivered another solid quarter with adjusted earnings per share of $1.72 in line with our expectations and again up more than 10% on a constant currency basis.

As Mitch said, we delivered another solid quarter with adjusted earnings per share of $1.72 in line with our expectations and again up more than 10% on a constant currency basis. We grew sales by 1.6% on an organic basis and currency translation reduced reported sales growth by 4.7 points in the quarter. Adjusted operating margin increased by 60 basis points to 12.1%., and we realized $12 million of restructuring savings net of transition costs in the quarter. The LGM restructure in Europe was largely completed as of the end of Q2, which will drive a significant uptake in savings from this initiative in the second half.
Turning to cash generation and allocation. Year-to-date, we've generated $165 million of free cash flow, up nearly $38 million compared to the prior year. And as we've discussed, we've increased our pace of [ 6 ] capital in IT-related spending for a 2- to 3-year period to support our long-term organic growth and margin expansion plans, with capital spending expected to be up by about $25 million this year. We continue to expect capital spending then to moderate from this level over the next couple of years, consistent with our long-term capital allocation strategy. And we continue to return cash to shareholders. In the first half of the year, we repurchased roughly 1.2 million shares at an aggregate cost of $117 million. It paid $93 million in dividends, including the 12% increase in the dividend rate in April, for a total of $209 million of cash return to shareholders, up 11% compared to the same period last year. 
And our balance sheet remains strong. Our current leverage position gives us ample capacity to continue executing our disciplined capital allocation strategy, including investing in organic growth and acquisitions while continuing to return cash to shareholders. We are well positioned to take advantage of [ dislocations ] in the market should they occur over the next few years.
I'll now turn to the segment results for the quarter. Label and Graphic Materials sales increased by 0.9% on an organic basis driven by prior year pricing actions as volume declined modestly. Growth in LGM's high-value categories continued to outpace the growth of the base business, once again led by specialty and durables, which are collectively up high single digits on an organic basis. 
Breaking down LGM's organic growth in the quarter by region, both North America and Western Europe declined at low single-digit rates reflecting the market dynamics I already discussed. Emerging markets grew at a low single-digit rate with China up low single digits and South Asia up high single digits. 
Adjusted operating margin for the segment was strong at 13.8%, in line with the same period last year, reflecting the benefit of productivity actions, including material reengineering partially offset by currency-related headwinds and the impact of lower volume. As I mentioned in last quarter's call, we've covered the cumulative effects of the roughly 18 months of raw material cost inflation that we experienced through a combination of pricing actions and material reengineering. 
We're now seeing some modest deflation in our raw material input cost on a sequential basis with comparable sequential declines in both the first and second quarters of the year. 
Shifting now to Retail Branding and Information Solutions. RBIS delivered solid top line growth, up 4.4% on an organic basis driven by faster growth in high-valued categories with sales of both RFID and external embellishments up more than 20% for the quarter. Our base business was roughly flat, adjusting for the impact of cannibalization due to RFID.
Adjusted operating margin for the segment expanded by 130 basis points to 12.5% as productivity and higher volume more than offset higher employee-related costs and growth-related investments.
Turning to the Industrial and Healthcare Materials segment. Sales were flat on an organic basis driven by the decline in global auto production as automotive applications globally represent about 1/3 of IHM's sales.
Outside of automotive, industrial categories were up mid-single digits on an organic basis. Health care categories likewise grew at a mid-single-digit pace with better-than-20% growth in medical applications. 
We continue to make good progress on the margin front in IHM. Adjusted operating margin increased by 120 basis points to 10.5% driven by productivity and the net benefit of pricing and raw material costs, which more than offset higher employee-related costs. Gains in the pricing side largely relate to a strategic adjustments we made as a result of our work to more effectively segment our portfolio.
Focusing now on our outlook for 2019, we have maintained our guidance midpoint for adjusted earnings per share while tightening the range to $6.50 to $6.65. We have reduced our outlook for organic sales growth to a range of 2% to 2.5%, in light of the slower market conditions in LGM during the first half that we assume will continue. 
We've outlined some of the other key contributing factors to this guidance on Slide 9 of our supplemental presentation materials. In particular, and just focusing on the changes from our assumptions in April, at recent exchange rates, currency translation represents a roughly 2.5 point headwind to reported sales growth for the year, with a pretax operating income hit of $28 million. This is up slightly from the $27 million we'd anticipated previously. We now estimate that incremental pretax savings from restructuring, net of transition costs, will contribute about $45 million to $50 million, up $5 million from our April estimate as we've accelerated a number of actions that were in the pipeline. We've already realized about $17 million in net savings year-to-date and expect the balance of our full year savings will be split roughly equally between the third and fourth quarters. And we've narrowed our range on average share count assuming dilution of 84.5 million to 85 million shares, reflecting we'd assume pick up from the Q2 pace of share buyback during the second half. 
In summary, we delivered another solid quarter in a more challenging environment, and we are confident in our ability to deliver the earnings guidance we've communicated at the start of the year and are on track to deliver on our long-term objectives to achieve GDP+ growth and top quartile returns on capital driving sustained growth in EVA.

The other big factor just between Q1 and Q2 is really around just timing of holidays and Chinese New Year and everything else. That aside, Q2 seemed to have a bit of a slowdown in the base. And it's really around just some of the uncertainty, particularly around announced tariffs and then tariffs being canceled and so forth. So even within individual quarters, we're seeing a bit more lumpiness than we normally see. 
Now with that regard, performance athletic continues to be a well-positioned category. They've moved a lot of their sourcing outside of China already.

We are focused on doing this in a disciplined and gradual way. We said it will take us a few quarters to recapture the chair. And how we do it is basically continuing to focus around our differentiated quality and service. That is a key area of focus for us and so we're willing to take some risk, particularly late in the inflationary cycle knowing that our core fundamental points of advantage continue to play through over time. 
Having said that, our markets clearly are competitive, and less differentiated categories are competitive as well. So we continue to have a balanced strategy focused around innovation and productivity to remain competitive and continue to have attractive returns within the base categories. 
I do want to comment real quick also as Ghansham, you have a follow-up question around RFID. So again, just my comments said continuing to see strength within RFID. RFID is an enabler for continuing to not only provide opportunities for end market demand and managing through the omnichannel, all the advantages we talked to in the past, but also around shortening lead times and cycle times, which given some of the trade uncertainty also is a great capability for any retailer and brand to have. So there's not any impact or changing views overall in RFID any way other than just general recognition that it is the technology of the future within the apparel categories. And we're seeing the new opportunities continue to flourish outside the apparel they talk through as well."

It enables them to have more efficient retail as well as omnichannel strategies, and it enables them for more efficient supply chain so even if things do turn down it actually this technology is a key enabler for the success of various companies in that environment so we are not seeing any negative shift just a continued acceleration as we commented on both in our revenue as well as in our pipeline effectivity."

We've had innovative solutions out there such as CleanFlake that enable more efficient and effective recycling of plastic containers. That's been growing double digits.

Now we're seeing all same macro trends you're seeing, and we don't yet have for market data for Q2. But if you look at the macro trends, it seems there might be a bit of a softening in Q2 here. 
Europe had even stronger growth in North America up until early last year. It then moderated. It moderated Still further from a market perspective and looks like volumes actually went negative as overall market as well in Q2. 
In China, we continue to see growth within the variable information labels tied to e-commerce. It's tough to tell exactly there's no clear market data here but there's just a lot more uncertainty in general there's a growth, decent growth overall outside of variable observation labels in the market but it's a lot more portion taken just uncertainty I'd say engagement that we have with our customers. And then South Asia, we continue to see strong growth. All the envelope a little bit lighter in India. [indiscernible] Basically has tough comps they're going through.

Now 2019 is obviously playing out a bit differently than we envisioned at the start of the year. And as you can see from our results, we are once again proving our ability to anticipate shifting market conditions and are responding swiftly. This agility is enabling us to sustain our earnings growth trajectory and maintain the midpoint of our EPS guidance for the year. 
We continue to execute well in driving outsized growth in high-value categories with growth of these products and solutions again outpacing the base business in Q2, and at the same time, our relentless focus on productivity was again a key driver of margin expansion. In sum, we are making good progress against our key strategic priorities and, despite the current environment, are on track to deliver our long-term financial targets.
Label and Graphic Materials posted roughly a point of organic growth for the quarter, driven by pricing with high-value categories again growing faster than the base. Overall, volumes declined modestly, reflecting softer market demand as well as the previously discussed loss of share in less differentiated categories over the preceding couple of quarters. Recall, this share loss resulted from our disciplined execution of pricing actions near the end of the inflationary cycle. We've begun to recover that share while sustaining the strong margin that we achieved in the same period last year. 
The slower demand trends we saw in Q1 continued into Q2. We've adjusted our full year guidance to reflect these softer market conditions through the balance of the year, combined with gradual focused share gains. As I mentioned, productivity efforts supported a strong operating margin for LGM in the quarter. We've been anticipating the possibility of a general market slowdown. And so in addition to some belt tightening, we accelerated restructuring actions that we had in the pipeline to both further improve our competitiveness in each region as well as to drive long-term sustainable expansion of both margins and returns.  
Retail Branding and Information Solutions delivered solid organic growth, driven by ongoing strength in RFID while continuing to drive significant margin expansion. RFID grew once again by more than 20% while the pace of the base business slowed. The slowdown in the base reflect a general market softness as well as what appeared to be some choppiness in timing of retailer purchases in light of trade-related uncertainty. While a fair market uncertainty remains, we are well positioned to win here with our unsurpassed global footprint and differentiated product and service capabilities.
The strong growth in RFID continues to be fueled by apparel. While we make great progress in developing other promising verticals, our total pipeline of customer engagements continues to expand, now up by more than 30% from just the beginning of this year with engagements in categories outside of apparel including food, beauty, logistics leading the way.
As the leader in ultrahigh frequency RFIDs, we are positioned extremely well to capture these opportunities with our industry-leading innovation and manufacturing capabilities and the best, most experienced team in the space. We continued to increase our investments in business development and other resources to drive this growth as we build out our Intelligent Labels platform to enable a future where every item can have a digital twin and a digital life.
In Industrial and Healthcare Materials, sales were flat on an organic basis, driven by the decline in global auto production, which more than offset solid growth in other industrial categories as well as strong growth in our medical business. And we once again made good progress in the quarter towards achieving our operating margin target for this business. 
In short, another solid quarter, and despite a softer top line, we are reaffirming our earnings guidance midpoint for the year. Our strategies to deliver outsized growth in high-value categories are clearly working, and our relentless focus on productivity continues to enable us to increase our pace of investment in these categories, increase our competitiveness overall and grow profitably in our base businesses while importantly continuing to expand operating margin. We are confident in our ability to achieve our long-term objective to drive GDP+ growth and top quartile returns, and we will continue to seek opportunities to leverage our positions of strength commercially, operationally and financially and lean forward even as others may pull back. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Greg."

As Mitch said, we delivered another solid quarter with adjusted earnings per share of $1.72, in line with our expectations and again up more than 10% on a constant currency basis. We grew sales by 1.6% on an organic basis and currency translation reduced reported sales growth by 4.7 points in the quarter. Adjusted operating margin increased by 60 basis points to 12.1% and we realized $12 million of restructuring savings net of transition costs in the quarter. The LGM restructure in Europe was largely completed as of the end of Q2, which will drive a significant uptake in savings from this initiative in the second half.
Turning to cash generation and allocation. Year-to-date, we've generated $165 million of free cash flow, up nearly $38 million compared to the prior year. And as we've discussed, we've increased our pace of fixed capital in IT-related spending for a 2- to 3-year period to support our long-term organic growth and margin expansion plans, with capital spending expected to be up by about $25 million this year. We continue to expect capital spending then to moderate from this level over the next couple of years, consistent with our long-term capital allocation strategy. And we continue to return cash to shareholders. In the first half of the year, we repurchased roughly 1.2 million shares at an aggregate cost of $117 million. It paid $93 million in dividends, including the 12% increase in the dividend rate in April for a total of $209 million of cash return to shareholders, up 11% compared to the same period last year. 
And our balance sheet remains strong. Our current leverage position gives us ample capacity to continue executing our disciplined capital allocation strategy, including investing in organic growth and acquisitions while continuing to return cash to shareholders. We are well positioned to take advantage of any dislocations in the market should they occur over the next few years.
I'll now turn to the segment results for the quarter. Label and Graphic Materials sales increased by 0.9% on an organic basis, driven by prior year pricing actions as volume declined modestly. Growth in LGM's high-value categories continued to outpace the growth of the base business, once again led by specialty and durables, which were collectively up high single digits on an organic basis. 
Breaking down LGM's organic growth in the quarter by region, both North America and Western Europe declined at low single-digit rates, reflecting the market dynamics I already discussed. Emerging markets grew at a low single-digit rate, with China up low single digits and South Asia up high single digits. 
Adjusted operating margin for the segment was strong at 13.8%, in line with the same period last year, reflecting the benefit of productivity actions including material reengineering, partially offset by currency-related headwinds and the impact of lower volume. As I mentioned in last quarter's call, we've covered the cumulative effects of the roughly 18 months of raw material cost inflation that we experienced through a combination of pricing actions and material reengineering. 
We're now seeing some modest deflation in our raw material input cost on a sequential basis with comparable sequential declines in both the first and second quarters of the year. 
Shifting now to Retail Branding and Information Solutions. RBIS delivered solid top line growth, up 4.4% on an organic basis, driven by faster growth in high-value categories with sales of both RFID and external embellishments up more than 20% for the quarter. Our base business was roughly flat, adjusting for the impact of cannibalization due to RFID.
Adjusted operating margin for the segment expanded by 130 basis points to 12.5% as productivity and higher volume more than offset higher employee-related costs and growth-related investments.
Turning to the Industrial and Healthcare Materials segment. Sales were flat on an organic basis, driven by the decline in global auto production as automotive applications globally represent about 1/3 of IHM's sales.
Outside of automotive, industrial categories were up mid-single digits on an organic basis. Health care categories likewise grew at a mid-single-digit pace with better-than-20% growth in medical applications. 
We continue to make good progress on the margin front in IHM. Adjusted operating margin increased by 120 basis points to 10.5%, driven by productivity and the net benefit of pricing and raw material costs, which more than offset higher employee-related costs. Gains on the pricing side largely relate to strategic adjustments we made as a result of our work to more effectively segment our portfolio.
Focusing now on our outlook for 2019. We have maintained our guidance midpoint for adjusted earnings per share while tightening the range to $6.50 to $6.65. We have reduced our outlook for organic sales growth to a range of 2% to 2.5%, in light of the slower market conditions in LGM during the first half that we assume will continue. 
We've outlined some of the other key contributing factors to this guidance on Slide 9 of our supplemental presentation materials. In particular, and just focusing on the changes from our assumptions in April, at recent exchange rates, currency translation represents a roughly 2.5 point headwind to reported sales growth for the year with a pretax operating income hit of $28 million. This is up slightly from the $27 million we'd anticipated previously. We now estimate that incremental pretax savings from restructuring, net of transition costs, will contribute about $45 million to $50 million, up $5 million from our April estimate as we've accelerated a number of actions that were in the pipeline. We've already realized about $17 million in net savings year-to-date and expect the balance of our full year savings will be split roughly equally between the third and fourth quarters. And we've narrowed our range on average share count assuming dilution of 84.5 million to 85 million shares, reflecting we'd assume pick up from the Q2 pace of share buyback during the second half. 
In summary, we delivered another solid quarter in a more challenging environment, and we are confident in our ability to deliver the earnings guidance we've communicated at the start of the year and are on track to deliver on our long-term objectives to achieve GDP+ growth and top quartile returns on capital driving sustained growth in EVA. 
Now we'll open up the call for your questions."

So having a generally kind of lower average variable margin than our average would be on that decline. At the same time, as you mentioned, Ghansham, we've accelerated productivity efforts with combination of restructuring actions as well as kind of short-term productivity actions, including belt tightening, as Mitch mentioned, a little bit of incentive cost and a little bit of benefit from price deflation year-over-year. So really a combination of things with the productivity as well as stronger growth and high-value segments helping maintain the margin year-over-year."

So overall, as far as pull forward, it's tough to call overall, Ghansham, as far as what end retailer behavior has been doing in the first half. There's been just more choppiness, as I commented on. 
The other big factor just between Q1 and Q2 is really around just timing of holidays and Chinese New Year and everything else. That aside, Q2 seemed to have a bit of a slowdown in the base. And it's really around just some of the uncertainty, particularly around announced tariffs and then tariffs being canceled and so forth. So even within individual quarters, we're seeing a bit more lumpiness than we normally see. 
Now with that regard, performance athletic continues to be a well-positioned category. They've moved a lot of their sourcing outside of China already. And I'd say the value segments, so think of discounters and so forth, are more exposed to what's going on with the China-U.S. trade relationships."

We are focused on doing this in a disciplined and gradual way. As we said, it will take us a few quarters to recapture that share. And how we do it is basically continuing to focus around our differentiated quality and service. That is a key area of focus for us and so we're willing to take some risk, particularly late in the inflationary cycle, knowing that our core fundamental points of advantage continue to play through over time. 
Having said that, our markets clearly are competitive, and less differentiated categories are competitive as well. So we continue to have a balanced strategy focused around innovation and productivity to remain competitive and continue to have attractive returns within the base categories. 
I do want to comment real quick also, as Ghansham, you had another follow-up question around RFID. So again, just my comments said continuing to see strength within RFID. RFID is an enabler for continuing to not only provide opportunities for end market demand and managing through the omnichannel, all the advantages we've talked to in the past, but also around shortening lead times and cycle times, which given some of the trade uncertainty, also is a great capability for any retailer brand to have. So there's not any impact or changing views overall in RFID in any way other than just general recognition that it is the technology of the future within the apparel categories. And we're seeing the new opportunities continue to flourish outside of apparels I talked through as well."

So Jeff, volume trends, we don't talk about the specific volume trends overall region by region. But if you look at within North America, it was growing low single digits organically through the end of '17, and the growth began to moderate a bit in '18 and then moderated fully again here in 2019. And as we talked about before, Q1, we think we saw a bit of softness that was probably a little bit more share than just the market, at least in the beginning of the quarter. Now we're seeing all same macro trends you're seeing, and we don't yet have share market data for Q2. But if you look at the macro trends, it seems that there might be a bit of a softening in Q2 here. 
Europe had even stronger growth in North America up until early last year. It then moderated. It moderated still further from a market perspective and looks like volumes, it actually went negative as an overall market as well in Q2. 
In China, we continue to see growth within the variable information labels tied to e-commerce. It's tough to tell exactly, there's no clear market data here but there's just a lot more uncertainty in general. There's growth, decent growth overall outside of variable observation labels in the market, but it's a lot more push and take and just uncertainty, I'd say, with the engagement that we have with our customers. 
And then South Asia, we continue to see strong growth. ASEAN is a little bit lighter than India. ASEAN basically has tough comps they're going through. India, we're seeing strong growth still, although that's moderating a bit. Exports are down coming out of India, which is having a general macro view. And Latin America, decent growth relative to the environment. You can see what's going on in the environment there.

Earnings in the second quarter met our expectations, delivering a roughly 12% increase over prior year on a constant currency basis as we more than offset softer-than-expected growth with increased productivity. No",764,"Thanks, Cindy, and good day, everyone. Earnings in the second quarter met our expectations, delivering a roughly 12% increase over prior year on a constant currency basis as we more than offset softer-than-expected growth with increased productivity. 
Now 2019 is obviously playing out a bit differently than we envisioned at the start of the year. And as you can see from our results, we are once again proving our ability to anticipate shifting market conditions and are responding swiftly. This agility is enabling us to sustain our earnings growth trajectory and maintain the midpoint of our EPS guidance for the year. 
We continue to execute well in driving outsized growth in high-value categories with growth of these products and solutions again outpacing the base business in Q2.  And at the same time, our relentless focus on productivity was again a key driver of margin expansion. In sum, we are making good progress against our key strategic priorities and, despite the current environment, are on track to deliver our long-term financial targets.
Label and Graphic Materials posted roughly 1 point of organic growth for the quarter, driven by pricing with high-value categories again growing faster than the base. Overall volumes declined modestly, reflecting softer market demand as well as the previously discussed loss of share in less differentiated categories over the preceding couple of quarters. Recall, this share loss resulted from our disciplined execution of pricing actions near the end of the inflationary cycle. We've begun to recover that share while sustaining the strong margin that we achieved in the same period last year. 
The slower demand trends we saw in Q1 continued into Q2. We've adjusted our full year guidance to reflect these softer market conditions through the balance of the year, combined with gradual focused share gains. As I mentioned, productivity efforts supported a strong operating margin for LGM in the quarter. We've been anticipating the possibility of a general market slowdown. And so in addition to some belt tightening, we accelerated restructuring actions that we had in the pipeline to both further improve our competitiveness in each region as well as to drive long-term sustainable expansion of both margins and returns.  
Retail Branding and Information Solutions delivered solid organic growth, driven by ongoing strength in RFID while continuing to drive significant margin expansion. RFID grew once again by more than 20% while the pace of the base business slowed. The slowdown in the base reflect a general market softness as well as what appeared to be some choppiness in timing of retailer purchases in light of trade-related uncertainty. While a fair market uncertainty remains, we are well positioned to win here with our unsurpassed global footprint and differentiated product and services capabilities.
The strong growth in RFID continues to be fueled by apparel. While we make great progress in developing other promising verticals, our total pipeline of customer engagements continues to expand, now up by more than 30% from just the beginning of this year with engagements in categories outside of apparel including food, beauty, logistics leading the way.
As the leader in ultrahigh frequency RFIDs, we are positioned extremely well to capture these opportunities with our industry-leading innovation and manufacturing capabilities and the best, most experienced team in the space. We continued to increase our investments in business development and other resources to drive this growth as we build out our Intelligent Labels platform to enable a future where every item can have a digital twin and a digital life.
In Industrial and Healthcare Materials, sales were flat on an organic basis, driven by the decline in global auto production, which more than offset solid growth in other industrial categories as well as strong growth in our medical business. And we once again made good progress in the quarter towards achieving our operating margin target for this business. 
In short, another solid quarter, and despite a softer top line, we are reaffirming our earnings guidance midpoint for the year. Our strategies to deliver outsized growth in high-value categories are clearly working, and our relentless focus on productivity continues to enable us to increase our pace of investment in these categories, increase our competitiveness overall and grow profitably in our base businesses while importantly continuing to expand operating margin. We are confident in our ability to achieve our long-term objective to drive GDP+ growth and top quartile returns, and we will continue to seek opportunities to leverage our positions of strength commercially, operationally and financially and lean forward even as others may pull back. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Greg."

The LGM restructuring in Europe was largely completed as of the end of Q2, which will drive a significant uptake in savings from this initiative in the second half.
Turning to cash generation and allocation. Year-to-date, we've generated $165 million of free cash flow, up nearly $38 million compared to the prior year. And as we've discussed, we've increased our pace of fixed capital in IT-related spending for a 2- to 3-year period to support our long-term organic growth and margin expansion plans, with capital spending expected to be up by about $25 million this year. We continue to expect capital spending then to moderate from this level over the next couple of years, consistent with our long-term capital allocation strategy. And we continue to return cash to shareholders. In the first half of the year, we repurchased roughly 1.2 million shares at an aggregate cost of $117 million; have paid $93 million in dividends, including the 12% increase in the dividend rate in April for a total of $209 million of cash return to shareholders, up 11% compared to the same period last year. 
And our balance sheet remains strong. Our current leverage position gives us ample capacity to continue executing our disciplined capital allocation strategy, including investing in organic growth and acquisitions while continuing to return cash to shareholders. We are well positioned to take advantage of any dislocations in the market should they occur over the next few years.
I'll now turn to the segment results for the quarter. Label and Graphic Materials sales increased by 0.9% on an organic basis, driven by prior year pricing actions as volume declined modestly. Growth in LGM's high-value categories continued to outpace the growth of the base business, once again led by specialty and durables, which were collectively up high single digits on an organic basis. 
Breaking down LGM's organic growth in the quarter by region, both North America and Western Europe declined at low single-digit rates, reflecting the market dynamics I already discussed. Emerging markets grew at a low single-digit rate, with China up low single digits and South Asia up high single digits. 
Adjusted operating margin for the segment was strong at 13.8%, in line with the same period last year, reflecting the benefit of productivity actions including material reengineering, partially offset by currency-related headwinds and the impact of lower volume. As I mentioned in last quarter's call, we've covered the cumulative effects of the roughly 18 months of raw material cost inflation that we experienced through a combination of pricing actions and material reengineering. 
We're now seeing some modest deflation in our raw material input cost on a sequential basis with comparable sequential declines in both the first and second quarters of the year. 
Shifting now to Retail Branding and Information Solutions. RBIS delivered solid top line growth, up 4.4% on an organic basis, driven by faster growth in high-value categories with sales of both RFID and external embellishments up more than 20% for the quarter. Our base business was roughly flat, adjusting for the impact of cannibalization due to RFID.
Adjusted operating margin for the segment expanded by 130 basis points to 12.5% as productivity and higher volume more than offset higher employee-related costs and growth-related investments.
Turning to the Industrial and Healthcare Materials segment. Sales were flat on an organic basis, driven by the decline in global auto production as automotive applications globally represent about 1/3 of IHM's sales.
Outside of automotive, industrial categories were up mid-single digits on an organic basis. Health care categories likewise grew at a mid-single-digit pace with better than 20% growth in medical applications. 
We continue to make good progress on the margin front in IHM. Adjusted operating margin increased by 120 basis points to 10.5%, driven by productivity and the net benefit of pricing and raw material costs, which more than offset higher employee-related costs. Gains on the pricing side largely relate to strategic adjustments we made as a result of our work to more effectively segment our portfolio.
Focusing now on our outlook for 2019. We have maintained our guidance midpoint for adjusted earnings per share while tightening the range to $6.50 to $6.65. We have reduced our outlook for organic sales growth to a range of 2% to 2.5%, in light of the slower market conditions in LGM during the first half that we assume will continue. 
We've outlined some of the other key contributing factors to this guidance on Slide 9 of our supplemental presentation materials. In particular, and just focusing on the changes from our assumptions in April, at recent exchange rates, currency translation represents a roughly 2.5 point headwind to reported sales growth for the year with a pretax operating income hit of $28 million. This is up slightly from the $27 million we'd anticipated previously. We now estimate that incremental pretax savings from restructuring, net of transition costs, will contribute about $45 million to $50 million, up $5 million from our April estimate as we've accelerated a number of actions that were in the pipeline. We've already realized about $17 million in net savings year-to-date and expect the balance of our full year savings will be split roughly equally between the third and fourth quarters. And we've narrowed our range on average share count assuming dilution of 84.5 million to 85 million shares, reflecting an assumed pickup from the Q2 pace of share buyback during the second half. 
In summary, we delivered another solid quarter in a more challenging environment, and we are confident in our ability to deliver the earnings guidance we've communicated at the start of the year and are on track to deliver on our long-term objectives to achieve GDP+ growth and top quartile returns on capital driving sustained growth in EVA. 
Now we'll open up the call for your questions."

So having a generally kind of lower average variable margin than our average would be on that decline. At the same time, as you mentioned, Ghansham, we've accelerated productivity efforts, combination of restructuring actions as well as kind of short-term productivity actions, including belt tightening, as Mitch mentioned, a little bit of incentive cost and a little bit of benefit from price deflation year-over-year.

The other big factor just between Q1 and Q2 is really around just timing of holidays and Chinese New Year and everything else. That aside, Q2 seemed to have a bit of a slowdown in the base. And it's really around just some of the uncertainty, particularly around announced tariffs and then tariffs being canceled and so forth. So even within individual quarters, we're seeing a bit more lumpiness than we normally see. 
Now with that regard, performance athletic continues to be a well-positioned category. They've moved a lot of their sourcing outside of China already. And I'd say the value segments, so think of discounters and so forth, are more exposed to what's going on with the China-U.S. trade relationships."

We are focused on doing this in a disciplined and gradual way. As we said, it will take us a few quarters to recapture that share. And how we do it is basically continuing to focus around our differentiated quality and service. That is a key area of focus for us and so we're willing to take some risk, particularly late in the inflationary cycle, knowing that our core fundamental points of advantage continue to play through over time. 
Having said that, our markets clearly are competitive, and less differentiated categories are competitive as well. So we continue to have a balanced strategy focused around innovation and productivity to remain competitive and continue to have attractive returns within the base categories. 
I do want to comment real quick also, as Ghansham, you had another follow-up question around RFID. So again, just as my comments said, continuing to see strength within RFID. RFID is an enabler for continuing to not only provide opportunities for end market demand and managing through the omnichannel, all the advantages we've talked to in the past, but also around shortening lead times and cycle times, which given some of the trade uncertainty, also is a great capability for any retailer and brand to have. So there's not any impact or changing views overall in RFID in any way other than just general recognition that it is the technology of the future within the apparel categories. And we're seeing the new opportunities continue to flourish outside of apparel, as I talked through as well."

And we find most of what we're looking to companies in the pipeline are privately held. Prices tend to be a little bit sticky. We are actively engaging a number of targets there.

So Jeff, the volume trends, we don't talk about the specific volume trends overall region by region. But if you look at within North America, it was growing low single digits organically through the end of '17, and the growth began to moderate a bit in '18 and then moderated fully again here in 2019. And as we talked about before, Q1, we think we saw a bit of softness that was probably a little bit more share than just the market, at least in the beginning of the quarter. Now we're seeing all same macro trends you're seeing, and we don't yet have share market data for Q2. But if you look at the macro trends, it seems that there might be a bit of a softening in Q2 here. 
Europe had even stronger growth than North America up until early last year. It then moderated. It moderated still further from a market perspective and looks like volumes, it actually went negative as an overall market as well in Q2. 
In China, we continue to see growth within the variable information labels tied to e-commerce. It's tough to tell exactly, there's no clear market data here but there's just a lot more uncertainty in general. There's growth, decent growth overall outside of variable observation labels in the market, but it's a lot more push and take and just uncertainty, I'd say, with the engagement that we have with our customers. 
And then South Asia, we continue to see strong growth. ASEAN is a little bit lighter than India. ASEAN basically has tough comps they're going through. India, we're seeing strong growth still, although that's moderating a bit. Exports are down coming out of India, which is having a general macro view. And Latin America, decent growth relative to the environment.  And you can see what's going on in the environment there. We've got -- had quite a bit of currency, price and so forth over the last couple of years."

Earnings in the second quarter met our expectations, delivering a roughly 12% increase over prior year on a constant currency basis as we more than offset softer-than-expected growth with increased productivity. No",764,"Thanks, Cindy, and good day, everyone. Earnings in the second quarter met our expectations, delivering a roughly 12% increase over prior year on a constant currency basis as we more than offset softer-than-expected growth with increased productivity. 
Now 2019 is obviously playing out a bit differently than we envisioned at the start of the year. And as you can see from our results, we are once again proving our ability to anticipate shifting market conditions and are responding swiftly. This agility is enabling us to sustain our earnings growth trajectory and maintain the midpoint of our EPS guidance for the year. 
We continue to execute well in driving outsized growth in high-value categories with growth of these products and solutions again outpacing the base business in Q2. And at the same time, our relentless focus on productivity was again a key driver of margin expansion. In sum, we are making good progress against our key strategic priorities and despite the current environment, are on track to deliver our long-term financial targets.
Label and Graphic Materials posted roughly 1 point of organic growth for the quarter, driven by pricing with high-value categories again growing faster than the base. Overall volumes declined modestly, reflecting softer market demand as well as the previously discussed loss of share in less differentiated categories over the preceding couple of quarters. Recall, this share loss resulted from our disciplined execution of pricing actions near the end of the inflationary cycle. We've begun to recover that share while sustaining the strong margin that we achieved in the same period last year. 
The slower demand trends we saw in Q1 continued into Q2. We've adjusted our full year guidance to reflect these softer market conditions through the balance of the year, combined with gradual focused share gains. As I mentioned, productivity efforts supported a strong operating margin for LGM in the quarter. We've been anticipating the possibility of a general market slowdown. And so in addition to some belt tightening, we accelerated restructuring actions that we had in the pipeline to both further improve our competitiveness in each region as well as to drive long-term sustainable expansion of both margins and returns. 
Retail Branding and Information Solutions delivered solid organic growth, driven by ongoing strength in RFID while continuing to drive significant margin expansion. RFID grew once again by more than 20% while the pace of the base business slowed. The slowdown in the base reflect a general market softness as well as what appeared to be some choppiness in timing of retailer purchases in light of trade-related uncertainty. While a fair market uncertainty remains, we are well positioned to win here with our unsurpassed global footprint and differentiated product and services capabilities.
The strong growth in RFID continues to be fueled by apparel. While we make great progress in developing other promising verticals, our total pipeline of customer engagements continues to expand, now up by more than 30% from just the beginning of this year with engagements in categories outside of apparel including food, beauty, logistics leading the way.
As the leader in ultrahigh frequency RFIDs, we are positioned extremely well to capture these opportunities with our industry-leading innovation and manufacturing capabilities and the best, most experienced team in the space. We continued to increase our investments in business development and other resources to drive this growth as we build out our Intelligent Labels platform to enable a future where every item can have a digital twin and a digital life.
In Industrial and Healthcare Materials, sales were flat on an organic basis, driven by the decline in global auto production, which more than offset solid growth in other industrial categories as well as strong growth in our medical business. And we once again made good progress in the quarter towards achieving our operating margin target for this business. 
In short, another solid quarter, and despite a softer top line, we are reaffirming our earnings guidance midpoint for the year. Our strategies to deliver outsized growth in high-value categories are clearly working, and our relentless focus on productivity continues to enable us to increase our pace of investment in these categories, increase our competitiveness overall and grow profitably in our base businesses while importantly continuing to expand operating margin. We are confident in our ability to achieve our long-term objective to drive GDP+ growth and top quartile returns, and we will continue to seek opportunities to leverage our positions of strength commercially, operationally and financially and lean forward even as others may pull back. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Greg."

As Mitch said, we delivered another solid quarter with adjusted earnings per share of $1.72, in line with our expectations and again up more than 10% on a constant currency basis. We grew sales by 1.6% on an organic basis and currency translation reduced reported sales growth by 4.7 points in the quarter. Adjusted operating margin increased by 60 basis points to 12.1% and we realized $12 million of restructuring savings net of transition costs in the quarter. The LGM restructuring in Europe was largely completed as of the end of Q2, which will drive a significant uptake in savings from this initiative in the second half.
Turning to cash generation and allocation. Year-to-date, we've generated $165 million of free cash flow, up nearly $38 million compared to the prior year. And as we've discussed, we've increased our pace of fixed capital in IT-related spending for a 2- to 3-year period to support our long-term organic growth and margin expansion plans, with capital spending expected to be up by about $25 million this year. We continue to expect capital spending then to moderate from this level over the next couple of years, consistent with our long-term capital allocation strategy. And we continue to return cash to shareholders. In the first half of the year, we repurchased roughly 1.2 million shares at an aggregate cost of $117 million; have paid $93 million in dividends, including the 12% increase in the dividend rate in April for a total of $209 million of cash return to shareholders, up 11% compared to the same period last year. 
And our balance sheet remains strong. Our current leverage position gives us ample capacity to continue executing our disciplined capital allocation strategy, including investing in organic growth and acquisitions while continuing to return cash to shareholders. We are well positioned to take advantage of any dislocations in the market should they occur over the next few years.
I'll now turn to the segment results for the quarter. Label and Graphic Materials sales increased by 0.9% on an organic basis, driven by prior year pricing actions as volume declined modestly. Growth in LGM's high-value categories continued to outpace the growth of the base business, once again led by specialty and durables, which were collectively up high single digits on an organic basis. 
Breaking down LGM's organic growth in the quarter by region, both North America and Western Europe declined at low single-digit rates, reflecting the market dynamics I already discussed. Emerging markets grew at a low single-digit rate, with China up low single digits and South Asia up high single digits. 
Adjusted operating margin for the segment was strong at 13.8%, in line with the same period last year, reflecting the benefit of productivity actions including material reengineering, partially offset by currency-related headwinds and the impact of lower volume. As I mentioned in last quarter's call, we've covered the cumulative effects of the roughly 18 months of raw material cost inflation that we experienced through a combination of pricing actions and material reengineering. 
We're now seeing some modest deflation in our raw material input cost on a sequential basis with comparable sequential declines in both the first and second quarters of the year. 
Shifting now to Retail Branding and Information Solutions. RBIS delivered solid top line growth, up 4.4% on an organic basis, driven by faster growth in high-value categories with sales of both RFID and external embellishments up more than 20% for the quarter. Our base business was roughly flat, adjusting for the impact of cannibalization due to RFID.
Adjusted operating margin for the segment expanded by 130 basis points to 12.5% as productivity and higher volume more than offset higher employee-related costs and growth-related investments.
Turning to the Industrial and Healthcare Materials segment. Sales were flat on an organic basis, driven by the decline in global auto production as automotive applications globally represent about 1/3 of IHM's sales.
Outside of automotive, industrial categories were up mid-single digits on an organic basis. Health care categories likewise grew at a mid-single-digit pace with better than 20% growth in medical applications. 
We continue to make good progress on the margin front in IHM. Adjusted operating margin increased by 120 basis points to 10.5%, driven by productivity and the net benefit of pricing and raw material costs, which more than offset higher employee-related costs. Gains on the pricing side largely relate to strategic adjustments we made as a result of our work to more effectively segment our portfolio.
Focusing now on our outlook for 2019. We have maintained our guidance midpoint for adjusted earnings per share while tightening the range to $6.50 to $6.65. We have reduced our outlook for organic sales growth to a range of 2% to 2.5%, in light of the slower market conditions in LGM during the first half that we assume will continue. 
We've outlined some of the other key contributing factors to this guidance on Slide 9 of our supplemental presentation materials. In particular, and just focusing on the changes from our assumptions in April, at recent exchange rates, currency translation represents a roughly 2.5 point headwind to reported sales growth for the year with a pretax operating income hit of $28 million. This is up slightly from the $27 million we'd anticipated previously. We now estimate that incremental pretax savings from restructuring, net of transition costs, will contribute about $45 million to $50 million, up $5 million from our April estimate as we've accelerated a number of actions that were in the pipeline. We've already realized about $17 million in net savings year-to-date and expect the balance of our full year savings will be split roughly equally between the third and fourth quarters. And we've narrowed our range on average share count assuming dilution of 84.5 million to 85 million shares, reflecting an assumed pickup from the Q2 pace of share buyback during the second half. 
In summary, we delivered another solid quarter in a more challenging environment, and we are confident in our ability to deliver the earnings guidance we've communicated at the start of the year and are on track to deliver on our long-term objectives to achieve GDP+ growth and top quartile returns on capital driving sustained growth in EVA. 
Now we'll open up the call for your questions."

One, we talked a little bit about the stronger growth in higher value segments, and that helped overall with our margins there as well, as well as some of the share loss that we've talked about over the last couple quarters is in some of the less differentiated segments. So having a generally kind of lower average variable margin than our average would be on that decline. At the same time, as you mentioned, Ghansham, we've accelerated productivity efforts, combination of restructuring actions as well as kind of short-term productivity actions, including belt tightening, as Mitch mentioned, a little bit of incentive cost and a little bit of benefit from price deflation year-over-year. So really a combination of things with the productivity as well as stronger growth in high-value segments helping maintain the margin year-over-year."

So overall, as far as pull forward, it's tough to call overall, Ghansham, as far as what end retailer behavior has been doing in the first half. There's been just more choppiness, as I commented on. 
The other big factor just between Q1 and Q2 is really around just timing of holidays and Chinese New Year and everything else. That aside, Q2 seemed to have a bit of a slowdown in the base. And it's really around just some of the uncertainty, particularly around announced tariffs and then tariffs being canceled and so forth. So even within individual quarters, we're seeing a bit more lumpiness than we normally see. 
Now with that regard, performance athletic continues to be a well-positioned category. They've moved a lot of their sourcing outside of China already. And I'd say the value segments, so think of discounters and so forth, are more exposed to what's going on with the China-U.S. trade relationships."

So we're seeing progress, particularly in North America and Europe where we have clear date on what's going on within the market. We can tell from volume trends that we're seeing we're making progress. We've stabilized the share position and began to recapture that share here in Q2. We are focused on doing this in a disciplined and gradual way. As we said, it will take us a few quarters to recapture that share. And how we do it is basically continuing to focus around our differentiated quality and service. That is a key area of focus for us and so we're willing to take some risk, particularly late in the inflationary cycle, knowing that our core fundamental points of advantage continue to play through over time. 
Having said that, our markets clearly are competitive, and less differentiated categories are competitive as well. So we continue to have a balanced strategy focused around innovation and productivity to remain competitive and continue to have attractive returns within the base categories. 
I do want to comment real quick also, as Ghansham, you had another follow-up question around RFID. So again, just as my comments said, continuing to see strength within RFID. RFID is an enabler for continuing to not only provide opportunities for end market demand and managing through the omnichannel, all the advantages we've talked to in the past, but also around shortening lead times and cycle times, which given some of the trade uncertainty, also is a great capability for any retailer and brand to have. So there's not any impact or changing views overall in RFID in any way other than just general recognition that it is the technology of the future within the apparel categories. And we're seeing the new opportunities continue to flourish outside of apparel, as I talked through as well."

And we find most of what we're looking to companies in the pipeline are privately held. Prices tend to be a little bit sticky. We are actively engaging a number of targets there. We did slow down a little bit of the slow core ships in IHM. We're now going to be ramping that up as well as far as how we core people. But it's, in general, pipeline is healthy but the pricing is a bit sticky is what I'd say. And that's why things haven't converted of late.

So Jeff, the volume trends, we don't talk about the specific volume trends overall region by region. But if you look at within North America, it was growing low single digits organically through the end of '17, and the growth began to moderate a bit in '18 and then moderated fully again here in 2019. And as we talked about before, Q1, we think we saw a bit of softness that was probably a little bit more share than just the market, at least in the beginning of the quarter. Now we're seeing all same macro trends you're seeing, and we don't yet have share market data for Q2. But if you look at the macro trends, it seems that there might be a bit of a softening in Q2 here. 
Europe had even stronger growth than North America up until early last year. It then moderated. It moderated still further from a market perspective and looks like volumes, it actually went negative as an overall market as well in Q2. 
In China, we continue to see growth within the variable information labels tied to e-commerce. It's tough to tell exactly, there's no clear market data here but there's just a lot more uncertainty in general. There's growth, decent growth overall outside of variable observation labels in the market, but it's a lot more push and take and just uncertainty, I'd say, with the engagement that we have with our customers. 
And then South Asia, we continue to see strong growth. ASEAN is a little bit lighter than India. ASEAN basically has tough comps they're going through. India, we're seeing strong growth still, although that's moderating a bit. Exports are down coming out of India, which is having a general macro view. And Latin America, decent growth relative to the environment. And you can see what's going on in the environment there. We've got -- had quite a bit of currency, price and so forth over the last couple of years."

We delivered solid profit growth in the third quarter, despite softer than usual market demand with EPS once again up double digits over prior year on a constant currency basis. Our focus in this slower growth environment has been to protect even expand our margins in the base business, while driving faster-than-average growth in high-value categories, like RFID. We're executing well on both fronts. We appear to have recaptured most of the share we recently lost in LGM. Our intelligent labels platform continues to drive over 20% growth from RFID-enabled solutions, and IHM's commercial execution continues to improve. 
At the same time, our relentless focus on productivity was, again, a key driver of the margin expansion for the company this quarter. 
In sum, we are making good progress against our key strategic priorities and are on track to deliver our long-term financial targets. 
Label and Graphic Materials posted strong profitability on roughly a point of organic growth for the quarter, driven primarily by volume. High-value categories, again, grew faster than the base. 
As I mentioned, though all of the market data isn't in yet for the third quarter, we have good reason to believe that by the end of the quarter, we had recaptured the bulk of the share we at the tail of the inflationary cycle. 
In terms of global market trends, it appears that the soft market conditions that we saw in the first half of the year largely continued into the third quarter, with a modest improvement in Europe offset by a moderation of demand in South Asia.
Retail Branding and Information Solutions delivered solid organic growth driven by ongoing strength in RFID external embellishments, which more than offset declines in the base apparel business. 
As we mentioned in July, we saw trade-related uncertainty impacting orders in the second quarter. This uncertainty was reinforced when additional tariffs were announced in August. Now while trade-related issues are causing near-term uncertainty, we are well positioned in the base business given our global footprint and differentiated product and service capabilities. As for RFID, the growth trajectory continues to be resilient, with continued strength in apparel and even faster growth from other promising verticals though obviously off of a small base. Our total pipeline of customer engagements continue to expand, up more than 40% from just the beginning of this year, driven primarily by categories outside of apparel.
At the leader in ultrahigh frequency RFID, we are positioned extremely well to capture these opportunities, with industry-leading innovation and manufacturing capabilities and the best most experienced team in the space. We continue to increase our level of investment in business development and other resources to drive its growth as build out our Intelligent Labels platform to enable a future where every item can have a digital twin and digital life.
Industrial and Healthcare Materials sales growth was relatively strong on an organic basis due in part to slowdown in China's automotive market last year. That said, given the high proportion of this segment's portfolio that is focused on industrial and markets, I'm pleased with the solid top line performance the team delivered. And importantly, we made excellent progress in the quarter towards achieving our operating margin targets for the business.
In short another solid quarter overall in the midst of a challenging environment. Our strategy is to deliver outsized growth in high-value categories are working and our relentless focus on productivity continues to enable us to increase our pace of investment categories, increase our competitiveness overall and grow profitably in our base businesses while importantly, continuing to protect and expand operating margin. 
While we lowered the high end of our near-term outlook for top line growth due to recent market trends, and currently shift causes to reduce the high end of EPS guidance for the year, we are confident in our ability to achieve our long-term objectives, including GDP+ growth and top quartile returns. 
We will continue to seek opportunities to leverage our position of strength commercially, operationally and financially and as our hearts Amy before, but be prepared to lean forward as others may pull back. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Greg."

As Mitch said, we delivered another solid quarter, with adjusted earnings per share of $1.66, up 14% despite the currency headwind. We grew sales by 2.1% on an organic basis, and currency translation reduced reported sales growth by 2 points in the quarter. And our adjusted operating margin increased by a full point to 11.7%. 
We realized $18 million of restructuring savings net of transition costs in the quarter due in part to LGM's restructuring in the Europe that was largely completed as of the end of Q2. And our cash generation has been strong. We delivered $327 million of free cash flow year-to-date, up $67 million compared to the same period last year.
As we've discussed, we've increased our pace of fixed capital and IT-related spending for a few years to support our long-term organic growth and margin expansion plans with capital spending expected to be up by about $20 million this year. 
And we continue to return cash to shareholders. In the first 3 quarters of the year, we repurchased roughly 2 million shares at an aggregate cost of $204 million and paid $141 million in dividends for a total of $346 million of cash return to shareholders. Importantly, our balance sheet remains strong with net debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA taking down slightly in the quarter. Our current leverage position gives us ample capacity to continue executing our disciplined capital allocation strategy, including investing in organic growth and acquisitions while continuing to return cash to shareholders.
We are well positioned to take advantage of any dislocations in the market should they occur over the next few years. 
Turning to the segment results for the quarter. Label and Graphic Materials sales increased by 1.2% on an organic basis driven primarily by higher volume as we have now lapped the bulk of last year's price increases. Growth in LGM's high-value categories led by specialty labels continued to outpace the growth of the base business.
In breaking down LGM's organic growth in the quarter by region, North America was roughly flat, while Western Europe was up low-single digits. Emerging markets also grew at a low-single-digit rate, with China up low-single digits and South Asia up mid-single digits.
Adjusted operating margin for the segment was strong at 13.5%, up 120 basis points compared to the prior year, reflecting the benefit of productivity initiatives, including restructuring and material reengineering, partially offset by higher employee-related costs. A net effect of changes in price, and raw material freight input costs was neutral for the quarter. 
Shifting now to Retail Branding and Information Solutions. RBIS delivered solid top line growth, up 4.1% on an organic basis, driven by faster growth in high-value categories with RFID sales up roughly 20%, and external embellishments growing even faster.
Our base business, adjusted for the migration of products to higher-value RFID solutions, was down low single digits. 
Adjusted operating margin for the segment increased 10 basis points to 11.5% as productivity gains were largely offset by long-term growth-related investments, primarily related to RFID. 
Turning to the Industrial and Healthcare Materials segment. Sales were up 3.7% on an organic basis, reflecting both volume growth and higher prices. Sales for industrial categories were up low- to mid-single digits, driven by solid growth in auto-related categories. And healthcare categories grew even faster a high-single digits, with medical up in the high-teens.
And we made excellent progress on the margin front in IHM. Adjusted operating margin increased by 180 basis points to 11% as the benefits from higher volume and productivity more than offset higher employee-related costs. The normal seasonality does call for sequential easing in margin for the fourth quarter, I'm confident we'll achieve the 10% we targeted for IHM for the full here.
Focusing now on our outlook for 2019. We have lowered the high end of our guidance range for adjusted earnings per share, reflecting incremental currency translation headwinds, largely offset by stronger operational results in a modestly lower tax rate compared to our previous expectations. 
We have reduced our outlook for full year organic sales growth to our range of 2.0% to 2.3%, which implies 2% to 3% growth for the fourth quarter. 
As you know, in our short-cycle businesses, visibility to demand is very limited, and we're seeing increased variability in order patents from month-to-month. So the low end of our organic growth outlook assumes a continuation of the 2% we've seen year-to-date, including the first few weeks of October. On the high-end reflects the fact that comparison easier for us over the balance of the quarter.
We've outlined some of the other key confident and factored store guidance on Slide 9 of our supplemental presentation materials. In particular, we're just focusing on the material changes from our assumptions in July. At recent exchange rates, currency translation represents a roughly 3.5 point headwind to reported sales growth for the year, with the pretax operating income hit of $37 million and incremental of $9 million headwind relative to the $28 million we were anticipating in July.
Partially offsetting this, we now estimate that incremental pretax savings from restructuring net of transition costs, will contribute approximately $50 million, as the teams have been executing very well against our plans and we look to deliver at the high end of our previous expectations. We realized about $35 million of the savings in the first 3 quarters of the year. And the tax rate should come in slightly lower than our previous outlook, which I assumed 25% at the midpoint of our guidance range.
In summary, we delivered another solid quarter in a more challenging environment, and we remain on track to deliver on our long-term objectives to achieve GDP+ growth and top quartile returns on capital, which together drives sustained growth in EVA.
And now we'll open up the call for your questions."

So basically, if you look within July, growth started out relatively soft, softened further in August and then came back in September. We're now seeing a bit of moderation as Greg talked about early October, again. So a little bit more of choppiness that we've talked through. 
In North America, so just from a market perspective, in the markets, we've seen pretty consistent low-single-digit growth between last year and this year. Our growth, of course, was lower than that in the first half of the year because of the share losses, which we since believe we are on the solid path to recapturing. And in Europe, we saw low to mid-single-digit growth last year, as you know, in the first half really no growth pretty flattened environment and we are now seeing a little bit of a pickup low single digit growth in Q3 mostly and southern Europe, not not or Central Europe overall. And then in, I think, China, we saw low mid-digit last year growth, and we saw flattened first half of this year and started to see some positive growth here in Q3, mid-single digits. And South Asia as we called out, that's where we saw a shift, and it's really ASEAN. So India continues to have strong growth, high-single digits. And ASEAN, specifically Malaysia and Thailand, where we're seeing some softness, which we attribute broadly to just softer market conditions and the link between the China and U.S. trade matters.  So as far as [indiscernible] basically the sentiment reflects those market trends overall. So generally, the customer sentiment label recently was well attended by customers, particularly from Europe once in southern Europe and Eastern Europe a little bit more confident about near-term outlook than the ones from northern and Central Europe, specifically.

We talked about the base apparel business slowing a little bit already, the rate of growth slowing in Q2 already and it further moderated here in Q3. 
We do see people trying to buy ahead of time because that was tentativeness people in general where just slow to move in overall. When we look at what's going on our growth trends when we talk to other players in the segment suppliers provide threats, and so forth, what they're saying is similar to what we are seeing. When you talk about actual retail and brand level, you have some retailers, some brands that are doing phenomenally well and others that are struggling. So that's a bit of a mixed bag, if you will, as far as what's going on in and retail environment. So we didn't really seen that any bills or anything. If you look at that material trends, inventory has dropped dramatically in '18, build up a little bit at the end of last year beginning of this year already to started depleting again. And these are levels that are near all-time lows right now as far as inventory levels, which I think just shows retailers and brands focused on the need for foster supply chains and lower inventory levels in this more uncertain environment we just further reinforces that option of our RFID."

We delivered solid profit growth in the third quarter, despite softer-than-usual market demand with EPS once again up double digits over prior year on a constant currency basis. Our focus in this slower growth environment had been to protect even expand our margins in the base business while driving faster-than-average growth in high-value categories, like RFID.
We're executing well on both fronts. We appear to have recaptured most of the share we recently lost in LGM. Our Intelligent Labels platform continued to drive over 20% growth from RFID-enabled solutions, and IHM's commercial execution continues to improve. At the same time, our relentless focus on productivity was, again, a key driver of the margin expansion for the company this quarter. In sum, we are making good progress against our key strategic priorities and are on track to deliver our long-term financial targets.
Label and Graphic Materials posted strong profitability on roughly a point of organic growth for the quarter, driven primarily by volume. High-value categories, again, grew faster than the base. As I mentioned, though all of the market data isn't in yet for the third quarter, we have good reason to believe that by the end of the quarter, we had recaptured the bulk of the share we ceded at the tail end of the inflationary cycle.
In terms of global market trends, it appears that the soft market conditions that we saw in the first half of the year largely continued into the third quarter, with a modest improvement in Europe offset by a moderation of demand in South Asia.
Retail Branding and Information Solutions delivered solid organic growth, driven by ongoing strength in RFID and external embellishments, which more than offset declines in the base apparel business. As we mentioned in July, we saw trade-related uncertainty impacting orders in the second quarter. This uncertainty was reinforced when additional tariffs were announced in August. Now while trade-related issues are causing near-term uncertainty, we are well positioned in the base business, given our global footprint and differentiated product and service capabilities.
As for RFID, the growth trajectory continues to be resilient, with continued strength in apparel and even faster growth from other promising verticals though obviously off of a small base. Our total pipeline of customer engagements continue to expand, up more than 40% from just the beginning of this year, driven primarily by categories outside of apparel.
As the leader in ultrahigh frequency RFID, we are positioned extremely well to capture these opportunities with industry-leading innovation and manufacturing capabilities and the best most experienced team in the space. We continue to increase our level of investment in business development and other resources to drive this growth as we build out our Intelligent Labels platform to enable a future where every item can have a digital twin and digital life.
In Industrial and Healthcare Materials, sales growth was relatively strong on an organic basis due in part to lapping the slowdown in China's automotive market last year. That said, given the high proportion of this segment's portfolio that is focused on industrial and markets, I'm pleased with the solid top line performance the team delivered. And importantly, we made excellent progress in the quarter towards achieving our operating margin target for the business.
In short, another solid quarter overall in the midst of a challenging environment. Our strategies to deliver outsized growth in high-value categories are working, and our relentless focus on productivity continues to enable us to increase our pace of investment in these categories, increase our competitiveness overall and grow profitably in our base businesses while importantly, continuing to protect and expand operating margin.
While we lowered the high end of our near-term outlook for top line growth due to recent market trends and currency shift caused us to reduce the high end of our EPS guidance for the year, we are confident in our ability to achieve our long-term objectives, including GDP+ growth and top quartile returns. We will continue to seek opportunities to leverage our position of strength commercially, operationally and financially and as you've heard me say before, be prepared to lean forward even as others may pull back.

As Mitch said, we delivered another solid quarter, with adjusted earnings per share of $1.66, up 14% despite the currency headwind. We grew sales by 2.1% on an organic basis, and currency translation reduced reported sales growth by 2 points in the quarter. And our adjusted operating margin increased by a full point to 11.7%. 
We realized $18 million of restructuring savings net of transition costs in the quarter due in part to LGM's restructuring in the Europe that was largely completed as of the end of Q2. And our cash generation has been strong. We've delivered $327 million of free cash flow year-to-date, up $67 million compared to the same period last year.
As we've discussed, we've increased our pace of fixed capital in IT-related spending for a few years to support our long-term organic growth and margin expansion plans, with capital spending expected to be up by about $20 million this year. And we continue to return cash to shareholders. In the first 3 quarters of the year, we repurchased roughly 2 million shares at an aggregate cost of $204 million and paid $141 million in dividends for a total of $346 million of cash returned to shareholders.
Importantly, our balance sheet remained strong with net debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA ticking down slightly in the quarter. Our current leverage position gives us ample capacity to continue executing our disciplined capital allocation strategy, including investing in organic growth and acquisitions while continuing to return cash to shareholders. We are well positioned to take advantage of any dislocations in the market, should they occur over the next few years.
Turning to the segment results for the quarter. Label and Graphic Materials sales increased by 1.2% on an organic basis, driven primarily by higher volume as we've now lapped the bulk of last year's price increases. Growth in LGM's high-value categories led by specialty labels continued to outpace the growth of the base business.
And breaking down LGM's organic growth in the quarter by region, North America was roughly flat, while Western Europe was up low single digits. Emerging markets also grew at a low single-digit rate, with China up low single digits and South Asia up mid-single digits.
Adjusted operating margin for the segment was strong at 13.5%, up 120 basis points compared to the prior year, reflecting the benefit of productivity initiatives, including restructuring and material reengineering, partially offset by higher employee-related costs. The net effect of changes in price and raw material and freight input cost was neutral for the quarter.
Shifting now to Retail Branding and Information Solutions. RBIS delivered solid top line growth, up 4.1% on an organic basis, driven by faster growth in high-value categories with RFID sales up roughly 20% and external embellishments growing even faster. Our base business, adjusted for the migration of products to higher-value RFID solutions, was down low single digits. Adjusted operating margin for the segment increased 10 basis points to 11.5% as productivity gains were largely offset by long-term growth-related investments, primarily related to RFID.
Turning to the Industrial and Healthcare Materials segment. Sales were up 3.7% on an organic basis, reflecting both volume growth and higher prices. Sales for industrial categories were up low to mid-single digits, driven by solid growth in auto-related categories. And health care categories grew even faster, up high single digits, with medical up in the high teens. And we made excellent progress on the margin front in IHM. Adjusted operating margin increased by 180 basis points to 11% as the benefits from higher volume and productivity more than offset higher employee-related costs. The normal seasonality does call for sequential easing in margin for the fourth quarter, I'm confident we'll achieve the 10% we targeted for IHM for the full year.
Focusing now on our outlook for 2019. We have lowered the high end of our guidance range for adjusted earnings per share, reflecting incremental currency translation headwinds, largely offset by stronger operational results in a modestly lower tax rate compared to our previous expectations. We have reduced our outlook for full year organic sales growth to a range of 2.0% to 2.3%, which implies 2% to 3% growth for the fourth quarter.
As you know, in our short-cycle businesses, visibility to demand is very limited, and we're seeing increased variability in order patterns from month-to-month. So the low end of our organic growth outlook assumes a continuation of the 2% we've seen year-to-date, including the first few weeks of October while the high-end reflects the fact that comparisons do get easier for us over the balance of the quarter.
We've outlined some of the other key contributing factors to our guidance on Slide 9 of our supplemental presentation materials. In particular, we're just focusing on the material changes from our assumptions in July. At recent exchange rates, currency translation represents a roughly 3.5 point headwind to reported sales growth for the year, with the pretax operating income hit of $37 million and incremental of $9 million headwind relative to the $28 million we were anticipating in July.
Partially offsetting this, we now estimate that incremental pretax savings from restructuring, net of transition costs, will contribute approximately $50 million, as the teams have been executing very well against our plans and we look to deliver at the high end of our previous expectations. We realized about $35 million of these savings in the first 3 quarters of the year. And the tax rate should come in slightly lower than our previous outlook, which I had assumed 25% at the midpoint of our guidance range.
In summary, we delivered another solid quarter in a more challenging environment, and we remain on track to deliver on our long-term objectives to achieve GDP+ growth and top quartile returns on capital, which together drives sustained growth in EVA.
And now we'll open up the call for your questions."

It softened further in August and then came back in September. We're now seeing a bit of a moderation as Greg talked about early October again. So a little bit more of the choppiness that we've talked through.
In North America, so just from a market perspective, in the markets, we've seen pretty consistent low single-digit growth between last year and this year. Our growth, of course, was lower than that in the first half of the year because of the share losses, which we since believe we're on the solid path to recapturing.
And in Europe, we saw low to mid-single-digit growth last year, as you know, and the first half really no growth, pretty flat environment, and we're now seeing a little bit of a pickup low single-digit growth in Q3 mostly in Southern Europe, not north or Central Europe overall. And then in, I think, China, we saw low mid-digit last year growth, and we saw flattened first half of this year and started to see some positive growth here in Q3, mid-single digits. And South Asia, as we called out, that's where we saw a shift, and it's really ASEAN. So India continues to have strong growth, high single digits. And ASEAN, specifically Malaysia and Thailand, where we're seeing some softness, which we attribute broadly to just softer market conditions and the link between the China and U.S. trade matters.
So as far as sentiment from the customer, basically the sentiment reflects those market trends overall. So generally, the customer sentiment, we just had Labelexpo recently. It was well attended by customers, particularly from Europe, the ones in Southern Europe and Eastern Europe sounded a little bit more confident about the near-term outlook than the ones from northern and Central Europe, specifically. Overall, a lot of excitement though about the innovations and a lot of interest coming from customers of what we can bring to the table and help together to grow the market."

Not uncommon in LGM, in particular, to have a few weeks of just growth above normal or below normal, but we're just being seeing it more consistent into somewhat larger degree.

There's a few areas where in addition to the fact that last year certainly from a comp perspective was when we really started to see the China auto market slow. So that was a year-over-year benefit. But in addition to that, our medical business, as you've heard us talked about over the last, at least our fourth straight quarter, I guess, we've had growth in the high teens in our medical business. So that business continues to perform very well and has certainly been taking some share in some target applications. We'll start to lap some of that high-teens growth here as we go into the fourth quarter, but feel very good about how that business has performed over the last year.
And at the same time, on industrial, for us, this is really an application-by-application based business. And here, we also feel like we want some share in some target applications in areas such as building construction types and North America as an example is an area we continue to grow very well in. So it's a little bit the easier comps in automotive, but still automotive market as a whole this year or in Q3 was still down, auto production globally. And we did grow in kind of low to mid-single-digit range. So I feel good about the performance here, as you said, against generally weaker industrial."

It'll be a headwind then in the first half of next year if we stay at these rates. And a few other items as headwinds, I think, is well there.

Yes, so overall, the speed at which we've been able to build the pipeline has been rapid, and I don't think we gave projections about what we expected, but we are hitting our ambitions on that. And as I mentioned, most of the growth in the actual pipeline is for categories outside of apparel. Specifically, the biggest growth driver of that has really been within the food category. So foods, we have quite a few programs in the pipeline that we're working.
As far as the actual growth, the growth levels, it's high in percentage terms but it's off of a very small base. So our focus here is leverage the strength that we have within the apparel segment, both from a business development as well innovation and manufacturing capabilities and identify other end markets where there are similarities to apparel that we think are right for adoption to begin to build that.
We're having some wins along the way, but a lot of this -- the revenue right now outside of apparel, a lot of them are at the pilot stage and so forth to pilot revenue, and there's a couple moving to full adoptions, but it's relatively small, less than 10 programs.

When you talk about actual at the retail and brand level, you have some retailers, some brands that are doing phenomenally well and others that are struggling. So there was a bit of a mixed bag, if you will, as far as what's going on in retail environment. So we didn't really see inventory builds or anything. If you look at the inventory trends, inventory has dropped dramatically in '18, built up a little bit at the end of last year beginning of this year, but then have already started depleting again.

So we're at PACK EXPO recently, and we saw -- it seemed to us anyway a lot of commentary by some of the other packaging providers around direct printing on secondary packaging, which obviously if that really took off and it was a scalable would have some threat -- present some threat to labeling and pressure-sensitive materials. Mitch, what are you seeing in that regard? Are you seeing a little bit more activity there from competing technologies? Are you not -- would you agree with our perception that whether or not it's a threat, you're seeing a little more activity from competing materials and competing technology, I should say. And then similarly, it comes up periodically. Are you seeing any increased attempts by brand owners and retailers to not necessarily go down the RFID path but use other technologies to track products through supply chain without having RFID, those revision systems or other things like that?"

Yes, so specifically, as far as other labeling technologies and commenting on direct print, we've actually been engaging with a number of firms on the direct print for a number of years now. So we have seen some activity here. The technology what we see as far as the economics of it, it's still pretty far weighs off. So we're actively engaged. I think a number of people are playing with in working through, but it's really going to be in small volumes premium side of the industry.
As far as the use of other technologies to attract products, we've been consistent in saying when we think about the Internet of Things and everything physical having a digital twin and digital life, we said RFID is one of a number of enabling technologies. And there's a number of areas where a wireless radio base connection will be required, others where you maybe have more clear line of sight, less SKU complexity and so forth can be using other technologies. So we think there's going to be a complement of technologies that enable that future overall. So that's not -- we're working with a number of those companies and well aware of that and see this is actually space where multiple technologies will prosper."

We delivered solid profit growth in the third quarter, despite softer-than-usual market demand with EPS once again up double digits over prior year on a constant currency basis. Our focus in this slower growth environment has been to protect, even expand our margins in the base business while driving faster-than-average growth in high-value categories, like RFID.
We're executing well on both fronts. We appear to have recaptured most of the share we recently lost in LGM. Our Intelligent Labels platform continues to drive over 20% growth from RFID-enabled solutions, and IHM's commercial execution continues to improve. At the same time, our relentless focus on productivity was, again, a key driver of the margin expansion for the company this quarter. In sum, we are making good progress against our key strategic priorities and are on track to deliver our long-term financial targets.
Label and Graphic Materials posted strong profitability on roughly a point of organic growth for the quarter, driven primarily by volume. High-value categories, again, grew faster than the base. As I mentioned, though all of the market data isn't in yet for the third quarter, we have good reason to believe that by the end of the quarter, we had recaptured the bulk of the share we ceded at the tail end of the inflationary cycle.
In terms of global market trends, it appears that the soft market conditions that we saw in the first half of the year largely continued into the third quarter, with a modest improvement in Europe offset by a moderation of demand in South Asia.
Retail Branding and Information Solutions delivered solid organic growth, driven by ongoing strength in RFID and external embellishments, which more than offset declines in the base apparel business. As we mentioned in July, we saw trade-related uncertainty impacting orders in the second quarter. This uncertainty was reinforced when additional tariffs were announced in August. Now while trade-related issues are causing near-term uncertainty, we are well positioned in the base business, given our global footprint and differentiated product and service capabilities.
As for RFID, the growth trajectory continues to be resilient, with continued strength in apparel and even faster growth from other promising verticals, though obviously off of a small base. Our total pipeline of customer engagements continues to expand, up more than 40% from just the beginning of this year, driven primarily by categories outside of apparel.
As the leader in ultrahigh frequency RFID, we are positioned extremely well to capture these opportunities with industry-leading innovation and manufacturing capabilities and the best, most experienced team in the space. We continue to increase our level of investment in business development and other resources to drive this growth as we build out our Intelligent Labels platform to enable a future where every item can have a digital twin and digital life.
In Industrial and Healthcare Materials, sales growth was relatively strong on an organic basis, due in part to lapping the slowdown in China's automotive market last year. That said, given the high proportion of this segment's portfolio that is focused on industrial end markets, I'm pleased with the solid top line performance the team delivered. And importantly, we made excellent progress in the quarter towards achieving our operating margin target for the business.
In short, another solid quarter overall in the midst of a challenging environment. Our strategies to deliver outsized growth in high-value categories are working, and our relentless focus on productivity continues to enable us to increase our pace of investment in these categories, increase our competitiveness overall and grow profitably in our base businesses while importantly continuing to protect and expand operating margin.
While we lowered the high end of our near-term outlook for top line growth due to recent market trends and currency shifts caused us to reduce the high end of our EPS guidance for the year, we are confident in our ability to achieve our long-term objectives, including GDP+ growth and top quartile returns. We will continue to seek opportunities to leverage our positions of strength commercially; operationally; and financially; and, as you've heard me say before, be prepared to lean forward even as others may pull back.
Now I'll turn the call over to Greg."

As Mitch said, we delivered another solid quarter, with adjusted earnings per share of $1.66, up 14% despite the currency headwind. We grew sales by 2.1% on an organic basis, and currency translation reduced reported sales growth by 2 points in the quarter. And our adjusted operating margin increased by a full point to 11.7%. 
We realized $18 million of restructuring savings net of transition costs in the quarter, due in part to LGM's restructuring in Europe that was largely completed as of the end of Q2. And our cash generation has been strong. We've delivered $327 million of free cash flow year-to-date, up $67 million compared to the same period last year.
As we've discussed, we've increased our pace of fixed capital in IT-related spending for a few years to support our long-term organic growth and margin expansion plans, with capital spending expected to be up by about $20 million this year. And we continue to return cash to shareholders. In the first 3 quarters of the year, we repurchased roughly 2 million shares at an aggregate cost of $204 million and paid $141 million in dividends for a total of $346 million of cash returned to shareholders.
Importantly, our balance sheet remains strong, with net debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA ticking down slightly in the quarter. Our current leverage position gives us ample capacity to continue executing our disciplined capital allocation strategy, including investing in organic growth and acquisitions while continuing to return cash to shareholders. We are well positioned to take advantage of any dislocations in the market, should they occur over the next few years.
Turning to the segment results for the quarter, label and Graphic Materials sales increased by 1.2% on an organic basis, driven primarily by higher volume as we've now lapped the bulk of last year's price increases. Growth in LGM's high-value categories led by specialty labels continued to outpace the growth of the base business.
And breaking down LGM's organic growth in the quarter by region, North America was roughly flat, while Western Europe was up low single digits. Emerging markets also grew at a low single-digit rate, with China up low single digits and South Asia up mid-single digits.
Adjusted operating margin for the segment was strong at 13.5%, up 120 basis points compared to the prior year, reflecting the benefit of productivity initiatives, including restructuring and material reengineering, partially offset by higher employee-related costs. The net effect of changes in price and raw material and freight input cost was neutral for the quarter.
Shifting now to Retail Branding and Information Solutions. RBIS delivered solid top line growth, up 4.1% on an organic basis, driven by faster growth in high-value categories with RFID sales up roughly 20% and external embellishments growing even faster. Our base business, adjusted for the migration of products to higher-value RFID solutions, was down low single digits. Adjusted operating margin for the segment increased 10 basis points to 11.5% as productivity gains were largely offset by long-term growth-related investments, primarily related to RFID.
Turning to the Industrial and Healthcare Materials segment. Sales were up 3.7% on an organic basis, reflecting both volume growth and higher prices. Sales for industrial categories were up low to mid-single digits, driven by solid growth in auto-related categories. And health care categories grew even faster, up high single digits, with medical up in the high teens. And we made excellent progress on the margin front in IHM. Adjusted operating margin increased by 180 basis points to 11% as the benefits from higher volume and productivity more than offset higher employee-related costs. Though normal seasonality does call for sequential easing in margin for the fourth quarter, I'm confident we'll achieve the 10% we targeted for IHM for the full year.
Focusing now on our outlook for 2019. We have lowered the high end of our guidance range for adjusted earnings per share, reflecting incremental currency translation headwinds, largely offset by stronger operational results in a modestly lower tax rate compared to our previous expectations. We have reduced our outlook for full year organic sales growth to a range of 2.0% to 2.3%, which implies 2% to 3% growth for the fourth quarter.
As you know, in our short-cycle businesses, visibility to demand is very limited, and we're seeing increased variability in order patterns from month-to-month. So the low end of our organic growth outlook assumes a continuation of the 2% we've seen year-to-date, including the first few weeks of October, while the high-end reflects the fact that comparisons do get easier for us over the balance of the quarter.
We've outlined some of the other key contributing factors to our guidance on Slide 9 of our supplemental presentation materials. In particular, and just focusing on the material changes from our assumptions in July, at recent exchange rates, currency translation represents a roughly 3.5 point headwind to reported sales growth for the year, with a pretax operating income hit of $37 million and incremental of $9 million headwind relative to the $28 million we were anticipating in July.
Partially offsetting this, we now estimate that incremental pretax savings from restructuring, net of transition costs, will contribute approximately $50 million, as the teams have been executing very well against our plans and we look to deliver at the high end of our previous expectations. We've realized about $35 million of these savings in the first 3 quarters of the year. And the tax rate should come in slightly lower than our previous outlook, which I had assumed 25% at the midpoint of our guidance range.
In summary, we delivered another solid quarter in a more challenging environment, and we remain on track to deliver on our long-term objectives to achieve GDP+ growth and top quartile returns on capital, which together drives sustained growth in EVA.
And now we'll open up the call for your questions."

It softened further in August and then came back in September. We're now seeing a bit of a moderation, as Greg talked about, early October again. So a little bit more of the choppiness that we've talked through.
In North America, so just from a market perspective, in the markets, we've seen pretty consistent low single-digit growth between last year and this year. Our growth, of course, was lower than that in the first half of the year because of the share losses, which we've since believe we're on the solid path to recapturing.
And in Europe, we saw low to mid-single-digit growth last year, as you know, and the first half really no growth, pretty flat environment, and we're now seeing a little bit of a pickup low single-digit growth in Q3, mostly in Southern Europe, not north or Central Europe overall. And then in, I think, China, we saw low mid-digit last year growth, and we saw flattened first half of this year and started to see some positive growth here in Q3, mid-single digits. And South Asia, as we called out, that's where we saw a shift, and it's really ASEAN. So India continues to have strong growth, high single digits. And ASEAN, specifically Malaysia and Thailand, where we're seeing some softness, which we attribute broadly to just softer market conditions and the link between the China and U.S. trade matters.
So as far as sentiment from the customer, basically the sentiment reflects those market trends overall. So generally, the customer sentiment, we just had Labelexpo recently. It was well attended by customers, particularly from Europe. The ones in Southern Europe and Eastern Europe sounded a little bit more confident about the near-term outlook than the ones from Northern and Central Europe, specifically. Overall, a lot of excitement though about the innovations and a lot of interest coming from customers of what we can bring to the table to help together grow the market."

But in addition to that, our medical business, as you've heard us talk about over the last, well, this is our fourth straight quarter, I guess, where we've had growth in the high teens in our medical business. So that business continues to perform very well and has certainly been taking some share in some target applications. We'll start to lap some of that high-teens growth here as we go into the fourth quarter, but feel very good about how that business has performed over the last year.
And at the same time, on industrial, for us, this is really an application-by-application based business. And here, we also feel like we won some share in some target applications in areas such as building construction [ tapes ] in North America as an example is an area we continue to grow very well in. So it's a little bit the easier comps in automotive, but still automotive market as a whole this year or in Q3 was still down, auto production globally.

So foods, we have quite a few programs in the pipeline that we're working.
As far as the actual growth, the growth levels, it's high in percentage terms but it's off of a very small base. So our focus here is leverage the strength that we have within the apparel segment, both from a business development as well innovation and manufacturing capabilities and identify other end markets where there are similarities to apparel that we think are right for adoption to begin to build that.
We're having some wins along the way, but a lot of this -- the revenue right now outside of apparel, a lot of them are at the pilot stage and so forth to pilot revenue.

Now, when you talk about actual at the retail and brand level, you have some retailers, some brands that are doing phenomenally well and others that are struggling. So there was a bit of a mixed bag, if you will, as far as what's going on in retail environment. So we didn't really see inventory builds or anything.

The other thing that happens is we went from the last price increase when we were at the end of inflationary cycle to, in some areas, some commodities seeing some deflation.

But if you think of water bottles and straws and so forth, pressure-sensitive labels are -- go on very few of those products. And that's where you're seeing a lot of the migration over. In general, my view is, is that there is an appropriate focus on sustainability of packaging in general. It's a key focus of the industry, it's a key focus of ours. We've been -- we're out in front of many companies, especially packagers are making sustainability a priority, and I'd say the first wave of that was more around improving sustainability of our own business, dramatically reduce greenhouse gases by 30% over the last number of years, buying more sustainably sourced raw materials, such as more than 90% of our paper that we procure is sustainably certified, such as Forest Stewardship Council. So that has been the focus, and now more recently we've been shifting more on making sure that our products make recyclability much more easy and efficient.

As far as the use of other technologies to attract products, we've been consistent in saying when we think about the Internet of Things and everything physical having a digital twin and digital life, we said RFID is one of a number of enabling technologies. And there's a number of areas where a wireless radio base connection will be required, others where you maybe have more clear line of sight, less SKU complexity and so forth, you can be using other technologies.

We delivered solid profit growth in the third quarter, despite softer-than-usual market demand with EPS once again up double digits over prior year on a constant currency basis. Our focus in this slower growth environment has been to protect, even expand our margins in the base business while driving faster-than-average growth in high-value categories, like RFID.
We're executing well on both fronts. We appear to have recaptured most of the share we recently lost in LGM. Our Intelligent Labels platform continues to drive over 20% growth from RFID-enabled solutions, and IHM's commercial execution continues to improve. At the same time, our relentless focus on productivity was, again, a key driver of the margin expansion for the company this quarter. In sum, we are making good progress against our key strategic priorities and are on track to deliver our long-term financial targets.
Label and Graphic Materials posted strong profitability on roughly a point of organic growth for the quarter driven primarily by volume. High-value categories, again, grew faster than the base. As I mentioned, though all of the market data isn't in yet for the third quarter, we have good reason to believe that by the end of the quarter, we had recaptured the bulk of the share we ceded at the tail end of the inflationary cycle.
In terms of global market trends, it appears that the soft market conditions that we saw in the first half of the year largely continued into the third quarter, with a modest improvement in Europe offset by a moderation of demand in South Asia.
Retail Branding and Information Solutions delivered solid organic growth driven by ongoing strength in RFID and external embellishments, which more than offset declines in the base apparel business. As we mentioned in July, we saw trade-related uncertainty impacting orders in the second quarter. This uncertainty was reinforced when additional tariffs were announced in August. Now while trade-related issues are causing near-term uncertainty, we are well positioned in the base business, given our global footprint and differentiated product and service capabilities.
As for RFID, the growth trajectory continues to be resilient, with continued strength in apparel and even faster growth from other promising verticals, though obviously off of a small base. Our total pipeline of customer engagements continues to expand, up more than 40% from just the beginning of this year, driven primarily by categories outside of apparel.
As the leader in ultrahigh frequency RFID, we are positioned extremely well to capture these opportunities with industry-leading innovation and manufacturing capabilities and the best, most experienced team in the space. We continue to increase our level of investment in business development and other resources to drive this growth as we build out our Intelligent Labels platform to enable a future where every item can have a digital twin and digital life.
In Industrial and Healthcare Materials, sales growth was relatively strong on an organic basis, due in part to lapping the slowdown in China's automotive market last year. That said, given the high proportion of this segment's portfolio that is focused on industrial end markets, I'm pleased with the solid top line performance the team delivered. And importantly, we made excellent progress in the quarter towards achieving our operating margin target for the business.
In short, another solid quarter overall in the midst of a challenging environment. Our strategies to deliver outsized growth in high-value categories are working, and our relentless focus on productivity continues to enable us to increase our pace of investment in these categories, increase our competitiveness overall and grow profitably in our base businesses while importantly continuing to protect and expand operating margin.
While we lowered the high end of our near-term outlook for top line growth due to recent market trends and currency shifts caused us to reduce the high end of our EPS guidance for the year, we are confident in our ability to achieve our long-term objectives, including GDP+ growth and top quartile returns. We will continue to seek opportunities to leverage our positions of strength commercially; operationally; and financially; and, as you've heard me say before, be prepared to lean forward even as others may pull back.
Now I'll turn the call over to Greg."

As Mitch said, we delivered another solid quarter, with adjusted earnings per share of $1.66, up 14% despite the currency headwind. We grew sales by 2.1% on an organic basis, and currency translation reduced reported sales growth by 2 points in the quarter. And our adjusted operating margin increased by a full point to 11.7%. 
We realized $18 million of restructuring savings net of transition costs in the quarter, due in part to LGM's restructuring in Europe that was largely completed as of the end of Q2. And our cash generation has been strong. We've delivered $327 million of free cash flow year-to-date, up $67 million compared to the same period last year.
As we've discussed, we've increased our pace of fixed capital in IT-related spending for a few years to support our long-term organic growth and margin expansion plans, with capital spending expected to be up by about $20 million this year. And we continue to return cash to shareholders. In the first 3 quarters of the year, we repurchased roughly 2 million shares at an aggregate cost of $204 million and paid $141 million in dividends for a total of $346 million of cash returned to shareholders.
Importantly, our balance sheet remains strong, with net debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA ticking down slightly in the quarter. Our current leverage position gives us ample capacity to continue executing our disciplined capital allocation strategy, including investing in organic growth and acquisitions while continuing to return cash to shareholders. We are well positioned to take advantage of any dislocations in the market, should they occur over the next few years.
Turning to the segment results for the quarter, label and Graphic Materials sales increased by 1.2% on an organic basis driven primarily by higher volume as we've now lapped the bulk of last year's price increases. Growth in LGM's high-value categories led by specialty labels continued to outpace the growth of the base business.
And breaking down LGM's organic growth in the quarter by region, North America was roughly flat, while Western Europe was up low single digits. Emerging markets also grew at a low single-digit rate, with China up low single digits and South Asia up mid-single digits.
Adjusted operating margin for the segment was strong at 13.5%, up 120 basis points compared to the prior year, reflecting the benefit of productivity initiatives, including restructuring and material reengineering, partially offset by higher employee-related costs. The net effect of changes in price and raw material and freight input cost was neutral for the quarter.
Shifting now to Retail Branding and Information Solutions. RBIS delivered solid top line growth, up 4.1% on an organic basis, driven by faster growth in high-value categories with RFID sales up roughly 20% and external embellishments growing even faster. Our base business, adjusted for the migration of products to higher-value RFID solutions, was down low single digits. Adjusted operating margin for the segment increased 10 basis points to 11.5% as productivity gains were largely offset by long-term growth-related investments, primarily related to RFID.
Turning to the Industrial and Healthcare Materials segment. Sales were up 3.7% on an organic basis, reflecting both volume growth and higher prices. Sales for industrial categories were up low to mid-single digits driven by solid growth in auto-related categories. And health care categories grew even faster, up high single digits, with medical up in the high teens. And we made excellent progress on the margin front in IHM. Adjusted operating margin increased by 180 basis points to 11% as the benefits from higher volume and productivity more than offset higher employee-related costs. Though normal seasonality does call for sequential easing in margin for the fourth quarter, I'm confident we'll achieve the 10% we targeted for IHM for the full year.
Focusing now on our outlook for 2019. We have lowered the high end of our guidance range for adjusted earnings per share, reflecting incremental currency translation headwinds, largely offset by stronger operational results in a modestly lower tax rate compared to our previous expectations. We have reduced our outlook for full year organic sales growth to a range of 2.0% to 2.3%, which implies 2% to 3% growth for the fourth quarter.
As you know, in our short-cycle businesses, visibility to demand is very limited, and we're seeing increased variability in order patterns from month-to-month. So the low end of our organic growth outlook assumes a continuation of the 2% we've seen year-to-date, including the first few weeks of October, while the high-end reflects the fact that comparisons do get easier for us over the balance of the quarter.
We've outlined some of the other key contributing factors to our guidance on Slide 9 of our supplemental presentation materials. In particular, and just focusing on the material changes from our assumptions in July, at recent exchange rates, currency translation represents a roughly 3.5 point headwind to reported sales growth for the year, with a pretax operating income hit of $37 million and incremental of $9 million headwind relative to the $28 million we were anticipating in July.
Partially offsetting this, we now estimate that incremental pretax savings from restructuring, net of transition costs, will contribute approximately $50 million, as the teams have been executing very well against our plans and we look to deliver at the high end of our previous expectations. We've realized about $35 million of these savings in the first 3 quarters of the year. And the tax rate should come in slightly lower than our previous outlook, which I had assumed 25% at the midpoint of our guidance range.
In summary, we delivered another solid quarter in a more challenging environment, and we remain on track to deliver on our long-term objectives to achieve GDP+ growth and top quartile returns on capital, which together drives sustained growth in EVA.
And now we'll open up the call for your questions."

It softened further in August and then came back in September. We're now seeing a bit of a moderation, as Greg talked about, early October again. So a little bit more of the choppiness that we've talked through.
In North America, so just from a market perspective, in the markets, we've seen pretty consistent low single-digit growth between last year and this year. Our growth, of course, was lower than that in the first half of the year because of the share losses, which we've since believe we're on the solid path to recapturing.
And in Europe, we saw low to mid-single-digit growth last year, as you know, and the first half really no growth, pretty flat environment, and we're now seeing a little bit of a pickup low single-digit growth in Q3, mostly in Southern Europe, not north or Central Europe overall. And then in, I think, China, we saw low mid-digit last year growth, and we saw flattened first half of this year and started to see some positive growth here in Q3, mid-single digits. And South Asia, as we called out, that's where we saw a shift, and it's really ASEAN. So India continues to have strong growth, high single digits. And ASEAN, specifically Malaysia and Thailand, where we're seeing some softness, which we attribute broadly to just softer market conditions and the link between the China and U.S. trade matters.
So as far as sentiment from the customer, basically the sentiment reflects those market trends overall. So generally, the customer sentiment, we just had Labelexpo recently. It was well attended by customers, particularly from Europe. The ones in Southern Europe and Eastern Europe sounded a little bit more confident about the near-term outlook than the ones from Northern and Central Europe, specifically. Overall, a lot of excitement though about the innovations and a lot of interest coming from customers of what we can bring to the table to help together grow the market."

Yes, so overall, the speed at which we've been able to build the pipeline has been rapid, and I don't think we gave projections about what we expected, but we are hitting our ambitions on that. And as I mentioned, most of the growth in the actual pipeline is for categories outside of apparel. Specifically, the biggest growth driver of that has really been within the food category. So foods, we have quite a few programs in the pipeline that we're working.
As far as the actual growth, the growth levels, it's high in percentage terms but it's off of a very small base. So our focus here is leverage the strength that we have within the apparel segment, both from a business development as well innovation and manufacturing capabilities and identify other end markets where there are similarities to apparel that we think are right for adoption to begin to build that.
We're having some wins along the way, but a lot of this -- the revenue right now outside of apparel, a lot of them are at the pilot stage and so forth to pilot revenue. There's a couple moving to full adoptions, but it's relatively small, less than 10 programs. So a vast majority of the pipeline is still early stage. And for us, it's really the growth opportunity, particularly in the 2021, '22. '22 beyond is what we're really focused on as far as when it starts to become much more meaningful numbers."

We didn't see people trying to buy ahead of time because it was just -- there was tentativeness and people in general were just slow to move overall. When we look at what's going on, our growth trends when we talk to other players in the segment suppliers, people who provide threads and so forth, what they're seeing is similar to what we are seeing.
Now, when you talk about actual at the retail and brand level, you have some retailers, some brands that are doing phenomenally well and others that are struggling. So there was a bit of a mixed bag, if you will, as far as what's going on in retail environment. So we didn't really see inventory builds or anything. If you look at the inventory trends, inventory has dropped dramatically in '18, built up a little bit at the end of last year, beginning of this year, but then have already started depleting again. And these are levels that are near all-time lows right now as far as inventory levels, which I think just shows retailers and brands focused on the need for faster supply chains and lower inventory levels in this more uncertain environment, which just further reinforces the adoption of RFID."

We've been -- we're out in front of many companies, especially packagers are making sustainability a priority, and I'd say the first wave of that was more around improving sustainability of our own business, dramatically reduce greenhouse gases by 30% over the last number of years, buying more sustainably sourced raw materials, such as more than 90% of our paper that we procure is sustainably certified, such as Forest Stewardship Council. So that has been the focus, and now more recently we've been shifting more on making sure that our products make recyclability much more easy and efficient.
