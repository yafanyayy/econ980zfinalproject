We enjoyed a solid fourth quarter, the results and comparisons to the prior periods are straightforward for the most part. As a result, I will go through them briefly to leave more time for my thoughts on the business segments, our outlook for 2019 and your questions. 
I also think you will find the press release and the additional presentation on our website fulsome and helpful. 
So earlier today, we reported fourth quarter revenue of $10 billion -- $10.38 billion, earnings from continuing operations of $909 million, and earnings of $3.07 per fully diluted share. This is a significant improvement against the fourth quarter of 2017, which was adversely impacted by a discrete $119 million increase in the tax provision as a result of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Even after adjusting for the adverse impact in Q4 2017, EPS was up $0.07 and earnings from continuing operations were up $154 million. Earnings per share at $3.07 also beat consensus by $0.09. Revenue and operating earnings were largely consistent with consensus. Most of the difference comes from a lower tax provision and the sum of lower share count. 
So all in all, a solid quarter with good performance, particularly compared to the year-ago quarter as well as the third quarter of 2018. For the year, we had fully diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $11.22. This was also $0.09 above consensus. Revenue of $36.2 billion was up over 2017 by $5.2 billion. On an organic basis, excluding CSRA, revenue was up $1.5 billion. Revenue was up across each of our reporting segments. Operating earnings of $4.5 billion were up 229 -- $221 million or 5.2% over 2017. Earnings from continuing operations were up $446 million or 15.3% over 2017. Importantly, earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.66 above 2017. All in all, 2018 was a very good year, a year of growth and year of important quarter intakes that left the company well positioned for 2019. 
I will review the full year and the quarters on a year-over-year basis for the group's without reference to sequential comparisons. On a sequential basis, suffice it to say that we had more revenue, higher operating earnings, higher earnings from continuing operations and higher earnings per share than in the third quarter 2018. So let me discuss each group and provide some color where appropriate. 
First, Aerospace. Aerospace revenue of $2.7 billion was up against the year-ago quarter by an impressive $722 million, that is 36.4%. This was attributable in large part to the delivery of 9 G500s in the quarter, and also, a strong fourth quarter in the service centers. For the full year, revenue of $8.46 billion was up $326 million or 4%. Operating earnings of $1.49 billion were down $87 million on lower operating margins. The lower operating earnings were attributable to poor performance in the completions business at Jet Aviation, the mix shift at Gulfstream and cost attendant to the introduction of the G500. This time last year, we told you to expect revenues between $8.35 billion to $8.4 billion with a margin rate of 18%, leading to forecasted earnings of $1.5 billion. We finished the year with more-than-forecasted revenue at 17.6% margin, a -- and $1.49 billion of operating earnings. All in all, very close to the forecast we gave you this time last year. On the order front, activity in the quarter was good and the pipeline activity remains robust. The book-to-bill at Aerospace in the fourth quarter was $0.08 to $1-denominated. You can see more information on deliveries and orders in the Exhibit J to the press release. We expect the G600 to be certified this tear although the exact timing is hard to predict given the impact of the government shutdown on the FAA. But we fully expect certification of the 600 this half. 
The pacing item for deliveries of the G500 and 600 will be our ability to deliver in itself. We have that line in good order. Costs are increasingly under control and we are producing very good quality. But we had to restart the supply chain that is on dormant with the thought filing of the Nordam bankruptcy proceedings. That has impacted rate and our ability to keep schedule. We expect all schedule issues to be behind us by mid-year. As a result, you will see accelerating G500 deliveries as the year progresses and our ability to provide nacelle to support G600 deliveries in the second half as well. 
Next, combat systems. At combat revenue of $1.74 billion was almost the same as the year-ago quarter. The same holds true for operating earnings of $251 million and an operating margin of 15%. For the full year, revenue of $6.24 billion was up $292 million, just short of 5%. Operating earnings of $952 million were up $25 million on a 40 basis point contraction in margin, largely related to mix shift. By the way, this performance is reasonably consistent with the forecast we provided at this time last year. We enjoyed somewhat better revenues than our initial forecast, which was an increase of $200 million to $250 million over 2017. We actually grew revenue $292 million. We forecast operating earnings of $970 million and came in at $962 million, an $8 million shortfall largely attributable to the diplomatic issues that slowed production of the vehicle program in Canada in the fourth quarter. We continue to see nice order activity in this group with fourth quarter orders of $2.19 million, a book-to-bill of 1.3:1 in the quarter and [ one-to-one ] for the year. Tank orders alone are in excess of $1 billion. 
We also continue to have significant international opportunities, particularly in Europe. We-have been negotiating with Spain with respect to a program valued at $2 billion for piranha vehicles. And of note, we acquired FWW, a qualified maintenance and service provider to the German Army and other international customers to enhance our position in the key market. FWW will become part of European Land Systems. 
In our U.S. market, our Army customer is modernizing and providing a growing demand across our combat vehicle and munitions business. In short, this group had quite positive revenue growth, continued to shift to a strong margin performance and had very good order activity. 
Next, Marine Systems. This is a really good news story across the board. Marine revenue of $2.3 billion was up $237 million, a stunning 11.5% over the year-ago quarter. Operating earnings of $213 million were up $46 million against the year-ago quarter, a 27.5% increase on a 120 basis point improvement in operating margins. This is very strong operating leverage in a growth environment. By the way, the sequential comparison's equally impressive. For the full year, revenue of $8.5 billion was up $498 million, in excess of 6%. Operating earnings for the year of $751 million were up $76 million, over 11%, on a 40 basis point improvement in operating margin. At this time last year, we told you to expect revenue of $8.4 billion to $8.5 billion, and operating earnings of $735 million to $745 million. We came in at the higher end of the revenue range. Operating earnings of $761 million outperformed our forecast by $16 million to $26 million. 
In response to the significant increased demand from our Navy customer across all 3 of our shipyards, we continue to invest in each of our yards with particular emphasis on Electric Boat, to prepare for increased production associated with the Block V of the Virginia submarine program and the new Columbia ballistic-missile submarine. As you may recall, Block V is a significant upgrade in size and performance requiring additional manufacturing capacity. 
As you know, we have also increased our internal training programs as well as our public-private partnerships with Connecticut and Rhode Island to meet our need for skilled trades. At $243 million, CapEx in 2018 from Marine was double its depreciation for the year. For 2019, we again expect the Marine segment to command the larger share of our capital budget as we work toward satisfying the nation's needs for its critical malleable systems. So suffice it to say, we are poised to support our Navy customers as they increase the size of the fleet. 
As you are well aware, the Information Systems and Technology group has been realigned and reshaped into 2 separate segments. Mission Systems, the large C4ISR business and GDIT, a leading provider of information solutions to the central government and its agencies. That was supplemented in the second quarter of 2018 by the acquisition of CSRA. I am going to ask Jason to interject some comparison data here that you might find relevant and helpful."
274561,597394105,1642789,"General Dynamics Corporation, Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Jan 30, 2019",2019-01-30,"Earnings Calls","General Dynamics Corporation","Executives","On that note, let me make some comments on GDIT and Mission Systems performance in 2018. We originally guided the full year revenue for the former IS&T business group between $9.3 billion and $9.4 billion, and operating earnings of approximately $1,030,00",179,"On that note, let me make some comments on GDIT and Mission Systems performance in 2018. We originally guided the full year revenue for the former IS&T business group between $9.3 billion and $9.4 billion, and operating earnings of approximately $1,030,000,000. If we look at how Mission Systems and GDIT, excluding CSRA, did for the year, they combined for $9.325 billion in sales. So in line with our expectations and that includes an organic growth rate of 4.3% for GDIT, not withstanding the impact of several divestitures during the year. From an operating earnings perspective, they were actually closer to $1,050,000,000 on a combined basis so somewhat better than we had expected. So all in all, a solid year for both businesses. As I alluded to, we also completed several portfolio-shaping activities in our GDIT segment during the year. These included the sale of the commercial health products business, CSRA's SEDAR business and our public-facing call centers. These divestitures of more than $1 billion of annualized sales enhance the groups focus on high-end solutions and high value-added customer needs."
274561,597394105,1642789,"General Dynamics Corporation, Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Jan 30, 2019",2019-01-30,"Earnings Calls","General Dynamics Corporation","Executives","So let's first address information technology. Information technology enjoyed revenue in the quarter of $2.38 billion and operating earnings of $194 million with an operating margin of 8.1%. Since the numbers for the fourth quarter at 2017 did not include",1017,"So let's first address information technology. Information technology enjoyed revenue in the quarter of $2.38 billion and operating earnings of $194 million with an operating margin of 8.1%. Since the numbers for the fourth quarter at 2017 did not include CSRA comparison to the year-ago quarter are not particularly meaningful. However, sequentially, revenue is up $75 million, operating earnings up $37 million and operating margin up 130 basis points. Evidence of our continuing ability to extract cost synergies here. 
For the year, revenue was $8.27 billion, and operating earnings were $608 million with a 7.4% margin. Once again, annual comparisons do not offer meaningful perspective since the prior year did not include CSRA. 
Next Mission Systems. Revenue in the quarter was essentially flat against the year-ago quarter, while operating earnings of $181 million were $6 million lower than the fourth quarter last year on a 40 basis point decrement in operating margin. 
For the year, revenue of $4.73 billion was up $245 million or 5.5%. Operating earnings of $659 million were up $21 million or 3.3% due to a 30 basis point decline in operating margin, driven in part by mix. Book-to-bill for the year was somewhat above onetime in the end of the year with a modestly higher backlog at $5.3 billion. 
So on this call last year, on a companywide basis our forecast for 2018 was to expect revenue of $32.35 billion to $32.45 billion. Operating earnings of $4.25 billion and an operating margin of 13.1%. As you know, we wound up $36.2 billion on an organic basis. But on an organic basis, revenue was up $1.5 billion, $500 million more than forecast. 
At the EPS line, we forecasted $10.90 to $11, and came in at $11.22, including the transaction cost related to CSRA, which were about $0.20 per share. 
So let me provide our forecast for 2019 initially by business group and then on a companywide rollout. In Aerospace, we expect 2019 revenue to be about $9.7 billion, but more than $1.2 billion on deliveries of approximately 145 business jets. Operating earnings will be slightly in excess of $1.5 billion with an operating margin rate of approximately 15.5%. The margin rate is lower than 2018 as a result of mix shift as well as a modest increase in preowned sales, which again generally carry no margin. 
So revenue will be back-end loaded as will the margin rate. In general, the quarterly spread in revenue preparation will something like [ $2.2 million, $2.3 billion, $2.4 billion and $2.8 billion ]. Operating margins in the first 2 quarterss should be in the [ mid-14 ] area, strengthening in Q3 moving well over [ 17 ] in Q4. 
We believe that last year will be the low point operating earnings during this transition training models with modest earnings increases in 2019 and 2020 and significant earnings traction thereafter. 
In Combat, we expect revenue to be between $6.5 billion and $6.6 billion, a $250 million to $350 million increase over 2018 with operating earnings up $965 million to $975 million, slightly better than last year. Here again, look for both revenue and earnings and margin rate of growth quarter-over-quarter during the year with a particularly strong fourth quarter. We continue to see solid growth for this business with orders for the Abraham and solid demand for Stryker vehicles in munitions. 
We see domestic volumes to expanding faster than our international business. The Marine Group is expected to have revenue of approximately $9 billion, a 6% or $500 million increase over 2018. Operating earnings in 2019 are anticipated to be about $770 million with an operating margin rate of around 8.5%. 
We anticipate growth at each of the yards with mix being reflected in margins. We continue to see long-term growth with an expanding need for submarines, service combatant and support ships and overhaul work. Our biggest opportunity here is around outperforming the forecasted margin rate. We respectively expect Information Technology revenue in 2019 of approximately $8.3 billion, consistent with 2018 with margins in the 7.5% range. The slight improvement over 2018's performance. 
To the plus side, we have a full year CSRA offset by the divestitures of the call centers and CEDA businesses, which represented just over $1 billion of prior year  revenues. We see the business excellent progress towards optimizing the acquisition is we combined teams, deeply integrate business systems, consolidate facilities and increase our value proposition to diverse, defense intel and federal civilian agencies. 
Information systems, we expect revenue in 2019 somewhere between 8 -- $4.8 million and $4.9 billion, an increase of just over $100 million, or between 2% to 3%. We see strong growth in our maritime, cyper and space-related markets, with fairly studied top line in our core tactical network incumbencies. 
We anticipate operating earnings up modestly over last year with margins in the -- between mid-And high 30s. Once again, building throughout the year. So for 2019, companywide all of this rolls up to approximately $38.5 billion of revenue, up by 6% over 2018. Operating earnings of $4.5 billion and an operating margin of around 11.7%. This gives us an EPS forecast of $11.60 to $11.70 per fully diluted share. 
I may emphasize that this plan is purely from operations. It assumes a low-18% tax provision and assumes we buy only in are shares to hold the share steady with year-end figures so as to avoid dilution from option exercises. So much like last year, beating our EPS guidance must come from the outperforming the operating plan, achieving a lower effective tax rate and the effective deployment of capital. With respect to the quarterly progression for EPS, the first quarter should be seasonally low at about 20% of the full year's results. The second quarter should be more than 10% better than that and the third quarter should account for over 25% of EPS and the final quarter of the year should represent about 1/3 of our EPS. 
Now let me turn this over to Jason for additional commentary around cash backlog and other items and then we'll take your questions."
274561,597394105,1642789,"General Dynamics Corporation, Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Jan 30, 2019",2019-01-30,"Earnings Calls","General Dynamics Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Phebe. Our net interest expense in the quarter was $112 million, bringing interest expense for the year to $356 million. That compares to $27 million and $103 million in the comparable periods of 2017. The increase in 2018 is due to the roughly",702,"Thank you, Phebe. Our net interest expense in the quarter was $112 million, bringing interest expense for the year to $356 million. That compares to $27 million and $103 million in the comparable periods of 2017. The increase in 2018 is due to the roughly $10 billion of debt we issued to finance the acquisition of CSRA. 
We repaid approximately $1.7 billion of this debt during the year and will continue to prioritize paying down debt consistent with our mid-A credit-rating. We ended the year with $850 million of commercial paper outstanding, and our next scheduled fixed-debt maturity is in the second quarter of 2020. For 2019 we expect interest expense to be approximately $430 million, reflecting a full year of the notes issued in 2018. Our effective tax rate was 19.7% for the quarter and 17.8% for the year, in line with our previous guidance. 
Looking ahead to 2019, we expect a full year effective tax rate in the low-18% range, between 18% and 18.5%. This is slightly higher than 2018 but recall in 2018, we took advantage of a onetime benefit provided by tax reform and made a $255 million discretionary pension contribution, which lowered the tax rate by approximately 75 basis points. Looking at capital deployment, we paid $274 million in dividends in the fourth quarter, bringing the full year to $1.1 billion. We also took advantage of the market decline in December by purchasing our shares to a greater degree than planned. In the quarter, we purchased 7.6 million shares of our stock for $1.3 billion. Bringing the full year to 10.1 million shares for $1.8 billion. 
Looking ahead, while debt repayment will continue to be a priority as I mentioned, we continue to have the flexibility to adjust our capital deployment in response to changing market conditions, as we did in December. 
Moving on to our pension plans, we contributed approximately $570 million to our plans in 2018, including the discretionary contribution. For 2019, we expect that amount to be approximately $200 million, to be contributed mostly during the third quarter. We've also ramped up our capital expenditures, which were almost 2% of sales for the year, that's up 60% from 2017 as we invest to support the growth of our businesses, particularly Marine Systems and Aerospace. For 2019, we expect capital expenditures to rise to 3% of sales, driven by the continued investment in the Columbia-class program. 
Our free cash flow conversion rate for the quarter was 200%, bringing our rate for the year to 78% excluding the discretionary pension contribution and this is below our typical 100% conversion target. 
If you're following the headcounts out of Canada, you know there are discussions taking place between the Canadian government and their customer on our armored vehicle supply contract. As a result of these discussions, we've experience payment delays that significantly impacted the free cash flow we expected last year. To be clear, this is a timing issue, and we expect to receive the delayed payments this year. 
Assuming the resolution of this matter, we expect the cash conversion rate well in excess of 100% in 2019 and looking ahead, we expect cash performance throughout the planning horizon to be very strong, in our typical 90% to 100% range. 
One last point on backlog. We ended the year with total backlog of approximately $68 billion, that's up 7.5% over this time last year. That increase came in spite of a headwind from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which reduced the backlog by $840 million, $700 million of which impacted the Combat Systems group. 
Beyond firm backlog, our total potential contract value, which include options and IDIQ arrangements, increased by an impressive 17.5% over the end of last year, including the multibillion CHS-5 IDIQ award at Mission Systems. In addition, we entered into a $1.1 billion contract with an existing corporate customer for a multiairplane multiyear order that requires their board approval this quarter. Once approved, that order will move into the firm backlog. So these awards along with the firm backlog provide a nice foundation for the continued growth we see ahead. Howard, that concludes my remarks, and I'll turn it back over to you for Q&A."

In a growing environment last year, they had one-to-one book-to-bill. They also had a 75% win rate and a $26 billion pipeline. This management team is performing the cost synergies beautifully and frankly is a bit of ahead of schedule. By the way, this is a very energetic, innovative management team that is really making GDIT into the workplace of preference. And in this market, people are absolutely critical, important across the board, but people here truly matter. I might also add the cash performance on this business is outstanding. Last year, they generated over 100% in net income in cash and will continue that this year and for the years to come. So what we see this year, despite that large backlog, despite the large win rate and book-to-bill is this is simply a question of timing, when the contracts move from the backlog into sales and you'll see the growth rate increase in the third quarter, fourth quarter and then significantly next year. This is just a question of the timing of several hundred contracts moving from backlog into sales. That also is impacting the margin rate. So I'm very confident in the ability of this business to perform. They are going to outperform their cost synergies. They are growing great cash performance so in the instance right now, its simply a question of timing."
274561,597394105,1642789,"General Dynamics Corporation, Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Jan 30, 2019",2019-01-30,"Earnings Calls","General Dynamics Corporation","Executives","And David if you want me -- I'll add a little bit of additional color on your inference around margin rates. If you look at the 7.4% margin rate that we reported for the year for the group, if you normalize that for the amortization burden that came with",415,"And David if you want me -- I'll add a little bit of additional color on your inference around margin rates. If you look at the 7.4% margin rate that we reported for the year for the group, if you normalize that for the amortization burden that came with the CSRA acquisition and take that out, you actually end up with a margin rate of 9.6% for the year. So that's a couple of hundred basis points better than we reported and about 110 basis points better than the year-ago 2017 full year rate. That's really driven by the CSRA contribution from an operations perspective, if you will. So they actually contributed approximately 10.9% incremental margins to the core business, excluding that amortization benefit. Now when you look ahead to next year, when you take the puts and takes on the revenue side between the additional quarter of CSRA volume offset by the divestitures, we are nominally up. Let's just call it notionally flat, but nominally up. So even though we do have because of the accelerating amortization schedule that we have for this business, even though we do have a somewhat declining quarterly amortization burden, the fact that we have 4 full quarters of amortization versus a flattish-to-slightly-nose up total top line is actually, perhaps, counterintuitively a little bit of a margin drag for next year. It will start to accelerate from the following year once we have a follow-up year-on-year comparison. So if you think of that amortization is really call it a 20 -- I'll call it a 20-ish basis point drag. And the other part of it is we do have synergies, as Phebe mentioned, that are accelerating. So I call that may be an 80 to 90-basis-point assist as we go forward, and we'll continue to accelerate after that. And then from a mix perspective, as you alluded to, when we talked about this for sometime after the acquisition, we did forecast, call it, 100 to 150 basis point contraction overall in the incremental CSRA margins over the next 3, 4 years. So call it 50 basis points or so from that. So if you take the 20-ish basis points on amortization, and we call it 50 basis points on mix, offset by a positive 80 to 90 basis point improvement from synergies, you get, call it, 10 to 20 basis point net improvement for the year. And we would exceed accelerating after that. So hopefully, that color is helpful."

So where deliveries may be further out in the delivery queue and spread out in the backlog. So as I mentioned, we did have in fourth quarter a fairly large contract signed up with an existing commercial customer. It was valued at just over $1 billion. It's a multiaircraft, multiyear arrangement that spans out over several years. That did not go into the firm backlog because that order is actually subject to that customers board approval coming up here this quarter. So we expect that to happen this quarter, and we'll move into the firm backlog and be counted as traditional order the time, but given the maturity of that and where it was in the quarter, that's why reported in the, as we typically are conservative on these notions, we put it in the potential contract value bucket versus in a firm backlog til we get to that firm order."

So I will see a little bit of slowness on that on that the delivery of nacelle but as we get into the second half, that will have completely resolved, and we will be in full-rate production throughout the supply chain. So quite pleased with that. The margin compression, it has been something we've been talking to you all for some time about. As you all know, the first lot of airplanes, in this case we are talking about the G500 carry very little margins. Those airplanes will ramp up, continue to ramp up that production in first quarter, second quarter and as we move from that initial lot to carry those lower margins, then you'll see -- we will see some margin expansion on that line. The 600 will come in at a slightly higher entry margins. Simply because of the disproportionate amount of test cost and R&D formed by the 500. And then we will see with respect to margins. The completion business at Jet, we had problems this year really on the operating side. We have fixed that. And going forward, we are comfortable that they will do better this year."

The results in comparisons with prior periods are straightforward for the most part. As a result, I will go through them briefly to leave more time for my thoughts on the business segments, our outlook for 2019 and your questions.
I also think you will find the press release and the additional presentation on our website fulsome and helpful.
So earlier today, we reported fourth quarter revenue of $10 billion -- $10.38 billion, earnings from continuing operations of $909 million, and earnings of $3.07 per fully diluted share. This is a significant improvement against the fourth quarter of 2017, which was adversely impacted by a discrete $119 million increase in the tax provision as a result of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Even after adjusting for the adverse impact in Q4 2017, EPS was up $0.07 and earnings from continuing operations were up $154 million. Earnings per share at $3.07 also beat consensus by $0.09. Revenue and operating earnings were largely consistent with consensus. Most of the difference comes from a lower tax provision and a somewhat lower share count.
So all in all, a solid quarter with good performance, particularly compared to the year-ago quarter as well as the third quarter of 2018. For the year, we had fully diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $11.22. This was also $0.09 above consensus. Revenue of $36.2 billion was up over 2017 by $5.2 billion. On an organic basis, excluding CSRA, revenue was up $1.5 billion. Revenue was up across each of our reporting segments. Operating earnings of $4.5 billion were up $221 million or 5.2% over 2017. Earnings from continuing operations were up $446 million or 15.3% over 2017. Importantly, earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.66 above 2017. All in all, 2018 was a very good year, a year of growth and a year of important order intakes that left the company well positioned for 2019.
I will review the full year and the quarters on a year-over-year basis for the groups without reference to sequential comparisons. On a sequential basis, suffice it to say that we had more revenue, higher operating earnings, higher earnings from continuing operations and higher earnings per share than in the third quarter 2018. So let me discuss each group and provide some color where appropriate.
First, Aerospace. Aerospace revenue of $2.7 billion was up against the year-ago quarter by an impressive $722 million, that is 36.4%. This was attributable in large part to the delivery of 9 G500s in the quarter and also a strong fourth quarter in the service centers. For the full year, revenue of $8.46 billion was up $326 million or 4%. Operating earnings of $1.49 billion were down $87 million on lower operating margins. The lower operating earnings were attributable to poor performance in the completions business at Jet Aviation, the mix shift at Gulfstream and cost attendant to the introduction of the G500. This time last year, we told you to expect revenue between $8.35 billion to $8.4 billion with a margin rate of 18%, leading to forecasted earnings of $1.5 billion. We finished the year with more than forecasted revenue at 17.6% margin, a -- and $1.49 billion of operating earnings. All in all, very close to the forecast we gave you this time last year.
On the order front, activity in the quarter was good, and the pipeline activity remains robust. The book-to-bill at Aerospace in the fourth quarter was $0.8 to $1 denominated. You can see more information on deliveries and orders in the Exhibit J to the press release. We expect the G600 to be certified this year, although the exact timing is hard to predict given the impact of the government shutdown on the FAA. But we fully expect certification of the 600 this half.
The pacing item for deliveries of the G500 and 600 will be our ability to deliver in itself. We have that line in good order. Costs are increasingly under control, and we are producing very good quality. But we had to restart the supply chain that is on dormant with the thought filing of the Nordam bankruptcy proceedings. That has impacted rate and our ability to keep schedule. We expect all schedule issues to be behind us by mid-year. As a result, you will see accelerating G500 deliveries as the year progresses and our ability to provide nacelle to support G600 deliveries in the second half as well.
Next, Combat Systems. At Combat, revenue of $1.74 billion was almost the same as the year-ago quarter. The same holds true for operating earnings of $261 million and an operating margin of 15%. For the full year, revenue of $6.24 billion was up $292 million, just short of 5%. Operating earnings of $962 million were up $25 million on a 40 basis point contraction in margin, largely related to mix shift. By the way, this performance is reasonably consistent with the forecast we provided at this time last year. We enjoyed somewhat better revenue than our initial forecast, which was an increase of $200 million to $250 million over 2017. We actually grew revenue $292 million. We forecast operating earnings of $970 million and came in at $962 million, an $8 million shortfall largely attributable to the diplomatic issues that slowed production of the vehicle program in Canada in the fourth quarter.
We continue to see nice order activity in this group with fourth quarter orders of $2.19 billion, a book-to-bill of 1.3:1 in the quarter and 1:1 for the year. Tank orders alone are in excess of $1 billion.
We also continue to have significant international opportunities, particularly in Europe. We've been negotiating with Spain with respect to a program valued at $2 billion for Piranha vehicles. And of note, we acquired FWW, a qualified maintenance and service provider to the German Army and other international customers to enhance our position in the key market. FWW will become part of European Land Systems.
In our U.S. market, our Army customer is modernizing and providing a growing demand across our combat vehicles and munitions business. In short, this group had quite positive revenue growth, continued its history of strong margin performance and had very good order activity.
Next, Marine Systems. This is a really good news story across the board. Marine revenue of $2.3 billion was up $237 million, a stunning 11.5% over the year-ago quarter. Operating earnings of $213 million were up $46 million against the year-ago quarter, a 27.5% increase on a 120 basis point improvement in operating margins. This is very strong operating leverage in a growth environment. By the way, the sequential comparison is equally impressive. For the full year, revenue of $8.5 billion was up $498 million, in excess of 6%. Operating earnings for the year of $761 million were up $76 million, over 11% on a 40 basis point improvement in operating margin. At this time last year, we told you to expect revenue of $8.4 billion to $8.5 billion, and operating earnings of $735 million to $745 million. We came in at the higher end of the revenue range. Operating earnings of $761 million outperformed our forecast by $16 million to $26 million.
In response to the significant increased demand from our Navy customer across all 3 of our shipyards, we continue to invest in each of our yards with particular emphasis on Electric Boat, to prepare for increased production associated with the Block V of the Virginia submarine program and the new Columbia ballistic-missile submarine. As you may recall, Block V is a significant upgrade in size and performance requiring additional manufacturing capacity.
As you know, we have also increased our internal training programs as well as our public-private partnerships with Connecticut and Rhode Island to meet our need for skilled trades. At $243 million, CapEx in 2018 from Marine was more than double its depreciation for the year. For 2019, we again expect the Marine segment to command the larger share of our capital budget as we work toward satisfying the nation's need for its critical naval systems. So suffice it to say, we are poised to support our Navy customer as they increase the size of the fleet.
As you are aware, the Information and Systems Technology group has been realigned and reshaped into 2 separate segments. Mission Systems, the large C4ISR business and GDIT, a leading provider of information solutions to the federal government and its agencies. That was supplemented in the second quarter of 2018 by the acquisition of CSRA. I'm going to ask Jason to interject some comparison data here that you might find relevant and helpful."

We originally guided to full year revenue for the former IS&T business group between $9.3 billion and $9.4 billion, and operating earnings of approximately $1,030,000,000. If we look at how Mission Systems and GDIT, excluding CSRA, did for the year, they combined for $9.325 billion in sales, so in line with our expectations. And that includes an organic growth rate of 4.3% for GDIT, not withstanding the impact of several divestitures during the year. From an operating earnings perspective, they were actually closer to $1,050,000,000 on a combined basis, so somewhat better than we had expected. So all in all, a solid year for both businesses. As I alluded to, we also completed several portfolio-shaping activities in our GDIT segment during the year. These included the sale of a commercial health products business, CSRA's SETA business and our public-facing call centers. These divestitures of more than $1 billion of annualized sales enhance the group's focus on high-end solutions and high value-added customer needs."
274561,597394105,1643029,"General Dynamics Corporation, Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Jan 30, 2019",2019-01-30,"Earnings Calls","General Dynamics Corporation","Executives","So let's first address information technology. Information technology enjoyed revenue in the quarter of $2.38 billion and operating earnings of $194 million with an operating margin of 8.1%. Since the numbers for the fourth quarter of 2017 did not include",1020,"So let's first address information technology. Information technology enjoyed revenue in the quarter of $2.38 billion and operating earnings of $194 million with an operating margin of 8.1%. Since the numbers for the fourth quarter of 2017 did not include CSRA, comparison to the year-ago quarter are not particularly meaningful. However, sequentially, revenue is up $75 million, operating earnings up $37 million and operating margin up 130 basis points. Evidence of our continuing ability to extract cost synergies here.
For the year, revenue was $8.27 billion, and operating earnings were $608 million with a 7.4% margin. Once again, annual comparisons do not offer meaningful perspective since the prior year did not include CSRA.
Next, Mission Systems. Revenue in the quarter was essentially flat against the year-ago quarter, while operating earnings of $181 million were $6 million lower than the fourth quarter last year on a 40 basis point decrement in operating margin.
For the year, revenue of $4.73 billion was up $245 million or 5.5%. Operating earnings of $659 million were up $21 million or 3.3% due to a 30 basis point decline in operating margin, driven in part by mix. Book-to-bill for the year was somewhat above 1x in the end of the year with a modestly higher backlog at $5.3 billion.
So on this call last year, on a company-wide basis, our forecast for 2018 was to expect revenue of $32.35 billion to $32.45 billion, operating earnings of $4.25 billion and an operating margin of 13.1%. As you know, we wound up for $36.2 billion on an organic basis. But on an organic basis, revenue was up $1.5 billion, $500 million more than forecast.
At the EPS line, we forecasted $10.90 to $11, and came in at $11.22, including the transaction cost related to CSRA, which were about $0.20 per share.
So let me provide our forecast for 2019 initially by business group and then on a company-wide rollout. In Aerospace, we expect 2019 revenue to be about $9.7 billion, a lot more than $1.2 billion on deliveries of approximately 145 business jets. Operating earnings will be slightly in excess of $1.5 billion with an operating margin rate of approximately 15.5%. The margin rate is lower than 2018 as a result of mix shift as well as a modest increase in preowned sales, which, again, generally carry no margin.
So revenue will be back-end loaded as will the margin rate. In general, the quarterly spread in revenue progression will look something like $2.2 billion, $2.3 billion, $2.4 billion and $2.8 billion. Operating margin in the first 2 quarters should be in the mid-14% area, strengthening in Q3 and moving to well over 17% in Q4.
We believe that last year will be the low point in operating earnings during this transition to our new models with modest earnings increase in 2019 and 2020 and significant earnings traction thereafter.
In Combat, we expect revenue to be between $6.5 billion and $6.6 billion, a $250 million to $350 million increase over 2018 with operating earnings up $965 million to $975 million, slightly better than last year. Here again, look for both revenue, earnings and margin rate to grow quarter-over-quarter during the year with a particularly strong fourth quarter. We continue to see solid growth for this business with orders for the Abram and solid demand for Stryker vehicles in munitions.
We see domestic volumes expanding faster than our international business. The Marine Group is expected to have revenue of approximately $9 billion, a 6% or $500 million increase over 2018. Operating earnings in 2019 are anticipated to be about $770 million with an operating margin rate, around 8.5%.
We anticipate growth at each of the yards with mix being reflected in margins. We continue to see long-term growth with an expanding need for submarines, surface combatant, support ships and overhaul work. Our biggest opportunity here is around outperforming the forecasted margin rate. We respect -- we expect Information Technology revenue in 2019 of approximately $8.3 billion, consistent with 2018 with margins in the 7.5% range, a slight improvement over 2018's performance.
To the plus side, we have a full year CSRA offset by the divestitures of the call centers and SETA businesses, which represented just over $1 billion of prior year revenues. We see the business making excellent progress toward optimizing the acquisition as we combine teams, deeply integrate business systems, consolidate facilities and increased our value proposition to diverse defense intel and federal civilian agencies.
For Mission Systems, we expect revenue in 2019 somewhere between $4.8 billion and $4.9 billion, an increase of just over $100 million, or between 2% to 3%. We see strong growth in our maritime, cyber and space-related markets, with fairly steady top line in our core tactical network incumbencies.
We anticipating operating earnings up modestly over last year with margins in the mid -- between mid- and high 13s, once again, building throughout the year. So for 2019, company-wide, all of this rolls up to approximately $38.5 billion of revenue, up by 6% over 2018. Operating earnings of $4.5 billion and an operating margin of around 11.7%. This gives us an EPS forecast of $11.60 to $11.70 per fully diluted share.
I may emphasize that this plan is purely from operations. It assumes a low 18% tax provision and assumes we buy only enough shares to hold the share count steady with year-end figure so as to avoid dilution from option exercises. So much like last year, beating our EPS guidance must come from outperforming the operating plan, achieving a lower effective tax rate and the effective deployment of capital. With respect to the quarterly progression for EPS, the first quarter should be seasonally low at about 20% of the full year's results. The second quarter should be more than 10% better than that and the third quarter should account for over 25% of EPS and the final quarter of the year could represent about 1/3 of our EPS.
So now let me turn this over to Jason for additional commentary around cash, backlog and other items, and then we'll take your questions."
274561,597394105,1643029,"General Dynamics Corporation, Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Jan 30, 2019",2019-01-30,"Earnings Calls","General Dynamics Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Phebe. Our net interest expense in the quarter was $112 million, bringing interest expense for the year to $356 million. That compares to $27 million and $103 million in the comparable periods of 2017.

That compares to $27 million and $103 million in the comparable periods of 2017. The increase in 2018 is due to the roughly $10 billion of debt we issued to finance the acquisition of CSRA.
We repaid approximately $1.7 billion of this debt during the year and will continue to prioritize paying down debt consistent with our mid-A credit rating. We ended the year with $850 million of commercial paper outstanding, and our next scheduled fixed debt maturity is in the second quarter of 2020. For 2019, we expect interest expense to be approximately $430 million, reflecting a full year of the notes issued in 2018. Our effective tax rate was 19.7% for the quarter and 17.8% for the year, in line with our previous guidance.
Looking ahead to 2019, we expect a full year effective tax rate in the low 18% range, between 18% and 18.5%. This is slightly higher than 2018, but recall, in 2018, we took advantage of a onetime benefit provided by tax reform and made a $255 million discretionary pension contribution, which lowered the tax rate by approximately 75 basis points. Looking at capital deployment, we paid $274 million in dividends in the fourth quarter, bringing the full year to $1.1 billion. We also took advantage of the market decline in December by purchasing our shares to a greater degree than planned. In the quarter, we purchased 7.6 million shares of our stock for $1.3 billion, bringing the full year to 10.1 million shares for $1.8 billion.
Looking ahead, while debt repayment will continue to be a priority, as I mentioned, we continue to have the flexibility to adjust our capital deployment in response to changing market conditions, as we did in December.
Moving on to our pension plans, we contributed approximately $570 million to our plans in 2018, including the discretionary contribution. For 2019, we expect that amount to be approximately $200 million to be contributed mostly during the third quarter. We've also ramped up our capital expenditures, which were almost 2% of sales for the year, that's up 60% from 2017 as we invest to support the growth of our businesses, particularly Marine Systems and Aerospace. For 2019, we expect capital expenditures to rise to 3% of sales, driven by the continued investment in the Columbia-class program.
Our free cash flow conversion rate for the quarter was 200%, bringing our rate for the year to 78% excluding the discretionary pension contribution, and this is below our typical 100% conversion target.
If you're following the headlines out of Canada, you know there are discussions taking place between the Canadian government and their customer on our armored vehicle supply contract. As a result of these discussions, we've experienced payment delays that significantly impacted the free cash flow we expected last year. To be clear, this is a timing issue, and we expect to receive the delayed payments this year.
Assuming the resolution of this matter, we expect the cash conversion rate well in excess of 100% in 2019, and looking ahead, we expect cash performance throughout the planning horizon to be very strong in our typical 90% to 100% range.
And one last point on backlog. We ended the year with total backlog of approximately $68 billion, that's up 7.5% over this time last year. That increase came in spite of a headwind from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which reduced the backlog by $840 million, $700 million of which impacted the Combat Systems group.
Beyond the firm backlog, our total potential contract value, which includes options and IDIQ arrangements, increased by an impressive 17.5% over the end of last year, including the multibillion dollar CHS-5 IDIQ award at Mission Systems. In addition, we entered into a $1.1 billion contract with an existing corporate customer for a multi-airplane multiyear order that requires their board approval this quarter. Once approved, that order will move into the firm backlog. So these awards along with the firm backlog provide a nice foundation for the continued growth we see ahead. Howard, that concludes my remarks, and I'll turn it back over to you for the Q&A."

By the way, this is a very energetic, innovative management team that is really making GDIT into the workplace of preference. And in this market, people are absolutely critical. They're important across the board, but people here truly matter. I might also add the cash performance on this business is outstanding. Last year, they generated over 100% in net income in cash and will continue that this year and for the years to come. So what we see this year, despite that large -- despite the large win rate and book-to-bill is this is simply a question of timing when the contracts move from the backlog into sales, and you'll see the growth rate increase in the third quarter, fourth quarter and then significantly next year. This is just a question of the timing of several hundred contracts moving from backlog into sales. That also is impacting the margin rate. So look, I'm very confident in the ability of this business to perform. They're going to outperform their cost synergies. They are growing great cash performance.

If you look at the 7.4% margin rate that we reported for the year for the group, if you normalize that for the amortization burden that came with the CSRA acquisition and take that out, you actually end up with a margin rate of 9.6% for the year. So that's a couple hundred basis points better than we reported and about 110 basis points better than the year-ago 2017 full year rate. That's really driven by the CSRA contribution from an operations perspective, if you will. So they actually contributed approximately 10.9% incremental margins of the core business, excluding that amortization benefit. Now when you look ahead to next year, when you take the puts and takes on the revenue side between the additional quarter of CSRA volume offset by the divestitures, we're nominally up. Let's just call it notionally flat, but nominally up. So even though we do have because of the accelerating amortization schedule that we have for this business, even though we do have a somewhat declining quarterly amortization burden, the fact that we have 4 full quarters of amortization versus a flattish to slightly nose up total top line is actually, perhaps, counterintuitively a little bit of a margin drag for next year. It'll start to accelerate in the following year once we have a full-up year-on-year comparison. So if you think of that amortization as really, call it, a 20 -- I'll call it a 20-ish basis point drag. And the other part of it is we do have synergies, as Phebe mentioned, that are accelerating. So I'd call that maybe an 80 to 90 basis point assist as we go forward, and we'll continue to accelerate after that. And then from a mix perspective, as you alluded to, when we talked about this for some time after the acquisition, we did forecast, call it, 100 to 150 basis point contraction overall in the incremental CSRA margins over the next 3, 4 years. So, call it, 50 basis points or so from that. So if you take the 20-ish basis points on amortization, call it, 50 basis points on mix, offset by a positive 80 to 90 basis point improvement from synergies, you get, call it, 10 to 20 basis point net improvement for the year. And we would exceed accelerating after that. So hopefully, that color is helpful."

For Aerospace, it hold a number of items to include options for aircraft as well as longer-term arrangements that we have with individual customers, so where deliveries may be further out in the delivery queue and spread out in the backlog. So as I mentioned, we did have, in the fourth quarter, a fairly large contract signed up with an existing commercial customer. It was valued at just over $1 billion. It's a multi-aircraft, multiyear arrangement that spans out over several years. That did not go into the firm backlog because that order is actually subject to that customer's board approval coming up later this quarter. So we expect that to happen this quarter, and we'll move into the firm backlog and be counted as traditional orders of the time, but given the maturity of that and where it was in the quarter, that's why we put it in the -- as we typically are conservative on these notions, we put it in the potential contract value bucket versus in the firm backlog till we get to that firm order."

So quite pleased with that. The margin compression, it has been something we've been talking to you all for some time about. As you all know, the first lot of airplanes, in this case, we're talking about the G500 carry very little margins. Those airplanes will ramp up -- continue to ramp up that production in first quarter, second quarter and as we move from that initial lot to carry those lower margins, then you'll see some -- we will see some margin expansion on that line. The 600 will come in at slightly higher entry margins simply because of the disproportionate amount of test cost and R&D cost borne by the 500. And then we'll see with respect to the margins.

The results and comparisons with prior periods are straightforward for the most part. As a result, I will go through them briefly to leave more time for my thoughts on the business segments, our outlook for 2019 and your questions.
I also think you will find the press release and the additional presentation on our website fulsome and helpful.
So earlier today, we reported fourth quarter revenue of $10 billion -- $10.38 billion, earnings from continuing operations of $909 million, and earnings of $3.07 per fully diluted share. This is a significant improvement against the fourth quarter of 2017, which was adversely impacted by a discrete $119 million increase in the tax provision as a result of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Even after adjusting for the adverse impact in Q4 2017, EPS was up $0.07 and earnings from continuing operations were up $154 million. Earnings per share at $3.07 also beat consensus by $0.09. Revenue and operating earnings were largely consistent with consensus. Most of the difference comes from a lower tax provision and a somewhat lower share count.
So all in all, a solid quarter with good performance, particularly compared to the year-ago quarter as well as the third quarter of 2018. For the year, we had fully diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $11.22. This was also $0.09 above consensus. Revenue of $36.2 billion was up over 2017 by $5.2 billion. On an organic basis, excluding CSRA, revenue was up $1.5 billion. Revenue was up across each of our reporting segments. Operating earnings of $4.5 billion were up $221 million or 5.2% over 2017. Earnings from continuing operations were up $446 million or 15.3% over 2017. Importantly, earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.66 above 2017. All in all, 2018 was a very good year, a year of growth and a year of important order intakes that left the company well positioned for 2019.
I will review the full year and the quarters on a year-over-year basis for the groups without reference to sequential comparisons. On a sequential basis, suffice it to say that we had more revenue, higher operating earnings, higher earnings from continuing operations and higher earnings per share than in the third quarter 2018. So let me discuss each group and provide some color where appropriate.
First, Aerospace. Aerospace revenue of $2.7 billion was up against the year-ago quarter by an impressive $722 million, that is 36.4%. This was attributable in large part to the delivery of 9 G500s in the quarter and also a strong fourth quarter in the service centers. For the full year, revenue of $8.46 billion was up $326 million or 4%. Operating earnings of $1.49 billion were down $87 million on lower operating margins. The lower operating earnings were attributable to poor performance in the completions business at Jet Aviation, the mix shift at Gulfstream and costs attendant to the introduction of the G500. This time last year, we told you to expect revenue between $8.35 billion to $8.4 billion with a margin rate of 18%, leading to forecasted earnings of $1.5 billion. We finished the year with more than forecasted revenue at 17.6% margin, a -- and $1.49 billion of operating earnings. All in all, very close to the forecast we gave you this time last year.
On the order front, activity in the quarter was good, and the pipeline activity remains robust. The book-to-bill at Aerospace in the fourth quarter was 0.8:1 dollar denominated. You can see more information on deliveries and orders in the Exhibit J to the press release. We expect the G600 to be certified this year, although the exact timing is hard to predict given the impact of the government shutdown on the FAA. But we fully expect certification of the 600 this half.
The pacing item for deliveries of the G500 and 600 will be our ability to deliver nacelles. We have that line in good order. Costs are increasingly under control, and we are producing very good quality. But we had to restart the supply chain that had gone dormant with the filing of the Nordam bankruptcy proceedings. That has impacted rate and our ability to keep schedule. We expect all schedule issues to be behind us by mid-year. As a result, you will see accelerating G500 deliveries as the year progresses and our ability to provide nacelles to support G600 deliveries in the second half as well.
Next, Combat Systems. At Combat, revenue of $1.74 billion was almost the same as the year-ago quarter. The same holds true for operating earnings of $261 million and an operating margin of 15%. For the full year, revenue of $6.24 billion was up $292 million, just short of 5%. Operating earnings of $962 million were up $25 million on a 40 basis point contraction in margin, largely related to mix shift. By the way, this performance is reasonably consistent with the forecast we provided at this time last year. We enjoyed somewhat better revenue than our initial forecast, which was an increase of $200 million to $250 million over 2017. We actually grew revenue $292 million. We forecast operating earnings of $970 million and came in at $962 million, an $8 million shortfall largely attributable to the diplomatic issues that slowed production of the vehicle program in Canada in the fourth quarter.
We continue to see nice order activity in this group with fourth quarter orders of $2.19 billion, a book-to-bill of 1.3:1 in the quarter and 1:1 for the year. Tank orders alone are in excess of $1 billion.
We also continue to have significant international opportunities, particularly in Europe. We've been negotiating with Spain with respect to a program valued at $2 billion for Piranha vehicles. And of note, we acquired FWW, a qualified maintenance and service provider to the German Army and other international customers to enhance our position in the key market. FWW will become part of European Land Systems.
In our U.S. market, our Army customer is modernizing and providing a growing demand across our combat vehicles and munitions business. In short, this group had quite positive revenue growth, continued its history of strong margin performance and had very good order activity.
Next, Marine Systems. This is a really good news story across the board. Marine revenue of $2.3 billion was up $237 million, a stunning 11.5% over the year-ago quarter. Operating earnings of $213 million were up $46 million against the year-ago quarter, a 27.5% increase on a 120 basis point improvement in operating margins. This is very strong operating leverage in a growth environment. By the way, the sequential comparison is equally impressive. For the full year, revenue of $8.5 billion was up $498 million, in excess of 6%. Operating earnings for the year of $761 million were up $76 million, over 11% on a 40 basis point improvement in operating margin. At this time last year, we told you to expect revenue of $8.4 billion to $8.5 billion, and operating earnings of $735 million to $745 million. We came in at the higher end of the revenue range. Operating earnings of $761 million outperformed our forecast by $16 million to $26 million.
In response to the significant increased demand from our Navy customer across all 3 of our shipyards, we continued to invest in each of our yards with particular emphasis on Electric Boat, to prepare for increased production associated with the Block V of the Virginia submarine program and the new Columbia ballistic-missile submarine. As you may recall, Block V is a significant upgrade in size and performance requiring additional manufacturing capacity.
As you know, we have also increased our internal training programs as well as our public-private partnerships with Connecticut and Rhode Island to meet our need for skilled trades. At $243 million, CapEx in 2018 from Marine was more than double its depreciation for the year. For 2019, we again expect the Marine segment to command the larger share of our capital budget as we work toward satisfying the nation's need for its critical naval systems. So suffice it to say, we are poised to support our Navy customer as they increase the size of the fleet.
As you are aware, the Information and Systems Technology group has been realigned and reshaped into 2 separate segments. Mission Systems, their large C4ISR business, and GDIT, a leading provider of information solutions to the federal government and its agencies. That was supplemented in the second quarter of 2018 by the acquisition of CSRA. I'm going to ask Jason to interject some comparison data here that you might find relevant and helpful."
274561,597394105,1643111,"General Dynamics Corporation, Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Jan 30, 2019",2019-01-30,"Earnings Calls","General Dynamics Corporation","Executives","On that note, let me make some comments about GDIT and Mission Systems performance in 2018.

We originally guided to full year revenue for the former IS&T business group between $9.3 billion and $9.4 billion, and operating earnings of approximately $1,030,000,000. If we look at how Mission Systems and GDIT, excluding CSRA, did for the year, they combined for $9.325 billion in sales, so in line with our expectations. And that includes an organic growth rate of 4.3% for GDIT, notwithstanding the impact of several divestitures during the year. From an operating earnings perspective, they were actually closer to $1,050,000,000 on a combined basis, so somewhat better than we had expected. So all in all, a solid year for both businesses. As I alluded to, we also completed several portfolio-shaping activities in our GDIT segment during the year. These included the sale of a commercial health products business, CSRA's SETA business and our public-facing call centers. These divestitures of more than $1 billion of annualized sales enhance the group's focus on high-end solutions and high value-added customer needs."
274561,597394105,1643111,"General Dynamics Corporation, Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Jan 30, 2019",2019-01-30,"Earnings Calls","General Dynamics Corporation","Executives","So let's first address information technology. Information technology enjoyed revenue in the quarter of $2.38 billion and operating earnings of $194 million with an operating margin of 8.1%. Since the numbers for the fourth quarter of 2017 did not include",1020,"So let's first address information technology. Information technology enjoyed revenue in the quarter of $2.38 billion and operating earnings of $194 million with an operating margin of 8.1%. Since the numbers for the fourth quarter of 2017 did not include CSRA, comparison to the year-ago quarter are not particularly meaningful. However, sequentially, revenue is up $75 million, operating earnings up $37 million and operating margin up 130 basis points. Evidence of our continuing ability to extract cost synergies here.
For the year, revenue was $8.27 billion, and operating earnings were $608 million with a 7.4% margin. Once again, annual comparisons do not offer meaningful perspective since the prior year did not include CSRA.
Next, Mission Systems. Revenue in the quarter was essentially flat against the year-ago quarter, while operating earnings of $181 million were $6 million lower than the fourth quarter last year on a 40 basis point decrement in operating margin.
For the year, revenue of $4.73 billion was up $245 million or 5.5%. Operating earnings of $659 million were up $21 million or 3.3% due to a 30 basis point decline in operating margin, driven in part by mix. Book-to-bill for the year was somewhat above 1x, and we ended the year with a modestly higher backlog at $5.3 billion.
So on this call last year, on a company-wide basis, our forecast for 2018 was to expect revenue of $32.35 billion to $32.45 billion, operating earnings of $4.25 billion and an operating margin of 13.1%. As you know, we wound up with $36.2 billion on an organic basis. But on an organic basis, revenue was up $1.5 billion, $500 million more than forecast.
At the EPS line, we forecasted $10.90 to $11, and came in at $11.22, including the transaction costs related to CSRA, which were about $0.20 per share.
So let me provide our forecast for 2019 initially by business group and then on a company-wide rollup. In Aerospace, we expect 2019 revenue to be about $9.7 billion, but more than $1.2 billion on deliveries of approximately 145 business jets. Operating earnings will be slightly in excess of $1.5 billion with an operating margin rate of approximately 15.5%. The margin rate is lower than 2018 as a result of mix shift as well as a modest increase in preowned sales, which, again, generally carry no margin.
So revenue will be back-end loaded as will the margin rate. In general, the quarterly spread in revenue progression will look something like $2.2 billion, $2.3 billion, $2.4 billion and $2.8 billion. Operating margin in the first 2 quarters should be in the mid-14% area, strengthening in Q3 and moving to well over 17% in Q4.
We believe that last year will be the low point in operating earnings during this transition to our new models with moderate -- modest earnings increase in 2019 and 2020 and significant earnings traction thereafter.
In Combat, we expect revenue to be between $6.5 billion and $6.6 billion, a $250 million to $350 million increase over 2018 with operating earnings up $965 million to $975 million, slightly better than last year. Here again, look for both revenue, earnings and margin rate to grow quarter-over-quarter during the year with a particularly strong fourth quarter. We continue to see solid growth for this business with orders for the Abram and solid demand for Stryker vehicles and munitions.
We see domestic volumes expanding faster than our international business. The Marine Group is expected to have revenue of approximately $9 billion, a 6% or $500 million increase over 2018. Operating earnings in 2019 are anticipated to be about $770 million with an operating margin rate around 8.5%.
We anticipate growth at each of the yards with mix being reflected in margins. We continue to see long-term growth with an expanding need for submarines, surface combatant, support ships and overhaul work. Our biggest opportunity here is around outperforming the forecasted margin rate. We respect -- we expect Information Technology revenue in 2019 of approximately $8.3 billion, consistent with 2018 with margins in the 7.5% range, a slight improvement over 2018's performance.
To the plus side, we have a full year CSRA offset by the divestitures of the call centers and SETA businesses, which represented just over $1 billion of prior year revenues. We see the business making excellent progress toward optimizing the acquisition as we combine teams, deeply integrate business systems, consolidate facilities and increase our value proposition to diverse defense, intel and federal civilian agencies.
For Mission Systems, we expect revenue in 2019 somewhere between $4.8 billion and $4.9 billion, an increase of just over $100 million, or between 2% to 3%. We see strong growth in our maritime, cyber and space-related markets, with fairly steady top line in our core tactical network incumbencies.
We anticipating operating earnings up modestly over last year with margins in the mid -- between mid- and high 13s, once again, building throughout the year. So for 2019, company-wide, all of this rolls up to approximately $38.5 billion of revenue, up by 6% over 2018. Operating earnings of $4.5 billion and an operating margin of around 11.7%. This gives us an EPS forecast of $11.60 to $11.70 per fully diluted share.
I may emphasize that this plan is purely from operations. It assumes a low 18% tax provision and assumes we buy only enough shares to hold the share count steady with year-end figures so as to avoid dilution from option exercises. So much like last year, beating our EPS guidance must come from outperforming the operating plan, achieving a lower effective tax rate and the effective deployment of capital. With respect to the quarterly progression for EPS, the first quarter should be seasonally low at about 20% of the full year's results. The second quarter should be more than 10% better than that and the third quarter should account for over 25% of EPS and the final quarter of the year could represent about 1/3 of our EPS.
So now let me turn this over to Jason for additional commentary around cash, backlog and other items, and then we'll take your questions."
274561,597394105,1643111,"General Dynamics Corporation, Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Jan 30, 2019",2019-01-30,"Earnings Calls","General Dynamics Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Phebe. Our net interest expense in the quarter was $112 million, bringing interest expense for the year to $356 million. That compares to $27 million and $103 million in the comparable periods of 2017. The increase in 2018 is due to the roughly",709,"Thank you, Phebe. Our net interest expense in the quarter was $112 million, bringing interest expense for the year to $356 million. That compares to $27 million and $103 million in the comparable periods of 2017. The increase in 2018 is due to the roughly $10 billion of debt we issued to finance the acquisition of CSRA.
We repaid approximately $1.7 billion of this debt during the year and will continue to prioritize paying down debt consistent with our mid-A credit rating. We ended the year with $850 million of commercial paper outstanding, and our next scheduled fixed debt maturity is in the second quarter of 2020. For 2019, we expect interest expense to be approximately $430 million, reflecting a full year of the notes issued in 2018. Our effective tax rate was 19.7% for the quarter and 17.8% for the year, in line with our previous guidance.
Looking ahead to 2019, we expect a full year effective tax rate in the low 18% range, between 18% and 18.5%. This is slightly higher than 2018, but recall, in 2018, we took advantage of a onetime benefit provided by tax reform and made a $255 million discretionary pension contribution, which lowered the tax rate by approximately 75 basis points. Looking at capital deployment, we paid $274 million in dividends in the fourth quarter, bringing the full year to $1.1 billion. We also took advantage of the market decline in December by purchasing our shares to a greater degree than planned. In the quarter, we purchased 7.6 million shares of our stock for $1.3 billion, bringing the full year to 10.1 million shares for $1.8 billion.
Looking ahead, while debt repayment will continue to be a priority, as I mentioned, we continue to have the flexibility to adjust our capital deployment in response to changing market conditions, as we did in December.
Moving on to our pension plans, we contributed approximately $570 million to our plans in 2018, including the discretionary contribution. For 2019, we expect that amount to be approximately $200 million to be contributed mostly during the third quarter. We've also ramped up our capital expenditures, which were almost 2% of sales for the year, that's up 60% from 2017 as we invest to support the growth of our businesses, particularly Marine Systems and Aerospace. For 2019, we expect capital expenditures to rise to 3% of sales, driven by the continued investment in the Columbia-class program.
Our free cash flow conversion rate for the quarter was 200%, bringing our rate for the year to 78% excluding the discretionary pension contribution, and this is below our typical 100% conversion target.
If you're following the headlines out of Canada, you know there are discussions taking place between the Canadian government and their customer on our armored vehicle supply contract. As a result of these discussions, we've experienced payment delays that significantly impacted the free cash flow we expected last year. To be clear, this is a timing issue, and we expect to receive the delayed payments this year.
Assuming the resolution of this matter, we expect a cash conversion rate well in excess of 100% in 2019, and looking ahead, we expect cash performance throughout the planning horizon to be very strong, in our typical 90% to 100% range.
And one last point on backlog. We ended the year with total backlog of approximately $68 billion, that's up 7.5% over this time last year. That increase came in spite of a headwind from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which reduced the backlog by $840 million, $700 million of which impacted the Combat Systems group.
Beyond the firm backlog, our total potential contract value, which includes options and IDIQ arrangements, increased by an impressive 17.5% over the end of last year, including the multibillion dollar CHS-5 IDIQ award at Mission Systems. In addition, we entered into a $1.1 billion contract with an existing corporate customer for a multi-airplane multiyear order that requires their board approval this quarter. Once approved, that order will move into the firm backlog. So these awards along with the firm backlog provide a nice foundation for the continued growth we see ahead. Howard, that concludes my remarks, and I'll turn it back over to you for the Q&A."

In a growing environment last year, they had a 1:1 book-to-bill. They also had a 75% win rate and a $26 billion pipeline. This management team is performing the cost synergies beautifully and frankly is a bit of ahead of schedule. By the way, this is a very energetic, innovative management team that is really making GDIT into the workplace of preference. And in this market, people are absolutely critical. They're important across the board, but people here truly matter. I might also add the cash performance on this business is outstanding. Last year, they generated over 100% in net income in cash and will continue that this year and for the years to come. So what we see this year, despite that large -- backlog -- despite the large win rate and book-to-bill is this is simply a question of timing when the contracts move from the backlog into sales, and you'll see the growth rate increase in the third quarter, fourth quarter and then significantly next year. This is just a question of the timing of several hundred contracts moving from backlog into sales. That also is impacting the margin rate. So look, I'm very confident in the ability of this business to perform. They're going to outperform their cost synergies. They're growing, great cash performance. So in the instance right now, it's simply a question of timing."

If you look at the 7.4% margin rate that we reported for the year for the group, if you normalize that for the amortization burden that came",417,"And, David, if you want me to -- I'll add a little bit of additional color around your inference on margin rates. If you look at the 7.4% margin rate that we reported for the year for the group, if you normalize that for the amortization burden that came with the CSRA acquisition and take that out, you actually end up with a margin rate of 9.6% for the year. So that's a couple hundred basis points better than we reported and about 110 basis points better than the year-ago 2017 full year rate. That's really driven by the CSRA contribution from an operations perspective, if you will. So they actually contributed approximately 10.9% incremental margins of the core business, excluding that amortization benefit. Now when you look ahead to next year, when you take the puts and takes on the revenue side between the additional quarter of CSRA volume offset by the divestitures, we're nominally up. Let's just call it notionally flat, but nominally up. So even though we do have because of the accelerating amortization schedule that we have for this business, even though we do have a somewhat declining quarterly amortization burden, the fact that we have 4 full quarters of amortization versus a flattish to slightly nose up total top line is actually, perhaps, counterintuitively a little bit of a margin drag for next year. It'll start to accelerate for the following year once we have a full-up year-on-year comparison. So if you think of that amortization as really, call it, a 20 -- I'll call it a 20-ish basis point drag. And the other part of it is we do have synergies, as Phebe mentioned, that are accelerating. So I'd call that maybe an 80 to 90 basis point assist as we go forward, and we'll continue to accelerate after that. And then from a mix perspective, as she alluded to, when we talked about this for some time after the acquisition, we did forecast, call it, 100 to 150 basis point contraction overall in the incremental CSRA margins over the next 3, 4 years. So, call it, 50 basis points or so from that. So if you take the 20-ish basis points on amortization, call it, 50 basis points on mix, offset by a positive 80 to 90 basis point improvement from synergies, you get, call it, 10 to 20 basis point net improvement for the year. And we would see it accelerating after that. So hopefully, that color is helpful."

For Aerospace, it hold a number of items to include options for aircraft as well as longer-term arrangements that we have with individual customers, so where deliveries may be further out in the delivery queue and spread out in the backlog. So as I mentioned, we did have, in the fourth quarter, a fairly large contract signed up with an existing commercial customer. It was valued at just over $1 billion. It's a multi-aircraft, multiyear arrangement that spans out over several years. That did not go into the firm backlog because that order is actually subject to that customer's board approval coming up later this quarter. So we expect that to happen this quarter, and will move into the firm backlog and be counted as traditional orders at the time, but given the maturity of that and where it was in the quarter, that's why we put it in the -- as we typically are conservative on these notions, we put it in the potential contract value bucket versus in the firm backlog till we get to that firm order."

So we're quite pleased with that. The margin compression, it has been something we've been talking to you all for some time about. As you all know, the first lot of airplanes, in this case, we're talking about the G500 carry very little margins. Those airplanes will ramp up -- continue to ramp up that production in first quarter, second quarter and as we move from that initial lot that carry those lower margins, then you'll see some -- we will see some margin expansion on that line. The 600 will come in at slightly higher entry margins simply because of the disproportionate amount of test cost and R&D cost borne by the 500. And then we'll see with respect to the margins.

The results and comparisons with prior periods are straightforward for the most part. As a result, I will go through them briefly to leave more time for my thoughts on the business segments, our outlook for 2019 and your questions.
I also think you will find the press release and the additional presentation on our website fulsome and helpful.
So earlier today, we reported fourth quarter revenue of $10 billion -- $10.38 billion, earnings from continuing operations of $909 million, and earnings of $3.07 per fully diluted share. This is a significant improvement against the fourth quarter of 2017, which was adversely impacted by a discrete $119 million increase in the tax provision as a result of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Even after adjusting for the adverse impact in Q4 2017, EPS was up $0.07 and earnings from continuing operations were up $154 million. Earnings per share at $3.07 also beat consensus by $0.09. Revenue and operating earnings were largely consistent with consensus. Most of the difference comes from a lower tax provision and a somewhat lower share count.
So all in all, a solid quarter with good performance, particularly compared to the year-ago quarter as well as the third quarter of 2018. For the year, we had fully diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $11.22. This was also $0.09 above consensus. Revenue of $36.2 billion was up over 2017 by $5.2 billion. On an organic basis, excluding CSRA, revenue was up $1.5 billion. Revenue was up across each of our reporting segments. Operating earnings of $4.5 billion were up $221 million or 5.2% over 2017. Earnings from continuing operations were up $446 million or 15.3% over 2017. Importantly, earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.66 above 2017. All in all, 2018 was a very good year, a year of growth and a year of important order intakes that left the company well positioned for 2019.
I will review the full year and the quarters on a year-over-year basis for the groups without reference to sequential comparisons. On a sequential basis, suffice it to say that we had more revenue, higher operating earnings, higher earnings from continuing operations and higher earnings per share than in the third quarter 2018. So let me discuss each group and provide some color where appropriate.
First, Aerospace. Aerospace revenue of $2.7 billion was up against the year-ago quarter by an impressive $722 million, that is 36.4%. This was attributable in large part to the delivery of 9 G500s in the quarter and also a strong fourth quarter in the service centers. For the full year, revenue of $8.46 billion was up $326 million or 4%. Operating earnings of $1.49 billion were down $87 million on lower operating margins. The lower operating earnings were attributable to poor performance in the completions business at Jet Aviation, the mix shift at Gulfstream and costs attendant to the introduction of the G500. This time last year, we told you to expect revenue between $8.35 billion to $8.4 billion with a margin rate of 18%, leading to forecasted earnings of $1.5 billion. We finished the year with more than forecasted revenue at 17.6% margin, a -- and $1.49 billion of operating earnings. All in all, very close to the forecast we gave you this time last year.
On the order front, activity in the quarter was good, and the pipeline activity remains robust. The book-to-bill at Aerospace in the fourth quarter was 0.8:1 dollar denominated. You can see more information on deliveries and orders in the Exhibit J to the press release. We expect the G600 to be certified this year, although the exact timing is hard to predict given the impact of the government shutdown on the FAA. But we fully expect certification of the 600 this half.
The pacing item for deliveries of the G500 and 600 will be our ability to deliver nacelles. We have that line in good order. Costs are increasingly under control, and we are producing very good quality. But we had to restart the supply chain that had gone dormant with the filing of the Nordam bankruptcy proceedings. That has impacted rate and our ability to keep schedule. We expect all schedule issues to be behind us by mid-year. As a result, you will see accelerating G500 deliveries as the year progresses and our ability to provide nacelles to support G600 deliveries in the second half as well.
Next, Combat Systems. At Combat, revenue of $1.74 billion was almost the same as the year-ago quarter. The same holds true for operating earnings of $261 million and an operating margin of 15%. For the full year, revenue of $6.24 billion was up $292 million, just short of 5%. Operating earnings of $962 million were up $25 million on a 40 basis point contraction in margin, largely related to mix shift. By the way, this performance is reasonably consistent with the forecast we provided at this time last year. We enjoyed somewhat better revenue than our initial forecast, which was an increase of $200 million to $250 million over 2017. We actually grew revenue $292 million. We forecast operating earnings of $970 million and came in at $962 million, an $8 million shortfall largely attributable to the diplomatic issues that slowed production of the vehicle program in Canada in the fourth quarter.
We continue to see nice order activity in this group with fourth quarter orders of $2.19 billion, a book-to-bill of 1.3:1 in the quarter and 1:1 for the year. Tank orders alone are in excess of $1 billion.
We also continue to have significant international opportunities, particularly in Europe. We've been negotiating with Spain with respect to a program valued at $2 billion for Piranha vehicles. And of note, we acquired FWW, a qualified maintenance and service provider to the German Army and other international customers to enhance our position in the key market. FWW will become part of European Land Systems.
In our U.S. market, our Army customer is modernizing and providing a growing demand across our combat vehicles and munitions business. In short, this group had quite positive revenue growth, continued its history of strong margin performance and had very good order activity.
Next, Marine Systems. This is a really good news story across the board. Marine revenue of $2.3 billion was up $237 million, a stunning 11.5% over the year-ago quarter. Operating earnings of $213 million were up $46 million against the year-ago quarter, a 27.5% increase on a 120 basis point improvement in operating margins. This is very strong operating leverage in a growth environment. By the way, the sequential comparison is equally impressive. For the full year, revenue of $8.5 billion was up $498 million, in excess of 6%. Operating earnings for the year of $761 million were up $76 million, over 11% on a 40 basis point improvement in operating margin. At this time last year, we told you to expect revenue of $8.4 billion to $8.5 billion, and operating earnings of $735 million to $745 million. We came in at the higher end of the revenue range. Operating earnings of $761 million outperformed our forecast by $16 million to $26 million.
In response to the significant increased demand from our Navy customer across all 3 of our shipyards, we continued to invest in each of our yards with particular emphasis on Electric Boat, to prepare for increased production associated with the Block V of the Virginia submarine program and the new Columbia ballistic-missile submarine. As you may recall, Block V is a significant upgrade in size and performance requiring additional manufacturing capacity.
As you know, we have also increased our internal training programs as well as our public-private partnerships with Connecticut and Rhode Island to meet our need for skilled trades. At $243 million, CapEx in 2018 from Marine was more than double its depreciation for the year. For 2019, we again expect the Marine segment to command the larger share of our capital budget as we work toward satisfying the nation's need for its critical naval systems. So suffice it to say, we are poised to support our Navy customer as they increase the size of the fleet.
As you are aware, the Information and Systems Technology group has been realigned and reshaped into 2 separate segments. Mission Systems, their large C4ISR business, and GDIT, a leading provider of information solutions to the federal government and its agencies. That was supplemented in the second quarter of 2018 by the acquisition of CSRA. I'm going to ask Jason to interject some comparison data here that you might find relevant and helpful."
274561,597394105,1643724,"General Dynamics Corporation, Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Jan 30, 2019",2019-01-30,"Earnings Calls","General Dynamics Corporation","Executives","On that note, let me make some comments about GDIT and Mission Systems performance in 2018.

We originally guided to full year revenue for the former IS&T business group between $9.3 billion and $9.4 billion, and operating earnings of approximately $1,030,000,000. If we look at how Mission Systems and GDIT, excluding CSRA, did for the year, they combined for $9.325 billion in sales, so in line with our expectations. And that includes an organic growth rate of 4.3% for GDIT, notwithstanding the impact of several divestitures during the year. From an operating earnings perspective, they were actually closer to $1,050,000,000 on a combined basis, so somewhat better than we had expected. So all in all, a solid year for both businesses. As I alluded to, we also completed several portfolio-shaping activities in our GDIT segment during the year. These included the sale of a commercial health products business, CSRA's SETA business and our public-facing call centers. These divestitures of more than $1 billion of annualized sales enhance the group's focus on high-end solutions and high value-added customer needs."
274561,597394105,1643724,"General Dynamics Corporation, Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Jan 30, 2019",2019-01-30,"Earnings Calls","General Dynamics Corporation","Executives","So let's first address information technology. Information technology enjoyed revenue in the quarter of $2.38 billion and operating earnings of $194 million with an operating margin of 8.1%. Since the numbers for the fourth quarter of 2017 did not include",1020,"So let's first address information technology. Information technology enjoyed revenue in the quarter of $2.38 billion and operating earnings of $194 million with an operating margin of 8.1%. Since the numbers for the fourth quarter of 2017 did not include CSRA, comparison to the year-ago quarter are not particularly meaningful. However, sequentially, revenue is up $75 million, operating earnings up $37 million and operating margin up 130 basis points. Evidence of our continuing ability to extract cost synergies here.
For the year, revenue was $8.27 billion, and operating earnings were $608 million with a 7.4% margin. Once again, annual comparisons do not offer meaningful perspective since the prior year did not include CSRA.
Next, Mission Systems. Revenue in the quarter was essentially flat against the year-ago quarter, while operating earnings of $181 million were $6 million lower than the fourth quarter last year on a 40 basis point decrement in operating margin.
For the year, revenue of $4.73 billion was up $245 million or 5.5%. Operating earnings of $659 million were up $21 million or 3.3% due to a 30 basis point decline in operating margin, driven in part by mix. Book-to-bill for the year was somewhat above 1x, and we ended the year with a modestly higher backlog at $5.3 billion.
So on this call last year, on a company-wide basis, our forecast for 2018 was to expect revenue of $32.35 billion to $32.45 billion, operating earnings of $4.25 billion and an operating margin of 13.1%. As you know, we wound up with $36.2 billion on an organic basis. But on an organic basis, revenue was up $1.5 billion, $500 million more than forecast.
At the EPS line, we forecasted $10.90 to $11, and came in at $11.22, including the transaction costs related to CSRA, which were about $0.20 per share.
So let me provide our forecast for 2019 initially by business group and then on a company-wide rollup. In Aerospace, we expect 2019 revenue to be about $9.7 billion, but more than $1.2 billion on deliveries of approximately 145 business jets. Operating earnings will be slightly in excess of $1.5 billion with an operating margin rate of approximately 15.5%. The margin rate is lower than 2018 as a result of mix shift as well as a modest increase in preowned sales, which, again, generally carry no margin.
So revenue will be back-end loaded as will the margin rate. In general, the quarterly spread in revenue progression will look something like $2.2 billion, $2.3 billion, $2.4 billion and $2.8 billion. Operating margin in the first 2 quarters should be in the mid-14% area, strengthening in Q3 and moving to well over 17% in Q4.
We believe that last year will be the low point in operating earnings during this transition to our new models with moderate -- modest earnings increase in 2019 and 2020 and significant earnings traction thereafter.
In Combat, we expect revenue to be between $6.5 billion and $6.6 billion, a $250 million to $350 million increase over 2018 with operating earnings up $965 million to $975 million, slightly better than last year. Here again, look for both revenue, earnings and margin rate to grow quarter-over-quarter during the year with a particularly strong fourth quarter. We continue to see solid growth for this business with orders for the Abram and solid demand for Stryker vehicles and munitions.
We see domestic volumes expanding faster than our international business. The Marine Group is expected to have revenue of approximately $9 billion, a 6% or $500 million increase over 2018. Operating earnings in 2019 are anticipated to be about $770 million with an operating margin rate around 8.5%.
We anticipate growth at each of the yards with mix being reflected in margins. We continue to see long-term growth with an expanding need for submarines, surface combatant, support ships and overhaul work. Our biggest opportunity here is around outperforming the forecasted margin rate. We respect -- we expect Information Technology revenue in 2019 of approximately $8.3 billion, consistent with 2018 with margins in the 7.5% range, a slight improvement over 2018's performance.
To the plus side, we have a full year CSRA offset by the divestitures of the call centers and SETA businesses, which represented just over $1 billion of prior year revenues. We see the business making excellent progress toward optimizing the acquisition as we combine teams, deeply integrate business systems, consolidate facilities and increase our value proposition to diverse defense, intel and federal civilian agencies.
For Mission Systems, we expect revenue in 2019 somewhere between $4.8 billion and $4.9 billion, an increase of just over $100 million, or between 2% to 3%. We see strong growth in our maritime, cyber and space-related markets, with fairly steady top line in our core tactical network incumbencies.
We anticipating operating earnings up modestly over last year with margins in the mid -- between mid- and high 13s, once again, building throughout the year. So for 2019, company-wide, all of this rolls up to approximately $38.5 billion of revenue, up by 6% over 2018. Operating earnings of $4.5 billion and an operating margin of around 11.7%. This gives us an EPS forecast of $11.60 to $11.70 per fully diluted share.
I may emphasize that this plan is purely from operations. It assumes a low 18% tax provision and assumes we buy only enough shares to hold the share count steady with year-end figures so as to avoid dilution from option exercises. So much like last year, beating our EPS guidance must come from outperforming the operating plan, achieving a lower effective tax rate and the effective deployment of capital. With respect to the quarterly progression for EPS, the first quarter should be seasonally low at about 20% of the full year's results. The second quarter should be more than 10% better than that and the third quarter should account for over 25% of EPS and the final quarter of the year could represent about 1/3 of our EPS.
So now let me turn this over to Jason for additional commentary around cash, backlog and other items, and then we'll take your questions."

That compares to $27 million and $103 million in the comparable periods of 2017. The increase in 2018 is due to the roughly $10 billion of debt we issued to finance the acquisition of CSRA.
We repaid approximately $1.7 billion of this debt during the year and will continue to prioritize paying down debt consistent with our mid-A credit rating. We ended the year with $850 million of commercial paper outstanding, and our next scheduled fixed debt maturity is in the second quarter of 2020. For 2019, we expect interest expense to be approximately $430 million, reflecting a full year of the notes issued in 2018. Our effective tax rate was 19.7% for the quarter and 17.8% for the year, in line with our previous guidance.
Looking ahead to 2019, we expect a full year effective tax rate in the low 18% range, between 18% and 18.5%. This is slightly higher than 2018, but recall, in 2018, we took advantage of a onetime benefit provided by tax reform and made a $255 million discretionary pension contribution, which lowered the tax rate by approximately 75 basis points. Looking at capital deployment, we paid $274 million in dividends in the fourth quarter, bringing the full year to $1.1 billion. We also took advantage of the market decline in December by purchasing our shares to a greater degree than planned. In the quarter, we purchased 7.6 million shares of our stock for $1.3 billion, bringing the full year to 10.1 million shares for $1.8 billion.
Looking ahead, while debt repayment will continue to be a priority, as I mentioned, we continue to have the flexibility to adjust our capital deployment in response to changing market conditions, as we did in December.
Moving on to our pension plans, we contributed approximately $570 million to our plans in 2018, including the discretionary contribution. For 2019, we expect that amount to be approximately $200 million to be contributed mostly during the third quarter. We've also ramped up our capital expenditures, which were almost 2% of sales for the year, that's up 60% from 2017 as we invest to support the growth of our businesses, particularly Marine Systems and Aerospace. For 2019, we expect capital expenditures to rise to 3% of sales, driven by the continued investment in the Columbia-class program.
Our free cash flow conversion rate for the quarter was 200%, bringing our rate for the year to 78% excluding the discretionary pension contribution, and this is below our typical 100% conversion target.
If you're following the headlines out of Canada, you know there are discussions taking place between the Canadian government and their customer on our armored vehicle supply contract. As a result of these discussions, we've experienced payment delays that significantly impacted the free cash flow we expected last year. To be clear, this is a timing issue, and we expect to receive the delayed payments this year.
Assuming the resolution of this matter, we expect a cash conversion rate well in excess of 100% in 2019, and looking ahead, we expect cash performance throughout the planning horizon to be very strong, in our typical 90% to 100% range.
And one last point on backlog. We ended the year with total backlog of approximately $68 billion, that's up 7.5% over this time last year. That increase came in spite of a headwind from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which reduced the backlog by $840 million, $700 million of which impacted the Combat Systems group.
Beyond the firm backlog, our total potential contract value, which includes options and IDIQ arrangements, increased by an impressive 17.5% over the end of last year, including the multibillion dollar CHS-5 IDIQ award at Mission Systems. In addition, we entered into a $1.1 billion contract with an existing corporate customer for a multi-airplane multiyear order that requires their board approval this quarter. Once approved, that order will move into the firm backlog. So these awards along with the firm backlog provide a nice foundation for the continued growth we see ahead. Howard, that concludes my remarks, and I'll turn it back over to you for the Q&A."

In a growing environment last year, they had a 1:1 book-to-bill. They also had a 75% win rate and a $26 billion pipeline. This management team is performing the cost synergies beautifully and frankly is a bit of ahead of schedule. By the way, this is a very energetic, innovative management team that is really making GDIT into the workplace of preference. And in this market, people are absolutely critical. They're important across the board, but people here truly matter. I might also add the cash performance on this business is outstanding. Last year, they generated over 100% in net income in cash and will continue that this year and for the years to come. So what we see this year, despite that large -- backlog -- despite the large win rate and book-to-bill is this is simply a question of timing when the contracts move from the backlog into sales, and you'll see the growth rate increase in the third quarter, fourth quarter and then significantly next year. This is just a question of the timing of several hundred contracts moving from backlog into sales. That also is impacting the margin rate. So look, I'm very confident in the ability of this business to perform. They're going to outperform their cost synergies. They're growing, great cash performance. So in the instance right now, it's simply a question of timing."

If you look at the 7.4% margin rate that we reported for the year for the group, if you normalize that for the amortization burden that came",417,"And, David, if you want me to -- I'll add a little bit of additional color around your inference on margin rates. If you look at the 7.4% margin rate that we reported for the year for the group, if you normalize that for the amortization burden that came with the CSRA acquisition and take that out, you actually end up with a margin rate of 9.6% for the year. So that's a couple hundred basis points better than we reported and about 110 basis points better than the year-ago 2017 full year rate. That's really driven by the CSRA contribution from an operations perspective, if you will. So they actually contributed approximately 10.9% incremental margins of the core business, excluding that amortization benefit. Now when you look ahead to next year, when you take the puts and takes on the revenue side between the additional quarter of CSRA volume offset by the divestitures, we're nominally up. Let's just call it notionally flat, but nominally up. So even though we do have because of the accelerating amortization schedule that we have for this business, even though we do have a somewhat declining quarterly amortization burden, the fact that we have 4 full quarters of amortization versus a flattish to slightly nose up total top line is actually, perhaps, counterintuitively a little bit of a margin drag for next year. It'll start to accelerate for the following year once we have a full-up year-on-year comparison. So if you think of that amortization as really, call it, a 20 -- I'll call it a 20-ish basis point drag. And the other part of it is we do have synergies, as Phebe mentioned, that are accelerating. So I'd call that maybe an 80 to 90 basis point assist as we go forward, and we'll continue to accelerate after that. And then from a mix perspective, as she alluded to, when we talked about this for some time after the acquisition, we did forecast, call it, 100 to 150 basis point contraction overall in the incremental CSRA margins over the next 3, 4 years. So, call it, 50 basis points or so from that. So if you take the 20-ish basis points on amortization, call it, 50 basis points on mix, offset by a positive 80 to 90 basis point improvement from synergies, you get, call it, 10 to 20 basis point net improvement for the year. And we would see it accelerating after that. So hopefully, that color is helpful."

For Aerospace, it hold a number of items to include options for aircraft as well as longer-term arrangements that we have with individual customers, so where deliveries may be further out in the delivery queue and spread out in the backlog. So as I mentioned, we did have, in the fourth quarter, a fairly large contract signed up with an existing commercial customer. It was valued at just over $1 billion. It's a multi-aircraft, multiyear arrangement that spans out over several years. That did not go into the firm backlog because that order is actually subject to that customer's board approval coming up later this quarter. So we expect that to happen this quarter, and will move into the firm backlog and be counted as traditional orders at the time, but given the maturity of that and where it was in the quarter, that's why we put it in the -- as we typically are conservative on these notions, we put it in the potential contract value bucket versus in the firm backlog till we get to that firm order."

As you all know, the first lot of airplanes, in this case, we're talking about the G500 carry very little margins. Those airplanes will ramp up -- continue to ramp up that production in first quarter, second quarter and as we move from that initial lot that carry those lower margins, then you'll see some -- we will see some margin expansion on that line. The 600 will come in at slightly higher entry margins simply because of the disproportionate amount of test cost and R&D cost borne by the 500. And then we'll see with respect to the margins.

The results and comparisons with prior periods are straightforward for the most part. As a result, I will go through them briefly to leave more time for my thoughts on the business segments, our outlook for 2019 and your questions.
I also think you will find the press release and the additional presentation on our website fulsome and helpful.
So earlier today, we reported fourth quarter revenue of $10 billion -- $10.38 billion, earnings from continuing operations of $909 million, and earnings of $3.07 per fully diluted share. This is a significant improvement against the fourth quarter of 2017, which was adversely impacted by a discrete $119 million increase in the tax provision as a result of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Even after adjusting for the adverse impact in Q4 2017, EPS was up $0.07 and earnings from continuing operations were up $154 million. Earnings per share at $3.07 also beat consensus by $0.09. Revenue and operating earnings were largely consistent with consensus. Most of the difference comes from a lower tax provision and a somewhat lower share count.
So all in all, a solid quarter with good performance, particularly compared to the year-ago quarter as well as the third quarter of 2018. For the year, we had fully diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $11.22. This was also $0.09 above consensus. Revenue of $36.2 billion was up over 2017 by $5.2 billion. On an organic basis, excluding CSRA, revenue was up $1.5 billion. Revenue was up across each of our reporting segments. Operating earnings of $4.5 billion were up $221 million or 5.2% over 2017. Earnings from continuing operations were up $446 million or 15.3% over 2017. Importantly, earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.66 above 2017. All in all, 2018 was a very good year, a year of growth and a year of important order intakes that left the company well positioned for 2019.
I will review the full year and the quarters on a year-over-year basis for the groups without reference to sequential comparisons. On a sequential basis, suffice it to say that we had more revenue, higher operating earnings, higher earnings from continuing operations and higher earnings per share than in the third quarter 2018. So let me discuss each group and provide some color where appropriate.
First, Aerospace. Aerospace revenue of $2.7 billion was up against the year-ago quarter by an impressive $722 million, that is 36.4%. This was attributable in large part to the delivery of 9 G500s in the quarter and also a strong fourth quarter in the service centers. For the full year, revenue of $8.46 billion was up $326 million or 4%. Operating earnings of $1.49 billion were down $87 million on lower operating margins. The lower operating earnings were attributable to poor performance in the completions business at Jet Aviation, the mix shift at Gulfstream and costs attendant to the introduction of the G500. This time last year, we told you to expect revenue between $8.35 billion to $8.4 billion with a margin rate of 18%, leading to forecasted earnings of $1.5 billion. We finished the year with more than forecasted revenue at 17.6% margin, a -- and $1.49 billion of operating earnings. All in all, very close to the forecast we gave you this time last year.
On the order front, activity in the quarter was good, and the pipeline activity remains robust. The book-to-bill at Aerospace in the fourth quarter was 0.8:1 dollar denominated. You can see more information on deliveries and orders in the Exhibit J to the press release. We expect the G600 to be certified this year, although the exact timing is hard to predict given the impact of the government shutdown on the FAA. But we fully expect certification of the 600 this half.
The pacing item for deliveries of the G500 and 600 will be our ability to deliver nacelles. We have that line in good order. Costs are increasingly under control, and we are producing very good quality. But we had to restart the supply chain that had gone dormant with the filing of the Nordam bankruptcy proceedings. That has impacted rate and our ability to keep schedule. We expect all schedule issues to be behind us by mid-year. As a result, you will see accelerating G500 deliveries as the year progresses and our ability to provide nacelles to support G600 deliveries in the second half as well.
Next, Combat Systems. At Combat, revenue of $1.74 billion was almost the same as the year-ago quarter. The same holds true for operating earnings of $261 million and an operating margin of 15%. For the full year, revenue of $6.24 billion was up $292 million, just short of 5%. Operating earnings of $962 million were up $25 million on a 40 basis point contraction in margin, largely related to mix shift. By the way, this performance is reasonably consistent with the forecast we provided at this time last year. We enjoyed somewhat better revenue than our initial forecast, which was an increase of $200 million to $250 million over 2017. We actually grew revenue $292 million. We forecast operating earnings of $970 million and came in at $962 million, an $8 million shortfall largely attributable to the diplomatic issues that slowed production of the vehicle program in Canada in the fourth quarter.
We continue to see nice order activity in this group with fourth quarter orders of $2.19 billion, a book-to-bill of 1.3:1 in the quarter and 1:1 for the year. Tank orders alone are in excess of $1 billion.
We also continue to have significant international opportunities, particularly in Europe. We've been negotiating with Spain with respect to a program valued at $2 billion for Piranha vehicles. And of note, we acquired FWW, a qualified maintenance and service provider to the German Army and other international customers to enhance our position in the key market. FWW will become part of European Land Systems.
In our U.S. market, our Army customer is modernizing and providing a growing demand across our combat vehicles and munitions business. In short, this group had quite positive revenue growth, continued its history of strong margin performance and had very good order activity.
Next, Marine Systems. This is a really good news story across the board. Marine revenue of $2.3 billion was up $237 million, a stunning 11.5% over the year-ago quarter. Operating earnings of $213 million were up $46 million against the year-ago quarter, a 27.5% increase on a 120 basis point improvement in operating margins. This is very strong operating leverage in a growth environment. By the way, the sequential comparison is equally impressive. For the full year, revenue of $8.5 billion was up $498 million, in excess of 6%. Operating earnings for the year of $761 million were up $76 million, over 11% on a 40 basis point improvement in operating margin. At this time last year, we told you to expect revenue of $8.4 billion to $8.5 billion, and operating earnings of $735 million to $745 million. We came in at the higher end of the revenue range. Operating earnings of $761 million outperformed our forecast by $16 million to $26 million.
In response to the significant increased demand from our Navy customer across all 3 of our shipyards, we continued to invest in each of our yards with particular emphasis on Electric Boat, to prepare for increased production associated with the Block V of the Virginia submarine program and the new Columbia ballistic-missile submarine. As you may recall, Block V is a significant upgrade in size and performance requiring additional manufacturing capacity.
As you know, we have also increased our internal training programs as well as our public-private partnerships with Connecticut and Rhode Island to meet our need for skilled trades. At $243 million, CapEx in 2018 from Marine was more than double its depreciation for the year. For 2019, we again expect the Marine segment to command the larger share of our capital budget as we work toward satisfying the nation's need for its critical naval systems. So suffice it to say, we are poised to support our Navy customer as they increase the size of the fleet.
As you are aware, the Information and Systems Technology group has been realigned and reshaped into 2 separate segments. Mission Systems, their large C4ISR business, and GDIT, a leading provider of information solutions to the federal government and its agencies. That was supplemented in the second quarter of 2018 by the acquisition of CSRA. I'm going to ask Jason to interject some comparison data here that you might find relevant and helpful."

We originally guided to full year revenue for the former IS&T business group between $9.3 billion and $9.4 billion, and operating earnings of approximately $1,030,000,000. If we look at how Mission Systems and GDIT, excluding CSRA, did for the year, they combined for $9.325 billion in sales, so in line with our expectations. And that includes an organic growth rate of 4.3% for GDIT, notwithstanding the impact of several divestitures during the year. From an operating earnings perspective, they were actually closer to $1,050,000,000 on a combined basis, so somewhat better than we had expected. So all in all, a solid year for both businesses. As I alluded to, we also completed several portfolio-shaping activities in our GDIT segment during the year. These included the sale of a commercial health products business, CSRA's SETA business and our public-facing call centers. These divestitures of more than $1 billion of annualized sales enhance the group's focus on high-end solutions and high value-added customer needs."
274561,597394105,1644917,"General Dynamics Corporation, Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Jan 30, 2019",2019-01-30,"Earnings Calls","General Dynamics Corporation","Executives","So let's first address information technology. Information technology enjoyed revenue in the quarter of $2.38 billion and operating earnings of $194 million with an operating margin of 8.1%. Since the numbers for the fourth quarter of 2017 did not include",1020,"So let's first address information technology. Information technology enjoyed revenue in the quarter of $2.38 billion and operating earnings of $194 million with an operating margin of 8.1%. Since the numbers for the fourth quarter of 2017 did not include CSRA, comparison to the year-ago quarter are not particularly meaningful. However, sequentially, revenue is up $75 million, operating earnings up $37 million and operating margin up 130 basis points. Evidence of our continuing ability to extract cost synergies here.
For the year, revenue was $8.27 billion, and operating earnings were $608 million with a 7.4% margin. Once again, annual comparisons do not offer meaningful perspective since the prior year did not include CSRA.
Next, Mission Systems. Revenue in the quarter was essentially flat against the year-ago quarter, while operating earnings of $181 million were $6 million lower than the fourth quarter last year on a 40 basis point decrement in operating margin.
For the year, revenue of $4.73 billion was up $245 million or 5.5%. Operating earnings of $659 million were up $21 million or 3.3% due to a 30 basis point decline in operating margin, driven in part by mix. Book-to-bill for the year was somewhat above 1x, and we ended the year with a modestly higher backlog at $5.3 billion.
So on this call last year, on a company-wide basis, our forecast for 2018 was to expect revenue of $32.35 billion to $32.45 billion, operating earnings of $4.25 billion and an operating margin of 13.1%. As you know, we wound up with $36.2 billion on an organic basis. But on an organic basis, revenue was up $1.5 billion, $500 million more than forecast.
At the EPS line, we forecasted $10.90 to $11, and came in at $11.22, including the transaction costs related to CSRA, which were about $0.20 per share.
So let me provide our forecast for 2019 initially by business group and then on a company-wide rollup. In Aerospace, we expect 2019 revenue to be about $9.7 billion, but more than $1.2 billion on deliveries of approximately 145 business jets. Operating earnings will be slightly in excess of $1.5 billion with an operating margin rate of approximately 15.5%. The margin rate is lower than 2018 as a result of mix shift as well as a modest increase in preowned sales, which, again, generally carry no margin.
So revenue will be back-end loaded as will the margin rate. In general, the quarterly spread in revenue progression will look something like $2.2 billion, $2.3 billion, $2.4 billion and $2.8 billion. Operating margin in the first 2 quarters should be in the mid-14% area, strengthening in Q3 and moving to well over 17% in Q4.
We believe that last year will be the low point in operating earnings during this transition to our new models with moderate -- modest earnings increase in 2019 and 2020 and significant earnings traction thereafter.
In Combat, we expect revenue to be between $6.5 billion and $6.6 billion, a $250 million to $350 million increase over 2018 with operating earnings up $965 million to $975 million, slightly better than last year. Here again, look for both revenue, earnings and margin rate to grow quarter-over-quarter during the year with a particularly strong fourth quarter. We continue to see solid growth for this business with orders for the Abram and solid demand for Stryker vehicles and munitions.
We see domestic volumes expanding faster than our international business. The Marine Group is expected to have revenue of approximately $9 billion, a 6% or $500 million increase over 2018. Operating earnings in 2019 are anticipated to be about $770 million with an operating margin rate around 8.5%.
We anticipate growth at each of the yards with mix being reflected in margins. We continue to see long-term growth with an expanding need for submarines, surface combatant, support ships and overhaul work. Our biggest opportunity here is around outperforming the forecasted margin rate. We respect -- we expect Information Technology revenue in 2019 of approximately $8.3 billion, consistent with 2018 with margins in the 7.5% range, a slight improvement over 2018's performance.
To the plus side, we have a full year CSRA offset by the divestitures of the call centers and SETA businesses, which represented just over $1 billion of prior year revenues. We see the business making excellent progress toward optimizing the acquisition as we combine teams, deeply integrate business systems, consolidate facilities and increase our value proposition to diverse defense, intel and federal civilian agencies.
For Mission Systems, we expect revenue in 2019 somewhere between $4.8 billion and $4.9 billion, an increase of just over $100 million, or between 2% to 3%. We see strong growth in our maritime, cyber and space-related markets, with fairly steady top line in our core tactical network incumbencies.
We anticipating operating earnings up modestly over last year with margins in the mid -- between mid- and high 13s, once again, building throughout the year. So for 2019, company-wide, all of this rolls up to approximately $38.5 billion of revenue, up by 6% over 2018. Operating earnings of $4.5 billion and an operating margin of around 11.7%. This gives us an EPS forecast of $11.60 to $11.70 per fully diluted share.
I may emphasize that this plan is purely from operations. It assumes a low 18% tax provision and assumes we buy only enough shares to hold the share count steady with year-end figures so as to avoid dilution from option exercises. So much like last year, beating our EPS guidance must come from outperforming the operating plan, achieving a lower effective tax rate and the effective deployment of capital. With respect to the quarterly progression for EPS, the first quarter should be seasonally low at about 20% of the full year's results. The second quarter should be more than 10% better than that and the third quarter should account for over 25% of EPS and the final quarter of the year could represent about 1/3 of our EPS.
So now let me turn this over to Jason for additional commentary around cash, backlog and other items, and then we'll take your questions."

Our net interest expense in the quarter was $112 million, bringing interest expense for the year to $356 million. That compares to $27 million and $103 million in the comparable periods of 2017. The increase in 2018 is due to the roughly",709,"Thank you, Phebe. Our net interest expense in the quarter was $112 million, bringing interest expense for the year to $356 million. That compares to $27 million and $103 million in the comparable periods of 2017. The increase in 2018 is due to the roughly $10 billion of debt we issued to finance the acquisition of CSRA.
We repaid approximately $1.7 billion of this debt during the year and will continue to prioritize paying down debt consistent with our mid-A credit rating. We ended the year with $850 million of commercial paper outstanding, and our next scheduled fixed debt maturity is in the second quarter of 2020. For 2019, we expect interest expense to be approximately $430 million, reflecting a full year of the notes issued in 2018. Our effective tax rate was 19.7% for the quarter and 17.8% for the year, in line with our previous guidance.
Looking ahead to 2019, we expect a full year effective tax rate in the low 18% range, between 18% and 18.5%. This is slightly higher than 2018, but recall, in 2018, we took advantage of a onetime benefit provided by tax reform and made a $255 million discretionary pension contribution, which lowered the tax rate by approximately 75 basis points. Looking at capital deployment, we paid $274 million in dividends in the fourth quarter, bringing the full year to $1.1 billion. We also took advantage of the market decline in December by purchasing our shares to a greater degree than planned. In the quarter, we purchased 7.6 million shares of our stock for $1.3 billion, bringing the full year to 10.1 million shares for $1.8 billion.
Looking ahead, while debt repayment will continue to be a priority, as I mentioned, we continue to have the flexibility to adjust our capital deployment in response to changing market conditions, as we did in December.
Moving on to our pension plans, we contributed approximately $570 million to our plans in 2018, including the discretionary contribution. For 2019, we expect that amount to be approximately $200 million to be contributed mostly during the third quarter. We've also ramped up our capital expenditures, which were almost 2% of sales for the year, that's up 60% from 2017 as we invest to support the growth of our businesses, particularly Marine Systems and Aerospace. For 2019, we expect capital expenditures to rise to 3% of sales, driven by the continued investment in the Columbia-class program.
Our free cash flow conversion rate for the quarter was 200%, bringing our rate for the year to 78% excluding the discretionary pension contribution, and this is below our typical 100% conversion target.
If you're following the headlines out of Canada, you know there are discussions taking place between the Canadian government and their customer on our armored vehicle supply contract. As a result of these discussions, we've experienced payment delays that significantly impacted the free cash flow we expected last year. To be clear, this is a timing issue, and we expect to receive the delayed payments this year.
Assuming the resolution of this matter, we expect a cash conversion rate well in excess of 100% in 2019, and looking ahead, we expect cash performance throughout the planning horizon to be very strong, in our typical 90% to 100% range.
And one last point on backlog. We ended the year with total backlog of approximately $68 billion, that's up 7.5% over this time last year. That increase came in spite of a headwind from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which reduced the backlog by $840 million, $700 million of which impacted the Combat Systems group.
Beyond the firm backlog, our total potential contract value, which includes options and IDIQ arrangements, increased by an impressive 17.5% over the end of last year, including the multibillion dollar CHS-5 IDIQ award at Mission Systems. In addition, we entered into a $1.1 billion contract with an existing corporate customer for a multi-airplane multiyear order that requires their board approval this quarter. Once approved, that order will move into the firm backlog. So these awards along with the firm backlog provide a nice foundation for the continued growth we see ahead. Howard, that concludes my remarks, and I'll turn it back over to you for the Q&A."

In a growing environment last year, they had a 1:1 book-to-bill. They also had a 75% win rate and a $26 billion pipeline. This management team is performing the cost synergies beautifully and frankly is a bit of ahead of schedule. By the way, this is a very energetic, innovative management team that is really making GDIT into the workplace of preference. And in this market, people are absolutely critical. They're important across the board, but people here truly matter. I might also add the cash performance on this business is outstanding. Last year, they generated over 100% in net income in cash and will continue that this year and for the years to come. So what we see this year, despite that large -- backlog -- despite the large win rate and book-to-bill is this is simply a question of timing when the contracts move from the backlog into sales, and you'll see the growth rate increase in the third quarter, fourth quarter and then significantly next year. This is just a question of the timing of several hundred contracts moving from backlog into sales. That also is impacting the margin rate. So look, I'm very confident in the ability of this business to perform. They're going to outperform their cost synergies. They're growing, great cash performance. So in the instance right now, it's simply a question of timing."

If you look at the 7.4% margin rate that we reported for the year for the group, if you normalize that for the amortization burden that came",417,"And, David, if you want me to -- I'll add a little bit of additional color around your inference on margin rates. If you look at the 7.4% margin rate that we reported for the year for the group, if you normalize that for the amortization burden that came with the CSRA acquisition and take that out, you actually end up with a margin rate of 9.6% for the year. So that's a couple hundred basis points better than we reported and about 110 basis points better than the year-ago 2017 full year rate. That's really driven by the CSRA contribution from an operations perspective, if you will. So they actually contributed approximately 10.9% incremental margins of the core business, excluding that amortization benefit. Now when you look ahead to next year, when you take the puts and takes on the revenue side between the additional quarter of CSRA volume offset by the divestitures, we're nominally up. Let's just call it notionally flat, but nominally up. So even though we do have because of the accelerating amortization schedule that we have for this business, even though we do have a somewhat declining quarterly amortization burden, the fact that we have 4 full quarters of amortization versus a flattish to slightly nose up total top line is actually, perhaps, counterintuitively a little bit of a margin drag for next year. It'll start to accelerate for the following year once we have a full-up year-on-year comparison. So if you think of that amortization as really, call it, a 20 -- I'll call it a 20-ish basis point drag. And the other part of it is we do have synergies, as Phebe mentioned, that are accelerating. So I'd call that maybe an 80 to 90 basis point assist as we go forward, and we'll continue to accelerate after that. And then from a mix perspective, as she alluded to, when we talked about this for some time after the acquisition, we did forecast, call it, 100 to 150 basis point contraction overall in the incremental CSRA margins over the next 3, 4 years. So, call it, 50 basis points or so from that. So if you take the 20-ish basis points on amortization, call it, 50 basis points on mix, offset by a positive 80 to 90 basis point improvement from synergies, you get, call it, 10 to 20 basis point net improvement for the year. And we would see it accelerating after that. So hopefully, that color is helpful."

So as I mentioned, we did have, in the fourth quarter, a fairly large contract signed up with an existing commercial customer. It was valued at just over $1 billion. It's a multi-aircraft, multiyear arrangement that spans out over several years. That did not go into the firm backlog because that order is actually subject to that customer's board approval coming up later this quarter. So we expect that to happen this quarter, and will move into the firm backlog and be counted as traditional orders at the time, but given the maturity of that and where it was in the quarter, that's why we put it in the -- as we typically are conservative on these notions, we put it in the potential contract value bucket versus in the firm backlog till we get to that firm order."

Earlier today, we reported earnings of $2.56 per diluted share on revenue just shy of $9.3 billion, operating earnings of slightly over $1 billion and net income of $745 million. Revenue was up 23% against the first q",1964,"Thanks, Howard, and good morning all. Earlier today, we reported earnings of $2.56 per diluted share on revenue just shy of $9.3 billion, operating earnings of slightly over $1 billion and net income of $745 million. Revenue was up 23% against the first quarter of 2018 due in large part to the acquisition of CSRA. However, without CSRA, revenue was up an impressive 9.6% on a purely organic basis. In fact, there was organic revenue growth across all 5 operating segments. 
EPS of $2.56 was $0.14 better than consensus. It would appear that revenue was some $400 million higher than anticipated by the sell side, and operating earnings were about $40 million higher. Operating earnings of slightly over $1 billion were our just ahead of the year ago results, despite modest declines at Aerospace, Marine and Combat Systems. The results benefited from the combination of CSRA with GDIT. 
While the operating margin of 10.9% in the quarter was good, it did not compare favorably to last year's stellar first quarter of 13.4%, which was before the inclusion of amortization from the CSRA transaction. 
Net earnings are down [ $54 ] million over the same quarter in 2018. Higher interest expense, somewhat higher taxes were the cause of the lower net income. It follows that earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.09 below the first quarter 2018, a 3% drop. 
Apart from the impressive revenue growth, an important part of the story in the quarter was order intake and growth in backlog. Total backlog grew to $69.2 billion, an increase of $1.34 billion compared to the end of last year. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, the book-to-bill for the company was an impressive 1.2, broken down to 1.1:1 for Defense and 1.4:1 for Aerospace. 
Let me discuss each group and provide some color where appropriate. First Aerospace. Aerospace revenue of $2.2 billion was $450 million or 22.7% ahead of the year ago period. This was attributable in large part to the delivery of 7 G500s in the quarter and a solid increase in service revenue. The moderately lower operating earnings were related to the mix shift at Gulfstream from the delivery of the G500s. These planes carry the burden of the test program and retrofit, as we previously advised. The margins on the aircraft will improve markedly through the year. 
At year-end, we had indicated that Aerospace margins for the first 2 quarters would be in the mid-14% range, up somewhat from the 14.1% rate in the final period of 2018. At 14.6%, the margin was fractionally better than that indication. Excluding the adverse impact of margins from preowned sales, margins would have been about 40 basis points better. Based on our delivery profile and cost improvement, we continue to expect overall margins to improve, particularly so in the second half of the year. 
On the order front, activity in the quarter was very good. The book-to-bill at Aerospace was 1.4:1 dollar denominated. The Gulfstream book-to-bill was even better. We grew the backlog for the G650 and also expanded the G500 and 600 backlog. For the trailing 12 months, Aerospace book-to-bill was about 1.1:1. You can see more information on the quarter's deliveries and orders in Exhibit J to the press release. 
We anticipate that G600 will be certified late June, but timing is difficult to predict given the FAA's rigorous review process. Nonetheless, we expect certification of the 600 this quarter or early next. The deliveries will remain on track for the second half. 
While the pacing [indiscernible] for deliveries on the 500 and 600 is our ability to deliver nacelle, this is becoming less of an issue, as you can discern from deliveries of the G500 in the fourth quarter and the last quarter. Nacelle costs are increasingly under control, and we are producing very good quality. We expect all schedule issues to be behind us by midyear. 
So forgive me this commercial plug, but earlier this month, the G650 shattered a record for speed and range, demonstrating it unrivaled performance. The aircraft flew 8,379 nautical miles from Singapore to Tucson in 15 hours and 23 minutes, averaging Mach 0.85, beating the record just a few weeks earlier by the competitor's aircraft by 44 minutes. It is also interesting that the G650 traveled during that flight approximately 227 nautical miles further than the competitor's aircraft in considerably less time. This is to our knowledge the longest distance ever flown by any business aviation aircraft. This is of particular interest to customers who think that the range and speed at that range is of vital importance. 
Next, Combat. At Combat, revenue of $1.6 billion was [ 13.6% ] above the year ago quarter. On the other hand come operating earnings declined $18 million with an operating margin of 12.6%. Mix was a large factor behind the results. There was strong growth in the program and a ramp-up of Mobile Protected Firepower, another new program. Stryker volumes were down, but we ascribe that to timing. Munitions also delivered growth. We also took a onetime charge in the quarter related to the disposition of a legal dispute over the closeout of a lease at one of our former European operating sites. Absent that onetime item, earnings for this segment would have been up year-over-year. 
The diplomatic issues that have slowed production on the international vehicle program in Canada are in the process of being resolved. Once resolved, between the 2 countries, we will see a reduction in operating working capital and a corresponding increase in cash received. Backlog for this segment is lumpy with the fourth quarter traditionally seeing the highest order activity and the first quarter is the slowest. This year is no exception. The $2.2 billion in orders received in Q4 followed by the approximately $1.2 billion in orders received this quarter is a good line of sight for the production planning and continuous improvement methodology. 
Of note, Stryker backlog grew in the first quarter, and the Army added funding to the [indiscernible], the next generation of the Abrams' main battle tank. Stryker is a very flexible platform, and the Army continues to find additional systems and weapons that we are integrating onto the vehicles. Integration of new capabilities on to our vehicles leverages our investment. Our intimate knowledge of the platform and ensures that the Army receives its programs reliably and affordably. 
We also continue to see opportunities to expand the ordnance and tactical munitions business as the Army refreshes its ordinance and ammo stockpile. We continue to have significant international opportunities throughout Middle and Eastern Europe as well as the Pacific regions. 
Next, Marine Systems. Marine revenues of $2.1 billion was up slightly and operating earnings of $180 million were down $4 million against the year ago quarter. Operating margins were 8.7% with our guidance for the year at 8.5%. We are modestly ahead of target. We have delivered the 17th ship of the Virginia class program and have another 11 in various stages of construction. With respect to Columbia, we are 97% complete with the detailed design and nearly 43% complete with the construction design drawings. We will be at 83% complete at the start of construction, far in excess of historical design completion metrics for any class of warship. We have begun long-lead material construction on Columbia and will begin full construction of the first ship late next year. 
In response to the significant increase in demand from our Navy customer across all 3 of our shipyards, we continue to invest in each of our yards with particular efforts at Electric Boat to prepare for the higher production associated with Block V of the Virginia program and the new Columbia ballistic-missile submarine. As you may recall, both Columbia and the Block V represent a significant increased in size and performance, requiring additional manufacturing capacity and different logistics infrastructure to transport the larger modules from [indiscernible] point to the waterfront [indiscernible] for final assembly and test. 
CapEx in 2018 for Marine Systems was $243 million, more than double its depreciation for the year. For 2019, we again expect the Marine segment to command the largest share of our capital budget, about half of our entire CapEx. So suffice it to say that we are poised to support our Navy customers as they seek to increase the size of their fleet. 
Next, Information Technology. For the quarter, IT generated revenue of $2.2 billion and operating earnings of $156 million with an operating margin of 7.2%. Since the numbers for the first quarter 2018 did not include CSRA, comparisons to the year ago quarter are not meaningful. 
Revenue of $2.2 billion is up by over $1 billion, but is down about $200 million sequentially, over half of which is attributable to the divestiture of the call centers and the remaining to the winding down of several mature programs replaced by the ramp-up of new programs. Margin of 7.2% is lower than Q4 due to mix, but a bit better than Q2 and Q3 of 2018. 
If you look at our EBITDA margin, it is 12.4%, including state and local taxes in the operating results. If these taxes were carried below the line, as in the case of the most competitors in this segment, it would add approximately 50 basis points to our results. This places the business in the best-in-class category for its industry. 
The integration has gone well and is a bit ahead of our plan we put in place last year. We are taking the best of the 2 legacy companies and building a highly competitive enterprise, with the scale and the resources to create value for our customers and our shareholders. GDIT's book-to-bill for the quarter was 1.1:1; and for the trailing 4 quarters, it is over 1:1. This business is growing and is positioned for growth going forward. 
The first quarter includes some notable wins, a $490 million contract from [indiscernible] to support Pentagon network infrastructure, a $125 million for helicopter training and simulation at Fort [indiscernible], $580 million for several classified programs and a myriad of additional wins across the portfolio. 
Finally, for Mission Systems, revenue rose by 5.5% compared to the year ago quarter, while operating earnings of $148 million were $2 million higher than the first quarter of last year, with a 50 basis point decrement in operating margins attributable solely to mix. Book-to-bill for the quarter was 1x following 1:1 book-to-bill for this -- for each of the last 2 years. As you can see, we ended the quarter with a backlog of $5.3 billion, essentially level with the prior quarter and with the year ago quarter. Demand was broad-based across many of the space and naval programs. Army ground systems activity was particularly strong. 
So in my view, we are off to a good start to the year. The story in the fourth quarter was about revenue and backlog growth. Orders [ at ] $10.7 billion across our businesses provide us with good operational visibility. Our ongoing focus on productivity provides the opportunity to deliver very good results. As we begin this quarter, we expect our second quarter performance to be very similar to the first quarter from an EPS perspective. 
You may recall that we do not, as a practice, change guidance at the end of the first quarter. It is our practice to give you a full review of our expectations at midyear -- at midpoint during the year. Suffice it to say that we are a bit ahead of the operating plan upon which our guidance was based. As always, will work to consolidate our improvement and strive to continue to improve our results. 
Let me turn this over to Jason for additional commentary and then take your questions."
274561,609741096,1703447,"General Dynamics Corporation, Q1 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2019",2019-04-24,"Earnings Calls","General Dynamics Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. Net interest expense in the quarter was $117 million versus $27 million in the first quarter of 2018. The increase in 2019 is due to the debt we issued to finance the acquisition of CSRA. We are also carrying more comme",484,"Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. Net interest expense in the quarter was $117 million versus $27 million in the first quarter of 2018. The increase in 2019 is due to the debt we issued to finance the acquisition of CSRA. We are also carrying more commercial paper than anticipated due to delayed payments on one of our large international vehicle programs in Canada. Our free cash flow of negative $976 million was impacted by these payment delays, and as we've discussed previously, this is a timing item. 
On the capital deployment front, capital expenditures of $181 million in the quarter were up about 75% from the year ago quarter, as we invest in our shipyards to support the significant growth that's on the horizon. We still expect this year to be the peak at approximately 3% of revenues and returning to the 2% range thereafter. 
In the quarter, we paid $268 million in dividends, and we spent $86 million on the repurchase of 525,000 of our shares. We plan to acquire enough shares in 2019 to ensure there is no dilution from the exercise of employee stock options. Otherwise, we anticipate deploying the balance of our free cash flow this year to pay down our short-term borrowings. 
We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $673 million on the balance sheet and a net debt position of $12.9 billion. Our effective tax rate was 18.6% for the quarter, which is consistent with our full year tax rate guidance. As Phebe noted, order activity and backlog were a particularly strong story in the quarter, as 4 of our 5 segment posted a book-to-bill of 1:1 or greater, even as we grew almost 10% organically. 
On that note, I think it bears a reminder that not all companies report book-to-bill on the same basis. We calculate this measure based on a firm backlog as reported under generally accepted accounting principles, excluding the value associated with IDIQ contracts. That's, of course, most relevant to Mission Systems and GDIT, each of which had a book-to-bill of 1:1 or greater, even under the more conservative GAAP definition. 
We finished the quarter with a total backlog of $69.2 billion, that's up 2% over year-end 2018 and up 11% over this time a year ago. The total potential contract value including options and IDIQ contracts was $103 billion, consistent with year-end and up almost 18% over year ago. 
As one final item I'd like to highlight, we adopted the new lease accounting standard effective January 1 of this year on a perspective basis. We recorded a $1.4 billion liability for our operating leases along with a corresponding asset. This creates a visible change in our other assets and liabilities on the balance sheet, but otherwise has no impact on our net earnings or cash flows. 
Howard, that concludes my remarks, I'll turn it back over to you for Q&A."

So they're modernizing the our existing fleet in addition to developing new potential platforms. And we -- that existing fleet is our program, right? Stryker and Abrams have seen considerable increases in their budget funding lines because the Army needs those vehicles. The Abrams remains an outstanding tank, and the upgrade in the version 4 really not your father's Abrams. It is a more capable, more survivable, more lethal system. As is Stryker. So we think those 2 core franchise programs are off to a very, very good start. We work very closely with our Army customers and understand their demands and their requirements and how they think about the war fight. And so we position ourselves and our investment dollars and also thinking about the art [indiscernible] possible for them on how we can help them meet their objective. That's certainly true on the franchise programs I've just talked about, but also on new programs. What is in the order of the possible, what's doable, how fast can you do it and what's it going to cost you? And the key there is to have the trust with your Army customer who believes that the estimate that you give them is reliable. So we've had a -- we're very aligned with our Army customer, know where they're headed, and I frankly like everything that I see here. And that's on the big vehicle programs. When I look at our munitions business, our munitions business is growing. I think we grew 10% in the quarter. And we've had a book-to-bill that's been very wholesome because as we increase our operational training temp, our munitions and armament increase demand. So outside the United States, in North America, outside the United States, we see some recapitalization in the U.K. and Canada, where we've had decade-long presence for both of those countries, throughout NATO and heavily Eastern in Europe. The world is getting a more dangerous place, and unfortunately, that creates a demand for our products. Our European Land Systems has multiple opportunities out -- throughout the former Soviet border states and Eastern Bloc and domestically and elsewhere.

Earlier today, we reported earnings of $2.56 per diluted share on revenue just shy of $9.3 billion, operating earnings of slightly over $1 billion and net income of $745 million. Revenue was up 23% against the first q",1956,"Thanks, Howard, and good morning all. Earlier today, we reported earnings of $2.56 per diluted share on revenue just shy of $9.3 billion, operating earnings of slightly over $1 billion and net income of $745 million. Revenue was up 23% against the first quarter of 2018 due in large part to the acquisition of CSRA. However, without CSRA, revenue was up an impressive 9.6% on a purely organic basis. In fact, there was organic revenue growth across all 5 operating segments. 
EPS of $2.56 was $0.14 better than consensus. It would appear that revenue was some $400 million higher than anticipated by the sell-side, and operating earnings were about $40 million higher. Operating earnings of slightly over $1 billion were our just ahead of the year ago results despite modest declines in Aerospace, Marine and Com Systems. The results benefited from the combination of CSRA with GDIT.  
While the operating margin of 10.9% in the quarter was good, it did not compare favorably to last year's stellar first quarter of 13.4%, which was before the inclusion of amortization from the CSRA transaction. 
Net earnings are down $54 million over the same quarter in 2018. Higher interest expense, somewhat higher taxes were the cause of the lower net income. It follows that earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.09 below the first quarter 2018, a 3% drop. 
Apart from the impressive revenue growth, an important part of the story in the quarter was order intake and growth in backlog. Total backlog grew to $69.2 billion, an increase of $1.34 billion compared to the end of last year. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, the book-to-bill for the company was an impressive 1.2, broken down into 1.1:1 for Defense and 1.4:1 for Aerospace. 
Let me discuss each group and provide some color where appropriate. First Aerospace. Aerospace revenue of $2.2 billion was $415 million or 22.7% ahead of the year ago period. This was attributable in large part to the delivery of 7 G500s in the quarter and a solid increase in service revenue. The moderately lower operating earnings were related to the mix shift at Gulfstream from the delivery of the G500s. These planes carry the burden of the test program and retrofit as we previously advised. The margins on the aircraft will improve markedly through the year. 
At year-end, we had indicated that Aerospace margins for the first 2 quarters would be in the mid-14% range, up somewhat from the 14.1% rate in the final period of 2018. At 14.6%, the margin was fractionally better than that indication. Excluding the adverse impact of margins from preowned sales, margins would have been about 40 basis points better. Based on our delivery profile and cost improvement, we continue to expect overall margins to improve, particularly so in the second half of the year. 
On the order front, activity in the quarter was very good. The book-to-bill at Aerospace was 1.4:1 dollar denominated. The Gulfstream book-to-bill was even better. We grew the backlog for the G650 and also expanded the Gs 500 and 600 backlog. For the trailing 12 months, Aerospace book-to-bill was about 1.1:1. You can see more information on the quarter's deliveries and orders in Exhibit J to the press release.  
We anticipate that G600 will be certified late June, but timing is difficult to predict given the FAA's rigorous review process. Nonetheless, we expect certification of the 600 this quarter or early next. Deliveries will remain on track for the second half. 
While the pacing items for deliveries on the 500 and 600 is our ability to deliver nacelle, this is becoming less of an issue as you can discern from deliveries of the G500 in the fourth quarter and the last quarter. Nacelle costs are increasingly under control, and we are producing very good quality. We expect all schedule issues to be behind us by midyear. 
So forgive me this commercial plug, but earlier this month, the G650 shattered a record for speed and range demonstrating its unrivaled performance. The aircraft flew 8,379 nautical miles from Singapore to Tucson in 15 hours and 23 minutes, averaging Mach 0.85, beating the record inside just a few weeks earlier by the competitor's aircraft by 44 minutes. It is also interesting that the G650 traveled during that flight approximately 227 nautical miles further than the competitor's aircraft in considerably less time. This is to our knowledge the longest distance ever flown by any business aviation aircraft. This is of particular interest to customers who think that the range and speed at that range is of vital importance. 
Next, Combat. At Combat, revenue of $1.6 billion was 13.6% above the year ago quarter. On the other hand, operating earnings declined $18 million with an operating margin of 12.6%. Mix was a large factor behind the results. There was strong growth in the Abrams program and a ramp-up of Mobile Protected Firepower, another new program. Stryker volumes were down, but we ascribe that to timing. Munitions also delivered growth. We also took a onetime charge in the quarter related to the disposition of a legal dispute over the closeout of a lease at one of our former European operating sites. Absent that onetime item, earnings for this segment would have been up year-over-year. 
The diplomatic issues that have slowed production on the international vehicle program in Canada are in the process of being resolved. Once resolved, between the 2 countries, we will see a reduction in operating working capital and a corresponding increase in cash received. Backlog for this segment is lumpy with the fourth quarter traditionally seeing the highest order activity and the first quarter the slowest. This year was no exception. The $2.2 billion in orders received in Q4 followed by the approximately $1.2 billion in orders received this quarter is of good line of sight for our production planning and continuous improvement methodology. 
Of note, Stryker backlog grew in the first quarter, and the Army added funding to the SEPv4, the next generation of the Abrams' main battle tank. Stryker is a very flexible platform, and the Army continues to find additional systems and weapons that we are integrating onto the vehicles. Integration of new capabilities onto our vehicles leverages our investment. Our intimate knowledge of the platform ensures that the Army receives its programs reliably and affordably. 
We also continue to see opportunities to expand the ordnance and tactical munition business as the Army refreshes its ordnance and ammo stockpiles. We continue to have significant international opportunities throughout NATO and Eastern Europe as well as the Pacific regions. 
Next, Marine Systems. Marine revenues of $2.1 billion was up slightly and operating earnings of $180 million were down $4 million against the year ago quarter. Operating margins were 8.7% with our guidance for the year at 8.5%. We are modestly ahead of target. We have delivered the 17th ship of the Virginia class program and have another 11 in various stages of construction. With respect to Columbia, we are 97% complete with the detailed design and nearly 43% complete with the construction design drawings. We will be at 83% complete at the start of construction, far in excess of historical design completion metrics for any class of warships. We have begun long-lead material construction on Columbia and will begin full construction of the first ship late next year.  
In response to the significant increase in demand from our Navy customer across all 3 of our shipyards, we continue to invest in each of our yards with particular emphasis on Electric Boat to prepare for the higher production associated with Block V of the Virginia program and the new Columbia ballistic-missile submarine. As you may recall, both Columbia and the Block V represent a significant increased in size and performance requiring additional manufacturing capacity and different logistics infrastructure to transport the larger modules from Quonset Point to the waterfront in Groton for final assembly and test. 
CapEx in 2018 for Marine Systems was $243 million, more than double its depreciation for the year. For 2019, we again expect the Marine segment to command the largest share of our capital budget, about half of our entire CapEx. So suffice it to say that we are poised to support our Navy customers as they seek to increase the size of their fleet. 
Next, Information Technology. For the quarter, IT generated revenue of $2.2 billion and operating earnings of $156 million with an operating margin of 7.2%. Since the numbers for the first quarter 2018 did not include CSRA, comparisons to the year ago quarter are not meaningful. 
Revenue of $2.2 billion is up by over $1 billion, but is down about $200 million sequentially, over half of which is attributable to the divestiture of the call centers and the remaining to the winding down of several mature programs replaced by the ramp-up of new programs. Margin of 7.2% is lower than Q4 due to mix, but a bit better than Q2 and Q3 of 2018. 
If you look at our EBITDA margin, it is 12.4% including state and local taxes in the operating results. If these taxes were carried below the line, as in the case for most competitors in this segment, it would add approximately 50 basis points to our results. This places the business in the best-in-class category for its industry. 
The integration has gone well and is a bit ahead of our plan we put in place last year. We are taking the best of the 2 legacy companies and building a highly competitive enterprise with the scale and the resources to create value for our customers and our shareholders. GDIT's book-to-bill for the quarter was 1.1:1 and for the trailing 4 quarters, it is over 1:1. This business is growing and is positioned for growth going forward. 
The first quarter includes some notable wins, a $490 million contract from DISA to support Pentagon network infrastructure, a $125 million for helicopter training and simulation at Fort Rucker, $580 million for several classified programs and a myriad of additional wins across the portfolio. 
Finally, for Mission Systems, revenue rose by 5.5% compared to the year ago quarter while operating earnings of $148 million were $2 million higher than the first quarter of last year, with a 50 basis point decrement in operating margins attributable solely to mix. Book-to-bill for the quarter was 1x following 1:1 book-to-bill for this -- for each of the last 2 years. As you can see, we ended the quarter with the backlog of $5.3 billion, essentially level with the prior quarter and with the year ago quarter. Demand was broad-based across many of their space and naval programs. Army ground systems activity was particularly strong. 
So in my view, we are off to a good start to the year. The story in the first quarter was about revenue and backlog growth. Orders of $10.7 billion across our businesses provide us with good operational visibility. Our ongoing focus on productivity provides the opportunity to deliver very good results. As we begin this quarter, we expect our second quarter performance to be very similar to the first quarter from an EPS perspective. 
You may recall that we do not, as a practice, change guidance at the end of the first quarter. It is our practice to give you a full review of our expectations at midyear -- at midpoint during the year. Suffice it to say that we are a bit ahead of the operating plan upon which our guidance was based. As always, we will work to consolidate our improvement and strive to continue to improve our results. 
Let me turn this over to Jason for additional commentary and then take your questions."
274561,609741096,1703625,"General Dynamics Corporation, Q1 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2019",2019-04-24,"Earnings Calls","General Dynamics Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. Net interest expense in the quarter was $117 million versus $27 million in the first quarter of 2018. The increase in 2019 is due to the debt we issued to finance the acquisition of CSRA. We are also carrying more comme",486,"Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. Net interest expense in the quarter was $117 million versus $27 million in the first quarter of 2018. The increase in 2019 is due to the debt we issued to finance the acquisition of CSRA. We are also carrying more commercial paper than anticipated due to delayed payments on one of our large international vehicle programs in Canada. Our free cash flow of negative $976 million was impacted by these payment delays and as we've discussed previously, this is a timing item. 
On the capital deployment front, capital expenditures of $181 million in the quarter were up about 75% from the year ago quarter as we invest in our shipyards to support the significant growth that's on the horizon. We still expect this year to be the peak at approximately 3% of revenues and returning to the 2% range thereafter. 
In the quarter, we paid $268 million in dividends, and we spent $86 million on the repurchase of 525,000 of our shares. We plan to acquire enough shares in 2019 to ensure there is no dilution from the exercise of employee stock options. Otherwise, we anticipate deploying the balance of our free cash flow this year to pay down our short-term borrowings. 
We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $673 million on the balance sheet and a net debt position of $12.9 billion. Our effective tax rate was 18.6% for the quarter, which is consistent with our full year tax rate guidance. As Phebe noted, order activity and backlog were a particularly strong story in the quarter, as 4 of our 5 segments posted a book-to-bill of 1:1 or greater even as we grew almost 10% organically. 
On that note, I think it bears a reminder that not all companies report book-to-bill on the same basis. We calculate this measure based on the firm backlog as reported under generally accepted accounting principles excluding the value associated with IDIQ contracts. That's, of course, most relevant to Mission Systems and GDIT, each of which had a book-to-bill of 1:1 or greater even under the more conservative GAAP definition. 
We finished the quarter with a total backlog of $69.2 billion, that's up 2% over year-end 2018 and up 11% over this time a year ago. The total potential contract value including options and IDIQ contracts was $103 billion consistent with year-end and up almost 18% over a year ago. 
As one final item I'd like to highlight, we adopted the new lease accounting standard effective January 1 of this year on a perspective basis. We recorded a $1.4 billion liability for our operating leases along with a corresponding asset. This creates a visible change in our other assets and liabilities on the balance sheet, but otherwise has no impact on our net earnings or cash flows. 
Howard, that concludes my remarks, I'll turn it back over to you for the Q&A."

After the hot wars, they had utilized a lot of their equipment. And as their budgets drove down rather precipitously, they did not have the resource to go and recapitalize. But they do now and that's exactly what they're doing. So they're modernizing their existing fleet in addition to developing new potential platforms. And we -- that existing fleet is our programs, right? Stryker and Abrams have seen considerable increases in their budget funding lines because the Army needs those vehicles. The Abrams remains an outstanding tank and the upgrade in the version 4 is really not your father's Abrams. It is a more capable, more survivable, more lethal system. As is Stryker. So we think those 2 core franchise programs were also in very, very good stead. We work very closely with our Army customers and understand their demands and their requirements and how they think about the war fight. And so we position ourselves and our investment dollars and also thinking about the art of the possible for them on how we can help them meet their objective. That's certainly true on the franchise programs I've just talked about, but also on new programs. What is in the art of the possible? What's doable? How fast can you do it? And what's it going to cost you? And the key there is to have the trust of your Army customer who believes that the estimates that you give them are reliable. 
So we've had a -- we're very aligned with our Army customer, know where they're headed and I frankly like everything that I see here. And that's on the big vehicle programs. When I look at our munitions business, our munitions business is growing. I think we grew 10% in the quarter. And we've had a book-to-bill there that's been very wholesome because as we increase our operational training tempo, our munitions and armaments, they increase demand. So outside the United States, in North America, outside the United States, we see some recapitalization in the U.K. and Canada, where we've decades-long presence in both of those countries, throughout NATO and heavily Eastern in Europe. The world is getting a more dangerous place, and -- unfortunately, but that is -- that creates demand for our products. Our European Land Systems has multiple opportunities throughout the former Soviet border states in Eastern Bloc and domestically and elsewhere.

Earlier today, we reported earnings of $2.56 per diluted share on revenue just shy of $9.3 billion, operating earnings of slightly over $1 billion and net income of $745 million. Revenue was up 23% against the first q",1956,"Thanks, Howard, and good morning all. Earlier today, we reported earnings of $2.56 per diluted share on revenue just shy of $9.3 billion, operating earnings of slightly over $1 billion and net income of $745 million. Revenue was up 23% against the first quarter of 2018 due in large part to the acquisition of CSRA. However, without CSRA, revenue was up an impressive 9.6% on a purely organic basis. In fact, there was organic revenue growth across all 5 operating segments. 
EPS of $2.56 was $0.14 better than consensus. It would appear that revenue was some $400 million higher than anticipated by the sell-side, and operating earnings were about $40 million higher. Operating earnings of slightly over $1 billion were just ahead of the year ago results despite modest declines in Aerospace, Marine and Com Systems. The results benefited from the combination of CSRA with GDIT.  
While the operating margin of 10.9% in the quarter was good, it did not compare favorably to last year's stellar first quarter of 13.4%, which was before the inclusion of amortization from the CSRA transaction. 
Net earnings are down $54 million over the same quarter in 2018. Higher interest expense, somewhat higher taxes were the cause of the lower net income. It follows that earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.09 below the first quarter 2018, a 3% drop. 
Apart from the impressive revenue growth, an important part of the story in the quarter was order intake and growth in backlog. Total backlog grew to $69.2 billion, an increase of $1.34 billion compared to the end of last year. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, the book-to-bill for the company was an impressive 1.2, broken down into 1.1:1 for Defense and 1.4:1 for Aerospace. 
Let me discuss each group and provide some color where appropriate. First Aerospace. Aerospace revenue of $2.2 billion was $415 million or 22.7% ahead of the year ago period. This was attributable in large part to the delivery of 7 G500s in the quarter and a solid increase in service revenue. The moderately lower operating earnings were related to the mix shift at Gulfstream from the delivery of the G500s. These planes carry the burden of the test program and retrofit as we've previously advised. The margins on the aircraft will improve markedly through the year. 
At year-end, we had indicated that Aerospace margins for the first 2 quarters would be in the mid-14% range, up somewhat from the 14.1% rate in the final period of 2018. At 14.6%, the margin was fractionally better than that indication. Excluding the adverse impact of margins from preowned sales, margins would have been about 40 basis points better. Based on our delivery profile and cost improvement, we continue to expect overall margins to improve, particularly so in the second half of the year. 
On the order front, activity in the quarter was very good. The book-to-bill at Aerospace was 1.4:1 dollar denominated. The Gulfstream book-to-bill was even better. We grew the backlog for the G650 and also expanded the Gs 500 and 600 backlog. For the trailing 12 months, Aerospace book-to-bill was about 1.1:1. You can see more information on the quarter's deliveries and orders in Exhibit J to the press release.  
We anticipate that G600 will be certified late June, but timing is difficult to predict given the FAA's rigorous review process. Nonetheless, we expect certification of the 600 this quarter or early next. Deliveries will remain on track for the second half. 
While the pacing items for deliveries on the 500 and 600 is our ability to deliver nacelles, this is becoming less of an issue as you can discern from deliveries of the G500 in the fourth quarter and the last quarter. Nacelle costs are increasingly under control, and we are producing very good quality. We expect all schedule issues to be behind us by midyear. 
So forgive me this commercial plug, but earlier this month, the G650 shattered a record for speed and range demonstrating its unrivaled performance. The aircraft flew 8,379 nautical miles from Singapore to Tucson in 15 hours and 23 minutes, averaging Mach 0.85, beating the record set just a few weeks earlier by the competitor's aircraft by 44 minutes. It is also interesting that the G650 traveled during that flight approximately 227 nautical miles further than the competitor's aircraft in considerably less time. This is to our knowledge the longest distance ever flown by any business aviation aircraft. This is of particular interest to customers who think that the range and speed at that range is of vital importance. 
Next, Combat. At Combat, revenue of $1.6 billion was 13.6% above the year ago quarter. On the other hand, operating earnings declined $18 million with an operating margin of 12.6%. Mix was a large factor behind the results. There was strong growth in the Abrams program and a ramp-up of Mobile Protected Firepower and other new programs. Stryker volumes were down, but we ascribe that to timing. Munitions also delivered growth. We also took a onetime charge in the quarter related to the disposition of a legal dispute over the closeout of a lease at one of our former European operating sites. Absent that onetime item, earnings for this segment would have been up year-over-year. 
The diplomatic issues that have slowed production on the international vehicle program in Canada are in the process of being resolved. Once resolved, between the 2 countries, we will see a reduction in operating working capital and a corresponding increase in cash received. Backlog for this segment is lumpy with the fourth quarter traditionally seeing the highest order activity and the first quarter the slowest. This year was no exception. The $2.2 billion in orders received in Q4 followed by the approximately $1.2 billion in orders received this quarter is a good line of sight for our production planning and continuous improvement methodology. 
Of note, Stryker backlog grew in the first quarter, and the Army added funding to the SEPv4, the next generation of the Abrams' main battle tank. Stryker is a very flexible platform, and the Army continues to find additional systems and weapons that we are integrating onto the vehicles. Integration of new capabilities onto our vehicles leverages our investment. Our intimate knowledge of the platform ensures that the Army receives its programs reliably and affordably. 
We also continue to see opportunities to expand the ordnance and tactical munition business as the Army refreshes its ordnance and ammo stockpiles. We continue to have significant international opportunities throughout NATO and Eastern Europe as well as the Pacific region. 
Next, Marine Systems. Marine revenues of $2.1 billion was up slightly and operating earnings of $180 million were down $4 million against the year ago quarter. Operating margins were 8.7% with our guidance for the year at 8.5%. We are modestly ahead of target. We have delivered the 17th ship of the Virginia class program and have another 11 in various stages of construction. With respect to Columbia, we are 97% complete with the detailed design and nearly 43% complete with the construction design drawings. We will be at 83% complete at the start of construction, far in excess of historical design completion metrics for any class of warships. We have begun long-lead material construction on Columbia and will begin full construction of the first ship late next year.  
In response to the significant increase in demand from our Navy customer across all 3 of our shipyards, we continue to invest in each of our yards with particular emphasis at Electric Boat to prepare for the higher production associated with Block V of the Virginia program and the new Columbia ballistic-missile submarine. As you may recall, both Columbia and the Block V represent a significant increase in size and performance requiring additional manufacturing capacity and different logistics infrastructure to transport the larger modules from Quonset Point to the waterfront at Groton for final assembly and test. 
CapEx in 2018 for Marine Systems was $243 million, more than double its depreciation for the year. For 2019, we again expect the Marine segment to command the largest share of our capital budget, about half of our entire CapEx. So suffice it to say that we are poised to support our Navy customer as they seek to increase the size of their fleet. 
Next, Information Technology. For the quarter, IT generated revenue of $2.2 billion and operating earnings of $156 million with an operating margin of 7.2%. Since the numbers for the first quarter 2018 did not include CSRA, comparisons to the year ago quarter are not meaningful. 
Revenue of $2.2 billion is up by over $1 billion, but is down about $200 million sequentially, over half of which is attributable to the divestiture of the call centers and the remaining to the winding down of several mature programs replaced by the ramp-up of new programs. Margin of 7.2% is lower than Q4 due to mix, but a bit better than Q2 and Q3 of 2018. 
If you look at our EBITDA margin, it is 12.4% including state and local taxes in the operating results. If these taxes were carried below the line, as in the case for most competitors in this segment, it would add approximately 50 basis points to our results. This places the business in the best-in-class category for its industry. 
The integration has gone well and is a bit ahead of the plan we put in place last year. We are taking the best of the 2 legacy companies and building a highly competitive enterprise with the scale and the resources to create value for our customers and our shareholders. GDIT's book-to-bill for the quarter was 1.1:1 and for the trailing 4 quarters, it is over 1:1. This business is growing and is positioned for growth going forward. 
The first quarter includes some notable wins, a $490 million contract from DISA to support Pentagon network infrastructure, a $125 million for helicopter training and simulation at Fort Rucker, $580 million for several classified programs and a myriad of additional wins across the portfolio. 
Finally, for Mission Systems, revenue rose by 5.5% compared to the year ago quarter while operating earnings of $148 million were $2 million higher than the first quarter of last year, with a 50 basis point decrement in operating margins attributable solely to mix. Book-to-bill for the quarter was 1x following 1:1 book-to-bill for this -- for each of the last 2 years. As you can see, we ended the quarter with a backlog of $5.3 billion, essentially level with the prior quarter and with the year ago quarter. Demand was broad-based across many of their space and naval programs. Army ground systems activity was particularly strong. 
So in my view, we are off to a good start to the year. The story in the first quarter was about revenue and backlog growth. Orders of $10.7 billion across our businesses provide us with good operational visibility. Our ongoing focus on productivity provides the opportunity to deliver very good results. As we begin this quarter, we expect our second quarter performance to be very similar to the first quarter from an EPS perspective. 
You may recall that we do not, as a practice, change guidance at the end of the first quarter. It is our practice to give you a full review of our expectations at midyear -- at midpoint during the year. Suffice it to say that we are a bit ahead of the operating plan upon which our guidance was based. As always, we will work to consolidate our improvement and strive to continue to improve our results. 
Let me turn this over to Jason for additional commentary and then take your questions."
274561,609741096,1703838,"General Dynamics Corporation, Q1 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2019",2019-04-24,"Earnings Calls","General Dynamics Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Phebe, and good morning.

The increase in 2019 is due to the debt we issued to finance the acquisition of CSRA. We are also carrying more commercial paper than anticipated due to delayed payments on one of our large international vehicle programs in Canada. Our free cash flow of negative $976 million was impacted by these payment delays and as we've discussed previously, this is a timing item. 
On the capital deployment front, capital expenditures of $181 million in the quarter were up about 75% from the year ago quarter as we invest in our shipyards to support the significant growth that's on the horizon. We still expect this year to be the peak at approximately 3% of revenues and returning to the 2% range thereafter. 
In the quarter, we paid $268 million in dividends, and we spent $86 million on the repurchase of 525,000 of our shares. We plan to acquire enough shares in 2019 to ensure there is no dilution from the exercise of employee stock options. Otherwise, we anticipate deploying the balance of our free cash flow this year to pay down our short-term borrowings. 
We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $673 million on the balance sheet and a net debt position of $12.9 billion. Our effective tax rate was 18.6% for the quarter, which is consistent with our full year tax rate guidance. As Phebe noted, order activity and backlog were a particularly strong story in the quarter, as 4 of our 5 segments posted a book-to-bill of 1:1 or greater even as we grew almost 10% organically. 
On that note, I think it bears a reminder that not all companies report book-to-bill on the same basis. We calculate this measure based on the firm backlog as reported under generally accepted accounting principles excluding the value associated with IDIQ contracts. That's, of course, most relevant to Mission Systems and GDIT, each of which had a book-to-bill of 1:1 or greater even under the more conservative GAAP definition. 
We finished the quarter with a total backlog of $69.2 billion, that's up 2% over year-end 2018 and up 11% over this time a year ago. The total potential contract value including options and IDIQ contracts was $103 billion consistent with year-end and up almost 18% over a year ago. 
There's one final item I'd like to highlight. We adopted the new lease accounting standard effective January 1 of this year on a prospective basis. We recorded a $1.4 billion liability for our operating leases along with a corresponding asset. This creates a visible change in our other assets and liabilities on the balance sheet, but otherwise has no impact on our net earnings or cash flows. 
Howard, that concludes my remarks, and I'll turn it back over to you for the Q&A."

After the hot wars, they had utilized a lot of their equipment. And as their budgets drove down rather precipitously, they did not have the resources to go and recapitalize. But they do now and that's exactly what they're doing. So they're modernizing their existing fleet in addition to developing new potential platforms. And we -- that existing fleet is our programs, right? Stryker and Abrams have seen considerable increases in their budget funding lines because the Army needs those vehicles. The Abrams remains an outstanding tank and the upgrade in the version 4 is really not your father's Abrams. It is a more capable, more survivable, more lethal system, as is Stryker. So we think those 2 core franchise programs for us are in very, very good stead. We work very closely with our Army customer to understand their demands and their requirements and how they think about the war fight. And so we position ourselves and our investment dollars and also thinking about the art of the possible for them on how we can help them meet their objective. That's certainly true on the franchise programs I've just talked about, but also on new programs. What is in the art of the possible? What's doable? How fast can you do it? And what's it going to cost you? And the key there is to have the trust of your Army customer who believes that the estimates that you give them are reliable. 
So we've had a -- we're very aligned with our Army customer, know where they're headed and I frankly like everything that I see here. And that's on the big vehicle programs. When I look at our munitions business, our munitions business is growing. I think we grew 10% in the quarter. And we've had a book-to-bill there that's been very wholesome because as we increase our operational training tempo, our munitions and armaments are in increased demand. So outside the United States, in North America, or outside the United States, we see some recapitalization in the U.K. and Canada, where we've decades-long presence in both of those countries, throughout NATO and heavily Eastern in Europe. The world is getting a more dangerous place, and -- unfortunately, but that is -- that creates demand for our products. Our European Land Systems has multiple opportunities throughout the former Soviet border states in Eastern Bloc and domestically and elsewhere. So threats drive funding and they drive the need for requirements. And unfortunately, we live in a world of increased threat."

274561,609741096,1704537,"General Dynamics Corporation, Q1 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2019",2019-04-24,"Earnings Calls","General Dynamics Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Howard, and good morning all. Earlier today, we reported earnings of $2.56 per diluted share on revenue just shy of $9.3 billion, operating earnings of slightly over $1 billion and net income of $745 million. Revenue was up 23% against the first q",1956,"Thanks, Howard, and good morning all. Earlier today, we reported earnings of $2.56 per diluted share on revenue just shy of $9.3 billion, operating earnings of slightly over $1 billion and net income of $745 million. Revenue was up 23% against the first quarter of 2018 due in large part to the acquisition of CSRA. However, without CSRA, revenue was up an impressive 9.6% on a purely organic basis. In fact, there was organic revenue growth across all 5 operating segments. 
EPS of $2.56 was $0.14 better than consensus. It would appear that revenue was some $400 million higher than anticipated by the sell-side, and operating earnings were about $40 million higher. Operating earnings of slightly over $1 billion were just ahead of the year ago results despite modest declines in Aerospace, Marine and Com Systems. The results benefited from the combination of CSRA with GDIT.  
While the operating margin of 10.9% in the quarter was good, it did not compare favorably to last year's stellar first quarter of 13.4%, which was before the inclusion of amortization from the CSRA transaction. 
Net earnings are down $54 million over the same quarter in 2018. Higher interest expense, somewhat higher taxes were the cause of the lower net income. It follows that earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.09 below the first quarter 2018, a 3% drop. 
Apart from the impressive revenue growth, an important part of the story in the quarter was order intake and growth in backlog. Total backlog grew to $69.2 billion, an increase of $1.34 billion compared to the end of last year. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, the book-to-bill for the company was an impressive 1.2, broken down into 1.1:1 for Defense and 1.4:1 for Aerospace. 
Let me discuss each group and provide some color where appropriate. First Aerospace. Aerospace revenue of $2.2 billion was $415 million or 22.7% ahead of the year ago period. This was attributable in large part to the delivery of 7 G500s in the quarter and a solid increase in service revenue. The moderately lower operating earnings were related to the mix shift at Gulfstream from the delivery of the G500s. These planes carry the burden of the test program and retrofit as we've previously advised. The margins on the aircraft will improve markedly through the year. 
At year-end, we had indicated that Aerospace margins for the first 2 quarters would be in the mid-14% range, up somewhat from the 14.1% rate in the final period of 2018. At 14.6%, the margin was fractionally better than that indication. Excluding the adverse impact of margins from preowned sales, margins would have been about 40 basis points better. Based on our delivery profile and cost improvement, we continue to expect overall margins to improve, particularly so in the second half of the year. 
On the order front, activity in the quarter was very good. The book-to-bill at Aerospace was 1.4:1 dollar denominated. The Gulfstream book-to-bill was even better. We grew the backlog for the G650 and also expanded the Gs 500 and 600 backlog. For the trailing 12 months, Aerospace book-to-bill was about 1.1:1. You can see more information on the quarter's deliveries and orders in Exhibit J to the press release.  
We anticipate that G600 will be certified late June, but timing is difficult to predict given the FAA's rigorous review process. Nonetheless, we expect certification of the 600 this quarter or early next. Deliveries will remain on track for the second half. 
While the pacing items for deliveries on the 500 and 600 is our ability to deliver nacelles, this is becoming less of an issue as you can discern from deliveries of the G500 in the fourth quarter and the last quarter. Nacelle costs are increasingly under control, and we are producing very good quality. We expect all schedule issues to be behind us by midyear. 
So forgive me this commercial plug, but earlier this month, the G650 shattered a record for speed and range demonstrating its unrivaled performance. The aircraft flew 8,379 nautical miles from Singapore to Tucson in 15 hours and 23 minutes, averaging Mach 0.85, beating the record set just a few weeks earlier by the competitor's aircraft by 44 minutes. It is also interesting that the G650 traveled during that flight approximately 227 nautical miles further than the competitor's aircraft in considerably less time. This is to our knowledge the longest distance ever flown by any business aviation aircraft. This is of particular interest to customers who think that the range and speed at that range is of vital importance. 
Next, Combat. At Combat, revenue of $1.6 billion was 13.6% above the year ago quarter. On the other hand, operating earnings declined $18 million with an operating margin of 12.6%. Mix was a large factor behind the results. There was strong growth in the Abrams program and a ramp-up of Mobile Protected Firepower and other new programs. Stryker volumes were down, but we ascribe that to timing. Munitions also delivered growth. We also took a onetime charge in the quarter related to the disposition of a legal dispute over the closeout of a lease at one of our former European operating sites. Absent that onetime item, earnings for this segment would have been up year-over-year. 
The diplomatic issues that have slowed production on the international vehicle program in Canada are in the process of being resolved. Once resolved, between the 2 countries, we will see a reduction in operating working capital and a corresponding increase in cash received. Backlog for this segment is lumpy with the fourth quarter traditionally seeing the highest order activity and the first quarter the slowest. This year was no exception. The $2.2 billion in orders received in Q4 followed by the approximately $1.2 billion in orders received this quarter is a good line of sight for our production planning and continuous improvement methodology. 
Of note, Stryker backlog grew in the first quarter, and the Army added funding to the SEPv4, the next generation of the Abrams' main battle tank. Stryker is a very flexible platform, and the Army continues to find additional systems and weapons that we are integrating onto the vehicles. Integration of new capabilities onto our vehicles leverages our investment. Our intimate knowledge of the platform ensures that the Army receives its programs reliably and affordably. 
We also continue to see opportunities to expand the ordnance and tactical munition business as the Army refreshes its ordnance and ammo stockpiles. We continue to have significant international opportunities throughout NATO and Eastern Europe as well as the Pacific region. 
Next, Marine Systems. Marine revenues of $2.1 billion was up slightly and operating earnings of $180 million were down $4 million against the year ago quarter. Operating margins were 8.7% with our guidance for the year at 8.5%. We are modestly ahead of target. We have delivered the 17th ship of the Virginia class program and have another 11 in various stages of construction. With respect to Columbia, we are 97% complete with the detailed design and nearly 43% complete with the construction design drawings. We will be at 83% complete at the start of construction, far in excess of historical design completion metrics for any class of warships. We have begun long-lead material construction on Columbia and will begin full construction of the first ship late next year.  
In response to the significant increase in demand from our Navy customer across all 3 of our shipyards, we continue to invest in each of our yards with particular emphasis at Electric Boat to prepare for the higher production associated with Block V of the Virginia program and the new Columbia ballistic-missile submarine. As you may recall, both Columbia and the Block V represent a significant increase in size and performance requiring additional manufacturing capacity and different logistics infrastructure to transport the larger modules from Quonset Point to the waterfront at Groton for final assembly and test. 
CapEx in 2018 for Marine Systems was $243 million, more than double its depreciation for the year. For 2019, we again expect the Marine segment to command the largest share of our capital budget, about half of our entire CapEx. So suffice it to say that we are poised to support our Navy customer as they seek to increase the size of their fleet. 
Next, Information Technology. For the quarter, IT generated revenue of $2.2 billion and operating earnings of $156 million with an operating margin of 7.2%. Since the numbers for the first quarter 2018 did not include CSRA, comparisons to the year ago quarter are not meaningful. 
Revenue of $2.2 billion is up by over $1 billion, but is down about $200 million sequentially, over half of which is attributable to the divestiture of the call centers and the remaining to the winding down of several mature programs replaced by the ramp-up of new programs. Margin of 7.2% is lower than Q4 due to mix, but a bit better than Q2 and Q3 of 2018. 
If you look at our EBITDA margin, it is 12.4% including state and local taxes in the operating results. If these taxes were carried below the line, as in the case for most competitors in this segment, it would add approximately 50 basis points to our results. This places the business in the best-in-class category for its industry. 
The integration has gone well and is a bit ahead of the plan we put in place last year. We are taking the best of the 2 legacy companies and building a highly competitive enterprise with the scale and the resources to create value for our customers and our shareholders. GDIT's book-to-bill for the quarter was 1.1:1 and for the trailing 4 quarters, it is over 1:1. This business is growing and is positioned for growth going forward. 
The first quarter includes some notable wins, a $490 million contract from DISA to support Pentagon network infrastructure, a $125 million for helicopter training and simulation at Fort Rucker, $580 million for several classified programs and a myriad of additional wins across the portfolio. 
Finally, for Mission Systems, revenue rose by 5.5% compared to the year ago quarter while operating earnings of $148 million were $2 million higher than the first quarter of last year, with a 50 basis point decrement in operating margins attributable solely to mix. Book-to-bill for the quarter was 1x following 1:1 book-to-bill for this -- for each of the last 2 years. As you can see, we ended the quarter with a backlog of $5.3 billion, essentially level with the prior quarter and with the year ago quarter. Demand was broad-based across many of their space and naval programs. Army ground systems activity was particularly strong. 
So in my view, we are off to a good start to the year. The story in the first quarter was about revenue and backlog growth. Orders of $10.7 billion across our businesses provide us with good operational visibility. Our ongoing focus on productivity provides the opportunity to deliver very good results. As we begin this quarter, we expect our second quarter performance to be very similar to the first quarter from an EPS perspective. 
You may recall that we do not, as a practice, change guidance at the end of the first quarter. It is our practice to give you a full review of our expectations at midyear -- at midpoint during the year. Suffice it to say that we are a bit ahead of the operating plan upon which our guidance was based. As always, we will work to consolidate our improvement and strive to continue to improve our results. 
Let me turn this over to Jason for additional commentary and then take your questions."

The increase in 2019 is due to the debt we issued to finance the acquisition of CSRA. We are also carrying more commercial paper than anticipated due to delayed payments on one of our large international vehicle programs in Canada. Our free cash flow of negative $976 million was impacted by these payment delays and as we've discussed previously, this is a timing item. 
On the capital deployment front, capital expenditures of $181 million in the quarter were up about 75% from the year ago quarter as we invest in our shipyards to support the significant growth that's on the horizon. We still expect this year to be the peak at approximately 3% of revenues and returning to the 2% range thereafter. 
In the quarter, we paid $268 million in dividends, and we spent $86 million on the repurchase of 525,000 of our shares. We plan to acquire enough shares in 2019 to ensure there is no dilution from the exercise of employee stock options. Otherwise, we anticipate deploying the balance of our free cash flow this year to pay down our short-term borrowings. 
We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $673 million on the balance sheet and a net debt position of $12.9 billion. Our effective tax rate was 18.6% for the quarter, which is consistent with our full year tax rate guidance. As Phebe noted, order activity and backlog were a particularly strong story in the quarter, as 4 of our 5 segments posted a book-to-bill of 1:1 or greater even as we grew almost 10% organically. 
On that note, I think it bears a reminder that not all companies report book-to-bill on the same basis. We calculate this measure based on the firm backlog as reported under generally accepted accounting principles excluding the value associated with IDIQ contracts. That's, of course, most relevant to Mission Systems and GDIT, each of which had a book-to-bill of 1:1 or greater even under the more conservative GAAP definition. 
We finished the quarter with a total backlog of $69.2 billion, that's up 2% over year-end 2018 and up 11% over this time a year ago. The total potential contract value including options and IDIQ contracts was $103 billion consistent with year-end and up almost 18% over a year ago. 
There's one final item I'd like to highlight. We adopted the new lease accounting standard effective January 1 of this year on a prospective basis. We recorded a $1.4 billion liability for our operating leases along with a corresponding asset. This creates a visible change in our other assets and liabilities on the balance sheet, but otherwise has no impact on our net earnings or cash flows. 
Howard, that concludes my remarks, and I'll turn it back over to you for the Q&A."

As we see in every -- by the way, we see this and you know this, in every one of our transitions from one block to the other because we've been down a continuous learning curve and we have a -- each one of our contracts has the same sort of target profit and we're on a share line. So we always give back some of that goodness, appropriately so, to the U.S. Navy. But what does that mean? That means we've got to drive our operating performance relentlessly and continuously, and we've done that now for 20 years. So we will work very hard to consolidate and accelerate our learning on the Block IV. But at the moment, we're pretty comfortable with the guidance we gave you."

After the hot wars, they had utilized a lot of their equipment. And as their budgets drove down rather precipitously, they did not have the resources to go and recapitalize. But they do now and that's exactly what they're doing. So they're modernizing their existing fleet in addition to developing new potential platforms. And we -- that existing fleet is our programs, right? Stryker and Abrams have seen considerable increases in their budget funding lines because the Army needs those vehicles. The Abrams remains an outstanding tank and the upgrade in the version 4 is really not your father's Abrams. It is a more capable, more survivable, more lethal system, as is Stryker. So we think those 2 core franchise programs for us are in very, very good stead. We work very closely with our Army customer to understand their demands and their requirements and how they think about the war fight. And so we position ourselves and our investment dollars and also thinking about the art of the possible for them on how we can help them meet their objective. That's certainly true on the franchise programs I've just talked about, but also on new programs. What is in the art of the possible? What's doable? How fast can you do it? And what's it going to cost you? And the key there is to have the trust of your Army customer who believes that the estimates that you give them are reliable. 
So we've had a -- we're very aligned with our Army customer, know where they're headed and I frankly like everything that I see here. And that's on the big vehicle programs. When I look at our munitions business, our munitions business is growing. I think we grew 10% in the quarter. And we've had a book-to-bill there that's been very wholesome because as we increase our operational training tempo, our munitions and armaments are in increased demand. So outside the United States, in North America, or outside the United States, we see some recapitalization in the U.K. and Canada, where we've decades-long presence in both of those countries, throughout NATO and heavily Eastern in Europe. The world is getting a more dangerous place, and -- unfortunately, but that is -- that creates demand for our products. Our European Land Systems has multiple opportunities throughout the former Soviet border states in Eastern Bloc and domestically and elsewhere. So threats drive funding and they drive the need for requirements. And unfortunately, we live in a world of increased threat."

reported but organic growth was higher after taking into account the effect of divestitures at GDIT and the acquisition of Hawker Pacific. Remember that divestitures at GDIT provided some of more than $250 million per quarter in revenue. 
Net earnings of $806 million were up $20 million or 2.5% on a modest improvement in operating earnings and the lower effective tax rate, offset in part by higher interest expense. Sequentially, revenue was up $294 million or 3.2%, and operating earnings were up $76 million or 7.5% on higher operating margins. 
With respect to consensus, revenue in the quarter was about $200 million more, and the operating margin rate was 10 basis points higher than forecasted by the sell side. In short, $0.08 of the $0.09 beat was provided by stronger operating earnings.
Let let me turn very briefly to the first half of 2019 compared to the first half of 2018. Revenue was up $2.1 billion or 12.5% against the first half of 2018 driven by strong organic growth plus the acquisition of CSRA at the beginning of the second quarter last year. In other words, CSRA revenue was not reflected in the first quarter's results last year. 
On the other hand, operating earnings were up only $8 million driven by the amortization related to the CSRA acquisition. EPS was $0.06 better. In short, we had a very good second quarter, good sequential improvement and a good first half. We are somewhat ahead of both our internal operating plan and external expectations.
So let me give you some perspective on the segment reporting for the quarter and for the half. I'll then ask Jason for some comments before I give you some insight into our outlook for the business and each segment for the remainder of the year. 
First, aerospace. Aerospace had a very good quarter most important respects. Revenue of $2.14 billion and operating earnings of $331 million were $241 million higher and $55 million lower, respectively. Both numbers were consistent with our outlook and the production plan for the year. Operating margin was down 490 basis points as anticipated. 
Let me give you a little color here with the quarter-over-quarter comparisons concerning earning and -- earnings and operating margins. You may recall that the Aerospace segment had a banner quarter in the second quarter of last year with 20.4% operating margins against 15.5% this quarter. This delta is driven only in part by mix. No G500s were in the second quarter 2018 results. More importantly, the second quarter of '18 had an unusually large assistant payments from the supplier resulted in higher year-over-year R&D expense. These 2 items were the significant difference between the quarters. 
Looking at things sequentially, revenue was down $104 million but operating earnings were up $3 million on a 90 basis point improvement in operating margin. 
We enjoyed good order activity in the quarter. The dollar-based book-to-bill was 1:1. This brings the book-to-bill to 1.2:1 for the first half. The numbers for Gulfstream alone were somewhat higher. We have had very good operating performance for 2 -- order performance for 2 years now. As you know, the G500 was certified on July 20, 2018, and we delivered 21 of them to customers and 1 to ourselves as demonstrated through the end of the second quarter. The G600 earned both its type and production certification on June 28, 2019. This now paves the way for G600 pilot training and deliveries commencing in early August. This will help both revenue and earnings in the second half and do much to reduce the operating working capital buildup related to producing the early G600s. Finally, IASA validation for the G500 is planned for Q3 and for the G600, in Q4.
Let's now turn to the Defense side of the house. Combat Systems had a good quarter as relevant comparisons indicate. Revenue of $1.66 billion was up $125 million over the second quarter last year or 8.1%. Similarly, operating earnings of $242 million were up $6 million or 2.5% over the second quarter [ of '18  ]. I should remind everyone that the second quarter of 2018 represented an 8.5% improvement in revenue over second quarter 2017 and a 5% increase in operating earnings. In short, we have experienced strong quarter-over-quarter growth for the last 3 years. 
On a sequential basis, the story is similar. Revenue was up $23 million, and operating earnings were up $36 million. For the first half, revenue was up $321 million or 10.8% against the first half of 2018. However, operating earnings were down $12 million with a onetime settlement of lease litigation in the first quarter more than accounting for the year-over-year decline. However, in my outlook for March will indicate, we expect to catch up in the second half. 
Our U.S.-based programs continue to perform well with Abrams volumes up and nice growth in the ordinance and munitions portfolio. In the aggregate, our U.S. government volume accounted for [ 57%  ] of revenue in the first half as compared with 48% in the first half of '18. Army demand upgrade our platform in the upcoming years is manifesting itself in explicit program direction for the tank and Stryker, which puts us in good stead for continued growth. 
Our international programs continue to progress nicely. Work on the U.K. Ajax program is transitioning from engineering to test and then to full production. Warfighter testing has been successful, and we expect to enter reliability testing in Q3 of this year. Backlog in this segment is lumpy, and the second quarter is no exception. Major orders for the fiscal year were captured in the fourth quarter of '18. As a consequence, we have a very good line of sight for production planning and for driving continuous improvements. We are in the right direction at Combat. It has a very nice growth story. 
With respect to the Marine Group. Revenue of $2.33 billion was $157 million or 7.2% higher than Q2 a year ago. Operating earnings were up only $2 million against the year ago quarter on a 50 basis point of traction in margin. On a sequential basis, revenue was up $267 million, and operating earnings were up $17 million, 13%, 9.4% respectively. 
For the first half, revenue of $4.38 billion was up $181 million or 4.3% against the first half of 2018. Operating earnings were down $2 million on a 40 basis points of distraction and margin rate.
Work on our submarine programs of the construction and engineering on the Columbia ballistic-missile submarine continues to make good progress. We are building Virginia-class Block IV boats and have begun to purchase long-lead materials for Block V. We expect the 10 [indiscernible] Block V contract to be awarded later this year. It will result in a considerable addition to backlog. 
With respect to Bath, the challenges on the first DDG 1000 ship and the DDG 51 star ships are behind us with nice performance on DDG 1001 and 1002 on the follow-on DDG 51 ships. We have 11 DDG 51s in backlog with very good opportunity to improve performance steadily across this large backlog. 
Finally, revenue with Mach over the quarter and year-to-date is up due to higher volumes related to the TAL class program. And our Marine Systems has been a compelling growth story for us and will continue to be so for a long time to come.
Mission Systems. Mission Systems had revenue of $1.28 billion in the quarter, an increase of $130 million or 11.3% over the year ago quarter. Earnings of $162 million were up $9 million against the second quarter last year. On a sequential basis, revenue was up $119 million, and earnings were up $14 million. On a year-to-date basis, Mission Systems revenue was up $190 million or 8.5%. First half earnings were up $11 million against the first half last year. Mission Systems has been a high-performance business for us and will continue to be so. It has enjoyed a book-to-bill of at least 1:1 in 2016, '17 and '18. While in the first half of 2019, the book-to-bill was slightly below 1x, we expect that to remedy in the second half. 
Information technology reported revenue of $2.16 billion in the second quarter, down $284 million against the year ago quarter. This is largely the result of the divestitures made in this segment through the course of last year, as I mentioned earlier in my remarks. However, operating earnings were only $2 million down as a result of improved margin rate. On a sequential basis, results were also quite solid. Revenue was essentially stable at $2.2 billion for each quarter. Operating profits were also quite similar with 2Q at $154 million versus $156 million in Q1. 
We are experiencing good program mix and synergies. Our industry-leading EBITDA was 12.4% in the quarter, matching Q1's results. 
Our integration of CSRA in the GDIT has gone very well and is ahead of our internal schedule. Our management team pulse from both businesses very nicely. We are meeting cost synergy targets and are working to exceed this year's goals. To that end, we have continued to generate good bookings. In the quarter, we had orders of $2.67 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.2:1. For the first half, our book-to-bill is also 1.2:1. On a trailing 12-month basis, book-to-bill also tops 1x. 
Our total backlog of $8.85 billion is up 5% after excluding the backlog related to divested businesses. 
So in summary, we have delivered solid operating results across the business. The comparisons quarter-over-quarter sequentially and year-to-date are all fulsome. 
Now I'm going to turn the call over to Jason, and I'll come back to you with our outlook for the rest of the year."

That brings the interest expense for the first half of the year to $236 million versus $130 mi",584,"Thank you, Phebe, and good morning, everyone. 
Our net interest expense in the quarter was [ $119  ] million versus $103 million in the second quarter of 2018. That brings the interest expense for the first half of the year to $236 million versus $130 million for the same period last year. The increase in 2019 is due to the debt we issued to finance the acquisition and CSRA. We're also carrying more commercial paper than anticipated due to delayed payments related to one of our large international vehicle programs in Canada. At this point, we expect the interest expense for 2019 to be approximately $460 million. 
Our cash from operations of $291 million in the quarter was also impacted by these payment delays. As we've discussed previously, this is a timing item. With respect to the outstanding receivable balance, we were recently told by the customer that we will receive considerable funding next month. We continue to expect to resolve the balance of the arrears by the end of the year. Assuming these outstanding payments come in this year, we still expect full year free cash flow conversion will be well in excess of 100% of net income. 
On the capital deployment front, capital expenditures were $181 million in the quarter or approximately 2% of revenues. Assuming receipt of the outstanding payments I just noted consistent with the timing I described, we still expect our capital expenditures to reach approximately 3% of revenues for the year reflecting the investment in our shipyards to support the significant growth that's on the horizon. 
Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 18%, bringing the rate for the first half to 18.3% consistent with our expectations for the full year. 
In the quarter, we paid $295 million in dividends, and we spent approximately $100 million on the repurchase of 575,000 of our shares. That brings the total for the first half to 1.1 million shares for $184 million. We plan to acquire enough shares in 2019 to ensure there is no dilution from the exercise of employee stock options. Otherwise, we anticipate deploying the balance of our free cash flow this year to pay down our short-term borrowings. 
We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $702 million on the balance sheet and a net debt position of $13.2 billion. We expect to repay our outstanding commercial paper balance by the end of this year, and our first tranche of fixed and floating rate notes matures in the second quarter of next year. 
I'll wrap up with a few points of color on the backlog and our order activity in the quarter. We had another solid quarter with respect to orders. We finished the quarter with a total backlog of $67.7 billion. That's up 2% over this time a year ago, and the total potential contract value including options and IDIQ contracts was $102 billion, up 3% over a year ago. As Phebe mentioned, GDIT posted a particularly strong quarter with a book-to-bill of 1.24x, and I'll remind you that does not include over $2.5 billion in IDIQ awards in the quarter, which as you know, we don't include in backlog or our book-to-bill.
And the last item I'll note is the ongoing impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the backlog of Combat Systems, which has experience a $250 million reduction in backlog in the first 6 months of the year due to this issue.
With that, I'll turn it back over to Phebe."

So turning to our outlook for the year. Let me provide our forecast for the year for each segment compared to what we told you in January and then wrap it into our EPS guidance.

So turning to our outlook for the year. Let me provide our forecast for the year for each segment compared to what we told you in January and then wrap it into our EPS guidance. For Aerospace, our guidance was to expect revenue of $9.7 billion, up $1.2 billion from 2018; operating earnings around $1.5 billion; and operating margin around 15.5%. We now expect revenue of $9.95 billion with earnings of $1.525 billion with an operating margin of 15.3%. The increased revenue comes largely from increased preowned sales and modest mix shift. Earnings will be up on improved operating performance, but the margin rate will be diluted by preowned aircraft sales. 
For Combat Systems, our previous guidance was to expect revenue of $6.5 billion to $6.6 billion, up $260 million to $360 million from 2018 with operating earnings in the range of $965 million to $975 million. We now expect revenue of $6.8 billion and operating earnings of approximately $1 billion. The more revenues drives $25 million to $35 million and more operating earnings. 
For the Marine Group, we've previously guided to our revenue of $9 billion, margins of around 8.5% and operating earnings of $770 million. We see no reason to change that guidance although my bias would be very normally lower.
For Mission Systems, we've previously guided an outlook for this year of $4.8 billion to $4.9 billion with margins in the mid to high 13% range. This implied an operating earnings of around $660 million. We now anticipate revenue of $5 billion, operating earnings around $690 million with operating margins of around 13.8%. 
For information technology, we guided to revenue of $8.3 billion with an operating margin of 7.5%. We now expect revenue of $8.5 billion and operating earnings of $630 million with an operating margin of 7.4%, almost 10 basis points lower. So all of this comes to revenues for General Dynamics of about $39.2 billion and operating earnings of around $4.6 billion. Compared to our initial guidance, we will have both higher revenue and operating earnings. This permits us to increase our EPS outlook from a range of 11 60 to 11 70 to a range of 11 85 to 11 90. As for the quarterly progression, it appears to us that the third quarter will be $0.30 better than the second quarter. Howard, we'll now take some questions."

So let's talk a little bit about what GDIT is. This is a people business, and the way you attract people is by establishing superior culture with very clear career development opportunities and some very interesting work. We have done quite well on that side in my mind, and that I think undergirds this really quite impressive performance that this management team has exhibited since the acquisition. And again, just to give you a size and scope and complexity of this business, on the first half, we submitted almost $24 billion in proposals, and that was more than the entire submittals in 2018. And for the remainder of the year in the second half, we're looking at about $27 billion proposals. We submitted about 350 proposals just in terms of numerically in the second quarter and then -- and about -- or 650 in the first half. So that tells you that what you need to undergird that kind of execution in proposals and velocity and submittals. And the win -- and the resulting win rate, you need a very, very strong management team undergirded by the culture and the people that I've just talked about.

I'll tell you back when we did the Ohio in the 80s, a separate account was set up. That's a potential option. So I don't worry too much about Columbia crowding other programs out. There's an imperative for the Navy to recapitalize its ships and build more ships. There is a consensus in Washington across political spectrum, across political parties, leadership in the major political parties that understand that we need ships, and we need to replace the under seed light of the deterrent.

And good morning, everyone.As you can discern from our press release, we enjoyed a very good second quarter with revenue of $9.56 billion and net earnings of $806 million. We reported EPS of $2.77 per diluted share, $0.15 a share bett",1697,"Thank you, Howard. And good morning, everyone.
As you can discern from our press release, we enjoyed a very good second quarter with revenue of $9.56 billion and net earnings of $806 million. We reported EPS of $2.77 per diluted share, $0.15 a share better than the year ago quarter and $0.09 per share better than consensus. Compared to the year ago quarter, revenue was up $369 million or 4%. This is as reported, but organic growth was higher after taking into account the effect of divestitures at GDIT and the acquisition of Hawker Pacific. Remember the divestitures at GDIT provided [ somewhat ] more than $250 million per quarter in revenue.
Net earnings of $806 million were up $20 million or 2.5% on a modest improvement of operating earnings and a lower effective tax rate, offset in part by higher interest expense. Sequentially, revenue was up $294 million or 3.2%, and operating earnings were up $76 million or 7.5% on higher operating margins.
With respect to consensus, revenue in the quarter was about $200 million more, and the operating margin rate was 10 basis points higher than forecasted by the sell side. In short, $0.08 of the $0.09 beat was provided by stronger operating earnings.
Let me turn very briefly to the first half of 2019 compared to the first half of 2018. Revenue was up $2.1 billion or 12.5% against the first half of 2018, driven by strong organic growth plus the acquisition of CSRA at the beginning of the second quarter last year. In other words, CSRA revenue was not reflected in the first quarter's results last year. On the other hand, operating earnings were up only $8 million, burdened by the amortization related to the CSRA acquisition. EPS was $0.06 better.
In short, we had a very good second quarter, good sequential improvement and a good first half. We are somewhat ahead of both our internal operating plan and external expectations.
So let me give you some perspective on the segment reporting for the quarter and for the half. I'll then ask Jason for some comments before I give you some insight into our outlook for the business and each segment for the remainder of the year.
First, Aerospace. Aerospace had a very good quarter in most important respects. Revenue of $2.14 billion and operating earnings of $331 million were $241 million higher and $55 million lower, respectively. Both numbers were consistent with our outlook and the production plan for the year. Operating margin was down 490 basis points, as anticipated.
Let me give you a little color here with the quarter-over-quarter comparisons concerning earning and -- earnings and operating margins. You may recall that the Aerospace segment had a banner quarter in the second quarter of last year with 20.4% operating margin against 15.5% this quarter. This delta is driven only in part by mix. No G500s were in the second quarter 2018 results. More importantly, the second quarter of '18 had an unusually large [ lumped assistant ] payment from a supplier. It resulted higher year-over-year R&D expense. These 2 items were the significant difference between the quarters. Looking at things sequentially, revenue was down $104 million, but operating earnings were up $3 million on a 90 basis point improvement in operating margin.
We enjoyed good order activity in the quarter. The dollar-based book-to-bill was 1:1. This brings the book-to-bill to 1.2:1 for the first half. The numbers for Gulfstream alone were somewhat higher. We have had very good operating performance for 2 -- order performance for 2 years now. As you know, the G500 was certified on July 20, 2018. And we have delivered 21 of them to customers and 1 to ourselves, as I demonstrated, through the end of the second quarter. The G600 earned both its type and production certification on June 28, 2019. This now paves the way for G600 pilot training and deliveries commencing in early August. This will help both revenue and earnings in the second half and do much to reduce the operating working capital buildup related to producing the early G600s. Finally, EASA validation for the G500 is planned for Q3, and for the G600 in Q4.
Let's now turn to the defense side of the house.
Combat Systems had a good quarter, as relevant comparisons clearly indicate. Revenue of $1.66 billion was up $125 million over the second quarter last year or 8.1%. Similarly, operating earnings of $242 million were up $6 million or 2.5% over the second quarter '18. I should remind everyone that the second quarter of 2018 represented an 8.5% improvement in revenue over second quarter of 2017 and a 5% increase in operating earnings. In short, we have experienced strong quarter-over-quarter growth for the last 3 years. On a sequential basis, the story is similar. Revenue was up $23 million and operating earnings were up $36 million.
For the first half, revenue was up $321 million or 10.8% against the first half of 2018. However, operating earnings were down $12 million, with a onetime settlement of lease litigation in the first quarter more than accounting for the year-over-year decline. However, as my outlook for March will indicate, we expect to catch up in the second half.
Our U.S.-based programs continue to perform well, with Abrams volumes up and nice growth in the ordnance and munitions portfolios. In the aggregate, our U.S. government volume accounted for 57% of revenue in the first half, as compared with 48% in the first half of '18. Army demand to upgrade our platforms in the coming -- upcoming years is manifesting itself in explicit program direction for the tank and Stryker, which puts us in good stead for continued growth. Our international programs continue to progress nicely. Work on the U.K. Ajax program is transitioning from engineering to test and then to full production. Live-fire testing has been successful, and we expect to enter reliability testing in Q3 of this year.
Backlog in this segment is lumpy, and the second quarter is no exception. Major orders for the fiscal year were captured in the fourth quarter of '18. As a consequence, we have very good line of sight for production planning and for driving continuous improvement. We are trending in the right direction at combat. It is a very nice growth story.
With respect to the marine group, revenue of $2.33 billion was $157 million or 7.2% higher than Q2 a year ago. Operating earnings were up only $2 million against the year ago quarter on a 50 basis points traction in margin. On a sequential basis, revenue was up $267 million and operating earnings were up $17 million, 13% and 9.4%, respectively.
For the first half, revenue of $4.38 billion was up $181 million or 4.3% against the first half of 2018. Operating earnings were down $2 million on a 40 basis point contraction in margin rate.
Work on our submarine programs, the Virginia class construction and engineering on the Columbia ballistic missile submarine, continues to make good progress. We are building Virginia-class Block IV boats and have begun to purchase long-lead materials for Block V. We expect a 10-boat Block V contract to be awarded later this year. It will result in a considerable addition to backlog. With respect to Bath, the challenges on the first DDG-1000 ship and DDG-51 restart ships are behind us, with nice performance on DDG-1001 and 1002 on the follow-on DDG-51 ships. We have 11 DDG-51s in backlog, with very good opportunity to improve performance steadily across this large backlog.
Finally, revenue with NASSCO for the quarter and year-to-date was up due to higher volumes related to the TAO Lewis-class oiler program. And our Marine Systems has been a compelling growth story for us and will continue to be so for a long time to come.
Mission Systems. Mission Systems had revenue of $1.28 billion in the quarter, an increase of $130 million or 11.3% over the year ago quarter. Earnings of $162 million were up $9 million against the second quarter last year. On a sequential basis, revenue was up $119 million, and earnings were up $14 million. On a year-to-date basis, Mission Systems revenue was up $190 million or 8.5%. First half earnings were up $11 million against the first half last year.
Mission Systems has been a high-performance business for us and will continue to be so. It has enjoyed a book-to-bill of at least 1:1 in 2016, '17 and '18. While the first half of 2019 the book-to-bill was slightly below 1x, we expect that to remedy in the second half.
Information Technology reported revenue of $2.16 billion in the second quarter, down $284 million against the year ago quarter. This is largely the result of the divestitures made in this segment through the course of last year, as I mentioned earlier in my remarks. However, operating earnings were only $2 million down as a result of improved margin rate. On a sequential basis, results were also quite solid. Revenue was essentially stable at $2.2 billion for each quarter. Operating profits were also quite similar with 2Q at $154 million versus $156 million in Q1. We are experiencing good program mix and synergies. Our industry-leading EBITDA was 12.4% in the quarter, matching Q1's results.
Our integration of CSRA into GDIT has gone very well and is ahead of our internal schedule. Our management team both -- from both businesses gelled very nicely. We are meeting cost synergy targets and are working to exceed this year's goals. To that end, we have continued to generate good bookings. In the quarter, we had orders of $2.67 billion, for a book-to-bill of 1.2:1. For the first half, our book-to-bill is also 1.2:1. On a trailing 12 months basis, book-to-bill also tops 1x. Our total backlog of $8.85 billion is up 5% after excluding the backlog related to divested businesses.
So in summary, we have delivered solid operating results across the business. The comparisons quarter-over-quarter sequentially and year-to-date are all fulsome.
I'm now going to turn the call over to Jason and then come back to you with our outlook for the rest of the year."

Our net interest expense in the quarter was $119 million versus $103 million in the second quarter of 2018. That brings the interest expense for the first half of the year to $236 million versus $130 million for the same period last year. The increase in 2019 is due to the debt we issued to finance the acquisition of CSRA. We're also carrying more commercial paper than anticipated due to delayed payments related to one of our large international vehicle programs in Canada. At this point, we expect interest expense for 2019 to be approximately $460 million.
Our cash from operations of $291 million in the quarter was also impacted by these payment delays. As we've discussed previously, this is a timing item. With respect to the outstanding receivable balance, we were recently told by the customer that we will receive considerable funding next month. We continue to expect to resolve the balance of the arrears by the end of the year. Assuming these outstanding payments come in this year, we still expect full year free cash flow conversion will be well in excess of 100% of net income.
On the capital deployment front, capital expenditures were $181 million in the quarter or approximately 2% of revenues. Assuming receipt of the outstanding payments I just noted consistent with the timing I described, we still expect our capital expenditures to reach approximately 3% of revenues for the year, reflecting the investment in our shipyards to support the significant growth that's on the horizon.
Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 18%, bringing the rate for the first half to 18.3%, consistent with our expectations for the full year.
In the quarter, we paid $295 million in dividends and we spent approximately $100 million on the repurchase of 575,000 of our shares. That brings the total for the first half to 1.1 million shares for $184 million. We plan to acquire enough shares in 2019 to ensure there is no dilution from the exercised employee stock options. Otherwise, we anticipate deploying the balance of our free cash flow this year to pay down on our short-term borrowings.
We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $702 million on the balance sheet and a net debt position of $13.2 billion. We expect to repay our outstanding commercial paper balance by the end of this year. And our first tranche of fixed- and floating-rate notes matures in the second quarter of next year.
I'll wrap up with a few points of color on the backlog and our order activity in the quarter. We had another solid quarter with respect to orders. We finished the quarter with a total backlog of $67.7 billion. That's up 2% over this time a year ago. And the total potential contract value including options and IDIQ contracts was $102 billion, up 3% over a year ago. As Phebe mentioned, GDIT posted a particularly strong quarter with a book-to-bill of 1.24x. And I'll remind you that, that does not include over $2.5 billion in IDIQ awards in the quarter, which as you know we don't include in backlog or our book-to-bill calculation. And the last item I'll note is the ongoing impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the backlog of Combat Systems, which has experienced a $250 million reduction in backlog in the first 6 months of the year due to this issue.
With that, I'll turn it back over to Phebe."

So turning to our outlook for the year, let me provide our forecasts for the year for each segment compared to what we told you in January and then wrap it into our EPS guidance.
For Aerospace, our guidance was to expect revenue of $9.7 billion, up $1.2 billion from 2018; operating earnings around $1.5 billion; and an operating margin around 15.5%. We now expect revenue of $9.95 billion, with earnings of $1.525 billion with an operating margin of 15.3%. The increased revenue comes largely from increased preowned sales and modest mix shift. Earnings will be up on improved operating performance, but the margin rate will be diluted by preowned aircraft sales.
For Combat Systems, our previous guidance was to expect revenue of $6.5 billion to $6.6 billion, up $260 million to $360 million from 2018, with operating earnings in the range of $965 million to $975 million. We now expect revenue of $6.8 billion and operating earnings of approximately $1 billion. The more revenues drives $25 million to $35 million in more operating earnings.
For the marine group, we've previously guided to a revenue of $9 billion, margins of around 8.5% and operating earnings of $770 million. We see no reason to change that guidance, although my bias would be very nominally lower.
For Mission Systems, we've previously provided an outlook for this year of $4.8 billion to $4.9 billion, with margins in the mid- to high-13% range. This implied an operating earnings of around $660 million. We now anticipate revenue of $5 billion, operating earnings around $690 million with operating margins of around 13.8%.
For Information Technology, we guided to revenue of $8.3 billion with an operating margin of 7.5%. We now expect revenue of $8.5 billion and operating earnings of $630 million but an operating margin of 7.4%, [ only ] 10 basis points lower.
So all of this sums to revenue for General Dynamics of about $39.2 billion and operating earnings of around $4.6 billion. Compared to our initial guidance, we will have both higher revenue and operating earnings. This permits us to increase our EPS outlook from a range of $11.60 to $11.70 to a range of $11.85 to $11.90. As for the quarterly progressions, it appears to us that the third quarter will be $0.30 better than the second quarter.
Howard, we can now take some questions."

And we've been building that backlog with programs that we think we can execute quite effectively and quite efficiently.
So let's talk a little bit about what GDIT is. This is a people business. And the way you attract people is by establishing a superior culture with very clear career development opportunities and some very interesting work. We have done quite well on that side, in my mind, and that I think undergirds this really quite impressive performance that this management team has exhibited since the acquisition. And again just to give you a size and scope and complexity of this business: In the first half, we submitted almost $24 billion in proposals, and that was more than the entire submittals in 2018. And for the remainder of the year and the second half, we're looking at about $27 billion proposals. We submitted about 350 proposals just in terms of numerically in the second quarter and then about -- or 650 in the first half. So that tells you that what -- you need to undergird that kind of execution in proposals and velocity in submittals. And the win -- and the resultant win rate, you need a very, very strong management team undergirded by the culture and the people that I just talked about.

We reported EPS of $2.77 per diluted share, $0.15 a share bett",1697,"Thank you, Howard, and good morning, everyone.
As you can discern from our press release, we enjoyed a very good second quarter with revenue of $9.56 billion and net earnings of $806 million. We reported EPS of $2.77 per diluted share, $0.15 a share better than the year ago quarter and $0.09 per share better than consensus. Compared to the year ago quarter, revenue was up $369 million or 4%. This is as reported, but organic growth was higher after taking into account the effect of the divestitures at GDIT and the acquisition of Hawker Pacific. Remember that divestitures at GDIT provided somewhat more than $250 million per quarter in revenue.
Net earnings of $806 million were up $20 million or 2.5% on a modest improvement of operating earnings and a lower effective tax rate, offset in part by higher interest expense. Sequentially, revenue was up $294 million or 3.2%, and operating earnings were up $76 million or 7.5% on higher operating margins.
With respect to consensus, revenue in the quarter was about $200 million more, and the operating margin rate was 10 basis points higher than forecasted by the sell side. In short, $0.08 of the $0.09 beat was provided by stronger operating earnings.
Let me turn very briefly to the first half of 2019 compared to the first half of 2018. Revenue was up $2.1 billion or 12.5% against the first half of 2018, driven by strong organic growth plus the acquisition of CSRA at the beginning of the second quarter last year. In other words, CSRA revenue was not reflected in the first quarter's results last year. On the other hand, operating earnings were up only $8 million, burdened by the amortization related to the CSRA acquisition. EPS was $0.06 better.
In short, we had a very good second quarter, good sequential improvement and a good first half. We are somewhat ahead of both our internal operating plan and external expectations.
So let me give you some perspective on the segment reporting for the quarter and for the half. I'll then ask Jason for some comments before I give you some insight into our outlook for the business and each segment for the remainder of the year.
First, Aerospace. Aerospace had a very good quarter in most important respects. Revenue of $2.14 billion and operating earnings of $331 million were $241 million higher and $55 million lower, respectively. Both numbers were consistent with our outlook and the production plan for the year. Operating margin was down 490 basis points, as anticipated.
Let me give you a little color here with the quarter-over-quarter comparisons concerning earning and -- earnings and operating margins. You may recall that the Aerospace segment had a banner quarter in the second quarter of last year with 20.4% operating margin against 15.5% this quarter. This delta is driven only in part by mix. No G500s were in the second quarter 2018 results. More importantly, the second quarter of '18 had an unusually large [ loan assistant ] payment from a supplier.  The result is higher year-over-year R&D expense. These 2 items were the significant difference between the quarters. Looking at things sequentially, revenue was down $104 million, but operating earnings were up $3 million on a 90 basis point improvement in operating margin.
We enjoyed good order activity in the quarter. The dollar-based book-to-bill was 1:1. This brings the book-to-bill to 1.2:1 for the first half. The numbers for Gulfstream alone were somewhat higher. We have had very good operating performance for 2 -- order performance for 2 years now. As you know, the G500 was certified on July 20, 2018. And we have delivered 21 of them to customers and 1 to ourselves as a demonstrator through the end of the second quarter. The G600 earned both its type and production certification on June 28, 2019. This now paves the way for G600 pilot training and deliveries commencing in early August. This will help both revenue and earnings in the second half and do much to reduce the operating working capital buildup related to producing the early G600s. Finally, EASA validation for the G500 is planned for Q3, and for the G600 in Q4.
Let's now turn to the defense side of the house.
Combat Systems had a good quarter, as relevant comparisons clearly indicate. Revenue of $1.66 billion was up $125 million over the second quarter last year or 8.1%. Similarly, operating earnings of $242 million were up $6 million or 2.5% over the second quarter '18. I should remind everyone that the second quarter of 2018 represented an 8.5% improvement in revenue over second quarter of 2017 and a 5% increase in operating earnings. In short, we have experienced strong quarter-over-quarter growth for the last 3 years. On a sequential basis, the story is similar. Revenue was up $23 million and operating earnings were up $36 million.
For the first half, revenue was up $321 million or 10.8% against the first half of 2018. However, operating earnings were down $12 million, with a onetime settlement of lease litigation in the first quarter more than accounting for the year-over-year decline. However, as my outlook for March will indicate, we expect to catch up in the second half.
Our U.S.-based programs continue to perform well, with Abrams volumes up and nice growth in the ordnance and munitions portfolios. In the aggregate, our U.S. government volume accounted for 57% of revenue in the first half, as compared with 48% in the first half of '18. Army demand to upgrade our platforms in the coming -- upcoming years is manifesting itself in explicit program direction for the tank and Stryker, which puts us in good stead for continued growth. Our international programs continue to progress nicely. Work on the U.K. Ajax program is transitioning from engineering to test and then to full production. Live-fire testing has been successful, and we expect to enter reliability testing in Q3 of this year.
Backlog in this segment is lumpy, and the second quarter is no exception. Major orders for the fiscal year were captured in the fourth quarter of '18. As a consequence, we have very good line of sight for production planning and for driving continuous improvement. We are trending in the right direction at combat. It is a very nice growth story.
With respect to the marine group, revenue of $2.33 billion was $157 million or 7.2% higher than Q2 a year ago. Operating earnings were up only $2 million against the year ago quarter on a 50 basis point traction in margin. On a sequential basis, revenue was up $267 million and operating earnings were up $17 million, 13% and 9.4%, respectively.
For the first half, revenue of $4.38 billion was up $181 million or 4.3% against the first half of 2018. Operating earnings were down $2 million on a 40 basis point contraction in margin rate.
Work on our submarine programs, the Virginia class construction and engineering on the Columbia ballistic missile submarine, continues to make good progress. We are building Virginia-class Block IV boats and have begun to purchase long-lead materials for Block V. We expect a 10-boat Block V contract to be awarded later this year. It will result in a considerable addition to backlog. With respect to Bath, the challenges on the first DDG-1000 ship and DDG-51 restart ships are behind us, with nice performance on DDG-1001 and 1002 on the follow-on DDG-51 ships. We have 11 DDG-51s in backlog, with very good opportunity to improve performance steadily across this large backlog.
Finally, revenue at NASSCO for the quarter and year-to-date was up due to higher volumes related to the TAO Lewis-class oiler program. And our Marine Systems has been a compelling growth story for us and will continue to be so for a long time to come.
Mission Systems. Mission Systems had revenue of $1.28 billion in the quarter, an increase of $130 million or 11.3% over the year ago quarter. Earnings of $162 million were up $9 million against the second quarter last year. On a sequential basis, revenue was up $119 million, and earnings were up $14 million. On a year-to-date basis, Mission Systems revenue was up $190 million or 8.5%. First half earnings were up $11 million against the first half last year.
Mission Systems has been a high-performance business for us and will continue to be so. It has enjoyed a book-to-bill of at least 1:1 in 2016, '17 and '18. While the first half of 2019 the book-to-bill was slightly below 1x, we expect that to remedy in the second half.
Information Technology reported revenue of $2.16 billion in the second quarter, down $284 million against the year ago quarter. This is largely the result of the divestitures made in this segment through the course of last year, as I mentioned earlier in my remarks. However, operating earnings were only $2 million down as a result of improved margin rate. On a sequential basis, results were also quite solid. Revenue was essentially stable at $2.2 billion for each quarter. Operating profits were also quite similar with 2Q at $154 million versus $156 million in Q1. We are experiencing good program mix and synergies. Our industry-leading EBITDA was 12.4% in the quarter, matching Q1's results.
Our integration of CSRA into GDIT has gone very well and is ahead of our internal schedule. Our management team both -- from both businesses gelled very nicely. We are meeting cost synergy targets and are working to exceed this year's goals. To that end, we have continued to generate good bookings. In the quarter, we had orders of $2.67 billion, for a book-to-bill of 1.2:1. For the first half, our book-to-bill is also 1.2:1. On a trailing 12 month basis, book-to-bill also tops 1x. Our total backlog of $8.85 billion is up 5% after excluding the backlog related to divested businesses.
So in summary, we have delivered solid operating results across the business. The comparisons quarter-over-quarter sequentially and year-to-date are all fulsome.
I'm now going to turn the call over to Jason and then come back to you with our outlook for the rest of the year."

Our net interest expense in the quarter was $119 million versus $103 million in the second quarter of 2018. That brings the interest expense for the first half of the year to $236 million versus $130 million for the same period last year. The increase in 2019 is due to the debt we issued to finance the acquisition of CSRA. We're also carrying more commercial paper than anticipated due to delayed payments related to one of our large international vehicle programs in Canada. At this point, we expect interest expense for 2019 to be approximately $460 million.
Our cash from operations of $291 million in the quarter was also impacted by these payment delays. As we've discussed previously, this is a timing item. With respect to the outstanding receivable balance, we were recently told by the customer that we will receive considerable funding next month. We continue to expect to resolve the balance of the arrears by the end of the year. Assuming these outstanding payments come in this year, we still expect full year free cash flow conversion will be well in excess of 100% of net income.
On the capital deployment front, capital expenditures were $181 million in the quarter or approximately 2% of revenues. Assuming receipt of the outstanding payments I just noted consistent with the timing I described, we still expect our capital expenditures to reach approximately 3% of revenues for the year, reflecting the investment in our shipyards to support the significant growth that's on the horizon.
Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 18%, bringing the rate for the first half to 18.3%, consistent with our expectations for the full year.
In the quarter, we paid $295 million in dividends and we spent approximately $100 million on the repurchase of 575,000 of our shares. That brings the total for the first half to 1.1 million shares for $184 million. We plan to acquire enough shares in 2019 to ensure there is no dilution from the exercised employee stock options. Otherwise, we anticipate deploying the balance of our free cash flow this year to pay down our short-term borrowings.
We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $702 million on the balance sheet and a net debt position of $13.2 billion. We expect to repay our outstanding commercial paper balance by the end of this year. And our first tranche of fixed- and floating-rate notes matures in the second quarter of next year.
I'll wrap up with a few points of color on the backlog and our order activity in the quarter. We had another solid quarter with respect to orders. We finished the quarter with a total backlog of $67.7 billion. That's up 2% over this time a year ago. And the total potential contract value including options and IDIQ contracts was $102 billion, up 3% over a year ago. As Phebe mentioned, GDIT posted a particularly strong quarter with a book-to-bill of 1.24x. And I'll remind you that, that does not include over $2.5 billion in IDIQ awards in the quarter, which as you know we don't include in backlog or our book-to-bill calculation. And the last item I'll note is the ongoing impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the backlog at Combat Systems, which has experienced a $250 million reduction in backlog in the first 6 months of the year due to this issue.
With that, I'll turn it back over to Phebe."
274561,629201428,1777568,"General Dynamics Corporation, Q2 2019 Earnings Call, Jul 24, 2019",2019-07-24,"Earnings Calls","General Dynamics Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Jason.So turning to our outlook for the year, let me provide our forecasts for the year for each segment compared to what we told you in January and then wrap it into our EPS guidance.For Aerospace, our guidance was to expect revenue of $9.7 b",394,"Thanks, Jason.
So turning to our outlook for the year, let me provide our forecasts for the year for each segment compared to what we told you in January and then wrap it into our EPS guidance.
For Aerospace, our guidance was to expect revenue of $9.7 billion, up $1.2 billion from 2018; operating earnings around $1.5 billion; and an operating margin around 15.5%. We now expect revenue of $9.95 billion, with earnings of $1.525 billion with an operating margin of 15.3%. The increased revenue comes largely from increased preowned sales and modest mix shift. Earnings will be up on improved operating performance, but the margin rate will be diluted by preowned aircraft sales.
For Combat Systems, our previous guidance was to expect revenue of $6.5 billion to $6.6 billion, up $260 million to $360 million from 2018, with operating earnings in the range of $965 million to $975 million. We now expect revenue of $6.8 billion and operating earnings of approximately $1 billion. The more revenues drives $25 million to $35 million in more operating earnings.
For the marine group, we previously guided to a revenue of $9 billion, margins of around 8.5% and operating earnings of $770 million. We see no reason to change that guidance, although my bias would be very nominally lower.
For Mission Systems, we've previously provided an outlook for this year of $4.8 billion to $4.9 billion, with margins in the mid- to high-13% range. This implied an operating earnings of around $660 million. We now anticipate revenue of $5 billion, operating earnings around $690 million with operating margins around 13.8%.
For Information Technology, we guided to revenue of $8.3 billion with an operating margin of 7.5%. We now expect revenue of $8.5 billion and operating earnings of $630 million but an operating margin of 7.4%, [ only ] 10 basis points lower.
So all of this sums to revenue for General Dynamics of about $39.2 billion and operating earnings of around $4.6 billion. Compared to our initial guidance, we will have both higher revenue and operating earnings. This permits us to increase our EPS outlook from a range of $11.60 to $11.70 to a range of $11.85 to $11.90. As for the quarterly progression, it appears to us that the third quarter will be $0.30 better than the second quarter.
Howard, we can now take some questions."

And we've been building that backlog with programs that we think we can execute quite effectively and quite efficiently.
So let's talk a little bit about what GDIT is. This is a people business. And the way you attract people is by establishing a superior culture with very clear career development opportunities and some very interesting work. We have done quite well on that side, in my mind, and that I think undergirds this really quite impressive performance that this management team has exhibited since the acquisition. And again just to give you a size and scope and complexity of this business.  In the first half, we submitted almost $24 billion in proposals, and that was more than the entire submittals in 2018. And for the remainder of the year and the second half, we're looking at about $27 billion proposals. We submitted about 350 proposals just in terms of numerically in the second quarter and in -- and about 650 in the first half. So that tells you that what -- you need to undergird that kind of execution in proposals and velocity in submittals. And the win -- and the resultant win rate, you need a very, very strong management team undergirded by the culture and the people that I just talked about.

We reported EPS of $2.77 per diluted share, $0.15 a share bett",1697,"Thank you, Howard, and good morning, everyone.
As you can discern from our press release, we enjoyed a very good second quarter with revenue of $9.56 billion and net earnings of $806 million. We reported EPS of $2.77 per diluted share, $0.15 a share better than the year ago quarter and $0.09 per share better than consensus. Compared to the year ago quarter, revenue was up $369 million or 4%. This is as reported, but organic growth was higher after taking into account the effect of the divestitures at GDIT and the acquisition of Hawker Pacific. Remember that divestitures at GDIT provided somewhat more than $250 million per quarter in revenue.
Net earnings of $806 million were up $20 million or 2.5% on a modest improvement of operating earnings and a lower effective tax rate, offset in part by higher interest expense. Sequentially, revenue was up $294 million or 3.2%, and operating earnings were up $76 million or 7.5% on higher operating margins.
With respect to consensus, revenue in the quarter was about $200 million more, and the operating margin rate was 10 basis points higher than forecasted by the sell side. In short, $0.08 of the $0.09 beat was provided by stronger operating earnings.
Let me turn very briefly to the first half of 2019 compared to the first half of 2018. Revenue was up $2.1 billion or 12.5% against the first half of 2018, driven by strong organic growth plus the acquisition of CSRA at the beginning of the second quarter last year. In other words, CSRA revenue was not reflected in the first quarter's results last year. On the other hand, operating earnings were up only $8 million, burdened by the amortization related to the CSRA acquisition. EPS was $0.06 better.
In short, we had a very good second quarter, good sequential improvement and a good first half. We are somewhat ahead of both our internal operating plan and external expectations.
So let me give you some perspective on the segment reporting for the quarter and for the half. I'll then ask Jason for some comments before I give you some insight into our outlook for the business and each segment for the remainder of the year.
First, Aerospace. Aerospace had a very good quarter in most important respects. Revenue of $2.14 billion and operating earnings of $331 million were $241 million higher and $55 million lower, respectively. Both numbers were consistent with our outlook and the production plan for the year. Operating margin was down 490 basis points, as anticipated.
Let me give you a little color here with the quarter-over-quarter comparisons concerning earning and -- earnings and operating margins. You may recall that the Aerospace segment had a banner quarter in the second quarter of last year with 20.4% operating margin against 15.5% this quarter. This delta is driven only in part by mix. No G500s were in the second quarter 2018 results. More importantly, the second quarter of '18 had an unusually large [ loan assistant ] payment from a supplier. The result is higher year-over-year R&D expense. These 2 items were the significant difference between the quarters. Looking at things sequentially, revenue was down $104 million, but operating earnings were up $3 million on a 90 basis point improvement in operating margin.
We enjoyed good order activity in the quarter. The dollar-based book-to-bill was 1:1. This brings the book-to-bill to 1.2:1 for the first half. The numbers for Gulfstream alone were somewhat higher. We have had very good operating performance for 2 -- order performance for 2 years now. As you know, the G500 was certified on July 20, 2018. And we have delivered 21 of them to customers and 1 to ourselves as a demonstrator through the end of the second quarter. The G600 earned both its type and production certification on June 28, 2019. This now paves the way for G600 pilot training and deliveries commencing in early August. This will help both revenue and earnings in the second half and do much to reduce the operating working capital buildup related to producing the early G600s. Finally, EASA validation for the G500 is planned for Q3, and for the G600 in Q4.
Let's now turn to the defense side of the house. Combat Systems had a good quarter, as relevant comparisons clearly indicate. Revenue of $1.66 billion was up $125 million over the second quarter last year or 8.1%. Similarly, operating earnings of $242 million were up $6 million or 2.5% over the second quarter '18. I should remind everyone that the second quarter of 2018 represented an 8.5% improvement in revenue over second quarter of 2017 and a 5% increase in operating earnings. In short, we have experienced strong quarter-over-quarter growth for the last 3 years. On a sequential basis, the story is similar. Revenue was up $23 million and operating earnings were up $36 million.
For the first half, revenue was up $321 million or 10.8% against the first half of 2018. However, operating earnings were down $12 million, with a onetime settlement of lease litigation in the first quarter more than accounting for the year-over-year decline. However, as my outlook for March will indicate, we expect to catch up in the second half.
Our U.S.-based programs continue to perform well, with Abrams volumes up and nice growth in the ordnance and munitions portfolios. In the aggregate, our U.S. government volume accounted for 57% of revenue in the first half, as compared with 48% in the first half of '18. Army demand to upgrade our platforms in the coming -- upcoming years is manifesting itself in explicit program direction for the tank and Stryker, which puts us in good stead for continued growth. Our international programs continue to progress nicely. Work on the U.K. Ajax program is transitioning from engineering to test and then to full production. Live-fire testing has been successful, and we expect to enter reliability testing in Q3 of this year.
Backlog in this segment is lumpy, and the second quarter is no exception. Major orders for the fiscal year were captured in the fourth quarter of '18. As a consequence, we have very good line of sight for production planning and for driving continuous improvement. We are trending in the right direction at combat. It is a very nice growth story.
With respect to the marine group, revenue of $2.33 billion was $157 million or 7.2% higher than Q2 a year ago. Operating earnings were up only $2 million against the year ago quarter on a 50 basis point traction in margin. On a sequential basis, revenue was up $267 million and operating earnings were up $17 million, 13% and 9.4%, respectively.
For the first half, revenue of $4.38 billion was up $181 million or 4.3% against the first half of 2018. Operating earnings were down $2 million on a 40 basis point contraction in margin rate.
Work on our submarine programs, the Virginia class construction and engineering on the Columbia ballistic missile submarine, continues to make good progress. We are building Virginia-class Block IV boats and have begun to purchase long-lead materials for Block V. We expect a 10-boat Block V contract to be awarded later this year. It will result in a considerable addition to backlog. With respect to Bath, the challenges on the first DDG-1000 ship and DDG-51 restart ships are behind us, with nice performance on DDG-1001 and 1002 on the follow-on DDG-51 ships. We have 11 DDG-51s in backlog, with very good opportunity to improve performance steadily across this large backlog.
Finally, revenue at NASSCO for the quarter and year-to-date was up due to higher volumes related to the TAO Lewis-class oiler program. And our Marine Systems has been a compelling growth story for us and will continue to be so for a long time to come.
Mission Systems. Mission Systems had revenue of $1.28 billion in the quarter, an increase of $130 million or 11.3% over the year ago quarter. Earnings of $162 million were up $9 million against the second quarter last year. On a sequential basis, revenue was up $119 million, and earnings were up $14 million. On a year-to-date basis, Mission Systems revenue was up $190 million or 8.5%. First half earnings were up $11 million against the first half last year.
Mission Systems has been a high-performance business for us and will continue to be so. It has enjoyed a book-to-bill of at least 1:1 in 2016, '17 and '18. While the first half of 2019 the book-to-bill was slightly below 1x, we expect that to remedy in the second half.
Information Technology reported revenue of $2.16 billion in the second quarter, down $284 million against the year ago quarter. This is largely the result of the divestitures made in this segment through the course of last year, as I mentioned earlier in my remarks. However, operating earnings were only $2 million down as a result of improved margin rate. On a sequential basis, results were also quite solid. Revenue was essentially stable at $2.2 billion for each quarter. Operating profits were also quite similar with 2Q at $154 million versus $156 million in Q1. We are experiencing good program mix and synergies. Our industry-leading EBITDA was 12.4% in the quarter, matching Q1's results.
Our integration of CSRA into GDIT has gone very well and is ahead of our internal schedule. Our management team both -- from both businesses gelled very nicely. We are meeting cost synergy targets and are working to exceed this year's goals. To that end, we have continued to generate good bookings. In the quarter, we had orders of $2.67 billion, for a book-to-bill of 1.2:1. For the first half, our book-to-bill is also 1.2:1. On a trailing 12 month basis, book-to-bill also tops 1x. Our total backlog of $8.85 billion is up 5% after excluding the backlog related to divested businesses.
So in summary, we have delivered solid operating results across the business. The comparisons quarter-over-quarter sequentially and year-to-date are all fulsome.
I'm now going to turn the call over to Jason and then come back to you with our outlook for the rest of the year."

Our net interest expense in the quarter was $119 million versus $103 million in the second quarter of 2018. That brings the interest expense for the first half of the year to $236 million versus $130 million for the same period last year. The increase in 2019 is due to the debt we issued to finance the acquisition of CSRA. We're also carrying more commercial paper than anticipated due to delayed payments related to one of our large international vehicle programs in Canada. At this point, we expect interest expense for 2019 to be approximately $460 million.
Our cash from operations of $291 million in the quarter was also impacted by these payment delays. As we've discussed previously, this is a timing item. With respect to the outstanding receivable balance, we were recently told by the customer that we will receive considerable funding next month. We continue to expect to resolve the balance of the arrears by the end of the year. Assuming these outstanding payments come in this year, we still expect full year free cash flow conversion will be well in excess of 100% of net income.
On the capital deployment front, capital expenditures were $181 million in the quarter or approximately 2% of revenues. Assuming receipt of the outstanding payments I just noted consistent with the timing I described, we still expect our capital expenditures to reach approximately 3% of revenues for the year, reflecting the investment in our shipyards to support the significant growth that's on the horizon.
Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 18%, bringing the rate for the first half to 18.3%, consistent with our expectations for the full year. In the quarter, we paid $295 million in dividends and we spent approximately $100 million on the repurchase of 575,000 of our shares. That brings the total for the first half to 1.1 million shares for $184 million. We plan to acquire enough shares in 2019 to ensure there is no dilution from the exercised employee stock options. Otherwise, we anticipate deploying the balance of our free cash flow this year to pay down our short-term borrowings.
We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $702 million on the balance sheet and a net debt position of $13.2 billion. We expect to repay our outstanding commercial paper balance by the end of this year. And our first tranche of fixed- and floating-rate notes matures in the second quarter of next year.
I'll wrap up with a few points of color on the backlog and our order activity in the quarter. We had another solid quarter with respect to orders. We finished the quarter with a total backlog of $67.7 billion. That's up 2% over this time a year ago. And the total potential contract value including options and IDIQ contracts was $102 billion, up 3% over a year ago. As Phebe mentioned, GDIT posted a particularly strong quarter with a book-to-bill of 1.24x. And I'll remind you that, that does not include over $2.5 billion in IDIQ awards in the quarter, which as you know we don't include in backlog or our book-to-bill calculation. And the last item I'll note is the ongoing impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the backlog at Combat Systems, which has experienced a $250 million reduction in backlog in the first 6 months of the year due to this issue.
With that, I'll turn it back over to Phebe."

So turning to our outlook for the year, let me provide our forecasts for the year for each segment compared to what we told you in January and then wrap it into our EPS guidance.For Aerospace, our guidance was to expect revenue of $9.7 bi",394,"Thanks, Jason. So turning to our outlook for the year, let me provide our forecasts for the year for each segment compared to what we told you in January and then wrap it into our EPS guidance.
For Aerospace, our guidance was to expect revenue of $9.7 billion, up $1.2 billion from 2018; operating earnings around $1.5 billion; and an operating margin around 15.5%. We now expect revenue of $9.95 billion, with earnings of $1.525 billion with an operating margin of 15.3%. The increased revenue comes largely from increased preowned sales and modest mix shift. Earnings will be up on improved operating performance, but the margin rate will be diluted by preowned aircraft sales.
For Combat Systems, our previous guidance was to expect revenue of $6.5 billion to $6.6 billion, up $260 million to $360 million from 2018, with operating earnings in the range of $965 million to $975 million. We now expect revenue of $6.8 billion and operating earnings of approximately $1 billion. The more revenues drives $25 million to $35 million in more operating earnings.
For the marine group, we previously guided to a revenue of $9 billion, margins of around 8.5% and operating earnings of $770 million. We see no reason to change that guidance, although my bias would be very nominally lower.
For Mission Systems, we've previously provided an outlook for this year of $4.8 billion to $4.9 billion, with margins in the mid- to high-13% range. This implied an operating earnings of around $660 million. We now anticipate revenue of $5 billion, operating earnings around $690 million with operating margins around 13.8%.
For Information Technology, we guided to revenue of $8.3 billion with an operating margin of 7.5%. We now expect revenue of $8.5 billion and operating earnings of $630 million but an operating margin of 7.4%, [ only ] 10 basis points lower.
So all of this sums to revenue for General Dynamics of about $39.2 billion and operating earnings of around $4.6 billion. Compared to our initial guidance, we will have both higher revenue and operating earnings. This permits us to increase our EPS outlook from a range of $11.60 to $11.70 to a range of $11.85 to $11.90. As for the quarterly progression, it appears to us that the third quarter will be $0.30 better than the second quarter.
Howard, we can now take some questions."

And we've been building that backlog with programs that we think we can execute quite effectively and quite efficiently.
So let's talk a little bit about what GDIT is. This is a people business. And the way you attract people is by establishing a superior culture with very clear career development opportunities and some very interesting work. We have done quite well on that side, in my mind, and that I think undergirds this really quite impressive performance that this management team has exhibited since the acquisition. And again just to give you a size and scope and complexity of this business. In the first half, we submitted almost $24 billion in proposals, and that was more than the entire submittals in 2018. And for the remainder of the year and the second half, we're looking at about $27 billion proposals. We submitted about 350 proposals just in terms of numerically in the second quarter and in -- and about 650 in the first half. So that tells you that what -- you need to undergird that kind of execution in proposals and velocity in submittals. And the win -- and the resultant win rate, you need a very, very strong management team undergirded by the culture and the people that I just talked about.

As you can discern from our press release, we've delivered attractive third quarter results, with revenue of $9.76 billion, operating earnings of $1.216 billion and net earnings from continuing operations of $913 million.",2305,"Thanks, Howard, and good morning. As you can discern from our press release, we've delivered attractive third quarter results, with revenue of $9.76 billion, operating earnings of $1.216 billion and net earnings from continuing operations of $913 million. We reported EPS of $3.14 per diluted share, $0.25 a share better than the year-ago quarter and $0.37 per share better than the second quarter this year.
Compared to the year-ago quarter, revenue was up [ $667 ] million or 7.3%. By the way, we have enjoyed top line growth every quarter for the past 12 consecutive quarters on a year-over-year basis.
Earnings from continuing operations of $913 million were up $49 million or 5.7% on a 7.1% improvement in operating earnings partially offset by a higher effective tax rate and lower pension income.
Operating margins returned to the 12.5% level. Sequentially, revenue was up $206 million or 2.2% and operating earnings were up $126 million or 11.6% on higher operating margins. In short, we had significant sequential margin improvements. With respect to consensus, our margin rate was 40 basis points higher than forecasted by the South side. This was offset in part by below-the-line items leading our EPS $0.07 better than consensus. The difference was provided by stronger operating earnings. 
With respect to cash, we had net cash provided by operating activities of $1.91 billion and free cash flow of $847 million.
As you can see from the charts attached to the press release, we enjoyed a good quarter, with a 1:1 book-to-bill. Total backlog of $67.4 billion decreased $258 million or about 1/3 of 1%. I have more to say about order intake as I discussed this operating segment, and Jason will give you some color about cash and backlog in his remarks. 
Let me turn very briefly to year-to-date 2019 compared to the first 9 months of 2018. Revenue was up $2.8 billion or 10.7% against the first 3 quarters of 2018 driven by strong organic growth plus the acquisition of CSRA at the beginning of the second quarter last year. To say it another way for clarity, CSRA's attributed revenue was in every 2018 quarter but the first. Operating earnings were up $89 million or 2.8%. EPS was [ $0.31 ] better. 
In short, we delivered good sequential improvement and a good first 9 months. As such, essentially, we are on track to our internal plan and external expectations. So let me give you some perspective on the segment reporting for the quarter and the year-to-date. 
First, aerospace. Aerospace had a very good quarter in most important respects. Revenue of $2.5 billion was 23% higher than the year-ago quarter. Operating earnings were $393 million or $17 million or 4.5% higher on a lower margins are related to mix as fully expected. 
Let me give you a little color here with the quarter-over-quarter comparisons concerning earnings and operating margin. You may recall that the Aerospace segment had a strong third quarter last year, with 18.5% operating margin against 15.8% this quarter. This Delta is driven only in part by mix. The third quarter of 2018 contained a positive nonrecurring settlement with the supplier. On a sequential basis, the story is even better. Revenue was up $359 million or 16.8%, and earnings were up $62 million or 18.7% on a 30 basis point improvement in operating margins. Excluding preowned sales from both periods results in a 70 basis points sequential improvement in Aerospace margin. The past quarters saw the first G600 deliveries in the quarter, over 30% of our large [ cabin ] deliveries were comprised of new product, which is notably higher than the second quarter of 2019. So despite the challenges of mix, we are making good progress. 
We are focused on aligning our costs with our operating cadence. The G600 earned both its type and production certification on June 28, 2019. We have commenced deliveries and expect to approach double-digit total this year. This will help both revenue and earnings in the balance of the year and improve working capital turns. The asset validation for this G500 was received on October 11 and the 600 validation is targeted for December 12.
With respect to orders, we had a book-to-bill 0.7:1 in the quarter. Activity and interest range remained very attractive to robust but in the process and time to closure of transactions was slower. We expect, as you would guess, a very strong order activity in the fourth quarter. You are undoubtedly aware of the announcement of the all-new G700. The materials related to this program and its specifications are publicly available. It is an expansion of our product line that brings advances in avionics and aerodynamics to create an industry leader. The G700 incorporates new engines, new wing widths and brand-new avionics from the G500 and 600 series.
The development of this plane is quite material and we expect first flight in December. The announcement of the G700 has cleared up some of the mystery, and has in some respects, stimulated G650 discussions. All in all, we are doing quite well at Aerospace. 
Turning to combat systems, we had a good quarter as relevant comparisons clearly indicate. Revenue of $1.74 billion was up $217 million over the third quarter of last year or 14.2%. Similarly, operating earnings of $264 million were up $23 million or 9.5% over the third quarter of 2018. On a sequential basis, the story is similar. Revenue was up $81 million or 5%, and operating earnings were up $22 million, a 9.1% increase. Combat Systems margins returned to the [ 15-plus percent ] neighborhood.
On a year-to-date basis, revenue was up $538 million or 12% against the same period of 2018. However, operating earnings are only $11 million or 1.6% higher. Mix and a onetime settlement of lease litigation in the first quarter explained why profits expanded more slowly than revenue. We expect a very good operating leverage in the final period of the year.
I think it's worth noting that Combat Systems has enjoyed a year-over-year growth in 11 of the past 12 quarters.
Our existing U.S.-based programs continue to perform well, with [indiscernible] volumes up, strong Stryker business and nice growth in the ordnance and munitions portfolios. In the aggregate, our U.S. government volumes accounted for 57% of revenue year-to-date compared to 49% for the first 3 quarters of 2018, underscoring the shift in mix.
Army demand to upgrade our platforms in the coming year is manifesting itself in explicit program direction for the tank and Stryker, which puts us in good stead for continued growth. Furthermore, we recognize the Army's set a high bar for the OMSC program, and we are focused on delivering a superior solution to replace the Bradley fighting vehicle.
Our international programs continue to progress nicely. Work on the U.K. Ajax program is transitioning from engineering to test and then to full production. Live fire testing has been successful, and we entered into a liability testing in the third quarters this year. We expect to enter steady-state production this year and continue through 2024. 
Combat Systems enhanced their backlog this quarter with a book-to-bill of 1.3:1. The Government of Canada ordered 360 armored combat support vehicles for $1.3 billion. Work has begun on the program, and we expect to begin deliveries in Q1 of 2021. ELS is in negotiating the contract with the Spanish government to deliver the first tranche of 348 [ piranha ] vehicles. As a consequence, we have very good line of sight for production planning and for driving continuous improvement in all businesses in this segment. We are turning in the right direction in Combat Systems. Every one of our businesses in the segment is on the move. 
With respect to the Marine group, revenue of $2.24 billion was $232 million or 11.6% higher than a Q3 a year ago. Operatings earnings were up $40 million or 23.7% against the year-ago quarter due in part to the progress to our closing out Virginia to block 3 and better year-over-year earnings at NASCO. On a sequential basis, revenue was down $90 million due to timing. Operating earnings were up $12 million. 
For the first 3 quarters of the year, revenue of $6.6 billion was up $413 million or 6.7% against the same 3 quarters of 2018. Operating earnings were $38 million better on a [indiscernible] voice basis point improvement in margin rate. 
Similar to Combat Systems, the Marine group has enjoyed year-over-year growth in 9 of the past 10 quarters. Work on our submarine programs, the Virginia Class construction and engineering on Columbia Ballistic Missile Submarine continues to make good progress. We have completed the design of Columbia and are 54% complete on the production drawings, which reflects good progress. Virginia Class Block 4 work remains steady. Volume EB has been driven by early work on Virginia Block 5 and Columbia. We expect the Block 5 contract to be awarded this year resulting in any considerable addition to backlog. With respect to bath, the challenges on the first [indiscernible] 1000 ship and DDG 51 restart ships are behind us, with nice performance on the 1001 and 1002 and the follow-on DDG-51 ships. We have 11 DDG-51 ships in backlog, with a very good opportunity to pursue -- improve performance steadily across this large backlog.
Finally, revenue at NASCO for the quarter was up due to higher repair volume. Similarly, year-to-date volumes were up due to higher repair and work on the TAO Class oiler program. We also expect the first 2 [ Maddison ] ships in the ESP 5 to deliver in the fourth quarter. 
In all, Marine Systems has been a compelling growth story for us and will continue to do so for a long time to come. Our focus going forward is operating efficiency and margin improvement over this very large backlog.
For Mission Systems, mission Systems had revenue of $1.2 billion in the quarter, flat with the year ago results. Earnings of $187 million were up $6 million against the third quarter last year. Margins were an impressive 60 basis points higher. Sequentially, margins of 15.2% were up on even more impressive 250 basis points. On a year-to-date basis, Mission Systems revenue was up $180 million or 5.2%. Earnings for the 9 months were up $17 million versus the first 9 months of last year.
Mission Systems has been a high-performance business for us and will continue to be so. It has enjoyed a book-to-bill of at least 1:1 in 2016, 2017 and 2018, and stands above 1:1 at the 3-quarter mark in 2019. Its wins have been broad-based reflectors capabilities in a space, communication and sophisticated command and control solutions.
Information Technology reported revenue of $2.1 billion in the third quarter, down $236 million against the year-ago quarter. This is largely the result of the divestitures made in this segment. Operating earnings were up $146 million, down $11 million despite a modest improvement in margin rate. The results were somewhat lower-than-expected as the company entered into a termination settlement related to its exit of a non-core line of business. Absent that charge, earnings in margin would have been more appropriate if reflected -- would have more appropriately reflected the progress we have made in combining CSRA with GDIT.
Our integration of CSRA and GDIT has gone very well and is ahead of our internal schedule. Our management team from both businesses have gelled very nicely. We are meeting cost synergies and are working to exceed this year's goals. 
To that end, we have continued to generate good bookings. In the quarter, we generated $2.38 billion for a book-to-bill of 1.2:1. For the 9 months, our book-to-bill was 1.2:1. Our 9-month booking for 2019 are nearly 8% higher than those captured during the first 3 quarters of 2018. Our total backlog of $9.16 billion is up 15% from the start of the year. The strong order activity comes in the face of a protracted procurement cycle. GDIT has close to $1 billion in awarded contracts that have been delayed by protests, and over half of the $65 billion in outstanding awards that the customer had expected has slipped to the right.
The underlying metric of this business remains solid. Cash flow continues to be strong. GDIT generated robust free cash flow to imputed net income of over 190% this quarter despite controlled investments in customer infrastructure and reconstructing expenses. 
So summary on the performance of all of the defense businesses, operating earnings have grown over 8% in the quarter on a nearly 3% advance in revenue. Excluding the divestiture of the call centers business, the organic growth rate for revenue and operating profit are about 1 to 2 points higher. Book-to-bill for the difference operations was 1.1:1 in the quarter. Orders are just shy of $8 billion on a revenue of $7.27 billion for the quarter. For the 9 months, defense bookings have essentially kept pace, with approximately 8% in revenue growth. 
I don't think I have any changes to make with respect to our prior guidance. We seem to be right on track with the comprehensive outlook I gave you last quarter. And finally in closing in, as tempting as it may be at this time to ask you about next year, let me just remind you that we have our planning process later this fall from the businesses get better insight into the upcoming year. The guidance that we give you in January as of last January is grounded in that process, and as a result, will be full and thorough. So I don't want to prematurely piecemeal and next year from this juncture. You will hear me from the deal of this has been our custom for many, many years. Let me turn over the call to our CFO, Jason Aiken."
274561,639827634,1836751,"General Dynamics Corporation, Q3 2019 Earnings Call, Oct 23, 2019",2019-10-23,"Earnings Calls","General Dynamics Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. Our net interest expense in the third quarter was $114 million in both 2019 and 2018. That brings net interest expense to $350 million for the first 9 months of the year compared to $244 million for the same period in 2",635,"Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. Our net interest expense in the third quarter was $114 million in both 2019 and 2018. That brings net interest expense to $350 million for the first 9 months of the year compared to $244 million for the same period in 2018. The increase in 2019 is due primarily to the debt we issued at the end of the first quarter of 2018  to finance the acquisition of CSRA. We've also been carrying a higher-than-anticipated commercial paper balance through the first 9 months as we continue to work to resolve an outstanding receivable balance on one of our large international vehicle programs that's been outstanding since the fourth quarter of last year. 
As Phebe mentioned, our cash from operations in the quarter was $1.1 billion, and our free cash flow was $847 million, a 93% conversion rate. The cash performance in the quarter reflected some progress on the international receivable that I just mentioned. That said, we still have work to do to resolve the balance of the arrears. We're continuing to work this issue with the customer and expect to have the matter resolved by the end of the year. Assuming these outstanding payments come in this year, we still expect full year free cash flow conversion to be well in excess of 100% of net income. Notwithstanding the progress made in the quarter, cash flow continue to be impacted by OWC growth at Gulfstream for reasons you now know and the Electric Boat. EB has been operating under an undefended ties contract action, or UCA, on the fifth Virginia Class Block as we continue to work with the Navy to get that effort under contract. Until we get that contract executed, our progress billings are temporally limited. We expect that situation to unwind with the receipt of the Block V contract in the fourth quarter.
On the capital deployment front, capital expenditures were $244 million in the quarter or 2.5% of revenues, reflecting the investment in our shipyards to support the significant growth that's on the horizon.
We also paid $295 million in dividends in the quarter. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $974 million on the balance sheet and a net debt position of $12.7 billion. We expect to use our free cash flow to repay our outstanding commercial paper balance by the end of this year. In addition, we have a tranche of fixed and floating rate notes maturing in the second quarter of next year so our focus in the moment beyond internal investments and the dividend will be repaying this debt.
Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 16.2%, reflecting greater foreign tax benefits than previously expected driven by the strength in our international operations. With a rate of 17.5% for the first 9 months, we are lowering our anticipated full year tax rate by 50 basis points to the mid-17% range.
As a result of current market conditions, we've adjusted our assumptions for pension costs and recognized in the third quarter an increase in the expense associated with our nonqualified plans. The impact of the increased pension expense and the lower tax rate I just discussed offset each other relative to our full year outlook. And one last point of color on our backlog at the end of the quarter, specifically at Combat Systems. We continue to experience a drag on that group's backlog balance due to the impact at the strength of the U.S. dollar, specifically Combat Systems has experienced a reduction in backlog of more than $400 million in the first 9 months of the year. Despite this headwind, the group's backlog remains very strong at more than 2x annual sales. Howard, that concludes my remarks. I'll turn it back over to you for the Q&A."

But I think it might be opportune just to remind you guys how we're really thinking about the portfolio of our airplanes and our operating strategies. So as you know, we've had a plan for the past several years to bring down the 650 production and increase 500 and 600, and we're doing that completely independently of the 700. We've been pretty valuable about the fact that G60 production and deliveries will be reduced next year again the following year. So that will get production and delivery consistent with current demand. And on that score, we had a very consistent order book for the 650 over the past 3 to 4 years. And as you know, we've had the benefit of a large backlog we've been able to work down over time. So just to be clear, this has nothing to do with the 700 launch announcement as a planned long ago. Our job is to balance the loss revenue and earnings from the planned reduction of G650 deliveries with an increased flow from 500 and 600 to keep earnings stable. If by the way, without risk but comes with the ample opportunity. And as I said, this has been the consistent plan and it remains our plan. And then as the G700 enters into service, that will then become another factor in our long-range earnings and revenue growth."

But in between that, as you articulated for the moment, the prioritization really is all about getting that debt paid down, at these for the first half of first year. Once we get to that point, we'll roughly pay down half of the incremental debt from the CSA acquisition, we'll have the commercial paper balance behind us, and we'll have a chance to look forward.

As you can discern from our press release, we delivered attractive third quarter results with revenue of $9.76 billion, operating earnings of $1.216 billion and net earnings from continuing operations of $913 million. We",2287,"Thanks, Howard, and good morning. As you can discern from our press release, we delivered attractive third quarter results with revenue of $9.76 billion, operating earnings of $1.216 billion and net earnings from continuing operations of $913 million. We reported EPS of $3.14 per diluted share, $0.25 a share better than the year-ago quarter and $0.37 per share better than the second quarter this year. Compared to the year-ago quarter, revenue was up $667 million or 7.3%. By the way, we have enjoyed top line growth every quarter for the past 12 consecutive quarters on a year-over-year basis. Earnings from continuing operations of $913 million were up $49 million or 5.7% on a 7.1% improvement in operating earnings, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate and lower pension income. Operating margins returned to the 12.5% level. Sequentially, revenue was up $206 million or 2.2% and operating earnings were up $126 million or 11.6% on higher operating margins. In short, we had significant sequential margin improvements. With respect to consensus, our margin rate was 40 basis points higher than forecasted by the sell side, this was offset in part by below-the-line items leaving our EPS $0.07 better than consensus. The difference was provided by stronger operating earnings.
With respect to cash, we had net cash provided by operating activities of $1.91 billion and free cash flow of $847 million. As you can see from the charts attached to the press release, we enjoyed a good quarter, with a 1:1 book-to-bill. Total backlog of $67.4 billion decreased $258 million or about 1/3 of 1%. I have more to say about order intake as I discuss the separate operating segment, and Jason will give you some color about cash and backlog in his remarks.
Let me turn very briefly to year-to-date 2019 compared to the first 9 months of 2018. Revenue was up $2.8 billion or 10.7% against the first 3 quarters of 2018 driven by strong organic growth plus the acquisition of CSRA at the beginning of the second quarter last year. To say it another way for clarity, CSRA's attributed revenue was in every 2018 quarter but the first. Operating earnings were up $89 million or 2.8%, EPS was $0.31 better. In short, we delivered good sequential improvement and a good first 9 months. As such, essentially, we are on track to our internal plan and external expectations.
So let me give you some perspective on the segment reporting for the quarter and the year-to-date. First, Aerospace. Aerospace had a very good quarter in most important respects. Revenue of $2.5 billion was 23% higher than the year ago quarter. Operating earnings of $393 million or $17 million or 4.5% higher on lower margins related to mix as fully expected. Let me give you a little color here with the quarter-over-quarter comparisons concerning earnings and operating margin. You may recall that the Aerospace segment had a strong third quarter last year, with 18.5% operating margin against 15.8% this quarter. This delta is driven only in part by mix. The third quarter of 2018 contained a positive nonrecurring settlement with a supplier. On a sequential basis, the story is even better. Revenue was up $359 million or 16.8%, and earnings were up $62 million or 18.7% on a 30 basis point improvement in operating margins. Excluding preowned sales from both periods results in a 70 basis points sequential improvement in Aerospace margin. The past quarters saw the first G600 deliveries in the quarter, over 30% of our large-cabin deliveries were comprised of new product, which is notably higher than the second quarter 2019. So despite the challenges of mix, we are making good progress. We are focused on aligning our cost with our operating cadence. The G600 earned both its type and production certification on June 28, 2019. We have commenced deliveries and expect to approach double-digit total this year. This will help both revenue and earnings in the balance of the year and improve working capital turns. The assay validation for this G500 was received on October 11 and the 600 validation is targeted for December 12. With respect to orders, we had a book-to-bill of 0.7:1 in the quarter. Activity and interest ranged between very attractive to robust, but the process and time to closure of transactions was slower. We expect, as you would guess, a very strong order activity in the fourth quarter. You are undoubtedly aware of the announcement of the all-new G700. The materials related to this program and its specifications are publicly available. It is an expansion of our product line that brings advances in avionics and aerodynamics to create an industry leader. The G700 incorporates new engines, new wing widths and brand-new avionics from the G500 and 600 series. The development of this plane is quite material and we expect first flight in December. The announcement of the G700 has cleared up some of the mystery, and has in some respects, stimulated G650 discussions. All in all, we are doing quite well at Aerospace.
Turning to Combat Systems, we had a good quarter as the relevant comparisons clearly indicate. Revenue of $1.74 billion was up $217 million over the third quarter of last year or 14.2%. Similarly, operating earnings of $264 million were up $23 million or 9.5% over the third quarter of 2018. On a sequential basis, the story is similar. Revenue was up $81 million or 5%, and operating earnings were up $22 million, a 9.1% increase. Combat Systems margins returned to the 15-plus percent neighborhood. On a year-to-date basis, revenue was up $538 million or 12% against the same period of 2018. However, operating earnings are only $11 million or 1.6% higher. Mix and a onetime settlement of lease litigation in the first quarter explained why profit has expanded more slowly than revenue. We expect a very good operating leverage in the final period of the year. I think it's worth noting that Combat Systems has enjoyed a year-over-year growth in 11 of the past 12 quarters. Our existing U.S.-based programs continue to perform well, with Abrams volumes up, strong Stryker business and nice growth in the ordnance and munitions portfolios. In the aggregate, our U.S. government volume accounted for 57% of revenue year-to-date compared with 49% in the first 3 quarters of 2018, underscoring the shift in mix. Army demand to upgrade our platforms in the coming year is manifesting itself in explicit program direction for the tank and Stryker, which puts us in good stead for continued growth. Furthermore, we recognize the Army's set a high bar for the OMFV program, and we are focused on delivering a superior solution to replace the Bradley fighting vehicle. Our international programs continue to progress nicely. Work on the U.K. AJAX program is transitioning from engineering to test and then to full production. Live fire testing has been successful, and we entered into reliability testing in third quarter this year. We expect to enter steady-state production this year and continue through 2024. Combat Systems enhanced their backlog this quarter with a book-to-bill of 1.3:1. The Government of Canada ordered 360 armored combat support vehicles for $1.3 billion. Work has begun on the program, and we expect to begin deliveries in Q1 of 2021. ELS is in negotiating the contract with the Spanish government to deliver the first tranche of 348 Piranha V vehicles. As a consequence, we have very good line of sight for production planning and for driving continuous improvement in all businesses in this segment. We are turning in the right direction at Combat Systems. Every one of our businesses in the segment is on the move.
With respect to the Marine group, revenue of $2.24 billion was $232 million or 11.6% higher than Q3 a year ago. Operating earnings were up $40 million or 23.7% against the year ago quarter due in part to the progress to our closing out Virginia Class Block III and better year-over-year earnings at NASSCO. On a sequential basis, revenue was down $90 million due to timing. Operating earnings were up $12 million. For the first 3 quarters of the year, revenue of $6.6 billion was up $413 million or 6.7% against the same 3 quarters of 2018. Operating earnings were $38 million better on a 10 basis point improvement in margin rate. Similar to Combat Systems, the Marine group has enjoyed year-over-year growth in 9 of the past 10 quarters. Work on our submarine programs, the Virginia Class construction and engineering on Columbia ballistic missile submarine continues to make good progress. We have completed the design of Columbia and are 54% complete on the production drawings, which reflects good progress. Virginia Class Block IV work remains steady. Volume EB has been driven by early work on Virginia Block V and Columbia. We expect the Block V contract to be awarded this year resulting in a considerable addition to backlog. With respect to Bath, the challenges on the first DDG-1000 ship and DDG-51 restart ships are behind us, with nice performance on the 1001 and 1002 and the follow-on DDG-51 ships. We have 11 DDG-51 ships in backlog, with a very good opportunity to improve performance steadily across this large backlog. Finally, revenue at NASSCO for the quarter was up due to higher repair volume. Similarly, year-to-date volumes were up due to higher repair and work on the TAO class oiler program. We also expect the first 2 Matson ships in the ESB 5 to deliver in the fourth quarter. In all, Marine Systems has been a compelling growth story for us and will continue to be so for a long time to come. Our focus going forward is operating efficiency and margin improvement over this very large backlog.
For Mission Systems, Mission Systems had revenue of $1.2 billion in the quarter, flat with the year ago results. Earnings of $187 million were up $6 million against the third quarter last year. Margins were an impressive 60 basis points higher. Sequentially, margins of 15.2% were up on even more impressive 250 basis points. On a year-to-date basis, Mission Systems revenue was up $180 million or 5.2%. Earnings for the 9 months were up $17 million versus the first 9 months of last year. Mission Systems has been a high-performance business for us and will continue to be so. It has enjoyed a book-to-bill of at least 1:1 in 2016, 2017 and 2018, and stands above 1:1 at the 3-quarter mark in 2019. Its wins have been broad-based, reflects its capabilities in space, communication and sophisticated command and control solutions.
Information Technology reported revenue of $2.1 billion in the third quarter, down $236 million against the year ago quarter. This is largely the result of the divestitures made in this segment. Operating earnings were up $146 million, down $11 million despite a modest improvement in margin rate. The results were somewhat lower than expected as the company entered into a termination settlement related to its exit of a non-core line of business. Absent that charge, earnings in margin would have more appropriately reflected the progress we have made in combining CSRA with GDIT. Our integration of CSRA into GDIT has gone very well and is ahead of our internal schedule. Our management team pulled from both businesses has gelled very nicely. We are meeting cost synergies and are working to exceed this year's goals. To that end, we have continued to generate good bookings. In the quarter, we generated $2.38 billion for a book-to-bill of 1.2:1. For the 9 months, our book-to-bill was 1.2:1. Our 9-month booking for 2019 are nearly 8% higher than those captured during the first 3 quarters of 2018. Our total backlog of $9.16 billion is up 15% from the start of the year. The strong order activity comes in the face of a protracted procurement cycle. GDIT has close to $1 billion in awarded contracts that have been delayed by protests, and over half of the $65 billion in outstanding awards that the customer had expected has slipped to the right. The underlying metric of this business remain solid. Cash flow continues to be strong. GDIT generated robust free cash flow to imputed net income of over 190% this quarter despite controlled investments in customer infrastructure and reconstructing expenses.
So to offer a summary on the performance of all of the defense businesses, operating earnings have grown over 8% in the quarter on a nearly 3% advance in revenue. Excluding the divestiture of the call centers business, the organic growth rate for revenue and operating profit are about 1 to 2 points higher. Book-to-bill for the defense operations was 1.1:1 in the quarter. Orders are just shy of $8 billion on a revenue of $7.27 billion for the quarter. For the 9 months, defense bookings have essentially kept pace, with approximately 8% in revenue growth. I don't think I have any changes to make with respect to our prior guidance. We seem to be right on track with the comprehensive outlook I gave you last quarter. And finally in closing in, as tempting as it may be at this time of year for you to ask about next year, let me just remind you that we have our planning process later this fall when the businesses get better insight into the upcoming year. The guidance that we give you in January as of last January is grounded in that process, and as a result, will be full and thorough. So I don't want to prematurely piecemeal next year at this juncture. You'll hear from me in detail in January, it's been our custom for many, many years.
Let me turn over the call to our CFO, Jason Aiken."
274561,639827634,1836912,"General Dynamics Corporation, Q3 2019 Earnings Call, Oct 23, 2019",2019-10-23,"Earnings Calls","General Dynamics Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. Our net interest expense in the third quarter was $114 million in both 2019 and 2018. That brings net interest expense to $350 million for the first 9 months of the year compared to $244 million for the same period in 2",633,"Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. Our net interest expense in the third quarter was $114 million in both 2019 and 2018. That brings net interest expense to $350 million for the first 9 months of the year compared to $244 million for the same period in 2018. The increase in 2019 is due primarily to the debt we issued at the end of the first quarter of 2018 to finance the acquisition of CSRA. We've also been carrying a higher-than-anticipated commercial paper balance through the first 9 months as we continue to work to resolve an outstanding receivable balance on one of our large international vehicle programs that's been outstanding since the fourth quarter of last year. As Phebe mentioned, our cash from operations in the quarter was $1.1 billion, and our free cash flow was $847 million, a 93% conversion rate. The cash performance in the quarter reflected some progress on the international receivables I just mentioned. That said, we still have work to do to resolve the balance of the arrears. We're continuing to work this issue with the customer and expect to have the matter resolved by the end of the year. Assuming these outstanding payments come in this year, we still expect full year free cash flow conversion to be well in excess of 100% of net income. Notwithstanding the progress made in the quarter, cash flow continued to be impacted by OWC growth at Gulfstream for reasons you now know and at Electric Boat. EB has been operating under an Undefinitized Contract Actions, or UCA, on the fifth Virginia Class Block as we continue to work with the Navy to get that effort under contract. Until we get that contract executed, our progress billings are temporally limited. We expect that situation to unwind with the receipt of the Block V contract in the fourth quarter.
On the capital deployment front, capital expenditures were $244 million in the quarter or 2.5% of revenues, reflecting the investment in our shipyards to support the significant growth that's on the horizon. We also paid $295 million in dividends in the quarter. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $974 million on the balance sheet and a net debt position of $12.7 billion. We expect to use our free cash flow to repay our outstanding commercial paper balance by the end of this year. In addition, we have a tranche of fixed and floating rate notes maturing in the second quarter of next year, so our focus in the moment beyond internal investments and the dividend will be repaying this debt. Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 16.2%, reflecting greater foreign tax benefits than previously expected driven by the start of international operations. With a rate of 17.5% for the first 9 months, we are lowering our anticipated full year tax rate by 50 basis points to the mid-17% range. As a result of current market conditions, we've adjusted our assumptions for pension costs and recognized in the third quarter an increase in the expense associated with our nonqualified plans. The impact of the increased pension expense and the lower tax rate I just discussed offset each other relative to our full year outlook. And one last point of color on the backlog at the end of the quarter, specifically at Combat Systems. We continue to experience a drag on that group's backlog balance due to the FX impact of the strength of the U.S. dollar, specifically Combat Systems has experienced a reduction in backlog of more than $400 million in the first 9 months of the year. Despite this headwind, the group's backlog remains very strong at more than 2x annual sales.
Howard, that concludes my remarks. I'll turn it back over to you for the Q&A."

But I think it might be opportune just to remind you guys how we're really thinking about the portfolio of our airplanes and our operating strategy. So as you know, we've had a plan for the past several years to bring down the 650 production and increase 500 and 600, and we're doing that completely independently of the 700. We've been pretty voluble about the fact that G60 production and deliveries will be reduced next year and again the following year. So that will get production and delivery consistent with current demand. And on that score, we've had a very consistent order book for the 650 over the past 3 to 4 years. And as you know, we've had the benefit of a large backlog we've been able to work down over time. So this is to be clear, this has nothing to do with the 700 launch announcement as a plan long ago. Our job is to balance the loss revenue and earnings from the planned reduction of G650 deliveries with an increased flow from 500 and 600 to keep earnings stable. By the way, to say, with that risk but it comes with ample opportunity. And as I said, this has been the consistent plan and it remains our plan. And then as the G700 enters into service, that will then become another factor in our long-range earnings and revenue growth."

But we've also seen a slowing in the execution of the contract awards, and we suspect that will resolve through the course of next year.

As you can discern from our press release, we delivered attractive third quarter results with revenue of $9.76 billion, operating earnings of $1.216 billion and net earnings from continuing operations of $913 million. We",2287,"Thanks, Howard, and good morning. As you can discern from our press release, we delivered attractive third quarter results with revenue of $9.76 billion, operating earnings of $1.216 billion and net earnings from continuing operations of $913 million. We reported EPS of $3.14 per diluted share, $0.25 a share better than the year-ago quarter and $0.37 per share better than the second quarter this year. Compared to the year-ago quarter, revenue was up $667 million or 7.3%. 
By the way, we have enjoyed top line growth every quarter for the past 12 consecutive quarters on a year-over-year basis. Earnings from continuing operations of $913 million were up $49 million or 5.7% on a 7.1% improvement in operating earnings, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate and lower pension income. Operating margins returned to the 12.5% level. 
Sequentially, revenue was up $206 million or 2.2% and operating earnings were up $126 million or 11.6% on higher operating margins. In short, we had significant sequential margin improvements. With respect to consensus, our margin rate was 40 basis points higher than forecasted by the sell side, this was offset in part by below-the-line items leaving our EPS $0.07 better than consensus. The difference was provided by stronger operating earnings.
With respect to cash, we had net cash provided by operating activities of $1.91 billion and free cash flow of $847 million. As you can see from the charts attached to the press release, we enjoyed a good quarter, with a 1:1 book-to-bill. Total backlog of $67.4 billion decreased $258 million or about 1/3 of 1%. I have more to say about order intake as I discuss the separate operating segment, and Jason will give you some color about cash and backlog in his remarks.
Let me turn very briefly to year-to-date 2019 compared to the first 9 months of 2018. Revenue was up $2.8 billion or 10.7% against the first 3 quarters of 2018 driven by strong organic growth plus the acquisition of CSRA at the beginning of the second quarter last year. To say it another way for clarity, CSRA's attributed revenue was in every 2018 quarter but the first. Operating earnings were up $89 million or 2.8%, EPS was $0.31 better. In short, we delivered good sequential improvement and a good first 9 months. As such, essentially, we are on track to our internal plan and external expectations.
So let me give you some perspective on the segment reporting for the quarter and the year-to-date. First, Aerospace. Aerospace had a very good quarter in most important respects. Revenue of $2.5 billion was 23% higher than the year ago quarter. Operating earnings of $393 million or $17 million or 4.5% higher on lower margins related to mix as fully expected. 
Let me give you a little color here with the quarter-over-quarter comparisons concerning earnings and operating margin. You may recall that the Aerospace segment had a strong third quarter last year, with 18.5% operating margin against 15.8% this quarter. This delta is driven only in part by mix. The third quarter of 2018 contained a positive nonrecurring settlement with a supplier. 
On a sequential basis, the story is even better. Revenue was up $359 million or 16.8%, and earnings were up $62 million or 18.7% on a 30 basis point improvement in operating margins. Excluding preowned sales from both periods results in a 70 basis points sequential improvement in Aerospace margin. The past quarters saw the first G600 deliveries in the quarter, over 30% of our large-cabin deliveries were comprised of new product, which is notably higher than the second quarter 2019. 
So despite the challenges of mix, we are making good progress. We are focused on aligning our cost with our operating cadence. The G600 earned both its type and production certification on June 28, 2019. We have commenced deliveries and expect to approach double-digit total this year. This will help both revenue and earnings in the balance of the year and improve working capital turns. The assay validation for this G500 was received on October 11 and the 600 validation is targeted for December 12. 
With respect to orders, we had a book-to-bill of 0.7:1 in the quarter. Activity and interest ranged between very attractive to robust, but the process and time to closure of transactions was slower. We expect, as you would guess, a very strong order activity in the fourth quarter. You are undoubtedly aware of the announcement of the all-new G700. The materials related to this program and its specifications are publicly available. It is an expansion of our product line that brings advances in avionics and aerodynamics to create an industry leader. 
The G700 incorporates new engines, new wing widths and brand-new avionics from the G500 and 600 series. The development of this plane is quite material and we expect first flight in December. The announcement of the G700 has cleared up some of the mystery, and has in some respects, stimulated G650 discussions. All in all, we are doing quite well at Aerospace.
Turning to Combat Systems, we had a good quarter as the relevant comparisons clearly indicate. Revenue of $1.74 billion was up $217 million over the third quarter of last year or 14.2%. Similarly, operating earnings of $264 million were up $23 million or 9.5% over the third quarter of 2018. On a sequential basis, the story is similar. Revenue was up $81 million or 5%, and operating earnings were up $22 million, a 9.1% increase. Combat Systems margins returned to the 15-plus percent neighborhood. 
On a year-to-date basis, revenue was up $538 million or 12% against the same period of 2018. However, operating earnings are only $11 million or 1.6% higher. Mix and a onetime settlement of lease litigation in the first quarter explained why profit has expanded more slowly than revenue. We expect a very good operating leverage in the final period of the year. I think it's worth noting that Combat Systems has enjoyed a year-over-year growth in 11 of the past 12 quarters. Our existing U.S.-based programs continue to perform well, with Abrams volumes up, strong Stryker business and nice growth in the ordnance and munitions portfolios. 
In the aggregate, our U.S. government volume accounted for 57% of revenue year-to-date compared with 49% in the first 3 quarters of 2018, underscoring the shift in mix. Army demand to upgrade our platforms in the coming year is manifesting itself in explicit program direction for the tank and Stryker, which puts us in good stead for continued growth. Furthermore, we recognize the Army's set a high bar for the OMFV program, and we are focused on delivering a superior solution to replace the Bradley fighting vehicle. 
Our international programs continue to progress nicely. Work on the U.K. AJAX program is transitioning from engineering to test and then to full production. Live fire testing has been successful, and we entered into reliability testing in third quarter this year. We expect to enter steady-state production this year and continue through 2024. Combat Systems enhanced their backlog this quarter with a book-to-bill of 1.3:1. The Government of Canada ordered 360 armored combat support vehicles for $1.3 billion. 
Work has begun on the program, and we expect to begin deliveries in Q1 of 2021. ELS is in negotiating the contract with the Spanish government to deliver the first tranche of 348 Piranha V vehicles. As a consequence, we have very good line of sight for production planning and for driving continuous improvement in all businesses in this segment. We are turning in the right direction at Combat Systems. Every one of our businesses in the segment is on the move.
With respect to the Marine group, revenue of $2.24 billion was $232 million or 11.6% higher than Q3 a year ago. Operating earnings were up $40 million or 23.7% against the year ago quarter due in part to the progress to our closing out Virginia Class Block III and better year-over-year earnings at NASSCO. On a sequential basis, revenue was down $90 million due to timing. Operating earnings were up $12 million. For the first 3 quarters of the year, revenue of $6.6 billion was up $413 million or 6.7% against the same 3 quarters of 2018. 
Operating earnings were $38 million better on a 10 basis point improvement in margin rate. Similar to Combat Systems, the Marine group has enjoyed year-over-year growth in 9 of the past 10 quarters. Work on our submarine programs, the Virginia Class construction and engineering on Columbia ballistic missile submarine continues to make good progress. We have completed the design of Columbia and are 54% complete on the production drawings, which reflects good progress. Virginia Class Block IV work remains steady. 
Volume EB has been driven by early work on Virginia Block V and Columbia. We expect the Block V contract to be awarded this year resulting in a considerable addition to backlog. With respect to Bath, the challenges on the first DDG-1000 ship and DDG-51 restart ships are behind us, with nice performance on the 1001 and 1002 and the follow-on DDG-51 ships. We have 11 DDG-51 ships in backlog, with a very good opportunity to improve performance steadily across this large backlog. 
Finally, revenue at NASSCO for the quarter was up due to higher repair volume. Similarly, year-to-date volumes were up due to higher repair and work on the TAO class oiler program. We also expect the first 2 Matson ships in the ESB 5 to deliver in the fourth quarter. In all, Marine Systems has been a compelling growth story for us and will continue to be so for a long time to come. Our focus going forward is operating efficiency and margin improvement over this very large backlog.
For Mission Systems, Mission Systems had revenue of $1.2 billion in the quarter, flat with the year ago results. Earnings of $187 million were up $6 million against the third quarter last year. Margins were an impressive 60 basis points higher. Sequentially, margins of 15.2% were up on even more impressive 250 basis points. On a year-to-date basis, Mission Systems revenue was up $180 million or 5.2%. Earnings for the 9 months were up $17 million versus the first 9 months of last year. 
Mission Systems has been a high-performance business for us and will continue to be so. It has enjoyed a book-to-bill of at least 1:1 in 2016, 2017 and 2018, and stands above 1:1 at the 3-quarter mark in 2019. Its wins have been broad-based, reflects its capabilities in space, communication and sophisticated command and control solutions.
Information Technology reported revenue of $2.1 billion in the third quarter, down $236 million against the year ago quarter. This is largely the result of the divestitures made in this segment. Operating earnings were up $146 million, down $11 million despite a modest improvement in margin rate. The results were somewhat lower than expected as the company entered into a termination settlement related to its exit of a noncore line of business. 
Absent that charge, earnings in margin would have more appropriately reflected the progress we have made in combining CSRA with GDIT. Our integration of CSRA into GDIT has gone very well and is ahead of our internal schedule. Our management team pulled from both businesses has gelled very nicely. We are meeting cost synergies and are working to exceed this year's goals. To that end, we have continued to generate good bookings. In the quarter, we generated $2.38 billion for a book-to-bill of 1.2:1. 
For the 9 months, our book-to-bill was 1.2:1. Our 9-month booking for 2019 are nearly 8% higher than those captured during the first 3 quarters of 2018. Our total backlog of $9.16 billion is up 15% from the start of the year. The strong order activity comes in the face of a protracted procurement cycle. GDIT has close to $1 billion in awarded contracts that have been delayed by protests, and over half of the $65 billion in outstanding awards that the customer had expected has slipped to the right. 
The underlying metric of this business remain solid. Cash flow continues to be strong. GDIT generated robust free cash flow to imputed net income of over 190% this quarter despite controlled investments in customer infrastructure and reconstructing expenses.
So to offer a summary on the performance of all of the defense businesses, operating earnings have grown over 8% in the quarter on a nearly 3% advance in revenue. Excluding the divestiture of the call centers business, the organic growth rate for revenue and operating profit are about 1 to 2 points higher. Book-to-bill for the defense operations was 1.1:1 in the quarter. Orders are just shy of $8 billion on a revenue of $7.27 billion for the quarter. For the 9 months, defense bookings have essentially kept pace, with approximately 8% in revenue growth. 
I don't think I have any changes to make with respect to our prior guidance. We seem to be right on track with the comprehensive outlook I gave you last quarter. And finally in closing in, as tempting as it may be at this time of year for you to ask about next year, let me just remind you that we have our planning process later this fall when the businesses get better insight into the upcoming year. The guidance that we give you in January as of last January is grounded in that process, and as a result, will be full and thorough. So I don't want to prematurely piecemeal next year at this juncture. You'll hear from me in detail in January, it's been our custom for many, many years.
Let me turn over the call to our CFO, Jason Aiken."
274561,639827634,1837699,"General Dynamics Corporation, Q3 2019 Earnings Call, Oct 23, 2019",2019-10-23,"Earnings Calls","General Dynamics Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. Our net interest expense in the third quarter was $114 million in both 2019 and 2018. That brings net interest expense to $350 million for the first 9 months of the year compared to $244 million for the same period in 2",633,"Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. Our net interest expense in the third quarter was $114 million in both 2019 and 2018. That brings net interest expense to $350 million for the first 9 months of the year compared to $244 million for the same period in 2018. The increase in 2019 is due primarily to the debt we issued at the end of the first quarter of 2018 to finance the acquisition of CSRA. We've also been carrying a higher-than-anticipated commercial paper balance through the first 9 months as we continue to work to resolve an outstanding receivable balance on one of our large international vehicle programs that's been outstanding since the fourth quarter of last year. 
As Phebe mentioned, our cash from operations in the quarter was $1.1 billion, and our free cash flow was $847 million, a 93% conversion rate. The cash performance in the quarter reflected some progress on the international receivables I just mentioned. That said, we still have work to do to resolve the balance of the arrears. We're continuing to work this issue with the customer and expect to have the matter resolved by the end of the year. Assuming these outstanding payments come in this year, we still expect full year free cash flow conversion to be well in excess of 100% of net income. 
Notwithstanding the progress made in the quarter, cash flow continued to be impacted by OWC growth at Gulfstream for reasons you now know and at Electric Boat. EB has been operating under an Undefinitized Contract Actions, or UCA, on the fifth Virginia Class Block as we continue to work with the Navy to get that effort under contract. Until we get that contract executed, our progress billings are temporally limited. We expect that situation to unwind with the receipt of the Block V contract in the fourth quarter.
On the capital deployment front, capital expenditures were $244 million in the quarter or 2.5% of revenues, reflecting the investment in our shipyards to support the significant growth that's on the horizon. We also paid $295 million in dividends in the quarter. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $974 million on the balance sheet and a net debt position of $12.7 billion. We expect to use our free cash flow to repay our outstanding commercial paper balance by the end of this year. In addition, we have a tranche of fixed and floating rate notes maturing in the second quarter of next year, so our focus in the moment beyond internal investments and the dividend will be repaying this debt. 
Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 16.2%, reflecting greater foreign tax benefits than previously expected driven by the start of international operations. With a rate of 17.5% for the first 9 months, we are lowering our anticipated full year tax rate by 50 basis points to the mid-17% range. As a result of current market conditions, we've adjusted our assumptions for pension costs and recognized in the third quarter an increase in the expense associated with our nonqualified plans. The impact of the increased pension expense and the lower tax rate I just discussed offset each other relative to our full year outlook. 
And one last point of color on the backlog at the end of the quarter, specifically at Combat Systems. We continue to experience a drag on that group's backlog balance due to the FX impact of the strength of the U.S. dollar, specifically Combat Systems has experienced a reduction in backlog of more than $400 million in the first 9 months of the year. Despite this headwind, the group's backlog remains very strong at more than 2x annual sales.
Howard, that concludes my remarks. I'll turn it back over to you for the Q&A."

But I think it might be opportune just to remind you guys how we're really thinking about the portfolio of our airplanes and our operating strategy. So as you know, we've had a plan for the past several years to bring down the 650 production and increase 500 and 600, and we're doing that completely independently of the 700. We've been pretty voluble about the fact that G60 production and deliveries will be reduced next year and again the following year. So that will get production and delivery consistent with current demand. 
And on that score, we've had a very consistent order book for the 650 over the past 3 to 4 years. And as you know, we've had the benefit of a large backlog we've been able to work down over time. So this is to be clear, this has nothing to do with the 700 launch announcement as a plan long ago. Our job is to balance the loss revenue and earnings from the planned reduction of G650 deliveries with an increased flow from 500 and 600 to keep earnings stable. 
By the way, to say, with that risk but it comes with ample opportunity. And as I said, this has been the consistent plan and it remains our plan. And then as the G700 enters into service, that will then become another factor in our long-range earnings and revenue growth."

But in between that, as you articulated, for the moment the prioritization really is all about getting that debt paid down, at least through the first half of next year. Once we get to that point, we'll roughly pay down half of the incremental debt from the CSRA acquisition, we'll have the commercial paper balance behind us, and we'll have a chance to look forward.

Now protests, as you well know, historically, resolve to the benefit of the winner, so we are quite comfortable that, that historical precedence will remain. But we've also seen a slowing in the execution of the contract awards, and we suspect that will resolve through the course of next year.

274561,639827634,1837848,"General Dynamics Corporation, Q3 2019 Earnings Call, Oct 23, 2019",2019-10-23,"Earnings Calls","General Dynamics Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Howard, and good morning. As you can discern from our press release, we delivered attractive third quarter results with revenue of $9.76 billion, operating earnings of $1.216 billion and net earnings from continuing operations of $913 million. We",2287,"Thanks, Howard, and good morning. As you can discern from our press release, we delivered attractive third quarter results with revenue of $9.76 billion, operating earnings of $1.216 billion and net earnings from continuing operations of $913 million. We reported EPS of $3.14 per diluted share, $0.25 a share better than the year-ago quarter and $0.37 per share better than the second quarter this year. Compared to the year-ago quarter, revenue was up $667 million or 7.3%. 
By the way, we have enjoyed top line growth every quarter for the past 12 consecutive quarters on a year-over-year basis. Earnings from continuing operations of $913 million were up $49 million or 5.7% on a 7.1% improvement in operating earnings, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate and lower pension income. Operating margins returned to the 12.5% level. 
Sequentially, revenue was up $206 million or 2.2% and operating earnings were up $126 million or 11.6% on higher operating margins. In short, we had significant sequential margin improvements. With respect to consensus, our margin rate was 40 basis points higher than forecasted by the sell side, this was offset in part by below-the-line items leaving our EPS $0.07 better than consensus. The difference was provided by stronger operating earnings.
With respect to cash, we had net cash provided by operating activities of $1.91 billion and free cash flow of $847 million. As you can see from the charts attached to the press release, we enjoyed a good quarter, with a 1:1 book-to-bill. Total backlog of $67.4 billion decreased $258 million or about 1/3 of 1%. I have more to say about order intake as I discuss the separate operating segment, and Jason will give you some color about cash and backlog in his remarks.
Let me turn very briefly to year-to-date 2019 compared to the first 9 months of 2018. Revenue was up $2.8 billion or 10.7% against the first 3 quarters of 2018 driven by strong organic growth plus the acquisition of CSRA at the beginning of the second quarter last year. To say it another way for clarity, CSRA's attributed revenue was in every 2018 quarter but the first. Operating earnings were up $89 million or 2.8%, EPS was $0.31 better. In short, we delivered good sequential improvement and a good first 9 months. As such, essentially, we are on track to our internal plan and external expectations.
So let me give you some perspective on the segment reporting for the quarter and the year-to-date. First, Aerospace. Aerospace had a very good quarter in most important respects. Revenue of $2.5 billion was 23% higher than the year ago quarter. Operating earnings of $393 million or $17 million or 4.5% higher on lower margins related to mix as fully expected. 
Let me give you a little color here with the quarter-over-quarter comparisons concerning earnings and operating margin. You may recall that the Aerospace segment had a strong third quarter last year, with 18.5% operating margin against 15.8% this quarter. This delta is driven only in part by mix. The third quarter of 2018 contained a positive nonrecurring settlement with a supplier. 
On a sequential basis, the story is even better. Revenue was up $359 million or 16.8%, and earnings were up $62 million or 18.7% on a 30 basis point improvement in operating margins. Excluding preowned sales from both periods results in a 70 basis points sequential improvement in Aerospace margin. The past quarters saw the first G600 deliveries in the quarter, over 30% of our large-cabin deliveries were comprised of new product, which is notably higher than the second quarter 2019. 
So despite the challenges of mix, we are making good progress. We are focused on aligning our cost with our operating cadence. The G600 earned both its type and production certification on June 28, 2019. We have commenced deliveries and expect to approach double-digit total this year. This will help both revenue and earnings in the balance of the year and improve working capital turns. The assay validation for this G500 was received on October 11 and the 600 validation is targeted for December 12. 
With respect to orders, we had a book-to-bill of 0.7:1 in the quarter. Activity and interest ranged between very attractive to robust, but the process and time to closure of transactions was slower. We expect, as you would guess, a very strong order activity in the fourth quarter. You are undoubtedly aware of the announcement of the all-new G700. The materials related to this program and its specifications are publicly available. It is an expansion of our product line that brings advances in avionics and aerodynamics to create an industry leader. 
The G700 incorporates new engines, new wing widths and brand-new avionics from the G500 and 600 series. The development of this plane is quite material and we expect first flight in December. The announcement of the G700 has cleared up some of the mystery, and has in some respects, stimulated G650 discussions. All in all, we are doing quite well at Aerospace.
Turning to Combat Systems, we had a good quarter as the relevant comparisons clearly indicate. Revenue of $1.74 billion was up $217 million over the third quarter of last year or 14.2%. Similarly, operating earnings of $264 million were up $23 million or 9.5% over the third quarter of 2018. On a sequential basis, the story is similar. Revenue was up $81 million or 5% and operating earnings were up $22 million, a 9.1% increase. Combat Systems margins returned to the 15-plus percent neighborhood. 
On a year-to-date basis, revenue was up $538 million or 12% against the same period of 2018. However, operating earnings are only $11 million or 1.6% higher. Mix and a onetime settlement of lease litigation in the first quarter explained why profit has expanded more slowly than revenue. We expect a very good operating leverage in the final period of the year. I think it's worth noting that Combat Systems has enjoyed a year-over-year growth in 11 of the past 12 quarters. Our existing U.S.-based programs continue to perform well, with Abrams volumes up, strong Stryker business and nice growth in the ordnance and munitions portfolios. 
In the aggregate, our U.S. government volume accounted for 57% of revenue year-to-date compared with 49% in the first 3 quarters of 2018, underscoring the shift in mix. Army demand to upgrade our platforms in the coming year is manifesting itself in explicit program direction for the tank and Stryker, which puts us in good stead for continued growth. Furthermore, we recognize the Army's set a high bar for the OMFV program, and we are focused on delivering a superior solution to replace the Bradley fighting vehicle. 
Our international programs continue to progress nicely. Work on the U.K. AJAX program is transitioning from engineering to test and then to full production. Live fire testing has been successful, and we entered into reliability testing in third quarter this year. We expect to enter steady-state production this year and continue through 2024. Combat Systems enhanced their backlog this quarter with a book-to-bill of 1.3:1. The Government of Canada ordered 360 armored combat support vehicles for $1.3 billion. 
Work has begun on the program, and we expect to begin deliveries in Q1 of 2021. ELS is in negotiating the contract with the Spanish government to deliver the first tranche of 348 Piranha V vehicles. As a consequence, we have very good line of sight for production planning and for driving continuous improvement in all businesses in this segment. We are turning in the right direction at Combat Systems. Every one of our businesses in the segment is on the move.
With respect to the Marine group, revenue of $2.24 billion was $232 million or 11.6% higher than Q3 a year ago. Operating earnings were up $40 million or 23.7% against the year ago quarter due in part to the progress to our closing out Virginia Class Block III and better year-over-year earnings at NASSCO. On a sequential basis, revenue was down $90 million due to timing. Operating earnings were up $12 million. For the first 3 quarters of the year, revenue of $6.6 billion was up $413 million or 6.7% against the same 3 quarters of 2018. 
Operating earnings were $38 million better on a 10 basis point improvement in margin rate. Similar to Combat Systems, the Marine group has enjoyed year-over-year growth in 9 of the past 10 quarters. Work on our submarine programs, the Virginia Class construction and engineering on Columbia ballistic missile submarine continues to make good progress. We have completed the design of Columbia and are 54% complete on the production drawings, which reflects good progress. Virginia Class Block IV work remains steady. 
Volume EB has been driven by early work on Virginia Block V and Columbia. We expect the Block V contract to be awarded this year resulting in a considerable addition to backlog. With respect to Bath, the challenges on the first DDG-1000 ship and DDG-51 restart ships are behind us, with nice performance on the 1001 and 1002 and the follow-on DDG-51 ships. We have 11 DDG-51 ships in backlog, with a very good opportunity to improve performance steadily across this large backlog. 
Finally, revenue at NASSCO for the quarter was up due to higher repair volume. Similarly, year-to-date volumes were up due to higher repair and work on the TAO class oiler program. We also expect the first 2 Matson ships in the ESB 5 to deliver in the fourth quarter. In all, Marine Systems has been a compelling growth story for us and will continue to be so for a long time to come. Our focus going forward is operating efficiency and margin improvement over this very large backlog.
For Mission Systems, Mission Systems had revenue of $1.2 billion in the quarter, flat with the year ago results. Earnings of $187 million were up $6 million against the third quarter last year. Margins were an impressive 60 basis points higher. Sequentially, margins of 15.2% were up on even more impressive 250 basis points. On a year-to-date basis, Mission Systems revenue was up $180 million or 5.2%. Earnings for the 9 months were up $17 million versus the first 9 months of last year. 
Mission Systems has been a high-performance business for us and will continue to be so. It has enjoyed a book-to-bill of at least 1:1 in 2016, 2017 and 2018, and stands above 1:1 at the 3-quarter mark in 2019. Its wins have been broad-based, reflects its capabilities in space, communication and sophisticated command and control solutions.
Information Technology reported revenue of $2.1 billion in the third quarter, down $236 million against the year ago quarter. This is largely the result of the divestitures made in this segment. Operating earnings were up $146 million, down $11 million despite a modest improvement in margin rate. The results were somewhat lower than expected as the company entered into a termination settlement related to its exit of a noncore line of business. 
Absent that charge, earnings in margin would have more appropriately reflected the progress we have made in combining CSRA with GDIT. Our integration of CSRA into GDIT has gone very well and is ahead of our internal schedule. Our management team pulled from both businesses has gelled very nicely. We are meeting cost synergies and are working to exceed this year's goals. To that end, we have continued to generate good bookings. In the quarter, we generated $2.38 billion for a book-to-bill of 1.2:1. 
For the 9 months, our book-to-bill was 1.2:1. Our 9-month booking for 2019 are nearly 8% higher than those captured during the first 3 quarters of 2018. Our total backlog of $9.16 billion is up 15% from the start of the year. The strong order activity comes in the face of a protracted procurement cycle. GDIT has close to $1 billion in awarded contracts that have been delayed by protests, and over half of the $65 billion in outstanding awards that the customer had expected has slipped to the right. 
The underlying metric of this business remain solid. Cash flow continues to be strong. GDIT generated robust free cash flow to imputed net income of over 190% this quarter despite controlled investments in customer infrastructure and reconstructing expenses.
So to offer a summary on the performance of all of the defense businesses, operating earnings have grown over 8% in the quarter on a nearly 3% advance in revenue. Excluding the divestiture of the call centers business, the organic growth rate for revenue and operating profit are about 1 to 2 points higher. Book-to-bill for the defense operations was 1.1:1 in the quarter. Orders are just shy of $8 billion on a revenue of $7.27 billion for the quarter. For the 9 months, defense bookings have essentially kept pace, with approximately 8% in revenue growth. 
I don't think I have any changes to make with respect to our prior guidance. We seem to be right on track with the comprehensive outlook I gave you last quarter. And finally in closing in, as tempting as it may be at this time of year for you to ask about next year, let me just remind you that we have our planning process later this fall when the businesses get better insight into the upcoming year. The guidance that we give you in January as of last January is grounded in that process, and as a result, will be full and thorough. So I don't want to prematurely piecemeal next year at this juncture. You'll hear from me in detail in January, it's been our custom for many, many years.
Let me turn over the call to our CFO, Jason Aiken."
274561,639827634,1837848,"General Dynamics Corporation, Q3 2019 Earnings Call, Oct 23, 2019",2019-10-23,"Earnings Calls","General Dynamics Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. Our net interest expense in the third quarter was $114 million in both 2019 and 2018. That brings net interest expense to $350 million for the first 9 months of the year compared to $244 million for the same period in 2",633,"Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. Our net interest expense in the third quarter was $114 million in both 2019 and 2018. That brings net interest expense to $350 million for the first 9 months of the year compared to $244 million for the same period in 2018. The increase in 2019 is due primarily to the debt we issued at the end of the first quarter of 2018 to finance the acquisition of CSRA. We've also been carrying a higher-than-anticipated commercial paper balance through the first 9 months as we continue to work to resolve an outstanding receivable balance on one of our large international vehicle programs that's been outstanding since the fourth quarter of last year. 
As Phebe mentioned, our cash from operations in the quarter was $1.1 billion, and our free cash flow was $847 million, a 93% conversion rate. The cash performance in the quarter reflected some progress on the international receivables I just mentioned. That said, we still have work to do to resolve the balance of the arrears. We're continuing to work this issue with the customer and expect to have the matter resolved by the end of the year. Assuming these outstanding payments come in this year, we still expect full year free cash flow conversion to be well in excess of 100% of net income. 
Notwithstanding the progress made in the quarter, cash flow continued to be impacted by OWC growth at Gulfstream for reasons you now know and at Electric Boat. EB has been operating under an Undefinitized Contract Actions, or UCA, on the fifth Virginia Class Block as we continue to work with the Navy to get that effort under contract. Until we get that contract executed, our progress billings are temporally limited. We expect that situation to unwind with the receipt of the Block V contract in the fourth quarter.
On the capital deployment front, capital expenditures were $244 million in the quarter or 2.5% of revenues, reflecting the investment in our shipyards to support the significant growth that's on the horizon. We also paid $295 million in dividends in the quarter. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $974 million on the balance sheet and a net debt position of $12.7 billion. We expect to use our free cash flow to repay our outstanding commercial paper balance by the end of this year. In addition, we have a tranche of fixed and floating rate notes maturing in the second quarter of next year, so our focus in the moment beyond internal investments and the dividend will be repaying this debt. 
Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 16.2%, reflecting greater foreign tax benefits than previously expected driven by the start of international operations. With a rate of 17.5% for the first 9 months, we are lowering our anticipated full year tax rate by 50 basis points to the mid-17% range. As a result of current market conditions, we've adjusted our assumptions for pension costs and recognized in the third quarter an increase in the expense associated with our nonqualified plans. The impact of the increased pension expense and the lower tax rate I just discussed offset each other relative to our full year outlook. 
And one last point of color on the backlog at the end of the quarter, specifically at Combat Systems. We continue to experience a drag on that group's backlog balance due to the FX impact of the strength of the U.S. dollar, specifically Combat Systems has experienced a reduction in backlog of more than $400 million in the first 9 months of the year. Despite this headwind, the group's backlog remains very strong at more than 2x annual sales.
Howard, that concludes my remarks. I'll turn it back over to you for the Q&A."

But I think it might be opportune just to remind you guys how we're really thinking about the portfolio of our airplanes and our operating strategy. So as you know, we've had a plan for the past several years to bring down the 650 production and increase 500 and 600, and we're doing that completely independently of the 700. We've been pretty voluble about the fact that G60 production and deliveries will be reduced next year and again the following year. So that will get production and delivery consistent with current demand. 
And on that score, we've had a very consistent order book for the 650 over the past 3 to 4 years. And as you know, we've had the benefit of a large backlog we've been able to work down over time. So this is to be clear, this has nothing to do with the 700 launch announcement as a plan long ago. Our job is to balance the loss revenue and earnings from the planned reduction of G650 deliveries with an increased flow from 500 and 600 to keep earnings stable. 
By the way, to say, with that risk but it comes with ample opportunity. And as I said, this has been the consistent plan and it remains our plan. And then as the G700 enters into service, that will then become another factor in our long-range earnings and revenue growth."

Internal investment first, where we have profitable opportunities for returns, followed by the steady and predictable dividend. And then it really is about M&A where attractive, accretive and our core opportunities exist and share repurchases. 
But in between that, as you articulated, for the moment the prioritization really is all about getting that debt paid down, at least through the first half of next year. Once we get to that point, we'll roughly pay down half of the incremental debt from the CSRA acquisition, we'll have the commercial paper balance behind us, and we'll have a chance to look forward.

Now protests, as you well know, historically, resolve to the benefit of the winner, so we are quite comfortable that, that historical precedence will remain. But we've also seen a slowing in the execution of the contract awards, and we suspect that will resolve through the course of next year.
