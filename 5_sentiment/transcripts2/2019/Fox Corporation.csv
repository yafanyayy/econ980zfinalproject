Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us today on Fox Corporation's year-end earnings call. While we are ending a fiscal year, we're also just starting our growth trajectory and are hitting key milestones at a good pace, specifically,",1886,"Thanks, Joe. Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us today on Fox Corporation's year-end earnings call. While we are ending a fiscal year, we're also just starting our growth trajectory and are hitting key milestones at a good pace, specifically, we just reported strong financial results. We recently concluded a very successful advertising upfront, very successful. We're making good progress on our distribution renewals. And we are having a compelling content lineup across our linear and digital channels, all of which positions us well as we commence our first full fiscal year in 2020. 
For fiscal 2019, we delivered exceptional financial results, achieving 12% revenue growth and 8% EBITDA growth. Our revenue growth was led by double-digit gains in both affiliate and advertising revenues. As you all know, about half of our annual revenue comes from affiliate revenue. And despite continued subscriber declines, we achieved 12% affiliate revenue growth in fiscal 2019. 
Renewing distribution arrangements with our partners is a normal course activity for us, and we have accomplished these renewals without much clamor over many cycles. This past fiscal year was no exception. We were able to reset affiliate rates, particularly in the Television segment, successfully renewing numerous distribution agreements. 
Today, the remainder of our annual revenue principally comes from advertising. In fiscal 2019, we achieved 10% growth, led by the addition of Thursday Night Football and record gross political revenues of more than $185 million at the FOX Stations Group, surpassing by almost 50% the previous record set in fiscal 2013 during the Obama-Romney election. 
A particularly noteworthy facet of this year's growth was a 24% increase in digital advertising revenues, led by 46% growth at FoxNews.com alone. Our advertising partners are clearly supportive of our ongoing programming strategy. This year's advertising upfront was one of the strongest we have seen in many years, yielding higher pricing across entertainment, sports and news. Specifically for Fox, these trends reflect advertisers' recognition of our unique capacity to deliver highly engaged audiences at scale. 
Across our concentrated portfolio, we were rewarded for our continuing content investments. On the entertainment front, we were able to achieve top-of-market, low-teen CPM increases and mid- to high-single-digit volume increases. In addition, we were able to command mid- to high-single-digit pricing increases in sports and news. In addition, even at this early date, we're very encouraged by both the volume and pricing we are seeing for the Super Bowl. We are in a strong television advertising market right now, which is due in part to an especially renewed interest by marketers in prime time and sports programming, which is clearly to our great advantage. 
As you know, a significant amount of the company's revenue is tied to the FOX broadcast network, which is supported by key sports and entertainment content as well as by local programming delivered everyday across America. Our network commenced premium advertising and retransmission revenue rates because it delivers a complete schedule of diverse content owners that engage wide audiences. From the NFL to The Simpson's, the network is defined by its programming breadth and not by a vertical concentration that is the hallmark of cable channels. And it is this breadth of programming that makes the FOX broadcast network 1 of the top 4 channels across the country, week in and week out, and such a strategic asset for Fox. 
While the power of sports is undeniable, we are not looking to turn Fox into a pure-play sports channel. We have a few of those already. Rather keeping the FOX Network vibrant and connected to our audiences is what we are constantly focused on. It is why we are investing in entertainment originality at the network at a time when broadcast originality and the scarcity value of reaching large audiences attracts a market premium across our revenue streams, as was demonstrated by advertisers in the recent upfront. 
To that end, we are pursuing a strategy to expand our portfolio of own content to generate long-term asset value for Fox. We are being strategic and judicious, building smartly and deliberately around our strengths. As part of this strategy, we are pursuing a new program coproduction model that gives us an equity interest in nearly all new shows aired on the network. We are enhancing our internal content-creation capabilities through the launch of SideCar, which is already providing third-party platforms, like be, with content; and also through the acquisition we announced yesterday of Bento Box, the animation company that produces BOB'S BURGERS; as well as 2 new Fox series, DUNCANVILLE and THE GREAT NORTH. Bento Box gives FOX access to the next-generation of animators and the ability to originate owned IP to drive long-term value for the company. 
You need only to look at our Sunday broadcast schedule, where we have launched more animated hits than anyone to know that animation has been the most stable network programming on FOX bar none, creating leverage, loyalty and youthful audiences across linear and digital properties. 
Beyond the network, we are also focused on our direct-to-consumer initiatives. FOX News continues to build a significant multi-platform presence well beyond the linear channel and has a strong position in direct-to-consumer news offerings. The FOX News digital properties attract over 100 million unique users per month and leads news engagement with over 3 billion page views per month. We're expanding our DTC news capabilities by offering a more immersive video-on-demand service in the former FOX Nation, which was launched just this past November. 
On the sports front, we launched pay-per-view boxing with the Spend Garcia bout in March. We followed that with the Pacquiao-Thurman match just a few weeks ago, and we're encouraged by the results, as total purchases increased by more than 30% and direct purchases on the FOX Sports digital properties nearly doubled from the first pay-per-view event. 
In aggregate, the Fox portfolio of digital properties generates a monthly audience of over 200 million unique people and nearly 10 billion minutes of content consumption. 
But our progress does not stop there. During the past few months and consistent with the strategy we outlined at our Investor Day, we've made key investments to expand the reach of our brands beyond their traditional linear business models and deliver new and innovative products to our most valuable asset: our massive and massively engaged audience. 
Most notably, in May, Fox and the Stars Group announced plans to launch Fox Bet, a national media and sports partnership in the United States. We are on track to launch the Fox Bet product in the upcoming football season -- or I should say, before the upcoming football season. And we see the opportunity in sports wagering as a long-term value contributor to FOX. 
Earlier this week, we announced the entry into a definitive agreement to the proposed acquisition of 67% of Credible Labs, a leading direct-to-consumer personal finance marketplace in the United States, at a price that we believe is full, fair and attractive on all relevant metrics, including our commitment to provide up to $75 million of growth capital over the next few years. The merger resulted from extensive discussions and negotiations with the special committee of independent directors and Credible's board, which has unanimously recommended the transaction. 
Through this prudent and disciplined investment, we will access an adjacency to our enormous national and local news audiences and tap into a high-growth market. Just like our investment in The Stars Group for our Fox Bet offering to FOX Sports, the Credible marketplace is comfortably adjacent to and enhances our core Fox digital properties, specifically those at FOX News media and our local television stations. 
Upon the approval of the Credible deal, you will see as activate the Credible marketplace across FOXBusiness.com, which we will be refreshing later this year, and across the fast-growing digital footprint of our FOX TV Stations. Over time, we expect to activate the marketplace across our wider digital network. We believe that given Credible access to our highly engaged digital audience will accelerate the company's growth. It's also important to note that we plan to ensure that Credible can continue to operate under its founder, Stephen Dash, enabling it to continue to pursue the widest growth opportunity in the personal finance marketplace category. 
From an operational standpoint, we're entering fiscal 2020 with great momentum. The FOX News channel dominates the cable news landscape, 17 consecutive years as the #1 cable news network and maintaining its position as the #1 cable network in both prime time and total debuting this past year. 
FOX Sports led the industry in fiscal 2019 in the consumption of live sports events, measured by minutes viewed, beating second-best CBS by 10%, ESPN by 13% and beating the combined viewing of ABC and NBC. With our Thursday night and Sunday afternoon broadcast of the NFL, we are football's most significant broadcast partner. We have a great schedule for the upcoming season, and we're confident we can build on last year's solid ratings growth. 
Our FOX Television stations will continue their multiyear expansion of local news coverage and will collectively produce nearly 1,000 hours a week of news. This focus on local programming has led the station's group to become #1 in the locally programmed and high profitable daytime daypart in our owned and operated market. 
We're also looking forward to the addition of 50 weeks of WWE Smackdown starting on October 4; a reinvigorated entertainment schedule built around the return of 2 seasons of the Messinger; our Own The Fall sports lineup across the network and our sports channels; and of course, the broadcast of Super Bowl LIV on FOX. 
In support of our growth and as we noted during our Investor Day, we will continue to invest in our platforms in fiscal 2020 as we plan to deploy approximately $200 million to $250 million of EBITDA to launch -- to the launch of the WWE, the FOX Entertainment programming initiatives and to our digital properties, most notably at FOX News and FOX Business. We are confident that these investments will serve to drive future growth and value in the long term. 
We are excited by the growth trajectory that we have set for our businesses and are pleased with the progress we are making. We believe that Fox is uniquely positioned to harness the opportunities created by this changing industry with a dynamic portfolio of leadership brands and compelling content that audiences are most passionate about. 
But before I turn over to Steve, let me comment on the legal claim that we, along with the other broadcast networks, filed against Locast last week. Simply put, Locast is a robust streaming service violating the copyright laws for commercial gain, nothing more. Locast claim to be a nonprofit that is not offering for any direct or indirect commercial advantage is absurd. It operates for the clear commercial benefit of the corporations that support it. I commented earlier on the importance of the company of our FOX Network and our owned and affiliated station group. We're confident in the merit of our claim against Locast. The Locast theft is, of course, a validation of the irreplaceable value of our brands and the content that they carry. 
Now I will turn the call over to Steve to provide more detail on our financial results."
546623668,629785893,1795666,"Fox Corporation, Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Aug 07, 2019",2019-08-07,"Earnings Calls","Fox Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Lachlan. Good afternoon. We are pleased with our first full fiscal quarter as a stand-alone company. As Lachlan mentioned, we delivered both healthy top line and EBITDA growth, with this financial momentum setting us up very well for fiscal 2020.",1469,"Thanks, Lachlan. Good afternoon. We are pleased with our first full fiscal quarter as a stand-alone company. As Lachlan mentioned, we delivered both healthy top line and EBITDA growth, with this financial momentum setting us up very well for fiscal 2020. 
Let me now take you through our financial results for the fiscal year as well as the fourth quarter, along with providing some financial markers for the future. Our full year results saw total revenues grow 12% to $11.4 billion. Our revenue growth was broad-based with affiliate revenues increasing 12%, led by retransmission revenue growth of the Television segment. Advertising revenue was up 10% on the back of our inaugural season of Thursday Night Football, which added 5 percentage points to the advertising revenue growth, coupled with the record year of political advertising at our television stations. Within this advertising revenue growth, we were also encouraged with our digital progress, with digital advertising representing close the $500 million or 10% of total company advertising revenue. 
Finally, we delivered strong growth in content revenue, which we record as part of our other revenue line, supported by the digital licensing of network entertainment programming. Total full year segment EBITDA was $2.7 billion, an increase of 8% from last year, reflecting 8% growth at the cable segment and 24% growth at the Television segment. At this point, it is worth remembering that when looking at our full year fiscal 2018 numbers as well as the first 3 quarters of our fiscal 2019 results that these results have been prepared on a so-called carve-out basis. As a result, include allocations of 21st Century Fox overhead and shared service costs in accordance with SEC guidance, which as we have said in the past, understate the costs required to support FOX as a stand-alone business. We estimate that the total recurring costs beyond the amounts formulaically allocated to our published financial statements should range between $225 million and $250 million on an annual basis. 
Illustratively, if we took 75% of these incremental costs into account, they would have reduced our fiscal 2019 EBITDA by approximately $180 million. Net income attributable to stockholders was $1.6 billion this year or $2.57 a share, while adjusted EPS was $2.63 versus $2.50 last year. Again, both of these absolute values of the year-on-year comparison are influenced by the differences in allocated shared services and overhead costs. 
Turning to the fourth quarter. Total company reported revenues were $2.5 billion, up 5% over last year, reflecting revenue growth across all operating segments. Total segment EBITDA was $709 million, an 11% increase over the $640 million generated a year ago, led by higher contributions from the television and cable segments. This growth was partially offset by higher corporate expenses reported in the other segments, which now more properly reflect the full cost of operating as a stand-alone public company. 
From a bottom line perspective, net income attributable to stockholders of $450 million or $0.73 per share was lower than the $0.76 per share in the prior year quarter, while adjusted EPS of $0.62 was down 7% over last year. These reductions principally reflect increased interest in income tax expenses from our operating as a stand-alone public company. 
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was a touch above the more normalized mid-20% range we expect to have going forward. 
So now turning to the performance of our operating segments for the quarter, with cable network's EBITDA of $602 million was up 4% on revenue growth of 2%. The revenue increase was led by affiliate fee growth of 3%, supported by higher average rates across all our brands, partially offset by net decrease in pay television subscribers. Ad revenues decreased slightly by 1%, reflecting lower contributions from the Women's FIFA World Cup in the current year as compared to the men's tournament in the prior year. The ad revenue decreased at the national sports networks partially offset by the continued strength of FOX News, led by digital and advertising growth. 
EBITDA at our cable segment increased 4% over the prior year, reflecting the higher revenues in the stable cost base as digital investments at FOX News were offset by lower sports rights expenses related to the FIFA World Cup and the absence of UFC programming in the current year quarter. 
At the television segment, EBITDA was $214 million, an increase of $103 million from the prior year quarter, reflecting revenue growth of 5% and expense declines of 4%. The revenue growth was led by an 18% increase in affiliate revenue growth, which in turn was driven by programming fee growth from non-owned station affiliates. This growth is consistent with the overall TV affiliate revenue trajectory we laid out at our Investor Day in May, where we expect to deliver revenues of approximately $2.65 billion by calendar year 2022. In line with our expectations, advertising revenues in the quarter were down by 8%, reflecting difficult comparisons to the quarter a year ago, which included political revenues at the local stations related to the 2018 midterm elections and more FIFA World Cup matches. 
When viewing the segment as a whole, the advertising revenue decline was substantially offset by increased digital content licensing revenues. The decrease in expenses reflects lower sports rights resulting from fewer FIFA World Cup matches and NASCAR races in the quarter as well as lower entertainment programming costs due to fewer hours of original programming in the current quarter. 
The strong overall P&L results generated free cash flow, which we calculate as net cash provided by operating activities; less cash invested in property, plant and equipment of over $800 million in this quarter; and $2.3 billion for the year, representing a 115% and 85% conversion of EBITDA to free cash flow, respectively. 
And finally, from an overall balance sheet perspective, we ended the quarter with $3.2 billion in cash and $6.8 billion in debt. 
Looking ahead into fiscal 2020, there are 3 key items I would draw your attention to, many of which we had previously outlined at our Investor Day. Firstly, Lachlan has already outlined the targeted set of initiatives that will impact EBITDA in fiscal 2020. In addition, it is also worth remembering the changes in our major broadcast events that will affect year-on-year comparability. The single largest being our broadcast of Super Bowl LIV in February, which from a year-over-year EBITDA perspective will largely be neutralized by the combined effects of other cyclical events, such as an off-cycle political year, one less NFC divisional playoff game and the absence of the FIFA World Cup. 
As we look at the cadence of fiscal 2020, we would note that our Q2 P&L results this coming year will be impacted by higher sports expenses at the network, reflecting the contractual annual escalators on the NFL and college football contracts and the addition of WWE rights as well as lower political advertising revenue at our local television stations when compared to the prior year. 
Looking across our group-wide other revenue category. We expect to post solid revenue growth in our cable and other segments supported by the increasing Fox Nation subscription revenues, the expansion of our pay-per-view boxing business, growth in content revenues and a full year of revenues associated with operating our [indiscernible]. Meanwhile, these gains will be at least partially offset by reductions in other revenue in our television segment. 
As we have previously disclosed, we expect shared services and corporate expenses reported in the other segment to increase significantly as we will be operating as a stand-alone public company for the full year as compared to only 1 quarter in fiscal 2019. On a full fiscal year basis, we expect the other segment to be a net EBITDA cost in the mid- to high-$300 million range. This includes a little over $50 million of stock-based compensation expense associated with the initial shareholder alignment plan award, which will temporarily impact our P&L in fiscal 2020 and 2021. 
From a cash flow standpoint, we expect very robust conversion of EBITDA to free cash flow. Here, we expect very low working capital usage and cash tax savings of approximately $370 million, resulting from the tax basis step-up obtained as a result of the FOX Corp. spin. While our capital expenditure will increase to fund the build of our new broadcast center in Phoenix. 
Before concluding, I'd like to reiterate that we remain committed to a balanced capital allocation strategy, balancing between organic investments, strategic M&A and shareholder return of capital. As part of this strategy, you will have seen that we just declared our second semiannual dividend of $0.23 a share and continue to expect to have a share buyback authorization in place in advance of our Annual Shareholder Meeting in November. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back to Joe."

The reason why cable had sort of reduced sequentially over the quarter through the fiscal year is just comps just lapping deal maturities. And so as we go into new deals, the focus will obviously be in getting greater share fair value on our retrans. So you'll see a disproportionate level of the forward growth still being with -- in the television segment as opposed to the cable segment."

And then on Credible, I'm happy to talk about it, we, as a management team, are very excited -- extraordinarily excited about the opportunity that the Credible affords us. We look at it, and I think we've talked about this at the Investor Day and since, our key asset is not a skill set necessarily in selling advertising or selling affiliate revenue. Although our teams are extraordinarily good at that, and those are businesses that, as you've seen in these results, are performing extraordinarily well. But really, our key asset, our key resource is the deep engagement that we have in news and in sport and entertainment with our audiences. And as we grow our digital platforms out, we are seeing that engagement really importantly and critically extend from a linear, analog environment to a direct digital environment, which affords us the ability to demonetize that engagement in new models. So that really led us earlier this year to the Stars Group, where we decided with sports obviously entering the sports gaming market with tremendous -- what we see as a huge long-term opportunity for us. And the correlation between, obviously, the sports audience and this is -- should be obvious to most people between the sports audience and the sports-betting audience is extraordinarily high correlation. And so you could say getting into the sports betting arena is a no-brainer. Well, it's equally a no-brainer with Credible in the news category. If you look and we've done a huge amount of research and due diligence on this over the last couple of months. If you look at our news audience, and I'm not just talking cable news, but importantly, the nearly 1,000 hours of local news that we produce each week. If you look at that audience, it correlates incredibly highly with Credible's target audience for their financial marketplace. Our audience in news, which is natural skews slightly older, it skews towards homeowners and it skews towards an educated audience. And these are all factors that people searching for mortgages, in particular, and refinancing loans skewed heavily towards. And so when we saw Credible, and we could see that by combining their service with our audience and our digital platforms, first, with FOX Business and then later through our other news platforms, we see a tremendous opportunity for it going forward."

So it's extraordinarily robust result we've had, certainly in both pricing and in volume. Pleasingly, the scatter market scenes in the upfront has been even stronger, and we are in scatter doing double-digits pricing premiums to what we sold in the upfront. So -- which means we do the math, we are in the low 20s pricing and scatter over last year. So -- and this is driven really across categories, so it's not one category that's driving it. We're seeing obviously the streaming platforms. We star to take their advertising digital platforms. Pharmaceutical continues to be strong. They had a short pause as they worked out some regulatory demands around their advertising, so they were and initially -- they were slow in the upfront, and then they came back in a strong and they're particularly strong in scatter now pharmaceutical. Finance has been strong. And even now locally, and this goes to partially to your second question, on a state-by-state basis in a couple of our local stations, New York and Philadelphia, we're seeing some of this gaming revenue begin to appear in a fairly significant way. So we think from a gaming point of view, as more states legalize online gambling that we have a tremendous revenue stream outside of the TSG partnership from just a local advertising point of view. Also obviously, in the Super Bowl, we start to sell the Super Bowl and we're very pleased with the Super Bowl, both from pricing point of view in terms of where we are versus our last Super Bowl a few years ago. Then your second question, Jessica, was on gaming and the TSG partnership? Steve, do you want to?"

546623668,629785893,1796051,"Fox Corporation, Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Aug 07, 2019",2019-08-07,"Earnings Calls","Fox Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Joe. Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us today on Fox Corporation's year-end earnings call. While we are ending a fiscal year, we're also just starting our growth trajectory and are hitting key milestones at a good pace. Specifically,",1886,"Thanks, Joe. Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us today on Fox Corporation's year-end earnings call. While we are ending a fiscal year, we're also just starting our growth trajectory and are hitting key milestones at a good pace. Specifically, we just reported strong financial results. We recently concluded a very successful advertising upfront, very successful. We're making good progress on our distribution renewals. And we are having a compelling content lineup across our linear and digital channels, all of which positions us well as we commence our first full fiscal year 2020. 
For fiscal 2019, we delivered exceptional financial results, achieving 12% revenue growth and 8% EBITDA growth. Our revenue growth was led by double-digit gains in both affiliate and advertising revenues. As you all know, about half of our annual revenue comes from affiliate revenue. And despite continued subscriber declines, we achieved 12% affiliate revenue growth in fiscal 2019. 
Renewing distribution arrangements with our partners is a normal course activity for us, and we have accomplished these renewals without much clamor over many cycles. This past fiscal year was no exception. We were able to reset affiliate rates, particularly in the Television segment, successfully renewing numerous distribution agreements. 
Today, the remainder of our annual revenue principally comes from advertising. In fiscal 2019, we achieved 10% growth, led by the addition of Thursday Night Football and record gross political revenues of more than $185 million at the FOX Stations Group, surpassing by almost 50% the previous record set in fiscal 2013 during the Obama-Romney election. 
A particularly noteworthy facet of this year's growth was a 24% increase in digital advertising revenues, led by 46% growth at FoxNews.com alone. Our advertising partners are clearly supportive of our ongoing programming strategy. This year's advertising upfront was one of the strongest we have seen in many years, yielding higher pricing across entertainment, sports and news. Specifically for Fox, this strength reflects advertisers' recognition of our unique capacity to deliver highly engaged audiences at scale.
Across our concentrated portfolio, we were rewarded for our continuing content investments. On the entertainment front, we were able to achieve top-of-market, low-teen CPM increases and mid- to high-single-digit volume increases. In addition, we were able to command mid- to high-single-digit pricing increases in sports and news. In addition, even at this early date, we're very encouraged by both the volume and pricing we are seeing for the Super Bowl. We are in a strong television advertising market right now, which is due in part to an especially renewed interest by marketers in prime time and sports programming, which is clearly to our great advantage. 
As you know, a significant amount of the company's revenue is tied to the FOX broadcast network, which is supported by key sports and entertainment content as well as by local programming delivered everyday across America. Our network commands premium advertising and retransmission revenue rates because it delivers a complete schedule of diverse content genres that engage wide audiences. From the NFL to The Simpsons, the network is defined by its programming breadth and not by a vertical concentration that is the hallmark of cable channels. And it is this breadth of programming that makes the FOX broadcast network 1 of the top 4 channels across the country, week in and week out, and such a strategic asset for Fox. 
While the power of sports is undeniable, we are not looking to turn Fox into a pure-play sports channel. We have a few of those already. Rather, keeping the FOX Network vibrant and connected to our audiences is what we are constantly focused on. It is why we are investing in entertainment originality at the network at a time when broadcast originality and the scarcity value of reaching large audiences attracts a market premium across our revenue streams as was demonstrated by advertisers in the recent upfront. 
To that end, we are pursuing a strategy to expand our portfolio of owned content to generate long-term asset value for Fox. We are being strategic and judicious, building smartly and deliberately around our strengths. As part of this strategy, we are pursuing a new program coproduction model that gives us an equity interest in nearly all new shows aired on the network. We are enhancing our internal content-creation capabilities through the launch of SideCar, which is already providing third-party platforms, like Quibi, with content and also, through the acquisition we announced yesterday of Bento Box, the animation company that produces Bob's Burgers as well as 2 new Fox series, Duncanville and The Great North. Bento Box gives FOX access to the next generation of animators and the ability to originate owned IP to drive long-term value for the company. 
You need only to look at our Sunday broadcast schedule, where we have launched more animated hits than anyone, to know that animation has been the most stable network programming on FOX bar none, creating leverage, loyalty and youthful audiences across linear and digital properties. 
Beyond the network, we are also focused on our direct-to-consumer initiatives. FOX News continues to build a significant multi-platform presence well beyond the linear channel and has a strong position in direct-to-consumer news offerings. The FOX News digital properties attract over 100 million unique users per month and leads news engagement with over 3 billion page views per month. We are expanding our D2C news capabilities by offering a more immersive video-on-demand service in the former Fox Nation, which was launched just this past November. 
On the sports front, we launched pay-per-view boxing with the Spence-Garcia bout in March. We followed that with the Pacquiao-Thurman match just a few weeks ago and were encouraged by the results as total purchases increased by more than 30% and direct purchases on the FOX Sports digital properties nearly doubled from the first pay-per-view event. 
In aggregate, the Fox portfolio of digital properties generates a monthly audience of over 200 million unique people and nearly 10 billion minutes of content consumption. 
But our progress does not stop there. During the past few months and consistent with the strategy we outlined at our Investor Day, we've made key investments to expand the reach of our brands beyond their traditional linear business models and deliver new and innovative products to our most valuable asset, our massive and massively engaged audience. 
Most notably, in May, Fox and the Stars Group announced plans to launch Fox Bet, a national media and sports wagering partnership in the United States. We are on track to launch the Fox Bet product in the upcoming football season -- or I should say, before the upcoming football season. And we see the opportunity in sports wagering as a long-term value contributor to Fox. 
Earlier this week, we announced the entry into a definitive agreement to the proposed acquisition of 67% of Credible Labs, a leading direct-to-consumer personal finance marketplace in the United States, at a price that we believe is full, fair and attractive on all relevant metrics, including our commitment to provide up to $75 million of growth capital over the next few years. The merger resulted from extensive discussions and negotiations with the special committee of independent directors on Credible's Board, which has unanimously recommended the transaction.
Through this prudent and disciplined investment, we will assess an adjacency to our enormous national and local news audiences and tap into a high-growth market. Just like our investment in the Stars Group for our Fox Bet offering through FOX Sports, the Credible marketplace is comfortably adjacent to and enhances our core Fox digital properties, specifically those at FOX News media and our local television stations. 
Upon the approval of the Credible deal, you will see as activate the Credible marketplace across FOXBusiness.com, which we will be refreshing later this year, and across the fast-growing digital footprint of our FOX TV Stations. Over time, we expect to activate the marketplace across our wider digital network. We believe that giving Credible access to our highly engaged digital audience will accelerate the company's growth. It's also important to note that we plan to ensure that Credible can continue to operate under its founder, Stephen Dash, enabling it to continue to pursue the widest growth opportunity in the personal finance marketplace category. 
From an operational standpoint, we're entering fiscal 2020 with great momentum. The FOX News channel dominates the cable news landscape, marking 17 consecutive years as the #1 cable news network and maintaining its position as the #1 cable network in both prime time and total debuting this past year. 
FOX Sports led the industry in fiscal 2019 in the consumption of live sports events, measured by minutes viewed, beating second-best CBS by 10%, ESPN by 13% and beating the combined viewing of ABC and NBC. With our Thursday night and Sunday afternoon broadcast of the NFL, we are football's most significant broadcast partner. We have a great schedule for the upcoming season, and we're confident we can build on last year's solid ratings growth. 
Our FOX Television Stations will continue their multiyear expansion of local news coverage and will collectively produce nearly 1,000 hours a week of news. This focus on local programming has led the Stations Group to become #1 in the locally programmed and high-profitable daytime daypart in our owned-and-operated markets. 
We're also looking forward to the addition of 50 weeks of WWE SmackDown starting on October 4, a reinvigorated entertainment schedule built around the return of 2 seasons of The Masked Singer, our Own the Fall sports lineup across the network and our sports channels and of course, the broadcast of Super Bowl LIV on Fox. 
In support of our growth and as we noted during our Investor Day, we will continue to invest in our platforms in fiscal 2020 as we plan to deploy approximately $200 million to $250 million of EBITDA to launch -- to the launch of the WWE, the FOX Entertainment programming initiatives and to our digital properties, most notably at FOX News and FOX Business. We are confident that these investments will serve to drive future growth and value in the long term.
We are excited by the growth trajectory that we have set for our businesses and are pleased with the progress we are making. We believe that Fox is uniquely positioned to harness the opportunities created by this changing industry with a dynamic portfolio of leadership brands and compelling content that audiences are most passionate about. 
But before I turn over to Steve, let me comment on the legal claim that we, along with the other broadcast networks, filed against Locast last week. Simply put, Locast is a rogue streaming service violating the copyright laws for commercial gain, nothing more. Locast's claim to be a nonprofit that is not offering for any direct or indirect commercial advantage is absurd. It operates for the clear commercial benefit of the corporations that support it. I commented earlier on the importance to the company of our FOX Network and our owned and affiliated Stations Group. We're confident in the merit of our claim against Locast. The Locast theft is, of course, a validation of the irreplaceable value of our brands and the content that they carry. 
Now I will turn the call over to Steve to provide more detail on our financial results."

We are pleased with our first full fiscal quarter as a stand-alone company. As Lachlan mentioned, we delivered both healthy top line and EBITDA growth, with this financial momentum setting us up very well for fiscal 2020.",1473,"Thanks, Lachlan. Good afternoon. We are pleased with our first full fiscal quarter as a stand-alone company. As Lachlan mentioned, we delivered both healthy top line and EBITDA growth, with this financial momentum setting us up very well for fiscal 2020. 
Let me now take you through our financial results for the fiscal year as well as the fourth quarter, along with providing some financial markers for the future. Our full year results saw total revenues grow 12% to $11.4 billion. Our revenue growth was broad-based, with affiliate revenues increasing 12%, led by retransmission revenue growth of the Television segment. Advertising revenue was up 10% on the back of our inaugural season of Thursday Night Football, which added 5 percentage points to the advertising revenue growth, coupled with the record year of political advertising at our Television Stations. Within this advertising revenue growth, we were also encouraged with our digital progress, with digital advertising representing close to $500 million or 10% of total company advertising revenue. 
Finally, we delivered strong growth in content revenue, which we record as part of our other revenue line, supported by the digital licensing of network entertainment programming. Total full year segment EBITDA was $2.7 billion, an increase of 8% from last year, reflecting 8% growth at the Cable segment and 24% growth at the Television segment. 
At this point, it is worth remembering that when looking at our full year fiscal 2018 numbers as well as the first 3 quarters of our fiscal 2019 results, that these results have been prepared on a so-called carve-out basis. As such, they include allocations of 21st Century Fox overhead and shared service costs in accordance with SEC guidance, which as we have said in the past, understate the costs required to support Fox as a stand-alone business. We estimate that the total recurring costs beyond the amounts formulaically allocated to our published financial statements should range between $225 million and $250 million on an annual basis. Illustratively, if we took 75% of these incremental costs into account, they would have reduced our fiscal 2019 EBITDA by approximately $180 million. 
Net income attributable to stockholders was $1.6 billion this year or $2.57 a share, while adjusted EPS was $2.63 versus $2.50 last year. Again, both of these absolute values and the year-on-year comparison are influenced by the differences in allocated shared services and overhead costs. 
Turning to the fourth quarter. Total company reported revenues were $2.5 billion, up 5% over last year, reflecting revenue growth across all operating segments. Total segment EBITDA was $709 million, an 11% increase over the $640 million generated a year ago, led by higher contributions from the Television and Cable segments. This growth was partially offset by higher corporate expenses reported in the other segment, which now more properly reflect the full cost of operating as a stand-alone public company. 
From a bottom line perspective, net income attributable to stockholders of $450 million or $0.73 a share was lower than the $0.76 per share in the prior year quarter, while adjusted EPS of $0.62 was down 7% over last year. These reductions principally reflect increased interest in income tax expenses from our operating as a stand-alone public company. 
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was a touch above the more normalized mid-20% range we expect to have going forward. 
So now turning to the performance of our operating segments for the quarter, where Cable Network's EBITDA of $602 million was up 4% on revenue growth of 2%. The revenue increase was led by affiliate fee growth of 3%, supported by higher average rates across all our brands, partially offset by a net decrease in pay television subscribers. Ad revenues decreased slightly by 1%, reflecting lower contributions from the Women's FIFA World Cup in the current year as compared to the men's tournament in the prior year. The ad revenue decrease at the national sports networks was partially offset by the continued strength of FOX News, led by digital and advertising growth. 
EBITDA at our Cable segment increased 4% over the prior year, reflecting the higher revenues and a stable cost base as digital investments at FOX News were offset by lower sports rights expenses related to the FIFA World Cup and the absence of UFC programming in the current year quarter. 
At the Television segment, EBITDA was $214 million, an increase of $103 million from the prior year quarter, reflecting revenue growth of 5% and expense declines of 4%. The revenue growth was led by an 18% increase in affiliate revenue growth, which in turn was driven by programming fee growth from nonowned station affiliates. This growth is consistent with the overall TV affiliate revenue trajectory we laid out at our Investor Day in May, where we expect to deliver revenues of approximately $2.65 billion by calendar year 2022. In line with our expectations, advertising revenues in the quarter were down by 8%, reflecting difficult comparisons to the quarter a year ago, which included political revenues at the local stations related to the 2018 midterm elections and more FIFA World Cup matches. 
When viewing the segment as a whole, the advertising revenue decline was substantially offset by increased digital content licensing revenues. The decrease in expenses reflects lower sports rights resulting from fewer FIFA World Cup matches and NASCAR races in the quarter as well as lower entertainment programming costs due to fewer hours of original programming in the current quarter. 
The strong overall P&L results generated free cash flow, which we calculate as net cash provided by operating activities, less cash invested in property, plant and equipment of over $800 million in this quarter and $2.3 billion for the year, representing a 115% and 85% conversion of EBITDA to free cash flow, respectively. 
And finally, from an overall balance sheet perspective, we ended the quarter with $3.2 billion in cash and $6.8 billion in debt. 
Looking ahead into fiscal 2020, there are a few key items I would draw your attention to, many of which we had previously outlined at our Investor Day. Firstly, Lachlan has already outlined the targeted set of initiatives that will impact EBITDA in fiscal 2020. In addition, it is also worth remembering the changes in our major broadcast events that will affect year-on-year comparability, the single largest being our broadcast of Super Bowl LIV in February, which from a year-over-year EBITDA perspective will largely be neutralized by the combined effects of other cyclical events, such as an off-cycle political year, one less NFC divisional playoff game and the absence of the FIFA World Cup. 
As we look at the cadence of fiscal 2020, we would note that our Q2 P&L results this coming year will be impacted by higher sports expenses at the network, reflecting the contractual annual escalators on the NFL and college football contracts, and the addition of WWE rights as well as lower political advertising revenue at our local television stations when compared to the prior year. 
Looking across our group-wide other revenue category. We expect to post solid revenue growth in our Cable and other segments, supported by the increasing Fox Nation subscription revenues, the expansion of our pay-per-view boxing business, growth in content revenues and a full year of revenues associated with operating our L.A. op. Meanwhile, these gains will be at least partially offset by reductions in other revenue in our Television segment.
As we have previously disclosed, we expect shared services and corporate expenses reported in the other segment to increase significantly as we will be operating as a stand-alone public company for the full year as compared to only 1 quarter in fiscal 2019. On a full fiscal year basis, we expect the other segment to be a net EBITDA cost in the mid- to high-$300 million range. This includes a little over $50 million of stock-based compensation expense associated with the initial shareholder alignment plan award, which will temporarily impact our P&L in fiscal 2020 and 2021.
From a cash flow standpoint, we expect very robust conversion of EBITDA to free cash flow. Here, we expect very low working capital usage and cash tax savings of approximately $370 million resulting from the tax basis step-up obtained as a result of the Fox Corp. spin, while our capital expenditure will increase to fund the build of our new broadcast center in Phoenix.
Before concluding, I'd like to reiterate that we remain committed to a balanced capital allocation strategy, balancing between organic investments, strategic M&A and shareholder returns of capital. As part of this strategy, you will have seen that we just declared our second semiannual dividend of $0.23 a share and continue to expect to have a share buyback authorization in place in advance of our Annual Shareholder Meeting in November. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back to Joe."

And then on Credible, and I'm happy to talk about it, we, as a management team, are very excited, extraordinarily excited about the opportunity that Credible affords us. We look at it, and I think we've talked about this at the Investor Day and since, our key asset is not a skill set necessarily in selling advertising or selling affiliate revenue, although our teams are extraordinarily good at that and those are businesses that, as you've seen in these results, are performing extraordinarily well. 
But really, our key asset, our key resource is the deep engagement that we have in news and in sport and in entertainment with our audiences. And as we grow our digital platforms out, we are seeing that engagement really importantly and critically extend from a linear, analog environment, to a direct digital environment, which affords us the ability to demonetize that engagement in new models. 
So that really led us earlier this year to the Stars Group, where we decided with sports obviously entering the sports gaming market was a tremendous -- we see as a huge long-term opportunity for us, and the correlation between, obviously, the sports audience and this is -- should be obvious to most people between the sports audience and the sports-betting audience, is extraordinarily high correlation. And so you could say getting into the sports betting arena is a no-brainer. 
Well, it's equally a no-brainer with Credible in the news category. If you look, and we've done a huge amount of research and due diligence on this over the last couple of months, if you look at our news audience, and I'm not just talking cable news, but importantly, the nearly 1,000 hours of local news that we produce each week, if you look at that audience, it correlates incredibly highly with Credible's target audience for their financial marketplace. Our audience in news, which is natural, skews slightly older. It skews towards homeowners, and it skews towards an educated audience. And these are all factors that people searching for mortgages, in particular, and refinancing loans skew heavily towards. 
And so when we saw Credible, and we could see that by combining their service with our audience and our digital platforms, first, with FOX Business and then later through our other news platforms, we see a tremendous opportunity for it going forward."

So it's extraordinarily robust, our result we've had, certainly in both pricing and in volume. Pleasingly, the scatter market, since the upfront, has been even stronger, and we are in scatter doing double-digits pricing premiums to what we sold in the upfront. So -- which means, if you do the math, we are in the low 20s pricing in scatter over last year. 
So -- and this is driven really across categories, so it's not one category that's driving it and driving it. We're seeing obviously the streaming platforms, where it started to take their advertising digital platforms. Pharmaceutical continues to be strong. They had a short pause as they worked out some regulatory demands around their advertising so that they weren't initially -- they were slow in the upfront and then came back in and strong, and they're particularly strong in scatter now, pharmaceutical.

Historically, though, I think they are still incredibly high. We are in an extraordinary news cycle. And so FOX News has lost less ratings or less audience relative to our competitors. And so we continue to be obviously #1 and expect to continue that run for quite some time. I do think, though, there probably is some news fatigue, but you ought to remember, this time last year, we were also in an extraordinary news cycle. We are incredibly pleased that the hard work of the people at FOX News has continued to keep their -- not only their prime time lineup, but their all-day ratings in the position that they are, even despite having some talent shakeup. So we are really pleased with the performance of FOX News. 
In terms of sub declines, overall, we're seeing about a 1% aggregate sub decline. So that includes our kind of growing sort of smaller networks, such as Fox Sports 2 and BTN. So we're down in aggregate numbers of subscribers just about 1%.

Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us today on Fox Corporation's year-end earnings call. While we are ending a fiscal year, we're also just starting our growth trajectory and are hitting key milestones at a good pace. Specifically,",1887,"Thanks, Joe. Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us today on Fox Corporation's year-end earnings call. While we are ending a fiscal year, we're also just starting our growth trajectory and are hitting key milestones at a good pace. Specifically, we just reported strong financial results. We recently concluded a very successful advertising upfront, very successful. We're making good progress on our distribution renewals. And we are having a compelling content lineup across our linear and digital channels, all of which positions us well as we commence our first full fiscal year 2020. 
For fiscal 2019, we delivered exceptional financial results, achieving 12% revenue growth and 8% EBITDA growth. Our revenue growth was led by double-digit gains in both affiliate and advertising revenues. As you all know, about half of our annual revenue comes from affiliate revenue. And despite continued subscriber declines, we achieved 12% affiliate revenue growth in fiscal 2019. 
Renewing distribution arrangements with our partners is a normal course activity for us, and we have accomplished these renewals without much clamor over many cycles. This past fiscal year was no exception. We were able to reset affiliate rates, particularly in the Television segment, successfully renewing numerous distribution agreements. 
Today, the remainder of our annual revenue principally comes from advertising. In fiscal 2019, we achieved 10% growth, led by the addition of Thursday Night Football and record gross political revenues of more than $185 million at the FOX Stations Group, surpassing by almost 50% the previous record set in fiscal 2013 during the Obama-Romney election. 
A particularly noteworthy facet of this year's growth was a 24% increase in digital advertising revenues, led by 46% growth at FoxNews.com alone. Our advertising partners are clearly supportive of our ongoing programming strategy. This year's advertising upfront was one of the strongest we have seen in many years, yielding higher pricing across entertainment, sports and news. Specifically for Fox, this strength reflects advertisers' recognition of our unique capacity to deliver highly engaged audiences at scale.
Across our concentrated portfolio, we were rewarded for our continuing content investments. On the entertainment front, we were able to achieve top-of-market, low-teen CPM increases and mid- to high-single-digit volume increases. In addition, we were able to command mid- to high-single-digit pricing increases in sports and news. In addition, even at this early date, we're very encouraged by both the volume and pricing we are seeing for the Super Bowl. We are in a strong television advertising market right now, which is due in part to an especially renewed interest by marketers in prime time and sports programming, which is clearly to our great advantage. 
As you know, a significant amount of the company's revenue is tied to the FOX broadcast network, which is supported by key sports and entertainment content as well as by local programming delivered everyday across America. Our network commands premium advertising and retransmission revenue rates because it delivers a complete schedule of diverse content genres that engage wide audiences. From the NFL to The Simpsons, the network is defined by its programming breadth and not by a vertical concentration that is the hallmark of cable channels. And it is this breadth of programming that makes the FOX broadcast network 1 of the top 4 channels across the country, week in and week out, and such a strategic asset for Fox. 
While the power of sports is undeniable, we are not looking to turn Fox into a pure-play sports channel. We have a few of those already. Rather, keeping the FOX Network vibrant and connected to our audiences is what we are constantly focused on. It is why we are investing in entertainment originality at the network at a time when broadcast originality and the scarcity value of reaching large audiences attracts a market premium across our revenue streams as was demonstrated by advertisers in the recent upfront. 
To that end, we are pursuing a strategy to expand our portfolio of owned content to generate long-term asset value for Fox. We are being strategic and judicious, building smartly and deliberately around our strengths. As part of this strategy, we are pursuing a new program coproduction model that gives us an equity interest in nearly all new shows aired on the network. We are enhancing our internal content-creation capabilities through the launch of SideCar, which is already providing third-party platforms, like Quibi, with content and also, through the acquisition we announced yesterday of Bento Box, the animation company that produces Bob's Burgers as well as 2 new Fox series, Duncanville and The Great North. Bento Box gives FOX access to the next generation of animators and the ability to originate owned IP to drive long-term value for the company. 
You need only to look at our Sunday broadcast schedule, where we have launched more animated hits than anyone, to know that animation has been the most stable network programming on FOX bar none, creating leverage, loyalty and youthful audiences across linear and digital properties. 
Beyond the network, we are also focused on our direct-to-consumer initiatives. FOX News continues to build a significant multi-platform presence well beyond the linear channel and has a strong position in direct-to-consumer news offerings. The FOX News digital properties attract over 100 million unique users per month and leads news engagement with over 3 billion page views per month. We are expanding our D2C news capabilities by offering a more immersive video-on-demand service in the form of Fox Nation, which was launched just this past November. 
On the sports front, we launched pay-per-view boxing with the Spence-Garcia bout in March. We followed that with the Pacquiao-Thurman match just a few weeks ago and were encouraged by the results as total purchases increased by more than 30% and direct purchases on the FOX Sports digital properties nearly doubled from the first pay-per-view event. 
In aggregate, the Fox portfolio of digital properties generates a monthly audience of over 200 million unique people and nearly 10 billion minutes of content consumption. 
But our progress does not stop there. During the past few months and consistent with the strategy we outlined at our Investor Day, we've made key investments to expand the reach of our brands beyond their traditional linear business models and deliver new and innovative products to our most valuable asset, our massive and massively engaged audience. 
Most notably, in May, Fox and the Stars Group announced plans to launch Fox Bet, a national media and sports wagering partnership in the United States. We are on track to launch the Fox Bet product in the upcoming football season -- or I should say, before the upcoming football season. And we see the opportunity in sports wagering as a long-term value contributor to Fox. 
Earlier this week, we announced the entry into a definitive agreement to the proposed acquisition of 67% of Credible Labs, a leading direct-to-consumer personal finance marketplace in the United States, at a price that we believe is full, fair and attractive on all relevant metrics, including our commitment to provide up to $75 million of growth capital over the next few years. The merger resulted from extensive discussions and negotiations with the special committee of independent directors on Credible's Board, which has unanimously recommended the transaction.
Through this prudent and disciplined investment, we will assess an adjacency to our enormous national and local news audiences and tap into a high-growth market. Just like our investment in the Stars Group for our Fox Bet offering through FOX Sports, the Credible marketplace is comfortably adjacent to and enhances our core Fox digital properties, specifically those at FOX News media and our local television stations. 
Upon the approval of the Credible deal, you will see us activate the Credible marketplace across FOXBusiness.com, which we will be refreshing later this year, and across the fast-growing digital footprint of our FOX TV Stations. Over time, we expect to activate the marketplace across our wider digital network. We believe that giving Credible access to our highly engaged digital audience will accelerate the company's growth. It's also important to note that we plan to ensure that Credible can continue to operate under its founder, Stephen Dash, enabling it to continue to pursue the widest growth opportunity in the personal finance marketplace category. 
From an operational standpoint, we're entering fiscal 2020 with great momentum. The FOX News channel dominates the cable news landscape, marking 17 consecutive years as the #1 cable news network and maintaining its position as the #1 cable network in both prime time and total debuting this past year. 
FOX Sports led the industry in fiscal 2019 in the consumption of live sports events, measured by minutes viewed, beating second-best CBS by 10%, ESPN by 13% and beating the combined viewing of ABC and NBC. With our Thursday night and Sunday afternoon broadcast of the NFL, we are football's most significant broadcast partner. We have a great schedule for the upcoming season, and we're confident we can build on last year's solid ratings growth. 
Our FOX Television Stations will continue their multiyear expansion of local news coverage and will collectively produce nearly 1,000 hours a week of news. This focus on local programming has led the Stations Group to become #1 in the locally programmed and high-profitable daytime daypart in our owned-and-operated markets. 
We're also looking forward to the addition of 50 weeks of WWE SmackDown starting on October 4, a reinvigorated entertainment schedule built around the return of 2 seasons of The Masked Singer, our Own the Fall sports lineup across the network and our sports channels and of course, the broadcast of Super Bowl LIV on Fox. 
In support of our growth and as we noted during our Investor Day, we will continue to invest in our platforms in fiscal 2020 as we plan to deploy approximately $200 million to $250 million of EBITDA to launch -- to the launch of the WWE, the FOX Entertainment programming initiatives and to our digital properties, most notably at FOX News and FOX Business. We are confident that these investments will serve to drive future growth and value in the long term.
We are excited by the growth trajectory that we have set for our businesses and are pleased with the progress we are making. We believe that Fox is uniquely positioned to harness the opportunities created by this changing industry with a dynamic portfolio of leadership brands and compelling content that audiences are most passionate about. 
But before I turn over to Steve, let me comment on the legal claim that we, along with the other broadcast networks, filed against Locast last week. Simply put, Locast is a rogue streaming service violating the copyright laws for commercial gain, nothing more. Locast's claim to be a nonprofit that is not offering for any direct or indirect commercial advantage is absurd. It operates for the clear commercial benefit of the corporations that support it. I commented earlier on the importance to the company of our FOX Network and our owned and affiliated Stations Group. We're confident in the merit of our claim against Locast. The Locast theft is, of course, a validation of the irreplaceable value of our brands and the content that they carry. 
Now I will turn the call over to Steve to provide more detail on our financial results."
546623668,629785893,1800462,"Fox Corporation, Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Aug 07, 2019",2019-08-07,"Earnings Calls","Fox Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Lachlan. Good afternoon. We are pleased with our first full fiscal quarter as a stand-alone company. As Lachlan mentioned, we delivered both healthy top line and EBITDA growth, with this financial momentum setting us up very well for fiscal 2020.",1472,"Thanks, Lachlan. Good afternoon. We are pleased with our first full fiscal quarter as a stand-alone company. As Lachlan mentioned, we delivered both healthy top line and EBITDA growth, with this financial momentum setting us up very well for fiscal 2020. 
Let me now take you through our financial results for the fiscal year as well as the fourth quarter, along with providing some financial markers for the future. Our full year results saw total revenues grow 12% to $11.4 billion. Our revenue growth was broad-based, with affiliate revenues increasing 12%, led by retransmission revenue growth of the Television segment. Advertising revenue was up 10% on the back of our inaugural season of Thursday Night Football, which added 5 percentage points of advertising revenue growth, coupled with the record year of political advertising at our Television Stations. Within this advertising revenue growth, we were also encouraged with our digital progress, with digital advertising representing close to $500 million or 10% of total company advertising revenue. 
Finally, we delivered strong growth in content revenue, which we record as part of our other revenue line, supported by the digital licensing of network entertainment programming. Total full year segment EBITDA was $2.7 billion, an increase of 8% from last year, reflecting 8% growth at the Cable segment and 24% growth at the Television segment. 
At this point, it is worth remembering that when looking at our full year fiscal 2018 numbers as well as the first 3 quarters of our fiscal 2019 results, that these results have been prepared on a so-called carve-out basis. As such, they include allocations of 21st Century Fox overhead and shared service costs in accordance with SEC guidance, which as we have said in the past, understate the costs required to support Fox as a stand-alone business. We estimate that the total recurring costs beyond the amounts formulaically allocated to our published financial statements should range between $225 million and $250 million on an annual basis. Illustratively, if we took 75% of these incremental costs into account, they would have reduced our fiscal 2019 EBITDA by approximately $180 million. 
Net income attributable to stockholders was $1.6 billion this year or $2.57 a share, while adjusted EPS was $2.63 versus $2.50 last year. Again, both of these absolute values and the year-on-year comparison are influenced by the differences in allocated shared services and overhead costs. 
Turning to the fourth quarter. Total company reported revenues were $2.5 billion, up 5% over last year, reflecting revenue growth across all operating segments. Total segment EBITDA was $709 million, an 11% increase over the $640 million generated a year ago, led by higher contributions from the Television and Cable segments. This growth was partially offset by higher corporate expenses reported in the other segment, which now more properly reflect the full cost of operating as a stand-alone public company. 
From a bottom line perspective, net income attributable to stockholders of $450 million or $0.73 a share was lower than the $0.76 per share in the prior year quarter, while adjusted EPS of $0.62 was down 7% over last year. These reductions principally reflect increased interest in income tax expenses from our operating as a stand-alone public company. 
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was a touch above the more normalized mid-20% range we expect to have going forward. 
So now turning to the performance of our operating segments for the quarter, where Cable Network's EBITDA of $602 million was up 4% on revenue growth of 2%. The revenue increase was led by affiliate fee growth of 3%, supported by higher average rates across all our brands, partially offset by a net decrease in pay television subscribers. Ad revenues decreased slightly by 1%, reflecting lower contributions from the Women's FIFA World Cup in the current year as compared to the men's tournament in the prior year. The ad revenue decrease at the national sports networks was partially offset by the continued strength of FOX News, led by digital and advertising growth. 
EBITDA at our Cable segment increased 4% over the prior year, reflecting the higher revenues and a stable cost base as digital investments at FOX News were offset by lower sports rights expenses related to the FIFA World Cup and the absence of UFC programming in the current year quarter. 
At the Television segment, EBITDA was $214 million, an increase of $103 million from the prior year quarter, reflecting revenue growth of 5% and expense declines of 4%. The revenue growth was led by an 18% increase in affiliate revenue growth, which in turn was driven by programming fee growth from nonowned station affiliates. This growth is consistent with the overall TV affiliate revenue trajectory we laid out at our Investor Day in May, where we expect to deliver revenues of approximately $2.65 billion by calendar year 2022. In line with our expectations, advertising revenues in the quarter were down by 8%, reflecting difficult comparisons to the quarter a year ago, which included political revenues at the local stations related to the 2018 midterm elections and more FIFA World Cup matches. 
When viewing the segment as a whole, the advertising revenue decline was substantially offset by increased digital content licensing revenues. The decrease in expenses reflects lower sports rights resulting from fewer FIFA World Cup matches and NASCAR races in the quarter as well as lower entertainment programming costs due to fewer hours of original programming in the current quarter. 
The strong overall P&L results generated free cash flow, which we calculate as net cash provided by operating activities, less cash invested in property, plant and equipment of over $800 million in this quarter and $2.3 billion for the year, representing a 115% and 85% conversion of EBITDA to free cash flow, respectively. 
And finally, from an overall balance sheet perspective, we ended the quarter with $3.2 billion in cash and $6.8 billion in debt. 
Looking ahead into fiscal 2020, there are a few key items I would draw your attention to, many of which we had previously outlined at our Investor Day. Firstly, Lachlan has already outlined the targeted set of initiatives that will impact EBITDA in fiscal 2020. In addition, it is also worth remembering the changes in our major broadcast events that will affect year-on-year comparability, the single largest being our broadcast of Super Bowl LIV in February, which from a year-over-year EBITDA perspective will largely be neutralized by the combined effects of other cyclical events, such as an off-cycle political year, one less NFC divisional playoff game and the absence of the FIFA World Cup. 
As we look at the cadence of fiscal 2020, we would note that our Q2 P&L results this coming year will be impacted by higher sports expenses at the network, reflecting the contractual annual escalators on the NFL and college football contracts, and the addition of WWE rights as well as lower political advertising revenue at our local television stations when compared to the prior year. 
Looking across our group-wide other revenue category. We expect to post solid revenue growth in our Cable and other segments, supported by the increasing Fox Nation subscription revenues, the expansion of our pay-per-view boxing business, growth in content revenues and a full year of revenues associated with operating our L.A. op. Meanwhile, these gains will be at least partially offset by reductions in other revenue in our Television segment.
As we have previously disclosed, we expect shared services and corporate expenses reported in the other segment to increase significantly as we will be operating as a stand-alone public company for the full year as compared to only 1 quarter in fiscal 2019. On a full fiscal year basis, we expect the other segment to be a net EBITDA cost in the mid- to high-$300 million range. This includes a little over $50 million of stock-based compensation expense associated with the initial shareholder alignment plan award, which will temporarily impact our P&L in fiscal 2020 and 2021.
From a cash flow standpoint, we expect very robust conversion of EBITDA to free cash flow. Here, we expect very low working capital usage and cash tax savings of approximately $370 million resulting from the tax basis step-up obtained as a result of the Fox Corp. spin, while our capital expenditure will increase to fund the build of our new broadcast center in Phoenix.
Before concluding, I'd like to reiterate that we remain committed to a balanced capital allocation strategy, balancing between organic investments, strategic M&A and shareholder returns of capital. As part of this strategy, you will have seen that we just declared our second semiannual dividend of $0.23 a share and continue to expect to have a share buyback authorization in place in advance of our Annual Shareholder Meeting in November. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back to Joe."

And so we would -- we finished Q4 versus Q4 with a plus 7% growth rate across the whole estate, and so we would anticipate that sort of growth rate at that level or above into fiscal 2020. The reason why Cable had sort of reduced sequentially over the quarter through the fiscal year is just comps just lapping deal maturities. And so as we go into new deals, the focus obviously will be in getting a greater share of fair value on our retrans. So you'll see a disproportionate level of the forward growth still being with -- in the Television segment as opposed to the Cable segment."

And then on Credible, and I'm happy to talk about it, we, as a management team, are very excited, extraordinarily excited about the opportunity that Credible affords us. We look at it, and I think we've talked about this at the Investor Day and since, our key asset is not a skill set necessarily in selling advertising or selling affiliate revenue, although our teams are extraordinarily good at that and those are businesses that, as you've seen in these results, are performing extraordinarily well. 
But really, our key asset, our key resource is the deep engagement that we have in news and in sport and in entertainment with our audiences. And as we grow our digital platforms out, we are seeing that engagement really importantly and critically extend from a linear, analog environment, to a direct digital environment, which affords us the ability to demonetize that engagement in new models. 
So that really led us earlier this year to the Stars Group, where we decided with sports obviously entering the sports gaming market was a tremendous -- we see as a huge long-term opportunity for us, and the correlation between, obviously, the sports audience and this is -- should be obvious to most people between the sports audience and the sports-betting audience, is extraordinarily high correlation. And so you could say getting into the sports betting arena is a no-brainer. 
Well, it's equally a no-brainer with Credible in the news category. If you look, and we've done a huge amount of research and due diligence on this over the last couple of months, if you look at our news audience, and I'm not just talking cable news, but importantly, the nearly 1,000 hours of local news that we produce each week, if you look at that audience, it correlates incredibly highly with Credible's target audience for their financial marketplace. Our audience in news, which is natural, skews slightly older. It skews towards homeowners, and it skews towards an educated audience. And these are all factors that people searching for mortgages, in particular, and refinancing loans skew heavily towards. 
And so when we saw Credible, and we could see that by combining their service with our audience and our digital platforms, first, with FOX Business and then later through our other news platforms, we see a tremendous opportunity for it going forward."

How sustainable do you see that growth rate being, especially as you head into what will be a political -- an elevated political year next year because, obviously, that helps sort of insulate the overall ad business to grow across the company? And I just wanted to ask if you had any update for us on the process in evaluating the buyback plans.

So it's extraordinarily robust, our result we've had, certainly in both pricing and in volume. Pleasingly, the scatter market, since the upfront, has been even stronger, and we are in scatter doing double-digits pricing premiums to what we sold in the upfront. So -- which means, if you do the math, we are in the low 20s pricing in scatter over last year. 
So -- and this is driven really across categories, so it's not one category that's driving it. We're seeing obviously the streaming platforms, where it started to take their advertising digital platforms. Pharmaceutical continues to be strong. They had a short pause as they worked out some regulatory demands around their advertising so that they weren't initially -- they were slow in the upfront and then came back in and strong, and they're particularly strong in scatter now, pharmaceutical. Finance has been strong. And even now, locally, and this goes partially to your second question, on a state-by-state basis in a couple of our local stations, notably New York and Philadelphia, we're seeing some of this gaming revenue begin to appear in a fairly significant way. So we think, from a gaming point of view, as more states legalize online gambling, that we have a tremendous revenue stream to us outside of the TSG partnership from just a local advertising point of view. 
Also, obviously, in the Super Bowl, we started to sell the Super Bowl, and we're very pleased with the Super Bowl, both from a pricing point of view in terms of where we are versus our last Super Bowl a few years ago.

Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us today on Fox Corporation's year-end earnings call. While we are ending a fiscal year, we're also just starting our growth trajectory and are hitting key milestones at a good pace. Specifically,",1887,"Thanks, Joe. Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us today on Fox Corporation's year-end earnings call. While we are ending a fiscal year, we're also just starting our growth trajectory and are hitting key milestones at a good pace. Specifically, we just reported strong financial results. We recently concluded a very successful advertising upfront, very successful. We're making good progress on our distribution renewals. And we are having a compelling content lineup across our linear and digital channels, all of which positions us well as we commence our first full fiscal year 2020. 
For fiscal 2019, we delivered exceptional financial results, achieving 12% revenue growth and 8% EBITDA growth. Our revenue growth was led by double-digit gains in both affiliate and advertising revenues. As you all know, about half of our annual revenue comes from affiliate revenue. And despite continued subscriber declines, we achieved 12% affiliate revenue growth in fiscal 2019. 
Renewing distribution arrangements with our partners is a normal course activity for us, and we have accomplished these renewals without much clamor over many cycles. This past fiscal year was no exception. We were able to reset affiliate rates, particularly in the Television segment, successfully renewing numerous distribution agreements. 
Today, the remainder of our annual revenue principally comes from advertising. In fiscal 2019, we achieved 10% growth, led by the addition of Thursday Night Football and record gross political revenues of more than $185 million at the FOX Stations Group, surpassing by almost 50% the previous record set in fiscal 2013 during the Obama-Romney election. 
A particularly noteworthy facet of this year's growth was a 24% increase in digital advertising revenues, led by 46% growth at FoxNews.com alone. Our advertising partners are clearly supportive of our ongoing programming strategy. This year's advertising upfront was one of the strongest we have seen in many years, yielding higher pricing across entertainment, sports and news. Specifically for Fox, this strength reflects advertisers' recognition of our unique capacity to deliver highly engaged audiences at scale.
Across our concentrated portfolio, we were rewarded for our continuing content investments. On the entertainment front, we were able to achieve top-of-market, low-teen CPM increases and mid- to high-single-digit volume increases. In addition, we were able to command mid- to high-single-digit pricing increases in sports and news. In addition, even at this early date, we're very encouraged by both the volume and pricing we are seeing for the Super Bowl. We are in a strong television advertising market right now, which is due in part to an especially renewed interest by marketers in prime time and sports programming, which is clearly to our great advantage. 
As you know, a significant amount of the company's revenue is tied to the FOX broadcast network, which is supported by key sports and entertainment content as well as by local programming delivered every day across America. Our network commands premium advertising and retransmission revenue rates because it delivers a complete schedule of diverse content genres that engage wide audiences. From the NFL to The Simpsons, the network is defined by its programming breadth and not by a vertical concentration that is the hallmark of cable channels. And it is this breadth of programming that makes the FOX broadcast network 1 of the top 4 channels across the country, week in and week out, and such a strategic asset for Fox. 
While the power of sports is undeniable, we are not looking to turn Fox into a pure-play sports channel. We have a few of those already. Rather, keeping the FOX Network vibrant and connected to our audiences is what we are constantly focused on. It is why we are investing in entertainment originality at the network at a time when broadcast originality and the scarcity value of reaching large audiences attracts a market premium across our revenue streams as was demonstrated by advertisers in the recent upfront. 
To that end, we are pursuing a strategy to expand our portfolio of owned content to generate long-term asset value for Fox. We are being strategic and judicious, building smartly and deliberately around our strengths. As part of this strategy, we are pursuing a new program coproduction model that gives us an equity interest in nearly all new shows aired on the network. We are enhancing our internal content-creation capabilities through the launch of SideCar, which is already providing third-party platforms, like Quibi, with content and also, through the acquisition we announced yesterday of Bento Box, the animation company that produces Bob's Burgers as well as 2 new Fox series, Duncanville and The Great North. Bento Box gives FOX access to the next generation of animators and the ability to originate owned IP to drive long-term value for the company. 
You need only to look at our Sunday broadcast schedule, where we have launched more animated hits than anyone, to know that animation has been the most stable network programming on FOX bar none, creating leverage, loyalty and youthful audiences across linear and digital properties. 
Beyond the network, we are also focused on our direct-to-consumer initiatives. FOX News continues to build a significant multi-platform presence well beyond the linear channel and has a strong position in direct-to-consumer news offerings. The FOX News digital properties attract over 100 million unique users per month and leads news engagement with over 3 billion page views per month. We are expanding our D2C news capabilities by offering a more immersive video-on-demand service in the form of Fox Nation, which was launched just this past November. 
On the sports front, we launched pay-per-view boxing with the Spence-Garcia bout in March. We followed that with the Pacquiao-Thurman match just a few weeks ago and were encouraged by the results as total purchases increased by more than 30% and direct purchases on the FOX Sports digital properties nearly doubled from the first pay-per-view event. 
In aggregate, the Fox portfolio of digital properties generates a monthly audience of over 200 million unique people and nearly 10 billion minutes of content consumption. 
But our progress does not stop there. During the past few months and consistent with the strategy we outlined at our Investor Day, we've made key investments to expand the reach of our brands beyond their traditional linear business models and deliver new and innovative products to our most valuable asset, our massive and massively engaged audience. 
Most notably, in May, Fox and the Stars Group announced plans to launch Fox Bet, a national media and sports wagering partnership in the United States. We are on track to launch the Fox Bet product in the upcoming football season -- or I should say, before the upcoming football season. And we see the opportunity in sports wagering as a long-term value contributor to Fox. 
Earlier this week, we announced the entry into a definitive agreement to the proposed acquisition of 67% of Credible Labs, a leading direct-to-consumer personal finance marketplace in the United States, at a price that we believe is full, fair and attractive on all relevant metrics, including our commitment to provide up to $75 million of growth capital over the next few years. The merger resulted from extensive discussions and negotiations with the special committee of independent directors on Credible's Board, which has unanimously recommended the transaction.
Through this prudent and disciplined investment, we will assess an adjacency to our enormous national and local news audiences and tap into a high-growth market. Just like our investment in the Stars Group for our Fox Bet offering through FOX Sports, the Credible marketplace is comfortably adjacent to and enhances our core Fox digital properties, specifically those at FOX News media and our local television stations. 
Upon the approval of the Credible deal, you will see us activate the Credible marketplace across FOXBusiness.com, which we will be refreshing later this year, and across the fast-growing digital footprint of our FOX TV Stations. Over time, we expect to activate the marketplace across our wider digital network. We believe that giving Credible access to our highly engaged digital audience will accelerate the company's growth. It's also important to note that we plan to ensure that Credible can continue to operate under its founder, Stephen Dash, enabling it to continue to pursue the widest growth opportunity in the personal finance marketplace category. 
From an operational standpoint, we're entering fiscal 2020 with great momentum. The FOX News channel dominates the cable news landscape marking 17 consecutive years as the #1 cable news network and maintaining its position as the #1 cable network in both primetime and total debuting this past year. 
FOX Sports led the industry in fiscal 2019 in the consumption of live sports events, measured by minutes viewed, beating second-best CBS by 10%, ESPN by 13% and beating the combined viewing of ABC and NBC. With our Thursday night and Sunday afternoon broadcast of the NFL, we are football's most significant broadcast partner. We have a great schedule for the upcoming season, and we're confident we can build on last year's solid ratings growth. 
Our FOX Television Stations will continue their multiyear expansion of local news coverage and will collectively produce nearly 1,000 hours a week of news. This focus on local programming has led the Stations Group to become #1 in the locally programmed and high-profitable daytime daypart in our owned-and-operated markets. 
We're also looking forward to the addition of 50 weeks of WWE SmackDown starting on October 4, a reinvigorated entertainment schedule built around the return of 2 seasons of The Masked Singer, our Own the Fall sports lineup across the network and our sports channels and of course, the broadcast of Super Bowl LIV on Fox. 
In support of our growth and as we noted during our Investor Day, we will continue to invest in our platforms in fiscal 2020 as we plan to deploy approximately $200 million to $250 million of EBITDA to launch -- to the launch of the WWE, the FOX Entertainment programming initiatives and to our digital properties, most notably at FOX News and FOX Business. We are confident that these investments will serve to drive future growth and value in the long term.
We are excited by the growth trajectory that we have set for our businesses and are pleased with the progress we are making. We believe that Fox is uniquely positioned to harness the opportunities created by this changing industry with a dynamic portfolio of leadership brands and compelling content that audiences are most passionate about. 
But before I turn over to Steve, let me comment on the legal claim that we, along with the other broadcast networks, filed against Locast last week. Simply put, Locast is a rogue streaming service violating the copyright laws for commercial gain, nothing more. Locast's claim to be a nonprofit that is not offering for any direct or indirect commercial advantage is absurd. It operates for the clear commercial benefit of the corporations that support it. I commented earlier on the importance to the company of our FOX Network and our owned and affiliated Stations Group. We're confident in the merit of our claim against Locast. The Locast theft is, of course, a validation of the irreplaceable value of our brands and the content that they carry. 
Now I will turn the call over to Steve to provide more detail on our financial results."
546623668,629785893,1805731,"Fox Corporation, Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Aug 07, 2019",2019-08-07,"Earnings Calls","Fox Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Lachlan. Good afternoon. We are pleased with our first full fiscal quarter as a stand-alone company. As Lachlan mentioned, we delivered both healthy top line and EBITDA growth, with this financial momentum setting us up very well for fiscal 2020.",1472,"Thanks, Lachlan. Good afternoon. We are pleased with our first full fiscal quarter as a stand-alone company. As Lachlan mentioned, we delivered both healthy top line and EBITDA growth, with this financial momentum setting us up very well for fiscal 2020. 
Let me now take you through our financial results for the fiscal year as well as the fourth quarter, along with providing some financial markers for the future. Our full year results saw total revenues grow 12% to $11.4 billion. Our revenue growth was broad-based, with affiliate revenues increasing 12%, led by retransmission revenue growth of the Television segment. Advertising revenue was up 10% on the back of our inaugural season of Thursday Night Football, which added 5 percentage points of advertising revenue growth, coupled with the record year of political advertising at our Television Stations. Within this advertising revenue growth, we were also encouraged with our digital progress, with digital advertising representing close to $500 million or 10% of total company advertising revenue. 
Finally, we delivered strong growth in content revenue, which we record as part of our other revenue line, supported by the digital licensing of network entertainment programming. Total full year segment EBITDA was $2.7 billion, an increase of 8% from last year, reflecting 8% growth at the Cable segment and 24% growth at the Television segment. 
At this point, it is worth remembering that when looking at our full year fiscal 2018 numbers as well as the first 3 quarters of our fiscal 2019 results, that these results have been prepared on a so-called carve-out basis. As such, they include allocations of 21st Century Fox overhead and shared service costs in accordance with SEC guidance, which as we have said in the past, understate the costs required to support Fox as a stand-alone business. We estimate that the total recurring costs beyond the amounts formulaically allocated to our published financial statements should range between $225 million and $250 million on an annual basis. Illustratively, if we took 75% of these incremental costs into account, they would have reduced our fiscal 2019 EBITDA by approximately $180 million. 
Net income attributable to stockholders was $1.6 billion this year or $2.57 a share, while adjusted EPS was $2.63 versus $2.50 last year. Again, both of these absolute values and the year-on-year comparison are influenced by the differences in allocated shared services and overhead costs. 
Turning to the fourth quarter. Total company reported revenues were $2.5 billion, up 5% over last year, reflecting revenue growth across all operating segments. Total segment EBITDA was $709 million, an 11% increase over the $640 million generated a year ago, led by higher contributions from the Television and Cable segments. This growth was partially offset by higher corporate expenses reported in the other segment, which now more properly reflect the full cost of operating as a stand-alone public company. 
From a bottom line perspective, net income attributable to stockholders of $450 million or $0.73 a share was lower than the $0.76 per share in the prior year quarter, while adjusted EPS of $0.62 was down 7% over last year. These reductions principally reflect increased interest in income tax expenses from our operating as a stand-alone public company. 
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was a touch above the more normalized mid-20% range we expect to have going forward. 
So now turning to the performance of our operating segments for the quarter, where Cable Network's EBITDA of $602 million was up 4% on revenue growth of 2%. The revenue increase was led by affiliate fee growth of 3%, supported by higher average rates across all our brands, partially offset by a net decrease in pay television subscribers. Ad revenues decreased slightly by 1%, reflecting lower contributions from the Women's FIFA World Cup in the current year as compared to the men's tournament in the prior year. The ad revenue decrease at the national sports networks was partially offset by the continued strength of FOX News, led by digital and advertising growth. 
EBITDA at our Cable segment increased 4% over the prior year, reflecting the higher revenues and a stable cost base as digital investments at FOX News were offset by lower sports rights expenses related to the FIFA World Cup and the absence of UFC programming in the current year quarter. 
At the Television segment, EBITDA was $214 million, an increase of $103 million from the prior year quarter, reflecting revenue growth of 5% and expense declines of 4%. The revenue growth was led by an 18% increase in affiliate revenue growth, which in turn was driven by programming fee growth from nonowned station affiliates. This growth is consistent with the overall TV affiliate revenue trajectory we laid out at our Investor Day in May, where we expect to deliver revenues of approximately $2.65 billion by calendar year 2022. In line with our expectations, advertising revenues in the quarter were down by 8%, reflecting difficult comparisons to the quarter a year ago, which included political revenues at the local stations related to the 2018 midterm elections and more FIFA World Cup matches. 
When viewing the segment as a whole, the advertising revenue decline was substantially offset by increased digital content licensing revenues. The decrease in expenses reflects lower sports rights resulting from fewer FIFA World Cup matches and NASCAR races in the quarter as well as lower entertainment programming costs due to fewer hours of original programming in the current quarter. 
The strong overall P&L results generated free cash flow, which we calculate as net cash provided by operating activities, less cash invested in property, plant and equipment of over $800 million in this quarter and $2.3 billion for the year, representing a 115% and 85% conversion of EBITDA to free cash flow, respectively. 
And finally, from an overall balance sheet perspective, we ended the quarter with $3.2 billion in cash and $6.8 billion in debt. 
Looking ahead into fiscal 2020, there are a few key items I would draw your attention to, many of which we had previously outlined at our Investor Day. Firstly, Lachlan has already outlined the targeted set of initiatives that will impact EBITDA in fiscal 2020. In addition, it is also worth remembering the changes in our major broadcast events that will affect year-on-year comparability, the single largest being our broadcast of Super Bowl LIV in February, which from a year-over-year EBITDA perspective will largely be neutralized by the combined effects of other cyclical events, such as an off-cycle political year, one less NFC divisional playoff game and the absence of the FIFA World Cup. 
As we look at the cadence of fiscal 2020, we would note that our Q2 P&L results this coming year will be impacted by higher sports expenses at the network, reflecting the contractual annual escalators on the NFL and college football contracts, and the addition of WWE rights as well as lower political advertising revenue at our local television stations when compared to the prior year. 
Looking across our group-wide other revenue category. We expect to post solid revenue growth in our Cable and other segments, supported by the increasing Fox Nation subscription revenues, the expansion of our pay-per-view boxing business, growth in content revenues and a full year of revenues associated with operating our L.A. op. Meanwhile, these gains will be at least partially offset by reductions in other revenue in our Television segment.
As we have previously disclosed, we expect shared services and corporate expenses reported in the other segment to increase significantly as we will be operating as a stand-alone public company for the full year as compared to only 1 quarter in fiscal 2019. On a full fiscal year basis, we expect the other segment to be a net EBITDA cost in the mid- to high-$300 million range. This includes a little over $50 million of stock-based compensation expense associated with the initial shareholder alignment plan award, which will temporarily impact our P&L in fiscal 2020 and 2021.
From a cash flow standpoint, we expect very robust conversion of EBITDA to free cash flow. Here, we expect very low working capital usage and cash tax savings of approximately $370 million resulting from the tax basis step-up obtained as a result of the Fox Corp. spin, while our capital expenditure will increase to fund the build of our new broadcast center in Phoenix.
Before concluding, I'd like to reiterate that we remain committed to a balanced capital allocation strategy, balancing between organic investments, strategic M&A and shareholder returns of capital. As part of this strategy, you will have seen that we just declared our second semiannual dividend of $0.23 a share and continue to expect to have a share buyback authorization in place in advance of our Annual Shareholder Meeting in November. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back to Joe."

And so we would -- we finished Q4 versus Q4 with a plus 7% growth rate across the whole estate, and so we would anticipate that sort of growth rate at that level or above into fiscal 2020. The reason why Cable had sort of reduced sequentially over the quarter through the fiscal year is just comps just lapping deal maturities. And so as we go into new deals, the focus obviously will be in getting a greater share of fair value on our retrans. So you'll see a disproportionate level of the forward growth still being with -- in the Television segment as opposed to the Cable segment."

And then on Credible, and I'm happy to talk about it, we, as a management team, are very excited, extraordinarily excited about the opportunity that Credible affords us. We look at it, and I think we've talked about this at the Investor Day and since, our key asset is not a skill set necessarily in selling advertising or selling affiliate revenue, although our teams are extraordinarily good at that and those are businesses that, as you've seen in these results, are performing extraordinarily well. 
But really, our key asset, our key resource is the deep engagement that we have in news and in sport and in entertainment with our audiences. And as we grow our digital platforms out, we are seeing that engagement really importantly and critically extend from a linear, analog environment, to a direct digital environment, which affords us the ability to demonetize that engagement in new models. 
So that really led us earlier this year to the Stars Group, where we decided with sports obviously entering the sports gaming market was a tremendous -- we see as a huge long-term opportunity for us, and the correlation between, obviously, the sports audience and this is -- should be obvious to most people between the sports audience and the sports-betting audience, is extraordinarily high correlation. And so you could say getting into the sports betting arena is a no-brainer. 
Well, it's equally a no-brainer with Credible in the news category. If you look, and we've done a huge amount of research and due diligence on this over the last couple of months, if you look at our news audience, and I'm not just talking cable news, but importantly, the nearly 1,000 hours of local news that we produce each week, if you look at that audience, it correlates incredibly highly with Credible's target audience for their financial marketplace. Our audience in news, which is natural, skews slightly older. It skews towards homeowners, and it skews towards an educated audience. And these are all factors that people searching for mortgages, in particular, and refinancing loans skew heavily towards. 
And so when we saw Credible, and we could see that by combining their service with our audience and our digital platforms, first, with FOX Business and then later through our other news platforms, we see a tremendous opportunity for it going forward."

So it's extraordinarily robust, our result we've had, certainly in both pricing and in volume. Pleasingly, the scatter market, since the upfront, has been even stronger, and we are in scatter doing double-digits pricing premiums to what we sold in the upfront. So -- which means, if you do the math, we are in the low 20s pricing in scatter over last year. 
So -- and this is driven really across categories, so it's not one category that's driving it. We're seeing obviously the streaming platforms, where it started to take their advertising digital platforms. Pharmaceutical continues to be strong. They had a short pause as they worked out some regulatory demands around their advertising so that they weren't initially -- they were slow in the upfront and then came back in and strong, and they're particularly strong in scatter now, pharmaceutical. Finance has been strong. And even now, locally, and this goes partially to your second question, on a state-by-state basis in a couple of our local stations, notably New York and Philadelphia, we're seeing some of this gaming revenue begin to appear in a fairly significant way. So we think, from a gaming point of view, as more states legalize online gambling, that we have a tremendous revenue stream to us outside of the TSG partnership from just a local advertising point of view. 
Also, obviously, in the Super Bowl, we started to sell the Super Bowl, and we're very pleased with the Super Bowl, both from a pricing point of view in terms of where we are versus our last Super Bowl a few years ago.

Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us today on Fox Corporation's year-end earnings call. While we are ending a fiscal year, we're also just starting our growth trajectory and are hitting key milestones at a good pace, specifically,",1886,"Thanks, Joe. Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us today on Fox Corporation's year-end earnings call. While we are ending a fiscal year, we're also just starting our growth trajectory and are hitting key milestones at a good pace, specifically, we just reported strong financial results. We recently concluded a very successful advertising upfront, very successful. We're making good progress on our distribution renewals. And we are having a compelling content lineup across our linear and digital channels, all of which positions us well as we commence our first full fiscal year in 2020. 
For fiscal 2019, we delivered exceptional financial results, achieving 12% revenue growth and 8% EBITDA growth. Our revenue growth was led by double-digit gains in both affiliate and advertising revenues. As you all know, about half of our annual revenue comes from affiliate revenue. And despite continued subscriber declines, we achieved 12% affiliate revenue growth in fiscal 2019. 
Renewing distribution arrangements with our partners is a normal course activity for us, and we have accomplished these renewals without much clamor over many cycles. This past fiscal year was no exception. We were able to reset affiliate rates, particularly in the Television segment, successfully renewing numerous distribution agreements. 
Today, the remainder of our annual revenue principally comes from advertising. In fiscal 2019, we achieved 10% growth, led by the addition of Thursday Night Football and record gross political revenues of more than $185 million at the FOX Stations Group, surpassing by almost 50% the previous record set in fiscal 2013 during the Obama-Romney election. 
A particularly noteworthy facet of this year's growth was a 24% increase in digital advertising revenues, led by 46% growth at FoxNews.com alone. Our advertising partners are clearly supportive of our ongoing programming strategy. This year's advertising upfront was one of the strongest we have seen in many years, yielding higher pricing across entertainment, sports and news. Specifically for Fox, these trends reflect advertisers' recognition of our unique capacity to deliver highly engaged audiences at scale. 
Across our concentrated portfolio, we were rewarded for our continuing content investments. On the entertainment front, we were able to achieve top-of-market, low-teen CPM increases and mid- to high-single-digit volume increases. In addition, we were able to command mid- to high-single-digit pricing increases in sports and news. In addition, even at this early date, we're very encouraged by both the volume and pricing we are seeing for the Super Bowl. We are in a strong television advertising market right now, which is due in part to an especially renewed interest by marketers in prime time and sports programming, which is clearly to our great advantage. 
As you know, a significant amount of the company's revenue is tied to the FOX broadcast network, which is supported by key sports and entertainment content as well as by local programming delivered everyday across America. Our network commenced premium advertising and retransmission revenue rates because it delivers a complete schedule of diverse content owners that engage wide audiences. From the NFL to The Simpson's, the network is defined by its programming breadth and not by a vertical concentration that is the hallmark of cable channels. And it is this breadth of programming that makes the FOX broadcast network 1 of the top 4 channels across the country, week in and week out, and such a strategic asset for Fox. 
While the power of sports is undeniable, we are not looking to turn Fox into a pure-play sports channel. We have a few of those already. Rather keeping the FOX Network vibrant and connected to our audiences is what we are constantly focused on. It is why we are investing in entertainment originality at the network at a time when broadcast originality and the scarcity value of reaching large audiences attracts a market premium across our revenue streams, as was demonstrated by advertisers in the recent upfront. 
To that end, we are pursuing a strategy to expand our portfolio of own content to generate long-term asset value for Fox. We are being strategic and judicious, building smartly and deliberately around our strengths. As part of this strategy, we are pursuing a new program coproduction model that gives us an equity interest in nearly all new shows aired on the network. We are enhancing our internal content-creation capabilities through the launch of SideCar, which is already providing third-party platforms, like be, with content; and also through the acquisition we announced yesterday of Bento Box, the animation company that produces BOB'S BURGERS; as well as 2 new Fox series, DUNCANVILLE and THE GREAT NORTH. Bento Box gives FOX access to the next-generation of animators and the ability to originate owned IP to drive long-term value for the company. 
You need only to look at our Sunday broadcast schedule, where we have launched more animated hits than anyone to know that animation has been the most stable network programming on FOX bar none, creating leverage, loyalty and youthful audiences across linear and digital properties. 
Beyond the network, we are also focused on our direct-to-consumer initiatives. FOX News continues to build a significant multi-platform presence well beyond the linear channel and has a strong position in direct-to-consumer news offerings. The FOX News digital properties attract over 100 million unique users per month and leads news engagement with over 3 billion page views per month. We're expanding our DTC news capabilities by offering a more immersive video-on-demand service in the former FOX Nation, which was launched just this past November. 
On the sports front, we launched pay-per-view boxing with the Spend Garcia bout in March. We followed that with the Pacquiao-Thurman match just a few weeks ago, and we're encouraged by the results, as total purchases increased by more than 30% and direct purchases on the FOX Sports digital properties nearly doubled from the first pay-per-view event. 
In aggregate, the Fox portfolio of digital properties generates a monthly audience of over 200 million unique people and nearly 10 billion minutes of content consumption. 
But our progress does not stop there. During the past few months and consistent with the strategy we outlined at our Investor Day, we've made key investments to expand the reach of our brands beyond their traditional linear business models and deliver new and innovative products to our most valuable asset: our massive and massively engaged audience. 
Most notably, in May, Fox and the Stars Group announced plans to launch Fox Bet, a national media and sports partnership in the United States. We are on track to launch the Fox Bet product in the upcoming football season -- or I should say, before the upcoming football season. And we see the opportunity in sports wagering as a long-term value contributor to FOX. 
Earlier this week, we announced the entry into a definitive agreement to the proposed acquisition of 67% of Credible Labs, a leading direct-to-consumer personal finance marketplace in the United States, at a price that we believe is full, fair and attractive on all relevant metrics, including our commitment to provide up to $75 million of growth capital over the next few years. The merger resulted from extensive discussions and negotiations with the special committee of independent directors and Credible's board, which has unanimously recommended the transaction. 
Through this prudent and disciplined investment, we will access an adjacency to our enormous national and local news audiences and tap into a high-growth market. Just like our investment in The Stars Group for our Fox Bet offering to FOX Sports, the Credible marketplace is comfortably adjacent to and enhances our core Fox digital properties, specifically those at FOX News media and our local television stations. 
Upon the approval of the Credible deal, you will see as activate the Credible marketplace across FOXBusiness.com, which we will be refreshing later this year, and across the fast-growing digital footprint of our FOX TV Stations. Over time, we expect to activate the marketplace across our wider digital network. We believe that given Credible access to our highly engaged digital audience will accelerate the company's growth. It's also important to note that we plan to ensure that Credible can continue to operate under its founder, Stephen Dash, enabling it to continue to pursue the widest growth opportunity in the personal finance marketplace category. 
From an operational standpoint, we're entering fiscal 2020 with great momentum. The FOX News channel dominates the cable news landscape, 17 consecutive years as the #1 cable news network and maintaining its position as the #1 cable network in both prime time and total debuting this past year. 
FOX Sports led the industry in fiscal 2019 in the consumption of live sports events, measured by minutes viewed, beating second-best CBS by 10%, ESPN by 13% and beating the combined viewing of ABC and NBC. With our Thursday night and Sunday afternoon broadcast of the NFL, we are football's most significant broadcast partner. We have a great schedule for the upcoming season, and we're confident we can build on last year's solid ratings growth. 
Our FOX Television stations will continue their multiyear expansion of local news coverage and will collectively produce nearly 1,000 hours a week of news. This focus on local programming has led the station's group to become #1 in the locally programmed and high profitable daytime daypart in our owned and operated market. 
We're also looking forward to the addition of 50 weeks of WWE Smackdown starting on October 4; a reinvigorated entertainment schedule built around the return of 2 seasons of the Messinger; our Own The Fall sports lineup across the network and our sports channels; and of course, the broadcast of Super Bowl LIV on FOX. 
In support of our growth and as we noted during our Investor Day, we will continue to invest in our platforms in fiscal 2020 as we plan to deploy approximately $200 million to $250 million of EBITDA to launch -- to the launch of the WWE, the FOX Entertainment programming initiatives and to our digital properties, most notably at FOX News and FOX Business. We are confident that these investments will serve to drive future growth and value in the long term. 
We are excited by the growth trajectory that we have set for our businesses and are pleased with the progress we are making. We believe that Fox is uniquely positioned to harness the opportunities created by this changing industry with a dynamic portfolio of leadership brands and compelling content that audiences are most passionate about. 
But before I turn over to Steve, let me comment on the legal claim that we, along with the other broadcast networks, filed against Locast last week. Simply put, Locast is a robust streaming service violating the copyright laws for commercial gain, nothing more. Locast claim to be a nonprofit that is not offering for any direct or indirect commercial advantage is absurd. It operates for the clear commercial benefit of the corporations that support it. I commented earlier on the importance of the company of our FOX Network and our owned and affiliated station group. We're confident in the merit of our claim against Locast. The Locast theft is, of course, a validation of the irreplaceable value of our brands and the content that they carry. 
Now I will turn the call over to Steve to provide more detail on our financial results."
546623668,629785893,1806645,"Fox Corporation, Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Aug 07, 2019",2019-08-07,"Earnings Calls","Fox Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Lachlan. Good afternoon. We are pleased with our first full fiscal quarter as a stand-alone company. As Lachlan mentioned, we delivered both healthy top line and EBITDA growth, with this financial momentum setting us up very well for fiscal 2020.",1469,"Thanks, Lachlan. Good afternoon. We are pleased with our first full fiscal quarter as a stand-alone company. As Lachlan mentioned, we delivered both healthy top line and EBITDA growth, with this financial momentum setting us up very well for fiscal 2020. 
Let me now take you through our financial results for the fiscal year as well as the fourth quarter, along with providing some financial markers for the future. Our full year results saw total revenues grow 12% to $11.4 billion. Our revenue growth was broad-based with affiliate revenues increasing 12%, led by retransmission revenue growth of the Television segment. Advertising revenue was up 10% on the back of our inaugural season of Thursday Night Football, which added 5 percentage points to the advertising revenue growth, coupled with the record year of political advertising at our television stations. Within this advertising revenue growth, we were also encouraged with our digital progress, with digital advertising representing close the $500 million or 10% of total company advertising revenue. 
Finally, we delivered strong growth in content revenue, which we record as part of our other revenue line, supported by the digital licensing of network entertainment programming. Total full year segment EBITDA was $2.7 billion, an increase of 8% from last year, reflecting 8% growth at the cable segment and 24% growth at the Television segment. At this point, it is worth remembering that when looking at our full year fiscal 2018 numbers as well as the first 3 quarters of our fiscal 2019 results that these results have been prepared on a so-called carve-out basis. As a result, include allocations of 21st Century Fox overhead and shared service costs in accordance with SEC guidance, which as we have said in the past, understate the costs required to support FOX as a stand-alone business. We estimate that the total recurring costs beyond the amounts formulaically allocated to our published financial statements should range between $225 million and $250 million on an annual basis. 
Illustratively, if we took 75% of these incremental costs into account, they would have reduced our fiscal 2019 EBITDA by approximately $180 million. Net income attributable to stockholders was $1.6 billion this year or $2.57 a share, while adjusted EPS was $2.63 versus $2.50 last year. Again, both of these absolute values of the year-on-year comparison are influenced by the differences in allocated shared services and overhead costs. 
Turning to the fourth quarter. Total company reported revenues were $2.5 billion, up 5% over last year, reflecting revenue growth across all operating segments. Total segment EBITDA was $709 million, an 11% increase over the $640 million generated a year ago, led by higher contributions from the television and cable segments. This growth was partially offset by higher corporate expenses reported in the other segments, which now more properly reflect the full cost of operating as a stand-alone public company. 
From a bottom line perspective, net income attributable to stockholders of $450 million or $0.73 per share was lower than the $0.76 per share in the prior year quarter, while adjusted EPS of $0.62 was down 7% over last year. These reductions principally reflect increased interest in income tax expenses from our operating as a stand-alone public company. 
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was a touch above the more normalized mid-20% range we expect to have going forward. 
So now turning to the performance of our operating segments for the quarter, with cable network's EBITDA of $602 million was up 4% on revenue growth of 2%. The revenue increase was led by affiliate fee growth of 3%, supported by higher average rates across all our brands, partially offset by net decrease in pay television subscribers. Ad revenues decreased slightly by 1%, reflecting lower contributions from the Women's FIFA World Cup in the current year as compared to the men's tournament in the prior year. The ad revenue decreased at the national sports networks partially offset by the continued strength of FOX News, led by digital and advertising growth. 
EBITDA at our cable segment increased 4% over the prior year, reflecting the higher revenues in the stable cost base as digital investments at FOX News were offset by lower sports rights expenses related to the FIFA World Cup and the absence of UFC programming in the current year quarter. 
At the television segment, EBITDA was $214 million, an increase of $103 million from the prior year quarter, reflecting revenue growth of 5% and expense declines of 4%. The revenue growth was led by an 18% increase in affiliate revenue growth, which in turn was driven by programming fee growth from non-owned station affiliates. This growth is consistent with the overall TV affiliate revenue trajectory we laid out at our Investor Day in May, where we expect to deliver revenues of approximately $2.65 billion by calendar year 2022. In line with our expectations, advertising revenues in the quarter were down by 8%, reflecting difficult comparisons to the quarter a year ago, which included political revenues at the local stations related to the 2018 midterm elections and more FIFA World Cup matches. 
When viewing the segment as a whole, the advertising revenue decline was substantially offset by increased digital content licensing revenues. The decrease in expenses reflects lower sports rights resulting from fewer FIFA World Cup matches and NASCAR races in the quarter as well as lower entertainment programming costs due to fewer hours of original programming in the current quarter. 
The strong overall P&L results generated free cash flow, which we calculate as net cash provided by operating activities; less cash invested in property, plant and equipment of over $800 million in this quarter; and $2.3 billion for the year, representing a 115% and 85% conversion of EBITDA to free cash flow, respectively. 
And finally, from an overall balance sheet perspective, we ended the quarter with $3.2 billion in cash and $6.8 billion in debt. 
Looking ahead into fiscal 2020, there are 3 key items I would draw your attention to, many of which we had previously outlined at our Investor Day. Firstly, Lachlan has already outlined the targeted set of initiatives that will impact EBITDA in fiscal 2020. In addition, it is also worth remembering the changes in our major broadcast events that will affect year-on-year comparability. The single largest being our broadcast of Super Bowl LIV in February, which from a year-over-year EBITDA perspective will largely be neutralized by the combined effects of other cyclical events, such as an off-cycle political year, one less NFC divisional playoff game and the absence of the FIFA World Cup. 
As we look at the cadence of fiscal 2020, we would note that our Q2 P&L results this coming year will be impacted by higher sports expenses at the network, reflecting the contractual annual escalators on the NFL and college football contracts and the addition of WWE rights as well as lower political advertising revenue at our local television stations when compared to the prior year. 
Looking across our group-wide other revenue category. We expect to post solid revenue growth in our cable and other segments supported by the increasing Fox Nation subscription revenues, the expansion of our pay-per-view boxing business, growth in content revenues and a full year of revenues associated with operating our [indiscernible]. Meanwhile, these gains will be at least partially offset by reductions in other revenue in our television segment. 
As we have previously disclosed, we expect shared services and corporate expenses reported in the other segment to increase significantly as we will be operating as a stand-alone public company for the full year as compared to only 1 quarter in fiscal 2019. On a full fiscal year basis, we expect the other segment to be a net EBITDA cost in the mid- to high-$300 million range. This includes a little over $50 million of stock-based compensation expense associated with the initial shareholder alignment plan award, which will temporarily impact our P&L in fiscal 2020 and 2021. 
From a cash flow standpoint, we expect very robust conversion of EBITDA to free cash flow. Here, we expect very low working capital usage and cash tax savings of approximately $370 million, resulting from the tax basis step-up obtained as a result of the FOX Corp. spin. While our capital expenditure will increase to fund the build of our new broadcast center in Phoenix. 
Before concluding, I'd like to reiterate that we remain committed to a balanced capital allocation strategy, balancing between organic investments, strategic M&A and shareholder return of capital. As part of this strategy, you will have seen that we just declared our second semiannual dividend of $0.23 a share and continue to expect to have a share buyback authorization in place in advance of our Annual Shareholder Meeting in November. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back to Joe."

And then on Credible, I'm happy to talk about it, we, as a management team, are very excited -- extraordinarily excited about the opportunity that the Credible affords us. We look at it, and I think we've talked about this at the Investor Day and since, our key asset is not a skill set necessarily in selling advertising or selling affiliate revenue. Although our teams are extraordinarily good at that, and those are businesses that, as you've seen in these results, are performing extraordinarily well. But really, our key asset, our key resource is the deep engagement that we have in news and in sport and entertainment with our audiences. And as we grow our digital platforms out, we are seeing that engagement really importantly and critically extend from a linear, analog environment to a direct digital environment, which affords us the ability to demonetize that engagement in new models. So that really led us earlier this year to the Stars Group, where we decided with sports obviously entering the sports gaming market with tremendous -- what we see as a huge long-term opportunity for us. And the correlation between, obviously, the sports audience and this is -- should be obvious to most people between the sports audience and the sports-betting audience is extraordinarily high correlation. And so you could say getting into the sports betting arena is a no-brainer. Well, it's equally a no-brainer with Credible in the news category. If you look and we've done a huge amount of research and due diligence on this over the last couple of months. If you look at our news audience, and I'm not just talking cable news, but importantly, the nearly 1,000 hours of local news that we produce each week. If you look at that audience, it correlates incredibly highly with Credible's target audience for their financial marketplace. Our audience in news, which is natural skews slightly older, it skews towards homeowners and it skews towards an educated audience. And these are all factors that people searching for mortgages, in particular, and refinancing loans skewed heavily towards. And so when we saw Credible, and we could see that by combining their service with our audience and our digital platforms, first, with FOX Business and then later through our other news platforms, we see a tremendous opportunity for it going forward."

So it's extraordinarily robust result we've had, certainly in both pricing and in volume. Pleasingly, the scatter market scenes in the upfront has been even stronger, and we are in scatter doing double-digits pricing premiums to what we sold in the upfront. So -- which means we do the math, we are in the low 20s pricing and scatter over last year. So -- and this is driven really across categories, so it's not one category that's driving it. We're seeing obviously the streaming platforms. We star to take their advertising digital platforms. Pharmaceutical continues to be strong. They had a short pause as they worked out some regulatory demands around their advertising, so they were and initially -- they were slow in the upfront, and then they came back in a strong and they're particularly strong in scatter now pharmaceutical. Finance has been strong. And even now locally, and this goes to partially to your second question, on a state-by-state basis in a couple of our local stations, New York and Philadelphia, we're seeing some of this gaming revenue begin to appear in a fairly significant way. So we think from a gaming point of view, as more states legalize online gambling that we have a tremendous revenue stream outside of the TSG partnership from just a local advertising point of view. Also obviously, in the Super Bowl, we start to sell the Super Bowl and we're very pleased with the Super Bowl, both from pricing point of view in terms of where we are versus our last Super Bowl a few years ago.

Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us today on Fox Corporation's year-end earnings call. While we are ending a fiscal year, we're also just starting our growth trajectory and are hitting key milestones at a good pace. Specifically,",1887,"Thanks, Joe. Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us today on Fox Corporation's year-end earnings call. While we are ending a fiscal year, we're also just starting our growth trajectory and are hitting key milestones at a good pace. Specifically, we just reported strong financial results. We recently concluded a very successful advertising upfront, very successful. We're making good progress on our distribution renewals. And we are having a compelling content lineup across our linear and digital channels, all of which positions us well as we commence our first full fiscal year 2020. 
For fiscal 2019, we delivered exceptional financial results, achieving 12% revenue growth and 8% EBITDA growth. Our revenue growth was led by double-digit gains in both affiliate and advertising revenues. As you all know, about half of our annual revenue comes from affiliate revenue. And despite continued subscriber declines, we achieved 12% affiliate revenue growth in fiscal 2019. 
Renewing distribution arrangements with our partners is a normal course activity for us, and we have accomplished these renewals without much clamor over many cycles. This past fiscal year was no exception. We were able to reset affiliate rates, particularly in the Television segment, successfully renewing numerous distribution agreements. 
Today, the remainder of our annual revenue principally comes from advertising. In fiscal 2019, we achieved 10% growth, led by the addition of Thursday Night Football and record gross political revenues of more than $185 million at the FOX Stations Group, surpassing by almost 50% the previous record set in fiscal 2013 during the Obama-Romney election. 
A particularly noteworthy facet of this year's growth was a 24% increase in digital advertising revenues, led by 46% growth at FoxNews.com alone. Our advertising partners are clearly supportive of our ongoing programming strategy. This year's advertising upfront was one of the strongest we have seen in many years, yielding higher pricing across entertainment, sports and news. Specifically for Fox, this strength reflects advertisers' recognition of our unique capacity to deliver highly engaged audiences at scale.
Across our concentrated portfolio, we were rewarded for our continuing content investments. On the entertainment front, we were able to achieve top-of-market, low-teen CPM increases and mid- to high-single-digit volume increases. In addition, we were able to command mid- to high-single-digit pricing increases in sports and news. In addition, even at this early date, we're very encouraged by both the volume and pricing we are seeing for the Super Bowl. We are in a strong television advertising market right now, which is due in part to an especially renewed interest by marketers in prime time and sports programming, which is clearly to our great advantage. 
As you know, a significant amount of the company's revenue is tied to the FOX broadcast network, which is supported by key sports and entertainment content as well as by local programming delivered every day across America. Our network commands premium advertising and retransmission revenue rates because it delivers a complete schedule of diverse content genres that engage wide audiences. From the NFL to The Simpsons, the network is defined by its programming breadth and not by a vertical concentration that is the hallmark of cable channels. And it is this breadth of programming that makes the FOX broadcast network 1 of the top 4 channels across the country, week in and week out, and such a strategic asset for Fox. 
While the power of sports is undeniable, we are not looking to turn Fox into a pure-play sports channel. We have a few of those already. Rather, keeping the FOX Network vibrant and connected to our audiences is what we are constantly focused on. It is why we are investing in entertainment originality at the network at a time when broadcast originality and the scarcity value of reaching large audiences attracts a market premium across our revenue streams as was demonstrated by advertisers in the recent upfront. 
To that end, we are pursuing a strategy to expand our portfolio of owned content to generate long-term asset value for Fox. We are being strategic and judicious, building smartly and deliberately around our strengths. As part of this strategy, we are pursuing a new program coproduction model that gives us an equity interest in nearly all new shows aired on the network. We are enhancing our internal content-creation capabilities through the launch of SideCar, which is already providing third-party platforms, like Quibi, with content and also, through the acquisition we announced yesterday of Bento Box, the animation company that produces Bob's Burgers as well as 2 new Fox series, Duncanville and The Great North. Bento Box gives FOX access to the next generation of animators and the ability to originate owned IP to drive long-term value for the company. 
You need only to look at our Sunday broadcast schedule, where we have launched more animated hits than anyone, to know that animation has been the most stable network programming on FOX bar none, creating leverage, loyalty and youthful audiences across linear and digital properties. 
Beyond the network, we are also focused on our direct-to-consumer initiatives. FOX News continues to build a significant multi-platform presence well beyond the linear channel and has a strong position in direct-to-consumer news offerings. The FOX News digital properties attract over 100 million unique users per month and leads news engagement with over 3 billion page views per month. We are expanding our D2C news capabilities by offering a more immersive video-on-demand service in the form of Fox Nation, which was launched just this past November. 
On the sports front, we launched pay-per-view boxing with the Spence-Garcia bout in March. We followed that with the Pacquiao-Thurman match just a few weeks ago and were encouraged by the results as total purchases increased by more than 30% and direct purchases on the FOX Sports digital properties nearly doubled from the first pay-per-view event. 
In aggregate, the Fox portfolio of digital properties generates a monthly audience of over 200 million unique people and nearly 10 billion minutes of content consumption. 
But our progress does not stop there. During the past few months and consistent with the strategy we outlined at our Investor Day, we've made key investments to expand the reach of our brands beyond their traditional linear business models and deliver new and innovative products to our most valuable asset, our massive and massively engaged audience. 
Most notably, in May, Fox and the Stars Group announced plans to launch Fox Bet, a national media and sports wagering partnership in the United States. We are on track to launch the Fox Bet product in the upcoming football season -- or I should say, before the upcoming football season. And we see the opportunity in sports wagering as a long-term value contributor to Fox. 
Earlier this week, we announced the entry into a definitive agreement to the proposed acquisition of 67% of Credible Labs, a leading direct-to-consumer personal finance marketplace in the United States, at a price that we believe is full, fair and attractive on all relevant metrics, including our commitment to provide up to $75 million of growth capital over the next few years. The merger resulted from extensive discussions and negotiations with the special committee of independent directors on Credible's Board, which has unanimously recommended the transaction.
Through this prudent and disciplined investment, we will assess an adjacency to our enormous national and local news audiences and tap into a high-growth market. Just like our investment in the Stars Group for our Fox Bet offering through FOX Sports, the Credible marketplace is comfortably adjacent to and enhances our core Fox digital properties, specifically those at FOX News media and our local television stations. 
Upon the approval of the Credible deal, you will see us activate the Credible marketplace across FOXBusiness.com, which we will be refreshing later this year, and across the fast-growing digital footprint of our FOX TV Stations. Over time, we expect to activate the marketplace across our wider digital network. We believe that giving Credible access to our highly engaged digital audience will accelerate the company's growth. It's also important to note that we plan to ensure that Credible can continue to operate under its founder, Stephen Dash, enabling it to continue to pursue the widest growth opportunity in the personal finance marketplace category. 
From an operational standpoint, we're entering fiscal 2020 with great momentum. The FOX News channel dominates the cable news landscape marking 17 consecutive years as the #1 cable news network and maintaining its position as the #1 cable network in both primetime and total debuting this past year. 
FOX Sports led the industry in fiscal 2019 in the consumption of live sports events, measured by minutes viewed, beating second-best CBS by 10%, ESPN by 13% and beating the combined viewing of ABC and NBC. With our Thursday night and Sunday afternoon broadcast of the NFL, we are football's most significant broadcast partner. We have a great schedule for the upcoming season, and we're confident we can build on last year's solid ratings growth. 
Our FOX Television Stations will continue their multiyear expansion of local news coverage and will collectively produce nearly 1,000 hours a week of news. This focus on local programming has led the Stations Group to become #1 in the locally programmed and high-profitable daytime daypart in our owned-and-operated markets. 
We're also looking forward to the addition of 50 weeks of WWE SmackDown starting on October 4, a reinvigorated entertainment schedule built around the return of 2 seasons of The Masked Singer, our Own the Fall sports lineup across the network and our sports channels and of course, the broadcast of Super Bowl LIV on Fox. 
In support of our growth and as we noted during our Investor Day, we will continue to invest in our platforms in fiscal 2020 as we plan to deploy approximately $200 million to $250 million of EBITDA to launch -- to the launch of the WWE, the FOX Entertainment programming initiatives and to our digital properties, most notably at FOX News and FOX Business. We are confident that these investments will serve to drive future growth and value in the long term.
We are excited by the growth trajectory that we have set for our businesses and are pleased with the progress we are making. We believe that Fox is uniquely positioned to harness the opportunities created by this changing industry with a dynamic portfolio of leadership brands and compelling content that audiences are most passionate about. 
But before I turn over to Steve, let me comment on the legal claim that we, along with the other broadcast networks, filed against Locast last week. Simply put, Locast is a rogue streaming service violating the copyright laws for commercial gain, nothing more. Locast's claim to be a nonprofit that is not offering for any direct or indirect commercial advantage is absurd. It operates for the clear commercial benefit of the corporations that support it. I commented earlier on the importance to the company of our FOX Network and our owned and affiliated Stations Group. We're confident in the merit of our claim against Locast. The Locast theft is, of course, a validation of the irreplaceable value of our brands and the content that they carry. 
Now I will turn the call over to Steve to provide more detail on our financial results."
546623668,629785893,1808351,"Fox Corporation, Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Aug 07, 2019",2019-08-07,"Earnings Calls","Fox Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Lachlan. Good afternoon. We are pleased with our first full fiscal quarter as a stand-alone company. As Lachlan mentioned, we delivered both healthy top line and EBITDA growth, with this financial momentum setting us up very well for fiscal 2020.",1472,"Thanks, Lachlan. Good afternoon. We are pleased with our first full fiscal quarter as a stand-alone company. As Lachlan mentioned, we delivered both healthy top line and EBITDA growth, with this financial momentum setting us up very well for fiscal 2020. 
Let me now take you through our financial results for the fiscal year as well as the fourth quarter, along with providing some financial markers for the future. Our full year results saw total revenues grow 12% to $11.4 billion. Our revenue growth was broad-based, with affiliate revenues increasing 12%, led by retransmission revenue growth of the Television segment. Advertising revenue was up 10% on the back of our inaugural season of Thursday Night Football, which added 5 percentage points of advertising revenue growth, coupled with the record year of political advertising at our Television Stations. Within this advertising revenue growth, we were also encouraged with our digital progress, with digital advertising representing close to $500 million or 10% of total company advertising revenue. 
Finally, we delivered strong growth in content revenue, which we record as part of our other revenue line, supported by the digital licensing of network entertainment programming. Total full year segment EBITDA was $2.7 billion, an increase of 8% from last year, reflecting 8% growth at the Cable segment and 24% growth at the Television segment. 
At this point, it is worth remembering that when looking at our full year fiscal 2018 numbers as well as the first 3 quarters of our fiscal 2019 results, that these results have been prepared on a so-called carve-out basis. As such, they include allocations of 21st Century Fox overhead and shared service costs in accordance with SEC guidance, which as we have said in the past, understate the costs required to support Fox as a stand-alone business. We estimate that the total recurring costs beyond the amounts formulaically allocated to our published financial statements should range between $225 million and $250 million on an annual basis. Illustratively, if we took 75% of these incremental costs into account, they would have reduced our fiscal 2019 EBITDA by approximately $180 million. 
Net income attributable to stockholders was $1.6 billion this year or $2.57 a share, while adjusted EPS was $2.63 versus $2.50 last year. Again, both of these absolute values and the year-on-year comparison are influenced by the differences in allocated shared services and overhead costs. 
Turning to the fourth quarter. Total company reported revenues were $2.5 billion, up 5% over last year, reflecting revenue growth across all operating segments. Total segment EBITDA was $709 million, an 11% increase over the $640 million generated a year ago, led by higher contributions from the Television and Cable segments. This growth was partially offset by higher corporate expenses reported in the other segment, which now more properly reflect the full cost of operating as a stand-alone public company. 
From a bottom line perspective, net income attributable to stockholders of $450 million or $0.73 a share was lower than the $0.76 per share in the prior year quarter, while adjusted EPS of $0.62 was down 7% over last year. These reductions principally reflect increased interest in income tax expenses from our operating as a stand-alone public company. 
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was a touch above the more normalized mid-20% range we expect to have going forward. 
So now turning to the performance of our operating segments for the quarter, where Cable Network's EBITDA of $602 million was up 4% on revenue growth of 2%. The revenue increase was led by affiliate fee growth of 3%, supported by higher average rates across all our brands, partially offset by a net decrease in pay television subscribers. Ad revenues decreased slightly by 1%, reflecting lower contributions from the Women's FIFA World Cup in the current year as compared to the men's tournament in the prior year. The ad revenue decrease at the national sports networks was partially offset by the continued strength of FOX News, led by digital and advertising growth. 
EBITDA at our Cable segment increased 4% over the prior year, reflecting the higher revenues and a stable cost base as digital investments at FOX News were offset by lower sports rights expenses related to the FIFA World Cup and the absence of UFC programming in the current year quarter. 
At the Television segment, EBITDA was $214 million, an increase of $103 million from the prior year quarter, reflecting revenue growth of 5% and expense declines of 4%. The revenue growth was led by an 18% increase in affiliate revenue growth, which in turn was driven by programming fee growth from nonowned station affiliates. This growth is consistent with the overall TV affiliate revenue trajectory we laid out at our Investor Day in May, where we expect to deliver revenues of approximately $2.65 billion by calendar year 2022. In line with our expectations, advertising revenues in the quarter were down by 8%, reflecting difficult comparisons to the quarter a year ago, which included political revenues at the local stations related to the 2018 midterm elections and more FIFA World Cup matches. 
When viewing the segment as a whole, the advertising revenue decline was substantially offset by increased digital content licensing revenues. The decrease in expenses reflects lower sports rights resulting from fewer FIFA World Cup matches and NASCAR races in the quarter as well as lower entertainment programming costs due to fewer hours of original programming in the current quarter. 
The strong overall P&L results generated free cash flow, which we calculate as net cash provided by operating activities, less cash invested in property, plant and equipment of over $800 million in this quarter and $2.3 billion for the year, representing a 115% and 85% conversion of EBITDA to free cash flow, respectively. 
And finally, from an overall balance sheet perspective, we ended the quarter with $3.2 billion in cash and $6.8 billion in debt. 
Looking ahead into fiscal 2020, there are a few key items I would draw your attention to, many of which we had previously outlined at our Investor Day. Firstly, Lachlan has already outlined the targeted set of initiatives that will impact EBITDA in fiscal 2020. In addition, it is also worth remembering the changes in our major broadcast events that will affect year-on-year comparability, the single largest being our broadcast of Super Bowl LIV in February, which from a year-over-year EBITDA perspective will largely be neutralized by the combined effects of other cyclical events, such as an off-cycle political year, one less NFC divisional playoff game and the absence of the FIFA World Cup. 
As we look at the cadence of fiscal 2020, we would note that our Q2 P&L results this coming year will be impacted by higher sports expenses at the network, reflecting the contractual annual escalators on the NFL and college football contracts, and the addition of WWE rights as well as lower political advertising revenue at our local television stations when compared to the prior year. 
Looking across our group-wide other revenue category. We expect to post solid revenue growth in our Cable and other segments, supported by the increasing Fox Nation subscription revenues, the expansion of our pay-per-view boxing business, growth in content revenues and a full year of revenues associated with operating our L.A. op. Meanwhile, these gains will be at least partially offset by reductions in other revenue in our Television segment.
As we have previously disclosed, we expect shared services and corporate expenses reported in the other segment to increase significantly as we will be operating as a stand-alone public company for the full year as compared to only 1 quarter in fiscal 2019. On a full fiscal year basis, we expect the other segment to be a net EBITDA cost in the mid- to high-$300 million range. This includes a little over $50 million of stock-based compensation expense associated with the initial shareholder alignment plan award, which will temporarily impact our P&L in fiscal 2020 and 2021.
From a cash flow standpoint, we expect very robust conversion of EBITDA to free cash flow. Here, we expect very low working capital usage and cash tax savings of approximately $370 million resulting from the tax basis step-up obtained as a result of the Fox Corp. spin, while our capital expenditure will increase to fund the build of our new broadcast center in Phoenix.
Before concluding, I'd like to reiterate that we remain committed to a balanced capital allocation strategy, balancing between organic investments, strategic M&A and shareholder returns of capital. As part of this strategy, you will have seen that we just declared our second semiannual dividend of $0.23 a share and continue to expect to have a share buyback authorization in place in advance of our Annual Shareholder Meeting in November. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back to Joe."

And so we would -- we finished Q4 versus Q4 with a plus 7% growth rate across the whole estate, and so we would anticipate that sort of growth rate at that level or above into fiscal 2020. The reason why Cable had sort of reduced sequentially over the quarter through the fiscal year is just comps just lapping deal maturities. And so as we go into new deals, the focus obviously will be in getting a greater share of fair value on our retrans. So you'll see a disproportionate level of the forward growth still being with -- in the Television segment as opposed to the Cable segment."

And then on Credible, and I'm happy to talk about it, we, as a management team, are very excited, extraordinarily excited about the opportunity that Credible affords us. We look at it, and I think we've talked about this at the Investor Day and since, our key asset is not a skill set necessarily in selling advertising or selling affiliate revenue, although our teams are extraordinarily good at that and those are businesses that, as you've seen in these results, are performing extraordinarily well. 
But really, our key asset, our key resource is the deep engagement that we have in news and in sport and in entertainment with our audiences. And as we grow our digital platforms out, we are seeing that engagement really importantly and critically extend from a linear, analog environment, to a direct digital environment, which affords us the ability to demonetize that engagement in new models. 
So that really led us earlier this year to the Stars Group, where we decided with sports obviously entering the sports gaming market was a tremendous -- we see as a huge long-term opportunity for us, and the correlation between, obviously, the sports audience and this is -- should be obvious to most people between the sports audience and the sports-betting audience, is extraordinarily high correlation. And so you could say getting into the sports betting arena is a no-brainer. 
Well, it's equally a no-brainer with Credible in the news category. If you look, and we've done a huge amount of research and due diligence on this over the last couple of months, if you look at our news audience, and I'm not just talking cable news, but importantly, the nearly 1,000 hours of local news that we produce each week, if you look at that audience, it correlates incredibly highly with Credible's target audience for their financial marketplace. Our audience in news, which is natural, skews slightly older. It skews towards homeowners, and it skews towards an educated audience. And these are all factors that people searching for mortgages, in particular, and refinancing loans skew heavily towards. 
And so when we saw Credible, and we could see that by combining their service with our audience and our digital platforms, first, with FOX Business and then later through our other news platforms, we see a tremendous opportunity for it going forward."

So it's extraordinarily robust, our result we've had, certainly in both pricing and in volume. Pleasingly, the scatter market, since the upfront, has been even stronger, and we are in scatter doing double-digits pricing premiums to what we sold in the upfront. So -- which means, if you do the math, we are in the low 20s pricing in scatter over last year. 
So -- and this is driven really across categories, so it's not one category that's driving it. We're seeing obviously the streaming platforms, where it started to take their advertising digital platforms. Pharmaceutical continues to be strong. They had a short pause as they worked out some regulatory demands around their advertising so that they weren't initially -- they were slow in the upfront and then came back in and strong, and they're particularly strong in scatter now, pharmaceutical. Finance has been strong. And even now, locally, and this goes partially to your second question, on a state-by-state basis in a couple of our local stations, notably New York and Philadelphia, we're seeing some of this gaming revenue begin to appear in a fairly significant way.

So we are really pleased with the performance of FOX News. 
In terms of sub declines, overall, we're seeing about a 1% aggregate sub decline. So that includes our kind of growing sort of smaller networks, such as Fox Sports 2 and BTN.

Good afternoon, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today on Fox Corporation's 2020 First Quarter Earnings Call. Our first full fiscal year as a stand-alone public company is off to a solid start, with good positive momentum across all our businesses. We have just reported strong financial results, which Steve will comment further on shortly. But perhaps more importantly, we are making significant progress on the operational goals and strategic initiatives that we outlined to you at our Investor Day. 
Our strategy to build Fox around live sports, news and event programming is producing results and delivering audience growth and engagement faster than we expected. For example, we are now 6 weeks into the fall season, and Fox has established itself as both the #1 rated broadcast network and the only big 4 network to deliver our year-on-year audience growth in the key 18-to-49 demographic and in total viewers. We are up 5% in 18-to-49 ratings and 10% in total viewers. 
This leadership position stems from the investments we are making across our network, beginning with FOX Sports, which has accounted for 22 of the 50 most watched telecast in the country since the NFL Kickoff. Our ratings are up 11% across our entire portfolio of college and pro football, led by Thursday night with viewership up 22% and our Sunday broadcast, which is up 8% to a 3-year high. 
Another new addition to the FOX Network was the debut of WWE's Friday Night Smackdown on October 4 to an average audience of nearly 4 million viewers. We are thrilled with our WWE partnership as it completes our strategy to program live content from Thursday through Sunday in the fall. 
The momentum behind football and WWE continued into the second quarter with a solid Major League Baseball postseason, culminating with a historic 7-Game World Series. Fox wins in adults 18 to 49 on 4 nights, Monday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, more nightly wins than any other network. 
The success of the network extends well beyond sport with our entertainment slate off to a great start, led by 2 of the top 3 programs on television. We're pleased to be seeing such positive signs of momentum as we execute the strategy we laid out last May. Our mix of live and near-live tentpole content mixed with high-quality entertainment is clearly paying dividends. The Masked Singer has returned for its second season as the #1 entertainment show on broadcast. And 911 is the top program on Mondays and is the #2 scripted program on all of television. And Part of a Sun is the highest-rated new broadcast program on any network this season. In fact, in entertainment programming only, Fox ranks #1 over the first 6 weeks of the season for the first time since 2011. 
Speaking of #1, the FOX News network is on track to finish the calendar year as the #1 cable channel for the fourth straight year and is the #1 news channel for 18 years running. And speaking of news, our station group has continued to expand the already extraordinary amount of local news we broadcast, which positions us well the robust political ad market we expect next year. 
The real strength and value of these distinctive brands is evidenced by the momentum we've had on the distribution and affiliate renewal front, where we remain on pace to achieve the targets we have previously outlined. We have successfully renewed distribution agreements with Charter, DISH and Cox, along with affiliate agreements with Nexstar, Gray and TEGNA. In each of these renewals, we were able to achieve value that reflects the strength of our core brands. 
Having said that, we have seen the rate of subscriber declines in the traditional MVPD universe escalate in recent months, with this quarter yielding industry declines of over 4%. But it is important to note that the subscriber losses reported by just one distributor, which accounts for approximately 25% of pay television subscribers, represent the majority of the net losses we experienced over the past 12 months. That distributor accounts for almost 80% of total losses over the last year. And without them, sub losses would decrease to about 1.3%, helped by strong gains from the leading D MVPDs. 
This is important because it suggests that it is too early to draw firm conclusions from a market that is still clearly fluid, especially in light of surging results from our leading digital partners. It is, though, something we are clearly focused on. 
Another area of focus is growing the company's digital revenues and businesses. I should mention that we do not include the MVPD distribution revenue in our digital results. The reach of our direct platforms has grown to over 250 million users per month, with total engagement growing to over 11 billion minutes per month. Interestingly, we now see well above 10% of our streaming audience consuming the 4K stream with very positive feedback, and we are excited to be the first broadcaster ever to stream the Super Bowl in 4K. It will be a groundbreaking experience for fans. 
Our digital strategy, inclusive of businesses like FOX Spec and Credible, is crucial to heightened engagement with our audiences, which is already driving meaningful growth. Year-over-year digital revenue has grown over 30% in the quarter, and we continue to work to optimize our digital platforms. For the first time ever, our FOX News, FOX Business and FOX Television Stations digital properties are all now underpinned by the same tech platforms. And FOX Sports is being transitioned this quarter, enabling us to drive improved monetization across these businesses. 
Of course, driving that improvement also leads us to new business models and new revenue streams. In conjunction with the kickoff of the football season, we launched the free-to-play FOX Sports Super 6 app nationally, which has already achieved nearly 1 million registered users and almost 10 million plays. The Stars Group is now live with the digital sports wagering service Fox Bet in both New Jersey and Pennsylvania. 
The proposed merger between Flooder Entertainment, the owner of Fanduel, and our partner, The Stars Group, will create many opportunities for us. We're excited to develop the Fox Bet brand in partnership with Fanduel and are confident in the dual-brand strategy to capitalize on the rapidly growing sports wagering market. 
Over a more month ago, FOX Business debuted a brand refresh across its linear and digital platforms, including a new logo and tagline, ""Invested in You."" As part of this initiative, Foxspins.com and the FOX Business app were relaunched with new content and editorial tools to drive engagement. The initial performance of the relaunched digital properties has been encouraging as we have seen substantial increases in page views and in unique users. 
A core part of our strategy for foxbusiness.com is our acquisition of Credible Labs, which closed a few weeks ago. We are now beginning the process of integrating its service with our core businesses, starting with FOX Business. 
While we remain focused on executing against our operational plans, we also continue to make progress towards other strategic initiatives while maintaining a balanced approach to capital allocation. To further strengthen our portfolio of assets, yesterday, we announced an agreement with Nexstar to acquire their local television stations in the Seattle and Milwaukee markets. In return, we have agreed to sell them our stations in the Charlotte market, which geographically aligns with Nexstar's existing operations in the Carolinas and in Virginia. It's a great deal for both companies and a rare win-win. This acquisition expands the reach of one of Fox's core assets, our television stations portfolio, and further strengthen what is already a highly profitable and cash-generative business. This transaction will expand our market presence to 14 of the top 15 DMAs, and importantly, adds 2 major markets, with NFL, Major League Baseball, Pack 12 and Big 10 Teams. 
Finally, consistent with the timing we laid out at our Investor Day [indiscernible], we have today announced that our Board of Directors has authorized a $2 billion stock repurchase program. We are pleased to have the buyback authorization formally in place as part of our capital toolkit. The company also announced its intent to complete $500 million of software purchases in the near term. 
In light of all the positive momentum I have just touched upon, in light of our success at the network, at sports at news and in our growing station group, in light of our market-leading investments in some sports gaming and in the Credible marketplace and in light of the unique cash benefits of our tax structure, we believe we are undervalued in respect to our peers and to other investment opportunities available to us at this time. This buyback reflects both our confidence in the long-term strength of our business and in our commitment to finding the most efficient use of our capital. We remain committed to deploying capital in a disciplined manner to maximize shareholder value through a balanced approach of organic investment, accretive M&A and return of capital to our stockholders. We will not follow a prescribed formula of deployment. Instead, we will be opportunistic and invest capital where we feel the company can achieve the greatest return on investment. 
Now Steve will provide more detail on our financial results."
546623668,640251747,1855634,"Fox Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Nov 06, 2019",2019-11-06,"Earnings Calls","Fox Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Lachlan, and good afternoon.

We delivered healthy top line a",1220,"Thanks, Lachlan, and good afternoon. We've made a solid start to fiscal 2020. And notwithstanding the subscriber headwind Lachlan just mentioned, overall, we are exceeding our internal plans that we commenced the year with. We delivered healthy top line and double-digit EBITDA growth in the first quarter, which sets us up well for the remainder of fiscal 2020. 
Let me now take you through our results and along the way, remind you of some key factors that shaped the rest of our fiscal year. In the first quarter, the company reported total revenues of $2.7 billion, up 5% over the comparative period in fiscal 2019, reflecting revenue growth across all operating segments. EBITDA was $856 million, a 12% increase over the $761 million generated in the prior year, led by higher contributions from the television and cable segment. This growth was partially offset by higher corporate expenses reported in the other segment, which reflect the costs of Fox operating as a stand-alone public company in the current year quarter versus the presentation of carve-out financial statements in the prior year. 
From a bottom line perspective, net income attributable to stockholders of $499 million or $0.80 per share was lower than the $604 million or $0.97 per share in the prior year quarter. This decrease was primarily attributable to a $115 million reduction in the unrealized gain recognized in other net related to the change in fair value of the company's investment in Roku. 
Excluding this impact and other onetime items, adjusted EPS of $0.83 was up slightly over last year's $0.82 per share as our strong operating performance was largely offset by below-the-line items such as interest and tax expense, which as we have flagged in the past, now reflect the full amounts associated with operating as a stand-alone company. 
So now turning to the performance of our operating segments for the quarter. Where cable network EBITDA of $684 million was up 8% on revenue growth of 2%. The revenue increase was led by other revenue growth of $30 million. This increase was driven by pay-per-view boxing revenues, including the Pacquiao-Thurman bout that took place on July 20, along with increased sports licensing revenues and subscription revenues from Fox Nation. 
Cable affiliate revenues were in line with those in the prior year quarter as the impact of higher average rates across essentially all of our brands was offset by the net decrease in pay television subscribers that Lachlan mentioned earlier. Barring material changes in current subscriber trends, we anticipate a return to growth in cable affiliate revenue in the second half of the fiscal year as rate resets from recent renegotiations begin to take effect. 
Cable advertising revenues decreased 4%, reflecting lower contributions from the Women's FIFA World Cup in the current year as compared to the men's tournament in the prior year, along with the absence of UFC programming at the national sports networks. EBITDA at our cable segment increased 8% over the prior year, reflecting the higher revenues and a 5% reduction in costs. The decrease in expenses was attributable to lower rights and production costs related to the Men's FIFA World Cup in the prior year quarter and the absence of UFC programming in the current year quarter, partially offset by contractual increases on existing sports rights agreements. 
At the television segment, EBITDA was $251 million, an increase of $80 million or 47% from the prior year quarter on the back of revenue growth of 6%. The revenue growth was led by a 14% increase in television affiliate revenues, reflecting double-digit programming fee growth from non-owned station affiliates and double-digit direct retransmission revenue growth at our owned and operated stations. This growth is consistent with the overall TV affiliate revenue trajectory we laid out at our Investor Day in May, where we announced our expectation to deliver revenues of approximately $2.65 billion by calendar year 2022. Other revenues in the television segment grew by $34 million driven by higher digital content licensing revenues and revenues from our recently acquired Animation Studio, Bento Box. 
As expected, advertising revenue in us in the quarter decreased by $12 million or 2% as higher entertainment advertising revenues, which include the impact of the broadcast of the Emmy Awards on Fox, were more than offset by several expected cyclical factors versus the quarter a year ago. These include the impacts of political advertising revenues at the local stations related to the 2018 midterm elections and more FIFA World Cup matches in the prior year quarter. 
Television segment expenses were in line with prior year amounts as the contractual increases on existing sports rights agreements and expenses associated with the broadcast of the Emmy Awards were offset by the absence of the rights expense associated with the broadcast of the Men's FIFA World Cup in the prior year quarter. 
While most of you are already aware, at this point, it is worth remembering that seasonal and cyclical factors have a particularly pronounced impact on our quarterly results in our television segment. This will be most visible in our Q2 results with the impact of higher sports rights and production expenses at the FOX Network, reflecting the contractual annual escalators on the NFL, Major League Baseball and college football contracts and the addition of WWE Rise as well as lower political advertising revenue at our local television stations when compared to the prior year. 
Finally, from a P&L perspective, the net EBITDA loss in our other segment amounted to $79 million, which reflects a full quarter of stand-alone costs as opposed to the carve-out basis of presentation in the corresponding quarter last year. These strong overall P&L results generated free cash flow, which we calculate as net cash provided by operating activities less cash invested in property, plant and equipment of just over $160 million in this quarter. The modest rate conversion of EBITDA to free cash flow of approximately 20% reflects the typical seasonality you should expect to see in the business. Here, our first and second quarter cash flows are impacted by the working capital deficit from sports rights payments and the timing of cash collections on our earned advertising revenue, which both reversed in the second half of our fiscal year. On a full year basis, we continue to expect to benefit from natural low working capital usage along with our cash tax benefit. 
From an overall balance sheet perspective, we ended the quarter with $3.3 billion in cash and $6.8 billion in debt. As Lachlan mentioned earlier, in the very near term, we will be deploying $500 million of cash on hand to the buyback of both A and B class shares. To do this, we have entered into an accelerated stock repurchase transaction to buy back $350 million of the company's Class A common stock and intend to promptly repurchase approximately $150 million of Class B common stock. 
Additionally, as part of our balanced capital allocation approach and as we announced yesterday, approximately $300 million of capital will be directed to the Nexstar television stations transaction, which we expect to close in the second half of this fiscal year. And in October, we closed the acquisition of a 67% stake in Credible Labs for approximately $260 million. 
And with that, I'd now like to return it back to Joe."

But in the quarter, despite some of the comparisons that Steve mentioned in his",480,"Great, Jessica. Those aren't tough questions. So I'm happy to take them. So thank you. Look, from an advertising point of view, talk a little bit about Super Bowl in a second. But in the quarter, despite some of the comparisons that Steve mentioned in his earlier comments, advertising has been quite strong, particularly across the entertainment and sports categories. We had a very successful upfront, with entertainment pricing up double digits and with sports pricing up high single digits, which we've been very pleased to achieve. 
In addition to that, one of the critical goals of our upfront was also to set the WWE pricing to broadcast pricing, not cable pricing, and we did that very successfully. Categories in the market are -- a number of categories are incredibly strong. The streaming services, with Disney, Netflix and Apple recently have been spending good money; the tech sector, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, very strong clients. Pharmaceutical has been strong. They've been moving some of the money between demographics so from some money sort of out of news, but on to sports and entertainment. And of course, the financial services sector, clients like GEICO, Progressive, State Farm, have also been spending good money and supporting us very well. 
So we're happy with where we are. I haven't mentioned news. News pricing in the upfront was up mid-single digits. The news market as an advertising market is softer than in entertainment and in sport. We think that's because of some of the ratings deficiencies at our competitors that are -- some volume is being given away more cheaply than we would agree to. So we're finding the news market softer than sports and news. 
Pacing in the -- sorry, in the quarter, our scatter pricing was up about 25%. There's very little scatter, so it's a good statistic. And going forward, it's lower than that but still up well above the upfront. 
Which leads us to the Super Bowl. We're well ahead of last year or so. We -- obviously, we don't know, last year, our competitor, but we're well ahead of our last Super Bowl, where we were selling at this stage in the year. We're sold out of all of our A positions, and we have really good momentum as we continue to sell the Super Bowl. So we're very confident that the pricing will be -- I don't want to give the number, but the pricing will certainly be the highest cost per 30-second ad in any Super Bowl to date. So we're very pleased with that. 
On the NFL, we don't have an update for you in terms of where we are with the negotiations. Obviously, we're engaged with the NFL every day as we broadcast their fixture and -- but negotiations with the NFL in terms of a renewal of any of the packages has not started yet."

So when you look at our first half, second half growth rate, the growth rate will absolutely be skewed to that second half, and in particular, our third quarter, where you'll see the benefit of those rate resets really kicking in. Again, it will be skewed towards retransmission growth as against cable affiliate. But we feel pretty comfortable where we are for the full year and also that $2.65 billion target for calendar '22."

Good afternoon and thanks, everyone, for joining us today on Fox Corporation's 2020 First Quarter Earnings Call. Our first full fiscal year as a stand-alone public company is off to a solid start with good positive momentum across all our bus",1549,"Thanks, Joe. Good afternoon and thanks, everyone, for joining us today on Fox Corporation's 2020 First Quarter Earnings Call. Our first full fiscal year as a stand-alone public company is off to a solid start with good positive momentum across all our businesses. We have just reported strong financial results, which Steve will comment further on shortly. But perhaps more importantly, we are making significant progress on the operational goals and strategic initiatives that we outlined to you at our Investor Day.
Our strategy to build Fox around live sports, news and event programming is producing results and delivering audience growth and engagement faster than we expected. For example, we are now 6 weeks into the fall season, and Fox has established itself as both the #1 rated broadcast network and the only big 4 network to deliver year-on-year audience growth in the key 18 to 49 demographic and in total viewers. We are up 5% in 18 to 49 ratings and 10% in total viewers.
This leadership position stems from the investments we are making across our network, beginning with FOX Sports, which has accounted for 22 of the 50 most watched telecast in the country since the NFL Kickoff. Our ratings are up 11% across our entire portfolio of college and pro football led by Thursday night with viewership up 22% and our Sunday broadcast, which is up 8% to a 3-year high.
Another new addition to the FOX Network was the debut of WWE's Friday Night Smackdown on October 4 to an average audience of nearly 4 million viewers. We are thrilled with our WWE partnership as it completes our strategy to program live content from Thursday through Sunday in the fall.
The momentum behind football and WWE continued into the second quarter with a solid Major League Baseball postseason, culminating with a historic 7-Game World Series. Fox wins in adults 18 to 49 on 4 nights, Monday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, more nightly wins than any other network.
The success of the network extends well beyond sport with our entertainment slate off to a great start led by 2 of the top 3 programs on television. We're pleased to be seeing such positive signs of momentum as we execute the strategy we laid out last May. Our mix of live and near-live tent-pole content mixed with high-quality entertainment is clearly paying dividends. The Masked Singer has returned for its second season as the #1 entertainment show on broadcast. And 9-1-1 is the top program on Mondays and is the #2 scripted program on all of television. And Prodigal Son is the highest-rated new broadcast program on any network this season. In fact, in entertainment programming only, Fox ranks #1 over the first 6 weeks of the season for the first time since 2011.
Speaking of #1, the FOX News network is on track to finish the calendar year as the #1 cable channel for the fourth straight year and is the #1 news channel for 18 years running. And speaking of news, our station group has continued to expand the already extraordinary amount of local news we broadcast, which positions us well to the robust political ad market we expect next year.
The real strength and value of these distinctive  brands is evidenced by the momentum we've had on the distribution and affiliate renewal front where we remain on pace to achieve the targets we have previously outlined. We have successfully renewed distribution agreements with Charter, DISH and Cox, along with affiliate agreements with Nexstar, Gray and TEGNA. In each of these renewals, we were able to achieve value that reflects the strength of our core brands.
Having said that, we have seen the rate of subscriber declines in the traditional MVPD universe escalate in recent months, with this quarter yielding industry declines of over 4%. But it is important to note that the subscriber losses reported by just one distributor, which accounts for approximately 25% of pay television subscribers, represent the majority of the net losses we experienced over the past 12 months. That distributor accounts for almost 80% of total losses over the last year. And without them, sub losses would decrease to about 1.3%, helped by strong gains from the leading DMVPDs. This is important because it suggests that it is too early to draw firm conclusions from a market that is still clearly fluid, especially in light of surging results from our leading digital partners. It is, though, something we are clearly focused on.
Another area of focus is growing the company's digital revenues and businesses. I should mention that we do not include the MVPD distribution revenue in our digital results. The reach of our direct platforms has grown to over 250 million users per month, with total engagement growing to over 11 billion minutes per month. Interestingly, we now see well above 10% of our streaming audience consuming the 4K stream with very positive feedback, and we are excited to be the first broadcaster ever to stream the Super Bowl in 4K. It will be a groundbreaking experience for fans.
Our digital strategy, inclusive of businesses like FOX Bet and Credible, is crucial to heightened engagement with our audiences, which is already driving meaningful growth. Year-over-year digital revenue has grown over 30% in the quarter, and we continue to work to optimize our digital platforms. For the first time ever, our FOX News, FOX Business and FOX Television Stations digital properties are all now underpinned by the same tech platforms. And FOX Sports is being transitioned this quarter, enabling us to drive improved monetization across these businesses.
Of course, driving that improvement also leads us to new business models and new revenue streams. In conjunction with the kickoff of the football season, we launched the free-to-play FOX Sports Super 6 app nationally, which has already achieved nearly 1 million registered users and almost 10 million plays. The Stars Group is now live with the digital sports wagering service Fox Bet in both New Jersey and Pennsylvania.
The proposed merger between Flutter Entertainment, the owner of FanDuel, and our partner, The Stars Group, will create many opportunities for us. We're excited to develop the Fox Bet brand in partnership with FanDuel and are confident in the dual-brand strategy to capitalize on the rapidly growing sports wagering market.
Over a month ago, FOX Business debuted a brand refresh across its linear and digital platforms, including a new logo and tagline, Invested in You. As part of this initiative, FOXBusiness.com and the FOX Business app were relaunched with new content and editorial tools to drive engagement. The initial performance of the relaunched digital properties has been encouraging as we have seen substantial increases in page views and in unique users.
A core part of our strategy for FOXBusiness.com is our acquisition of Credible Labs, which closed a few weeks ago. We are now beginning the process of integrating its service with our core businesses, starting with FOX Business.
While we remain focused on executing against our operational plans, we also continue to make progress towards other strategic initiatives while maintaining a balanced approach to capital allocation. To further strengthen our portfolio of assets, yesterday, we announced an agreement with Nexstar to acquire their local television stations in the Seattle and Milwaukee markets. In return, we have agreed to sell them our stations in the Charlotte market, which geographically aligns with Nexstar's existing operations in the Carolinas and in Virginia. It's a great deal for both companies and a rare win-win. This acquisition expands the reach of one of Fox's core assets, our television stations portfolio, and further strengthens what is already a highly profitable and cash-generative business. This transaction will expand our market presence to 14 of the top 15 DMAs and importantly adds 2 major markets with NFL, Major League Baseball, Pac-12 and Big Ten Teams.
Finally, consistent with the timing we laid out at our Investor Day, we have today announced that our Board of Directors has authorized a $2 billion stock repurchase program. We are pleased to have the buyback authorization formally in place as part of our capital toolkit. The company also announced its intent to complete $500 million of software purchases in the near term.
In light of all the positive momentum I have just touched upon, in light of our success at the network, at sports, at news and in our growing station group, in light of our market-leading investments in sports gaming and in the Credible marketplace and in light of the unique cash benefits of our tax structure, we believe we are undervalued in respect to our peers and to other investment opportunities available to us at this time. This buyback reflects both our confidence in the long-term strength of our business and in our commitment to finding the most efficient use of our capital. We remain committed to deploying capital in a disciplined manner to maximize shareholder value through a balanced approach of organic investment, accretive M&A and return of capital to our stockholders. We will not follow a prescribed formula of deployment. Instead, we will be opportunistic and invest capital where we feel the company can achieve the greatest return on investment.
Now Steve will provide more detail on our financial results."

And notwithstanding the subscriber headwind Lachlan just mentioned, overall, we are exceeding our internal plans that we commenced the year with. We delivered healthy top line and double-digit EBITDA growth in the first quarter, which sets us up well for the remainder of fiscal 2020.
Let me now take you through our results and along the way, remind you of some key factors that shape the rest of our fiscal year. In the first quarter, the company reported total revenues of $2.7 billion, up 5% over the comparative period in fiscal 2019, reflecting revenue growth across all operating segments. EBITDA was $856 million, a 12% increase over the $761 million generated in the prior year led by higher contributions from the Television and Cable segment. This growth was partially offset by higher corporate expenses reported in the other segment, which reflect the costs of Fox operating as a stand-alone public company in the current year quarter versus the presentation of carve-out financial statements in the prior year.
From a bottom line perspective, net income attributable to stockholders of $499 million or $0.80 per share was lower than the $604 million or $0.97 per share in the prior year quarter. This decrease was primarily attributable to a $115 million reduction in the unrealized gain recognized in other net related to the change in fair value of the company's investment in Roku.
Excluding this impact and other onetime items, adjusted EPS of $0.83 was up slightly over last year's $0.82 per share as our strong operating performance was largely offset by below-the-line items such as interest and tax expense, which, as we have flagged in the past, now reflect the full amounts associated with operating as a stand-alone company.
So now turning to the performance of our operating segments for the quarter where cable network EBITDA of $684 million was up 8% on revenue growth of 2%. The revenue increase was led by other revenue growth of $30 million. This increase was driven by pay-per-view boxing revenues, including the Pacquiao-Thurman bout that took place on July 20, along with increased sports sublicensing revenues and subscription revenues from Fox Nation.
Cable affiliate revenues were in line with those in the prior year quarter as the impact of higher average rates across essentially all of our brands was offset by the net decrease in pay television subscribers that Lachlan mentioned earlier. Barring material changes in current subscriber trends, we anticipate a return to growth in cable affiliate revenue in the second half of the fiscal year as rate resets from recent renegotiations begin to take effect.
Cable advertising revenues decreased 4%, reflecting lower contributions from the Women's FIFA World Cup in the current year as compared to the men's tournament in the prior year, along with the absence of UFC programming at the national sports networks.
EBITDA at our Cable segment increased 8% over the prior year, reflecting the higher revenues and a 5% reduction in costs. The decrease in expenses was attributable to lower rights and production costs related to the Men's FIFA World Cup in the prior year quarter and the absence of UFC programming in the current year quarter, partially offset by contractual increases on existing sports rights agreements.
At the Television segment, EBITDA was $251 million, an increase of $80 million or 47% from the prior year quarter on the back of revenue growth of 6%. The revenue growth was led by a 14% increase in television affiliate revenues, reflecting double-digit programming fee growth from non-owned station affiliates and double-digit direct retransmission revenue growth at our owned and operated stations. This growth is consistent with the overall TV affiliate revenue trajectory we laid out at our Investor Day in May where we announced our expectation to deliver revenues of approximately $2.65 billion by calendar year 2022. Other revenues in the Television segment grew by $34 million driven by higher digital content licensing revenues and revenues from our recently acquired animation studio, Bento Box.
As expected, advertising revenues in the quarter decreased by $12 million or 2% as higher entertainment advertising revenues, which include the impact of the broadcast of the Emmy Awards on Fox, were more than offset by the several -- by several expected cyclical factors versus the quarter a year ago. These include the impacts of political advertising revenues at the local stations related to the 2018 midterm elections and more FIFA World Cup matches in the prior year quarter.
Television segment expenses were in line with prior year amounts as the contractual increases on existing sports rights agreements and expenses associated with the broadcast of the Emmy Awards were offset by the absence of the rights expense associated with the broadcast of the Men's FIFA World Cup in the prior year quarter.
While most of you are already aware, at this point, it is worth remembering that seasonal and cyclical factors have a particularly pronounced impact on our quarterly results in our Television segment. This will be most visible in our Q2 results with the impact of higher sports rights and production expenses at the FOX Network, reflecting the contractual annual escalators on the NFL, Major League Baseball and college football contracts and the addition of WWE rights as well as lower political advertising revenue at our local television stations when compared to the prior year. 
Finally, from a P&L perspective, the net EBITDA loss in our other segment amounted to $79 million, which reflects a full quarter of stand-alone costs as opposed to the carve-out basis of presentation in the corresponding quarter last year. These strong overall P&L results generated free cash flow, which we calculate as net cash provided by operating activities less cash invested in property, plant and equipment, of just over $160 million in this quarter. The modest rate conversion of EBITDA to free cash flow of approximately 20% reflects the typical seasonality you should expect to see in the business. Here, our first and second quarter cash flows are impacted by the working capital deficit from sports rights payments and the timing of cash collections on our earned advertising revenue, which both reversed in the second half of our fiscal year. On a full year basis, we continue to expect to benefit from natural low working capital usage along with our cash tax benefit.
From an overall balance sheet perspective, we ended the quarter with $3.3 billion in cash and $6.8 billion in debt. As Lachlan mentioned earlier, in the very near term, we will be deploying $500 million of cash on hand to the buyback of both A and B class shares. To do this, we have entered into an accelerated stock repurchase transaction to buy back $350 million of the company's Class A common stock and intend to promptly repurchase approximately $150 million of Class B common stock.
Additionally, as part of our balanced capital allocation approach and as we announced yesterday, approximately $300 million of capital will be directed to the Nexstar television stations transaction, which we expect to close in the second half of this fiscal year. And in October, we closed the acquisition of a 67% stake in Credible Labs for approximately $260 million. 
And with that, I'd now like to return it back to Joe."

Look, from an advertising point of view, talk a little bit about Super Bowl in a second. But in the quarter, despite some of the comparisons that Steve mentioned in his earlier comments, advertising has been quite strong, particularly across the entertainment and sports categories. We had a very successful upfront with entertainment pricing up double digits and with sports pricing up high single digits, which we've been very pleased to achieve.
In addition to that, one of the critical goals of our upfront was also to set the WWE pricing to broadcast pricing, not cable pricing, and we did that very successfully. Categories in the market are -- a number of categories are incredibly strong. The streaming services with Disney, Netflix and Apple recently have been spending good money. The tech sector with Google, Microsoft, Amazon, very strong clients. Pharmaceutical has been strong. They've been moving some of the money between demographics, so from some money sort of out of news but on to sports and entertainment. And of course, the financial services sector, clients like GEICO, Progressive, State Farm, have also been spending good money and supporting us very well.
So we're happy with where we are. I haven't mentioned news. News pricing in the upfront was up mid-single digits. The news market as an advertising market is softer than in entertainment and in sport. We think that's because of some of the ratings deficiencies at our competitors that are -- some volume is being given away more cheaply than we would agree to. So we're finding the news market softer than sports and news.
Pacing in the -- sorry, in the quarter, our scatter pricing was up about 25%. Now there's very little scatter, so it's a good statistic. And going forward, it's lower than that but still up well above the upfront.
Which leads us to the Super Bowl. We're well ahead of last year -- obviously, we don't know last year with our competitor, but we're well ahead of our last Super Bowl where we were selling at this stage in the year. We're sold out of all of our A positions, and we have really good momentum as we continue to sell the Super Bowl. So we're very confident that the pricing will be -- I don't want to give the number, but the pricing will certainly be the highest cost per 30-second ad in any Super Bowl to date. So we're very pleased with that.
On the NFL, we don't have an update for you in terms of where we are with the negotiations. Obviously, we're engaged with the NFL every day as we broadcast their fixtures and -- but negotiations with the NFL in terms of a renewal of any of the packages has not started yet."

Good afternoon and thanks, everyone, for joining us today on Fox Corporation's 2020 First Quarter Earnings Call. Our first full fiscal year as a stand-alone public company is off to a solid start with good positive momentum across all our bus",1545,"Thanks, Joe. Good afternoon and thanks, everyone, for joining us today on Fox Corporation's 2020 First Quarter Earnings Call. Our first full fiscal year as a stand-alone public company is off to a solid start with good positive momentum across all our businesses. We have just reported strong financial results, which Steve will comment further on shortly. But perhaps more importantly, we are making significant progress on the operational goals and strategic initiatives that we outlined to you at our Investor Day.
Our strategy to build Fox around live sports, news and event programming is producing results and delivering audience growth and engagement faster than we expected. For example, we are now 6 weeks into the fall season, and Fox has established itself as both the #1 rated broadcast network and the only big 4 network to deliver year-on-year audience growth in the key 18-to-49 demographic and in total viewers. We are up 5% in 18-to-49 ratings and 10% in total viewers.
This leadership position stems from the investments we are making across our network, beginning with FOX Sports, which has accounted for 22 of the 50 most watched telecasts in the country since the NFL Kickoff. Our ratings are up 11% across our entire portfolio of college and pro football, led by Thursday night with viewership up 22%, and our Sunday broadcast, which is up 8% to a 3-year high.
Another new addition to the FOX Network was the debut of WWE's Friday Night Smackdown on October 4 to an average audience of nearly 4 million viewers. We are thrilled with our WWE partnership as it completes our strategy to program live content from Thursday through Sunday in the fall.
The momentum behind football and WWE continued into the second quarter with a solid Major League Baseball postseason, culminating with a historic 7-game World Series. Fox wins in adults 18 to 49 on 4 nights, Monday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, more nightly wins than any other network.
The success of the network extends well beyond sports, with our entertainment slate off to a great start led by 2 of the top 3 programs on television. We're pleased to be seeing such positive signs of momentum as we execute the strategy we laid out last May. Our mix of live and near-live tent-pole content mixed with high-quality entertainment is clearly paying dividends. The Masked Singer has returned for its second season as the #1 entertainment show on broadcast. And 9-1-1 is the top program on Mondays and is the #2 scripted program on all of television. And Prodigal Son is the highest-rated new broadcast program on any network this season. In fact, in entertainment programming only, Fox ranks #1 over the first 6 weeks of the season for the first time since 2011.
Speaking of #1, the FOX News network is on track to finish the calendar year as the #1 cable channel for the fourth straight year and is the #1 news channel for 18 years running. And speaking of news, our station group has continued to expand the already extraordinary amount of local news we broadcast, which positions us well for the robust political ad market we expect next year.
The real strength and value of these distinctive  brands is evidenced by the momentum we've had on the distribution and affiliate renewal front, where we remain on pace to achieve the targets we have previously outlined. We have successfully renewed distribution agreements with Charter, DISH and Cox, along with affiliate agreements with Nexstar, Gray and Tegna. In each of these renewals, we were able to achieve value that reflects the strength of our core brands.
Having said that, we have seen the rate of subscriber declines in the traditional MVPD universe escalate in recent months, with this quarter yielding industry declines of over 4%. But it is important to note that the subscriber losses reported by just one distributor, which accounts for approximately 25% of pay television subscribers, represent the majority of the net losses we experienced over the past 12 months. That distributor accounts for almost 80% of total losses over the last year. And without them, sub losses would decrease to about 1.3%, helped by strong gains from the leading DMVPDs. This is important because it suggests that it is too early to draw firm conclusions from a market that is still clearly fluid, especially in light of surging results from our leading digital partners. It is, though, something we are clearly focused on.
Another area of focus is growing the company's digital revenues and businesses. I should mention that we do not include the MVPD distribution revenue in our digital results. The reach of our direct platforms has grown to over 250 million users per month, with total engagement growing to over 11 billion minutes per month. Interestingly, we now see well above 10% of our streaming audience consuming the 4K stream with very positive feedback, and we are excited to be the first broadcaster ever to stream the Super Bowl in 4K. It will be a groundbreaking experience for fans.
Our digital strategy, inclusive of businesses like FOX Bet and Credible, is crucial to heightened engagement with our audiences, which is already driving meaningful growth. Year-over-year, digital revenue has grown over 30% in the quarter, and we continue to work to optimize our digital platforms. For the first time ever, our FOX News, FOX Business and FOX Television Stations digital properties are all now underpinned by the same tech platforms. And FOX Sports is being transitioned this quarter, enabling us to drive improved monetization across these businesses.
Of course, driving that improvement also leads us to new business models and new revenue streams. In conjunction with the kickoff of the football season, we launched the free-to-play FOX Sports Super 6 app nationally, which has already achieved nearly 1 million registered users and almost 10 million plays. The Stars Group is now live with the digital sports wagering service Fox Bet in both New Jersey and Pennsylvania.
The proposed merger between Flutter Entertainment, the owner of FanDuel, and our partner, The Stars Group, will create many opportunities for us. We're excited to develop the Fox Bet brand in partnership with FanDuel and are confident in the dual-brand strategy to capitalize on the rapidly growing sports wagering market.
Over a month ago, FOX Business debuted a brand refresh across its linear and digital platforms, including a new logo and tagline, Invested in You. As part of this initiative, FOXBusiness.com and the FOX Business app were relaunched with new content and editorial tools to drive engagement. The initial performance of the relaunched digital properties has been encouraging as we have seen substantial increases in page views and in unique users.
A core part of our strategy for FOXBusiness.com is our acquisition of Credible Labs, which closed a few weeks ago. We are now beginning the process of integrating its service with our core businesses, starting with FOX Business.
While we remain focused on executing against our operational plans, we also continue to make progress towards other strategic initiatives while maintaining a balanced approach to capital allocation. To further strengthen our portfolio of assets, yesterday, we announced an agreement with Nexstar to acquire their local television stations in the Seattle and Milwaukee markets. In return, we have agreed to sell them our stations in the Charlotte market, which geographically aligns with Nexstar's existing operations in the Carolinas and in Virginia. It's a great deal for both companies and a rare win-win. This acquisition expands the reach of one of Fox's core assets, our television stations portfolio, and further strengthens what is already a highly profitable and cash-generative business. This transaction will expand our market presence to 14 of the top 15 DMAs and importantly adds 2 major markets with NFL, Major League Baseball, Pac-12 and Big Ten teams.
Finally, consistent with the timing we laid out at our Investor Day, we have today announced that our Board of Directors has authorized a $2 billion stock repurchase program. We are pleased to have the buyback authorization formally in place as part of our capital toolkit. The company also announced its intent to complete $500 million of software purchases in the near term.
In light of all the positive momentum I have just touched upon, in light of our success at the network, at sports, at news and in our growing station group, in light of our market-leading investments in sports gaming and in the Credible marketplace and in light of the unique cash benefits of our tax structure, we believe we are undervalued in respect to our peers and to other investment opportunities available to us at this time. This buyback reflects both our confidence in the long-term strength of our business and in our commitment to finding the most efficient use of our capital. We remain committed to deploying capital in a disciplined manner to maximize shareholder value through a balanced approach of organic investment, accretive M&A and return of capital to our stockholders. We will not follow a prescribed formula of deployment. Instead, we will be opportunistic and invest capital where we feel the company can achieve the greatest return on investment.
Now Steve will provide more detail on our financial results."

We've made a solid start to fiscal 2020. And notwithstanding the subscriber headwind Lachlan just mentioned, overall, we are exceeding our internal plans that we commenced the year with. We delivered healthy top line a",1222,"Thanks, Lachlan, and good afternoon. We've made a solid start to fiscal 2020. And notwithstanding the subscriber headwind Lachlan just mentioned, overall, we are exceeding our internal plans that we commenced the year with. We delivered healthy top line and double-digit EBITDA growth in the first quarter, which sets us up well for the remainder of fiscal 2020.
Let me now take you through our results and along the way, remind you of some key factors that shape the rest of our fiscal year. In the first quarter, the company reported total revenues of $2.7 billion, up 5% over the comparative period in fiscal 2019, reflecting revenue growth across all operating segments. EBITDA was $856 million, a 12% increase over the $761 million generated in the prior year led by higher contributions from the Television and Cable segment. This growth was partially offset by higher corporate expenses reported in the other segment, which reflect the costs of Fox operating as a stand-alone public company in the current year quarter versus the presentation of carve-out financial statements in the prior year.
From a bottom line perspective, net income attributable to stockholders of $499 million or $0.80 per share was lower than the $604 million or $0.97 per share in the prior year quarter. This decrease was primarily attributable to a $115 million reduction in the unrealized gain recognized in other net related to the change in fair value of the company's investment in Roku.
Excluding this impact and other onetime items, adjusted EPS of $0.83 was up slightly over last year's $0.82 per share as our strong operating performance was largely offset by below-the-line items such as interest and tax expense, which, as we have flagged in the past, now reflect the full amounts associated with operating as a stand-alone company.
So now turning to the performance of our operating segments for the quarter, where Cable Network EBITDA of $684 million was up 8% on revenue growth of 2%. The revenue increase was led by other revenue growth of $30 million. This increase was driven by pay-per-view boxing revenues, including the Pacquiao-Thurman bout that took place on July 20, along with increased sports sublicensing revenues and subscription revenues from Fox Nation.
Cable affiliate revenues were in line with those in the prior year quarter as the impact of higher average rates across essentially all of our brands was offset by the net decrease in pay television subscribers that Lachlan mentioned earlier. Barring material changes in current subscriber trends, we anticipate a return to growth in cable affiliate revenue in the second half of the fiscal year as rate resets from recent renegotiations begin to take effect.
Cable advertising revenues decreased 4%, reflecting lower contributions from the Women's FIFA World Cup in the current year as compared to the men's tournament in the prior year, along with the absence of UFC programming at the national sports networks.
EBITDA at our Cable segment increased 8% over the prior year, reflecting the higher revenues and a 5% reduction in costs. The decrease in expenses was attributable to lower rights and production costs related to the Men's FIFA World Cup in the prior year quarter and the absence of UFC programming in the current year quarter, partially offset by contractual increases on existing sports rights agreements.
At the Television segment, EBITDA was $251 million, an increase of $80 million or 47% from the prior year quarter on the back of revenue growth of 6%. The revenue growth was led by a 14% increase in television affiliate revenues, reflecting double-digit programming fee growth from non-owned station affiliates, and double-digit direct retransmission revenue growth at our owned and operated stations. This growth is consistent with the overall TV affiliate revenue trajectory we laid out at our Investor Day in May, where we announced our expectation to deliver revenues of approximately $2.65 billion by calendar year 2022. Other revenues in the Television segment grew by $34 million driven by higher digital content licensing revenues and revenues from our recently acquired animation studio, Bento Box.
As expected, advertising revenues in the quarter decreased by $12 million or 2% as higher entertainment advertising revenues, which include the impact of the broadcast of the Emmy Awards on Fox, were more than offset by the several -- by several expected cyclical factors versus the quarter a year ago. These include the impacts of political advertising revenues at the local stations related to the 2018 midterm elections and more FIFA World Cup matches in the prior year quarter.
Television segment expenses were in line with prior year amounts as the contractual increases on existing sports rights agreements and expenses associated with the broadcast of the Emmy Awards were offset by the absence of the rights expense associated with the broadcast of the Men's FIFA World Cup in the prior year quarter.
While most of you are already aware, at this point, it is worth remembering that seasonal and cyclical factors have a particularly pronounced impact on our quarterly results in our Television segment. This will be most visible in our Q2 results with the impact of higher sports rights and production expenses at the FOX Network, reflecting the contractual annual escalators on the NFL, Major League Baseball and college football contracts and the addition of WWE rights as well as lower political advertising revenue at our local television stations when compared to the prior year. 
Finally, from a P&L perspective, the net EBITDA loss in our other segment amounted to $79 million, which reflects a full quarter of stand-alone costs as opposed to the carve-out basis of presentation in the corresponding quarter last year. These strong overall P&L results generated free cash flow, which we calculate as net cash provided by operating activities less cash invested in property, plant and equipment, of just over $160 million in this quarter. The modest rate conversion of EBITDA to free cash flow of approximately 20% reflects the typical seasonality you should expect to see in the business. Here, our first and second quarter cash flows are impacted by the working capital deficit from sports rights payments and the timing of cash collections on our earned advertising revenue, which both reverse in the second half of our fiscal year. On a full year basis, we continue to expect to benefit from natural low working capital usage along with our cash tax benefit.
From an overall balance sheet perspective, we ended the quarter with $3.3 billion in cash and $6.8 billion in debt. As Lachlan mentioned earlier, in the very near term, we will be deploying $500 million of cash on hand to the buyback of both A and B class shares. To do this, we have entered into an accelerated stock repurchase transaction to buy back $350 million of the company's Class A common stock and intend to promptly repurchase approximately $150 million of Class B common stock.
Additionally, as part of our balanced capital allocation approach and as we announced yesterday, approximately $300 million of capital will be directed to the Nexstar television stations transaction, which we expect to close in the second half of this fiscal year. And in October, we closed the acquisition of a 67% stake in Credible Labs for approximately $260 million. 
And with that, I'd now like to return it back to Joe."

Look, from an advertising point of view, talk a little bit about Super Bowl in a second. But in the quarter, despite some of the comparisons that Steve mentioned in his earlier comments, advertising has been quite strong, particularly across the entertainment and sports categories. We had a very successful upfront with entertainment pricing up double digits and with sports pricing up high single digits, which we've been very pleased to achieve.
In addition to that, one of the critical goals of our upfront was also to set the WWE pricing to broadcast pricing, not cable pricing, and we did that very successfully. Categories in the market are -- a number of categories are incredibly strong. The streaming services with Disney, Netflix and Apple recently have been spending good money. The tech sector with Google, Microsoft, Amazon, very strong clients. Pharmaceutical has been strong. They've been moving some of the money between demographics, so from some money sort of out of news but on to sports and entertainment. And of course, the financial services sector, clients like GEICO, Progressive, State Farm, have also been spending good money and supporting us very well.
So we're happy with where we are. I haven't mentioned news. News pricing in the upfront was up mid-single digits. The news market as an advertising market is softer than in entertainment and in sport. We think that's because of some of the ratings deficiencies at our competitors that are -- some volume is being given away more cheaply than we would agree to. So we're finding the news market softer than sports and news (sic) [ entertainment ].
Pacing in the -- sorry, in the quarter, our scatter pricing was up about 25%. Now there's very little scatter, so it's a good statistic. And going forward, it's lower than that but still up well above the upfront.
Which leads us to the Super Bowl. We're well ahead of last year -- obviously, we don't know last year, it was our competitor, but we're well ahead of our last Super Bowl where we were selling at this stage in the year. We're sold out of all of our A positions, and we have really good momentum as we continue to sell the Super Bowl. So we're very confident that the pricing will be -- I don't want to give the number, but the pricing will certainly be the highest cost per 30-second ad in any Super Bowl to date. So we're very pleased with that.
On the NFL, we don't have an update for you in terms of where we are with the negotiations. Obviously, we're engaged with the NFL every day as we broadcast their [ fixtures ] and -- but negotiations with the NFL in terms of a renewal of any of the packages has not started yet."

If you look at the strategy of any of these -- Fox Bet, if you look at what the strategy was in Sky, in Britain and other countries where legalized sports -- digital sports wagering has occurred, having a free-to-play game, a sort of top of the phone, to attract users is critically important. Having -- with Super 6 and the success, the very early and then rapid success of Super 6, I think, bodes very well to dropping those users down into a Fox Bet for pay game. So we're pleased with Super 6, and we're pleased with Fox Bet.
I should mention, and I didn't -- I was remiss not to mention this to -- in response to Jessica's question. Already, if you look just in the New York, New Jersey market, really for the New Jersey sports betting, there are already 13 active gaming advertisers. And so one of the reasons we're quite pleased about this liberalization of sports wagering rules state-by-state is not only do we think we'll gain tremendous long-term value through Fox Bet, but also just from an advertising point of view, we're now seeing several million dollars year-to-date already start to flow through in only the very limited number of states where sports wagering is legalized."

But then with the renegotiations that we've just done, which Lachlan outlined in his opening remarks, the rate resets that we get out of those renegotiations really begin to kick in at the start of the calendar year next year. So when you look at our first half, second half growth rate, the growth rate will absolutely be skewed to that second half, and in particular our third quarter where you'll see -- we see the benefit of those rate resets really kicking in. Again, it will be skewed towards retransmission growth as against cable affiliate. But we feel pretty comfortable where we are for the full year and also that $2.65 billion target for calendar '22."

Good afternoon and thanks, everyone, for joining us today on Fox Corporation's 2020 First Quarter Earnings Call. Our first full fiscal year as a stand-alone public company is off to a solid start with good positive momentum across all our bus",1545,"Thanks, Joe. Good afternoon and thanks, everyone, for joining us today on Fox Corporation's 2020 First Quarter Earnings Call. Our first full fiscal year as a stand-alone public company is off to a solid start with good positive momentum across all our businesses. We have just reported strong financial results, which Steve will comment further on shortly. But perhaps more importantly, we are making significant progress on the operational goals and strategic initiatives that we outlined to you at our Investor Day.
Our strategy to build Fox around live sports, news and event programming is producing results and delivering audience growth and engagement faster than we expected. For example, we are now 6 weeks into the fall season, and Fox has established itself as both the #1 rated broadcast network and the only big 4 network to deliver year-on-year audience growth in the key 18-to-49 demographic and in total viewers. We are up 5% in 18-to-49 ratings and 10% in total viewers.
This leadership position stems from the investments we are making across our network, beginning with FOX Sports, which has accounted for 22 of the 50 most watched telecasts in the country since the NFL Kickoff. Our ratings are up 11% across our entire portfolio of college and pro football, led by Thursday night with viewership up 22%, and our Sunday broadcast, which is up 8% to a 3-year high.
Another new addition to the FOX Network was the debut of WWE's Friday Night Smackdown on October 4 to an average audience of nearly 4 million viewers. We are thrilled with our WWE partnership as it completes our strategy to program live content from Thursday through Sunday in the fall.
The momentum behind football and WWE continued into the second quarter with a solid Major League Baseball postseason, culminating with a historic 7-game World Series. Fox wins in adults 18 to 49 on 4 nights, Monday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, more nightly wins than any other network.
The success of the network extends well beyond sports, with our entertainment slate off to a great start led by 2 of the top 3 programs on television. We're pleased to be seeing such positive signs of momentum as we execute the strategy we laid out last May. Our mix of live and near-live tent-pole content mixed with high-quality entertainment is clearly paying dividends. The Masked Singer has returned for its second season as the #1 entertainment show on broadcast. And 9-1-1 is the top program on Mondays and is the #2 scripted program on all of television. And Prodigal Son is the highest-rated new broadcast program on any network this season. In fact, in entertainment programming only, Fox ranks #1 over the first 6 weeks of the season for the first time since 2011.
Speaking of #1, the FOX News network is on track to finish the calendar year as the #1 cable channel for the fourth straight year and is the #1 news channel for 18 years running. And speaking of news, our station group has continued to expand the already extraordinary amount of local news we broadcast, which positions us well for the robust political ad market we expect next year.
The real strength and value of these distinctive  brands is evidenced by the momentum we've had on the distribution and affiliate renewal front, where we remain on pace to achieve the targets we have previously outlined. We have successfully renewed distribution agreements with Charter, DISH and Cox, along with affiliate agreements with Nexstar, Gray and Tegna. In each of these renewals, we were able to achieve value that reflects the strength of our core brands.
Having said that, we have seen the rate of subscriber declines in the traditional MVPD universe escalate in recent months, with this quarter yielding industry declines of over 4%. But it is important to note that the subscriber losses reported by just one distributor, which accounts for approximately 25% of pay television subscribers, represent the majority of the net losses we experienced over the past 12 months. That distributor accounts for almost 80% of total losses over the last year. And without them, sub losses would decrease to about 1.3%, helped by strong gains from the leading DMVPDs. This is important because it suggests that it is too early to draw firm conclusions from a market that is still clearly fluid, especially in light of surging results from our leading digital partners. It is, though, something we are clearly focused on.
Another area of focus is growing the company's digital revenues and businesses. I should mention that we do not include the MVPD distribution revenue in our digital results. The reach of our direct platforms has grown to over 250 million users per month, with total engagement growing to over 11 billion minutes per month. Interestingly, we now see well above 10% of our streaming audience consuming the 4K stream with very positive feedback, and we are excited to be the first broadcaster ever to stream the Super Bowl in 4K. It will be a groundbreaking experience for fans.
Our digital strategy, inclusive of businesses like FOX Bet and Credible, is crucial to heightened engagement with our audiences, which is already driving meaningful growth. Year-over-year, digital revenue has grown over 30% in the quarter, and we continue to work to optimize our digital platforms. For the first time ever, our FOX News, FOX Business and FOX Television Stations digital properties are all now underpinned by the same tech platforms. And FOX Sports is being transitioned this quarter, enabling us to drive improved monetization across these businesses.
Of course, driving that improvement also leads us to new business models and new revenue streams. In conjunction with the kickoff of the football season, we launched the free-to-play FOX Sports Super 6 app nationally, which has already achieved nearly 1 million registered users and almost 10 million plays. The Stars Group is now live with the digital sports wagering service Fox Bet in both New Jersey and Pennsylvania.
The proposed merger between Flutter Entertainment, the owner of FanDuel, and our partner, The Stars Group, will create many opportunities for us. We're excited to develop the Fox Bet brand in partnership with FanDuel and are confident in the dual-brand strategy to capitalize on the rapidly growing sports wagering market.
Over a month ago, FOX Business debuted a brand refresh across its linear and digital platforms, including a new logo and tagline, Invested in You. As part of this initiative, FOXBusiness.com and the FOX Business app were relaunched with new content and editorial tools to drive engagement. The initial performance of the relaunched digital properties has been encouraging as we have seen substantial increases in page views and in unique users.
A core part of our strategy for FOXBusiness.com is our acquisition of Credible Labs, which closed a few weeks ago. We are now beginning the process of integrating its service with our core businesses, starting with FOX Business.
While we remain focused on executing against our operational plans, we also continue to make progress towards other strategic initiatives while maintaining a balanced approach to capital allocation. To further strengthen our portfolio of assets, yesterday, we announced an agreement with Nexstar to acquire their local television stations in the Seattle and Milwaukee markets. In return, we have agreed to sell them our stations in the Charlotte market, which geographically aligns with Nexstar's existing operations in the Carolinas and in Virginia. It's a great deal for both companies and a rare win-win. This acquisition expands the reach of one of Fox's core assets, our television stations portfolio, and further strengthens what is already a highly profitable and cash-generative business. This transaction will expand our market presence to 14 of the top 15 DMAs and importantly adds 2 major markets with NFL, Major League Baseball, Pac-12 and Big Ten teams.
Finally, consistent with the timing we laid out at our Investor Day, we have today announced that our Board of Directors has authorized a $2 billion stock repurchase program. We are pleased to have the buyback authorization formally in place as part of our capital toolkit. The company also announced its intent to complete $500 million of software purchases in the near term.
In light of all the positive momentum I have just touched upon, in light of our success at the network, at sports, at news and in our growing station group, in light of our market-leading investments in sports gaming and in the Credible marketplace and in light of the unique cash benefits of our tax structure, we believe we are undervalued in respect to our peers and to other investment opportunities available to us at this time. This buyback reflects both our confidence in the long-term strength of our business and in our commitment to finding the most efficient use of our capital. We remain committed to deploying capital in a disciplined manner to maximize shareholder value through a balanced approach of organic investment, accretive M&A and return of capital to our stockholders. We will not follow a prescribed formula of deployment. Instead, we will be opportunistic and invest capital where we feel the company can achieve the greatest return on investment.
Now Steve will provide more detail on our financial results."

We've made a solid start to fiscal 2020. And notwithstanding the subscriber headwind Lachlan just mentioned, overall, we are exceeding our internal plans that we commenced the year with. We delivered healthy top line a",1222,"Thanks, Lachlan, and good afternoon. We've made a solid start to fiscal 2020. And notwithstanding the subscriber headwind Lachlan just mentioned, overall, we are exceeding our internal plans that we commenced the year with. We delivered healthy top line and double-digit EBITDA growth in the first quarter, which sets us up well for the remainder of fiscal 2020.
Let me now take you through our results and along the way, remind you of some key factors that shape the rest of our fiscal year. In the first quarter, the company reported total revenues of $2.7 billion, up 5% over the comparative period in fiscal 2019, reflecting revenue growth across all operating segments. EBITDA was $856 million, a 12% increase over the $761 million generated in the prior year led by higher contributions from the Television and Cable segment. This growth was partially offset by higher corporate expenses reported in the other segment, which reflect the costs of Fox operating as a stand-alone public company in the current year quarter versus the presentation of carve-out financial statements in the prior year.
From a bottom line perspective, net income attributable to stockholders of $499 million or $0.80 per share was lower than the $604 million or $0.97 per share in the prior year quarter. This decrease was primarily attributable to a $115 million reduction in the unrealized gain recognized in other net related to the change in fair value of the company's investment in Roku.
Excluding this impact and other onetime items, adjusted EPS of $0.83 was up slightly over last year's $0.82 per share as our strong operating performance was largely offset by below-the-line items such as interest and tax expense, which, as we have flagged in the past, now reflect the full amounts associated with operating as a stand-alone company.
So now turning to the performance of our operating segments for the quarter, where Cable Network EBITDA of $684 million was up 8% on revenue growth of 2%. The revenue increase was led by other revenue growth of $30 million. This increase was driven by pay-per-view boxing revenues, including the Pacquiao-Thurman bout that took place on July 20, along with increased sports sublicensing revenues and subscription revenues from Fox Nation.
Cable affiliate revenues were in line with those in the prior year quarter as the impact of higher average rates across essentially all of our brands was offset by the net decrease in pay television subscribers that Lachlan mentioned earlier. Barring material changes in current subscriber trends, we anticipate a return to growth in cable affiliate revenue in the second half of the fiscal year as rate resets from recent renegotiations begin to take effect.
Cable advertising revenues decreased 4%, reflecting lower contributions from the Women's FIFA World Cup in the current year as compared to the men's tournament in the prior year, along with the absence of UFC programming at the national sports networks.
EBITDA at our Cable segment increased 8% over the prior year, reflecting the higher revenues and a 5% reduction in costs. The decrease in expenses was attributable to lower rights and production costs related to the Men's FIFA World Cup in the prior year quarter and the absence of UFC programming in the current year quarter, partially offset by contractual increases on existing sports rights agreements.
At the Television segment, EBITDA was $251 million, an increase of $80 million or 47% from the prior year quarter on the back of revenue growth of 6%. The revenue growth was led by a 14% increase in television affiliate revenues, reflecting double-digit programming fee growth from non-owned station affiliates, and double-digit direct retransmission revenue growth at our owned and operated stations. This growth is consistent with the overall TV affiliate revenue trajectory we laid out at our Investor Day in May, where we announced our expectation to deliver revenues of approximately $2.65 billion by calendar year 2022. Other revenues in the Television segment grew by $34 million driven by higher digital content licensing revenues and revenues from our recently acquired animation studio, Bento Box.
As expected, advertising revenues in the quarter decreased by $12 million or 2% as higher entertainment advertising revenues, which include the impact of the broadcast of the Emmy Awards on Fox, were more than offset by the several -- by several expected cyclical factors versus the quarter a year ago. These include the impacts of political advertising revenues at the local stations related to the 2018 midterm elections and more FIFA World Cup matches in the prior year quarter.
Television segment expenses were in line with prior year amounts as the contractual increases on existing sports rights agreements and expenses associated with the broadcast of the Emmy Awards were offset by the absence of the rights expense associated with the broadcast of the Men's FIFA World Cup in the prior year quarter.
While most of you are already aware, at this point, it is worth remembering that seasonal and cyclical factors have a particularly pronounced impact on our quarterly results in our Television segment. This will be most visible in our Q2 results with the impact of higher sports rights and production expenses at the FOX Network, reflecting the contractual annual escalators on the NFL, Major League Baseball and college football contracts and the addition of WWE rights as well as lower political advertising revenue at our local television stations when compared to the prior year. 
Finally, from a P&L perspective, the net EBITDA loss in our other segment amounted to $79 million, which reflects a full quarter of stand-alone costs as opposed to the carve-out basis of presentation in the corresponding quarter last year. These strong overall P&L results generated free cash flow, which we calculate as net cash provided by operating activities less cash invested in property, plant and equipment, of just over $160 million in this quarter. The modest rate conversion of EBITDA to free cash flow of approximately 20% reflects the typical seasonality you should expect to see in the business. Here, our first and second quarter cash flows are impacted by the working capital deficit from sports rights payments and the timing of cash collections on our earned advertising revenue, which both reverse in the second half of our fiscal year. On a full year basis, we continue to expect to benefit from natural low working capital usage along with our cash tax benefit.
From an overall balance sheet perspective, we ended the quarter with $3.3 billion in cash and $6.8 billion in debt. As Lachlan mentioned earlier, in the very near term, we will be deploying $500 million of cash on hand to the buyback of both A and B class shares. To do this, we have entered into an accelerated stock repurchase transaction to buy back $350 million of the company's Class A common stock and intend to promptly repurchase approximately $150 million of Class B common stock.
Additionally, as part of our balanced capital allocation approach and as we announced yesterday, approximately $300 million of capital will be directed to the Nexstar television stations transaction, which we expect to close in the second half of this fiscal year. And in October, we closed the acquisition of a 67% stake in Credible Labs for approximately $260 million. 
And with that, I'd now like to return it back to Joe."

In addition to that, one of the critical goals of our upfront was also to set the WWE pricing to broadcast pricing, not cable pricing, and we did that very successfully. Categories in the market are -- a number of categories are incredibly strong. The streaming services with Disney, Netflix and Apple recently have been spending good money. The tech sector with Google, Microsoft, Amazon, very strong clients. Pharmaceutical has been strong. They've been moving some of the money between demographics, so from some money sort of out of news but on to sports and entertainment. And of course, the financial services sector, clients like GEICO, Progressive, State Farm, have also been spending good money and supporting us very well.
So we're happy with where we are. I haven't mentioned news. News pricing in the upfront was up mid-single digits. The news market as an advertising market is softer than in entertainment and in sport. We think that's because of some of the ratings deficiencies at our competitors that are -- some volume is being given away more cheaply than we would agree to. So we're finding the news market softer than sports and news (sic) [ entertainment ].
Pacing in the -- sorry, in the quarter, our scatter pricing was up about 25%. Now there's very little scatter, so it's a good statistic. And going forward, it's lower than that but still up well above the upfront.
Which leads us to the Super Bowl. We're well ahead of last year -- obviously, we don't know last year, it was our competitor, but we're well ahead of our last Super Bowl where we were selling at this stage in the year. We're sold out of all of our A positions, and we have really good momentum as we continue to sell the Super Bowl. So we're very confident that the pricing will be -- I don't want to give the number, but the pricing will certainly be the highest cost per 30-second ad in any Super Bowl to date. So we're very pleased with that.
On the NFL, we don't have an update for you in terms of where we are with the negotiations. Obviously, we're engaged with the NFL every day as we broadcast their [ fixtures ] and -- but negotiations with the NFL in terms of a renewal of any of the packages has not started yet."

Already, if you look just in the New York, New Jersey market, really for the New Jersey sports betting, there are already 13 active gaming advertisers. And so one of the reasons we're quite pleased about this liberalization of sports wagering rules state-by-state is not only do we think we'll gain tremendous long-term value through Fox Bet, but also just from an advertising point of view, we're now seeing several million dollars year-to-date already start to flow through in only the very limited number of states where sports wagering is legalized."

Good afternoon and thanks, everyone, for joining us today on Fox Corporation's 2020 First Quarter Earnings Call. Our first full fiscal year as a stand-alone public company is off to a solid start with good positive momentum across all our bus",1545,"Thanks, Joe. Good afternoon and thanks, everyone, for joining us today on Fox Corporation's 2020 First Quarter Earnings Call. Our first full fiscal year as a stand-alone public company is off to a solid start with good positive momentum across all our businesses. We have just reported strong financial results, which Steve will comment further on shortly. But perhaps more importantly, we are making significant progress on the operational goals and strategic initiatives that we outlined to you at our Investor Day.
Our strategy to build Fox around live sports, news and event programming is producing results and delivering audience growth and engagement faster than we expected. For example, we are now 6 weeks into the fall season, and Fox has established itself as both the #1 rated broadcast network and the only big 4 network to deliver year-on-year audience growth in the key 18-to-49 demographic and in total viewers. We are up 5% in 18-to-49 ratings and 10% in total viewers.
This leadership position stems from the investments we are making across our network, beginning with FOX Sports, which has accounted for 22 of the 50 most watched telecasts in the country since the NFL Kickoff. Our ratings are up 11% across our entire portfolio of college and pro football, led by Thursday night with viewership up 22%, and our Sunday broadcast, which is up 8% to a 3-year high.
Another new addition to the FOX Network was the debut of WWE's Friday Night Smackdown on October 4 to an average audience of nearly 4 million viewers. We are thrilled with our WWE partnership as it completes our strategy to program live content from Thursday through Sunday in the fall.
The momentum behind football and WWE continued into the second quarter with a solid Major League Baseball postseason, culminating with a historic 7-game World Series. Fox wins in adults 18 to 49 on 4 nights, Monday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, more nightly wins than any other network.
The success of the network extends well beyond sports, with our entertainment slate off to a great start led by 2 of the top 3 programs on television. We're pleased to be seeing such positive signs of momentum as we execute the strategy we laid out last May. Our mix of live and near-live tent-pole content mixed with high-quality entertainment is clearly paying dividends. The Masked Singer has returned for its second season as the #1 entertainment show on broadcast. And 9-1-1 is the top program on Mondays and is the #2 scripted program on all of television. And Prodigal Son is the highest-rated new broadcast program on any network this season. In fact, in entertainment programming only, Fox ranks #1 over the first 6 weeks of the season for the first time since 2011.
Speaking of #1, the FOX News network is on track to finish the calendar year as the #1 cable channel for the fourth straight year and is the #1 news channel for 18 years running. And speaking of news, our station group has continued to expand the already extraordinary amount of local news we broadcast, which positions us well for the robust political ad market we expect next year.
The real strength and value of these distinctive  brands is evidenced by the momentum we've had on the distribution and affiliate renewal front, where we remain on pace to achieve the targets we have previously outlined. We have successfully renewed distribution agreements with Charter, DISH and Cox, along with affiliate agreements with Nexstar, Gray and Tegna. In each of these renewals, we were able to achieve value that reflects the strength of our core brands.
Having said that, we have seen the rate of subscriber declines in the traditional MVPD universe escalate in recent months, with this quarter yielding industry declines of over 4%. But it is important to note that the subscriber losses reported by just one distributor, which accounts for approximately 25% of pay television subscribers, represent the majority of the net losses we experienced over the past 12 months. That distributor accounts for almost 80% of total losses over the last year. And without them, sub losses would decrease to about 1.3%, helped by strong gains from the leading DMVPDs. This is important because it suggests that it is too early to draw firm conclusions from a market that is still clearly fluid, especially in light of surging results from our leading digital partners. It is, though, something we are clearly focused on.
Another area of focus is growing the company's digital revenues and businesses. I should mention that we do not include the MVPD distribution revenue in our digital results. The reach of our direct platforms has grown to over 250 million users per month, with total engagement growing to over 11 billion minutes per month. Interestingly, we now see well above 10% of our streaming audience consuming the 4K stream with very positive feedback, and we are excited to be the first broadcaster ever to stream the Super Bowl in 4K. It will be a groundbreaking experience for fans.
Our digital strategy, inclusive of businesses like FOX Bet and Credible, is crucial to heightened engagement with our audiences, which is already driving meaningful growth. Year-over-year, digital revenue has grown over 30% in the quarter, and we continue to work to optimize our digital platforms. For the first time ever, our FOX News, FOX Business and FOX Television Stations digital properties are all now underpinned by the same tech platforms. And FOX Sports is being transitioned this quarter, enabling us to drive improved monetization across these businesses.
Of course, driving that improvement also leads us to new business models and new revenue streams. In conjunction with the kickoff of the football season, we launched the free-to-play FOX Sports Super 6 app nationally, which has already achieved nearly 1 million registered users and almost 10 million plays. The Stars Group is now live with the digital sports wagering service Fox Bet in both New Jersey and Pennsylvania.
The proposed merger between Flutter Entertainment, the owner of FanDuel, and our partner, The Stars Group, will create many opportunities for us. We're excited to develop the Fox Bet brand in partnership with FanDuel and are confident in the dual-brand strategy to capitalize on the rapidly growing sports wagering market.
Over a month ago, FOX Business debuted a brand refresh across its linear and digital platforms, including a new logo and tagline, Invested in You. As part of this initiative, FOXBusiness.com and the FOX Business app were relaunched with new content and editorial tools to drive engagement. The initial performance of the relaunched digital properties has been encouraging as we have seen substantial increases in page views and in unique users.
A core part of our strategy for FOXBusiness.com is our acquisition of Credible Labs, which closed a few weeks ago. We are now beginning the process of integrating its service with our core businesses, starting with FOX Business.
While we remain focused on executing against our operational plans, we also continue to make progress towards other strategic initiatives while maintaining a balanced approach to capital allocation. To further strengthen our portfolio of assets, yesterday, we announced an agreement with Nexstar to acquire their local television stations in the Seattle and Milwaukee markets. In return, we have agreed to sell them our stations in the Charlotte market, which geographically aligns with Nexstar's existing operations in the Carolinas and in Virginia. It's a great deal for both companies and a rare win-win. This acquisition expands the reach of one of Fox's core assets, our television stations portfolio, and further strengthens what is already a highly profitable and cash-generative business. This transaction will expand our market presence to 14 of the top 15 DMAs and importantly adds 2 major markets with NFL, Major League Baseball, Pac-12 and Big Ten teams.
Finally, consistent with the timing we laid out at our Investor Day, we have today announced that our Board of Directors has authorized a $2 billion stock repurchase program. We are pleased to have the buyback authorization formally in place as part of our capital toolkit. The company also announced its intent to complete $500 million of software purchases in the near term.
In light of all the positive momentum I have just touched upon, in light of our success at the network, at sports, at news and in our growing station group, in light of our market-leading investments in sports gaming and in the Credible marketplace and in light of the unique cash benefits of our tax structure, we believe we are undervalued in respect to our peers and to other investment opportunities available to us at this time. This buyback reflects both our confidence in the long-term strength of our business and in our commitment to finding the most efficient use of our capital. We remain committed to deploying capital in a disciplined manner to maximize shareholder value through a balanced approach of organic investment, accretive M&A and return of capital to our stockholders. We will not follow a prescribed formula of deployment. Instead, we will be opportunistic and invest capital where we feel the company can achieve the greatest return on investment.
Now Steve will provide more detail on our financial results."

And notwithstanding the subscriber headwind Lachlan just mentioned, overall, we are exceeding our internal plans that we commenced the year with. We delivered healthy top line and double-digit EBITDA growth in the first quarter, which sets us up well for the remainder of fiscal 2020.
Let me now take you through our results and along the way, remind you of some key factors that shape the rest of our fiscal year. In the first quarter, the company reported total revenues of $2.7 billion, up 5% over the comparative period in fiscal 2019, reflecting revenue growth across all operating segments. EBITDA was $856 million, a 12% increase over the $761 million generated in the prior year led by higher contributions from the Television and Cable segment. This growth was partially offset by higher corporate expenses reported in the other segment, which reflect the costs of Fox operating as a stand-alone public company in the current year quarter versus the presentation of carve-out financial statements in the prior year.
From a bottom line perspective, net income attributable to stockholders of $499 million or $0.80 per share was lower than the $604 million or $0.97 per share in the prior year quarter. This decrease was primarily attributable to a $115 million reduction in the unrealized gain recognized in other net related to the change in fair value of the company's investment in Roku.
Excluding this impact and other onetime items, adjusted EPS of $0.83 was up slightly over last year's $0.82 per share as our strong operating performance was largely offset by below-the-line items such as interest and tax expense, which, as we have flagged in the past, now reflect the full amounts associated with operating as a stand-alone company.
So now turning to the performance of our operating segments for the quarter, where Cable Network EBITDA of $684 million was up 8% on revenue growth of 2%. The revenue increase was led by other revenue growth of $30 million. This increase was driven by pay-per-view boxing revenues, including the Pacquiao-Thurman bout that took place on July 20, along with increased sports sublicensing revenues and subscription revenues from Fox Nation.
Cable affiliate revenues were in line with those in the prior year quarter as the impact of higher average rates across essentially all of our brands was offset by the net decrease in pay television subscribers that Lachlan mentioned earlier. Barring material changes in current subscriber trends, we anticipate a return to growth in cable affiliate revenue in the second half of the fiscal year as rate resets from recent renegotiations begin to take effect.
Cable advertising revenues decreased 4%, reflecting lower contributions from the Women's FIFA World Cup in the current year as compared to the men's tournament in the prior year, along with the absence of UFC programming at the national sports networks.
EBITDA at our Cable segment increased 8% over the prior year, reflecting the higher revenues and a 5% reduction in costs. The decrease in expenses was attributable to lower rights and production costs related to the Men's FIFA World Cup in the prior year quarter and the absence of UFC programming in the current year quarter, partially offset by contractual increases on existing sports rights agreements.
At the Television segment, EBITDA was $251 million, an increase of $80 million or 47% from the prior year quarter on the back of revenue growth of 6%. The revenue growth was led by a 14% increase in television affiliate revenues, reflecting double-digit programming fee growth from non-owned station affiliates, and double-digit direct retransmission revenue growth at our owned and operated stations. This growth is consistent with the overall TV affiliate revenue trajectory we laid out at our Investor Day in May, where we announced our expectation to deliver revenues of approximately $2.65 billion by calendar year 2022. Other revenues in the Television segment grew by $34 million driven by higher digital content licensing revenues and revenues from our recently acquired animation studio, Bento Box.
As expected, advertising revenues in the quarter decreased by $12 million or 2% as higher entertainment advertising revenues, which include the impact of the broadcast of the Emmy Awards on Fox, were more than offset by the several -- by several expected cyclical factors versus the quarter a year ago. These include the impacts of political advertising revenues at the local stations related to the 2018 midterm elections and more FIFA World Cup matches in the prior year quarter.
Television segment expenses were in line with prior year amounts as the contractual increases on existing sports rights agreements and expenses associated with the broadcast of the Emmy Awards were offset by the absence of the rights expense associated with the broadcast of the Men's FIFA World Cup in the prior year quarter.
While most of you are already aware, at this point, it is worth remembering that seasonal and cyclical factors have a particularly pronounced impact on our quarterly results in our Television segment. This will be most visible in our Q2 results with the impact of higher sports rights and production expenses at the FOX Network, reflecting the contractual annual escalators on the NFL, Major League Baseball and college football contracts and the addition of WWE rights as well as lower political advertising revenue at our local television stations when compared to the prior year. 
Finally, from a P&L perspective, the net EBITDA loss in our other segment amounted to $79 million, which reflects a full quarter of stand-alone costs as opposed to the carve-out basis of presentation in the corresponding quarter last year. These strong overall P&L results generated free cash flow, which we calculate as net cash provided by operating activities less cash invested in property, plant and equipment, of just over $160 million in this quarter. The modest rate conversion of EBITDA to free cash flow of approximately 20% reflects the typical seasonality you should expect to see in the business. Here, our first and second quarter cash flows are impacted by the working capital deficit from sports rights payments and the timing of cash collections on our earned advertising revenue, which both reverse in the second half of our fiscal year. On a full year basis, we continue to expect to benefit from natural low working capital usage along with our cash tax benefit.
From an overall balance sheet perspective, we ended the quarter with $3.3 billion in cash and $6.8 billion in debt. As Lachlan mentioned earlier, in the very near term, we will be deploying $500 million of cash on hand to the buyback of both A and B class shares. To do this, we have entered into an accelerated stock repurchase transaction to buy back $350 million of the company's Class A common stock and intend to promptly repurchase approximately $150 million of Class B common stock.
Additionally, as part of our balanced capital allocation approach and as we announced yesterday, approximately $300 million of capital will be directed to the Nexstar television stations transaction, which we expect to close in the second half of this fiscal year. And in October, we closed the acquisition of a 67% stake in Credible Labs for approximately $260 million. 
And with that, I'd now like to return it back to Joe."

Look, from an advertising point of view, talk a little bit about Super Bowl in a second. But in the quarter, despite some of the comparisons that Steve mentioned in his earlier comments, advertising has been quite strong, particularly across the entertainment and sports categories. We had a very successful upfront with entertainment pricing up double digits and with sports pricing up high single digits, which we've been very pleased to achieve.
In addition to that, one of the critical goals of our upfront was also to set the WWE pricing to broadcast pricing, not cable pricing, and we did that very successfully. Categories in the market are -- a number of categories are incredibly strong. The streaming services with Disney, Netflix and Apple recently have been spending good money. The tech sector with Google, Microsoft, Amazon, very strong clients. Pharmaceutical has been strong. They've been moving some of the money between demographics, so from some money sort of out of news but on to sports and entertainment. And of course, the financial services sector, clients like GEICO, Progressive, State Farm, have also been spending good money and supporting us very well.
So we're happy with where we are. I haven't mentioned news. News pricing in the upfront was up mid-single digits. The news market as an advertising market is softer than in entertainment and in sport. We think that's because of some of the ratings deficiencies at our competitors that are -- some volume is being given away more cheaply than we would agree to. So we're finding the news market softer than sports and news (sic) [ entertainment ].
Pacing in the -- sorry, in the quarter, our scatter pricing was up about 25%. Now there's very little scatter, so it's a good statistic. And going forward, it's lower than that but still up well above the upfront.
Which leads us to the Super Bowl. We're well ahead of last year -- obviously, we don't know last year, it was our competitor, but we're well ahead of our last Super Bowl where we were selling at this stage in the year. We're sold out of all of our A positions, and we have really good momentum as we continue to sell the Super Bowl. So we're very confident that the pricing will be -- I don't want to give the number, but the pricing will certainly be the highest cost per 30-second ad in any Super Bowl to date. So we're very pleased with that.
On the NFL, we don't have an update for you in terms of where we are with the negotiations. Obviously, we're engaged with the NFL every day as we broadcast their [ fixtures ] and -- but negotiations with the NFL in terms of a renewal of any of the packages has not started yet."
