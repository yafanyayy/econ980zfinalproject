Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. 2018 was another excellent year for our company. I'm happy to share our financial results with you today. Our 2018 financial results did benefit from higher sales due to more extreme temperatures than normal. Our non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.17 include [ a $0.06 ] net benefit from temperatures. When we normalize for temperature, our adjusted earnings per share of $2.11 is 6% above last year's as shown on Slide 2. 
2018 was a fifth year in a row that we achieved 5% to 7% earnings per share growth and increased our dividend by at least 6%. I'm also reaffirming our 2019 earnings guidance midpoint of $2.24 per share and our long-term earnings growth guidance of 5% to 7% be based of our 2018 temperature-normalized results.
Our long-term growth guidance through 2022 is supported by our capital expenditure plan, modest sales growth, constructive regulatory outcomes and assumes normal temperatures.
Now on March 1, we plan to file our first future test year rate reviews in Iowa. For electric customers, a 2018 test year will be used for interim rates and a 2020 future test year for final rates. For gas customers, the review will be based only on the 2020 future test year. Under Iowa statutes, we much within 10 months. Therefore, we expect final orders in both the electric and gas reviews by year-end. 
As I shared with you previously, the electric rate review will include recovery of our significant investments in wind energy, enhancements to our distribution network and upgrades to customer service technologies.
Interim rates based on the 2018 test year will also include and measurable rate base additions that occur by the end of the first quarter. 
Since the English Farms and Upland Prairie windfarms are expected to be in service in late March, interim electric rates will be effected on April 1, so those projects can be included. will see the benefits of reduced fuel cost and PTCs from the windfarms concurrent with the implementation of interim rates.
We'll also be requesting modifications to simplify our rates and to reduce the huge variance in summer and winter pricing that has frustrated our customers for decades. We'll also be proposing new product offerings for customers interested in partnering with us in their renewable energy efforts. And we're requesting a renewable energy writer, which would allow recovery of new investments to renewable energy when they are placed in service if that project has already received advanced ratemaking approval. 
While the base rate increased and benefits from lower fuel costs and PTCs will vary already by customer class, the overall net impact on the electric customer bills will be in the low to mid-single digits. Further details will be available after the filing is made next week.
I must acknowledge that our financial and operational results are achieved through the hard work and dedication of my employees. These employees privately serve customers each and every day and safely restore service no matter the conditions. This past year brought many challenging days, including dealing with major flooding, blizzards, ice storms, tornadoes and extreme temperatures. And during the recent I'm pleased to report our system held up well and our employees were able to maintain gas and electric system integrity and reliability. From the of our customers and investors, I would like to thank all of our employees for providing excellent service even in the toughest conditions.
Now to summarize. I'm very pleased with our 2018 accomplishments, and our team is committed to again delivering on our financial and operational goals for 2019. We have a great track record and will continue to deliver results as we focus on the following: completing our large construction projects on time and out of the low budget in a very sustainable and safe manner; advancing affordable and clear energy through substantial investments in wind; construction of West Riverside Energy Center and additional fossil plant retirements; delivering on 5% to 7% earnings growth guidance; and a 60% to 70% common dividend payout target. And we'll continue to manage the company to strike a balance between capital investment, operational and financial discipline and cost impact to customers.
Before I turn the call over to John, I'd like to congratulate him on being my successor effective July 1. I'm so proud of what have been accomplished at Alliant Energy in my 7 years as CEO, and I know that under John's leadership, the company will continue to thrive. Congratulations, John. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to John to provide updates on several of our key strategic priorities."

My thanks as well for your thoughtful leadership and the strong relationship you've developed across our company, industry and investor community.

My thanks as well for your thoughtful leadership and the strong relationship you've developed across our company, industry and investor community. We wish you all the best as you transition into a well-deserved retirement.
Good morning, everyone. 2018 was a solid year for Alliant Energy, both financially and operationally. Pat provided a great overview of our key accomplishments. Our focus my comments on key operational achievements, and Robert will address financial outcomes and regulatory matters. I'm pleased to report that our investments in renewables, natural gas and grid operations are resulting in improved reliability and lower carbon intensity. Our fossil fuel generation capacity factors and grid reliability improved by nearly 10% compared to our 5-year average. And most importantly, our 2018 safety performance improved significantly compared to the previous year.
Our focus will be to continue making the necessary investments to deliver safe, reliable and cleaner energy to our customers. We began the transition of our generation portfolio through a greener and more efficiently nearly a decade ago. This transition started with the retirements of our smaller less efficient fossil fuel generation stations and the start of our utility-owned wind additions. In 2016, the Iowa Utility Board approved the first 500 of our 1,000-megawatt planned wind additions in Iowa, and in 2018, the remaining 500 megawatts was approved. Of the 1000 megawatts of approved new Iowa wind, we are on track to bring 470 megawatts into service next month and the remaining 530 megawatts in 2020.
In Wisconsin, we're making great progress on our 730-megawatt West Riverside Energy Center. This highly efficient natural gas resource is over 70% complete and expected to go into service by the end of this year. In 2018, we advanced renewable energy in Wisconsin with the Public Service Commission in Wisconsin approval to purchase 55 megawatts of the Forward Energy Wind Center and the approval to construct a 150-megawatt wind farm in Iowa. We continue to power what's next as we advance our clean energy vision.
In 2018, we installed environmental controls to generating stations, we 480 megawatts of capacity and advanced decommissioning efforts at 4 facilities in our Iowa business. We now have permanently retired approximately 30% of our fossil fuel generation capacity since 2005. And by 2050, we will eliminate all existing coal from our energy mix.
Once facilities are decommissioned, we're restoring and redeveloping the land, rail guards, pollinator habitats and transfer solar panels are just some of the ways that we are sustainably reducing. A great example of this is in Beloit, Wisconsin. This year Beloit College will open their powerhouse facility. The college is repurposing our decommissioned black mark generating station into a state-of-the-art student center. These are just a few examples of how we're putting our core value of act for tomorrow into practice. Thank you for your interest in Alliant Energy. I will the call over to Rob."

As we closed out National Engineers Week, I'd like to begin my remarks by taking a moment to recognize Pat, John and the more than 350 other engineers at Alliant Energy for their contributions to our company's past, present and future success. Alliant Energy engineers have been at the center of virtually every major project in our company and their skills and expertise enable us to improve the lives of our customers. Thank you.
Yesterday, we announced 2018 non-GAAP earnings of $2.17 per share compared to $1.93 per share in 2017. The key drivers for the $0.24 increase were higher margins from increasing rate base, the net temperature impact on retail electric and gas sales and higher allowance for funds used during construction. These items were closely offset by higher depreciation expense.
We provided additional details on the earnings variance drivers for the year on Slides 3 and 4.
In 2018, temperatures in our service territory increased Alliant Energy's retail electric and gas margins by approximately $0.11 per share. Due to WPL's earnings sharing mechanism, we've reserved a higher margins resulting from the temperature impacts at WPL and will give those back to our Wisconsin retail customers in the future. In addition, Alliant Energy's performance pay is based on earnings. As a result, a portion of the higher earnings from the temperature impacts will be offset by higher performance pay expense. Therefore, the 2018 temperature impacts, net of reserves for WPL's earnings sharing mechanism and additional performance pay expense, are estimated to be a $0.06 per share increase in earnings.
Our consolidated 2019 earnings guidance range continues to be $2.17 per share to $2.31 per share. Our walk from the midpoint to the 2018 non-GAAP temperature-normalized EPS to the midpoint of the 2019 earnings guidance range are shown on Slide 5. 
The key drivers of the 6% growth in EPS are related to investments in our core utility business, including WPL's West Riverside Energy Center and our wind expansion program in Iowa. These investments were reflected in WPL's approved electric rates for 2019 and will be reflected in IPL's electric interim rates following our retail electric rate filing next month. 
Slide 6 has been to assist you in modeling the effective tax rates for our 2 utilities in our consolidated group. We estimate a consolidated effective tax rate of 11% for 2019.
We continue to focus on controlling costs for our customers. In Wisconsin, we created electric and gas customer bills by approximately $40 million in 2018 for current year tax savings generated by Federal Tax Reform. Going forward, we expect to hold electric and gas base rates flat for the next 2 years by using fuel savings and excess deferred taxes resulting from Federal Tax Reform to offset the cost of utility investments, including bringing our new highly efficient West Riverside Energy Center into service at the end of this year. 
We've made significant progress for our Iowa customers as well. In 2018, we generated almost [ $50 million ] of tax savings from Federal Tax Reform, and we're giving to our electric and gas customers. We also negotiated reduced transportation rates for coal deliveries, lowered energy efficiency charges beginning in 2019 and advocated for a lower independent adder charge by our transmission service provider. All help in reduced expenses for our customers.
In December 2018, the Iowa Utilities Board approved the agreement to terminate the Energy Center purchase power agreement with early, which will begin serving our customers' money in 2021. 
Lastly, as we bring on in the service our plan to wind projects in 2019 and 2020, we expect production tax credit and lower fuel expenses to largely offset the impact of increases in rate base from these wind projects.
Moving to our financing plans. Our 2019 plan remains unchanged from the plan we shared last November, including issuing up to $400 million of new common equity. $370 million of this equity was price to equity agreement executed in December 2018. We expect to sell those equity agreements over the next 6 months to fund capital expenditures for our 2 utilities. The remaining $25 million will be issued during 2019 through our standard program. 
In 2019, we also plan to issue up to $600 million long-term debt at IPL and up to $400 million of long-term debt at WPL. For 2019, financing plan is driven by the robust capital expenditure plans for our utilities, regulatory decisions on delivering tax reform benefits to our customers and the approved increase in WPL's common equity percentage by PSCW. These 2019 financing plans support our objective of maintaining capital structures at our 2 utilities, consistent with their most recent regulatory decisions. We will adjust the financing plan if market conditions warrant and as our external financing needs are reassessed.
Lastly, we included our regulatory initiatives note on Slide 7. These regulatory initiatives are important components of our operational and financial goals for 2019. 
We very much appreciate your continued interest in our company. 
At this time, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session."

2018 was another excellent year for our company. I'm happy to share our financial results with you today. Our 2018 financial results did benefit from higher sales due to more extreme temperatures than normal. Our non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.17 include a $0.06 net benefit from temperatures. When we normalize for temperature, our adjusted earnings per share of $2.11 is 6% above last year's as shown on Slide 2. 
2018 was a fifth year in a row that we achieved at least 5% to 7% earnings per share growth and increased our dividend by at least 6%. I'm also reaffirming our 2019 earnings guidance midpoint of $2.24 per share and our long-term earnings growth guidance of 5% to 7% re-based off our 2018 temperature-normalized results.
Our long-term growth guidance through 2022 is supported by our capital expenditure plan, modest sales growth, constructive regulatory outcomes and assumes normal temperatures.  
Now on March 1, we plan to file our first future test year rate reviews in Iowa. For electric customers, a 2018 test year will be used for interim rates and a 2020 future test year for final rates. For gas customers, review will be based only on the 2020 future test year. Under Iowa statutes, rate reviews must generally be decided within 10 months. Therefore, we expect final orders in both the electric and gas reviews by year-end. 
As I shared with you previously, the electric rate review will include recovery of our significant investments in wind energy, enhancements to our distribution network and upgrades to customer service technologies.
Interim rates based on the 2018 test year will also include known and measurable rate base additions that occur by the end of the first quarter. 
Since the English Farms and Upland Prairie Wind Farms are expected to be in service in late March, interim electric rates will be effective on April 1, so those projects can be included. Customers will receive the benefits of reduced fuel cost and PTCs from the wind farms concurrent with the implementation of interim rates.
We will also be requesting modifications to simplify our rates and to reduce the huge variance in summer and winter pricing that has frustrated our customers for decades. We will also be proposing new product offerings for customers interested in partnering with us in their renewable energy efforts. And we're requesting a renewable energy writer, which would allow recovery of new investments in renewable energy when they are placed in service if that project has already received advanced ratemaking approval. 
While the base rate increase and the benefits from lower fuel costs and PTCs will vary by customer class, the overall net impact on electric customer bills will be in the low- to mid-single digits. Further details will be available after the filing is made next week.
I must acknowledge that our financial and operational results are achieved through the hard work and dedication of my several employees. These employees proudly serve customers each and every day and safely restore service no matter the conditions. This past year brought many challenging days, including dealing with major flooding, blizzards, ice storms, tornadoes and extreme temperatures. And during the recent polar vortex, I'm pleased to report that our system held up well and our employees were able to maintain gas and electric system integrity and reliability. 
So on behalf of our customers and investors, I'd like to thank all of our employees for providing excellent service even in the toughest conditions.  
Now to summarize, I'm very pleased with our 2018 accomplishments, and our team is committed to again deliver on our financial and operational goals for 2019. We have a great track record and will continue to deliver results as we focus on the following: completing our large construction projects on time and at below budget in a very sustainable and safe manner; advancing affordable and clear energy through substantial investments in wind; construction of our West Riverside Energy Center and additional fossil plant retirements; delivering on 5% to 7% earnings growth guidance; and a 60% to 70% common dividend payout target. And we will continue to manage the company to strike a balance between capital investment, operational and financial discipline and cost impact to customers.
Before I turn the call over to John, I would like to congratulate him on being named my successor effective July 1. I'm so proud of what we've accomplished at Alliant Energy in my 7 years as CEO, and I know that under John's leadership, the company will continue to thrive. Congratulations, John. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to John to provide updates on several of our key strategic priorities."

My thanks as well for your thoughtful leadership and the strong relationships you've developed across our company, industry and investor community. We wish you all the best as you transition into a well-deserved retirement.Good morning,",495,"Thank you, Pat. My thanks as well for your thoughtful leadership and the strong relationships you've developed across our company, industry and investor community. We wish you all the best as you transition into a well-deserved retirement.
Good morning, everyone. 2018 was a solid year for Alliant Energy, both financially and operationally. Pat provided a great overview of our key accomplishments. I'll focus my comments on key operational achievements, and Robert will address financial outcomes and regulatory matters. I'm pleased to report that our investments in renewables, natural gas and grid operations are resulting in improved reliability and lower carbon intensity. Our fossil fuel generation capacity factors and grid reliability improved by nearly 10% compared to our 5-year average. And most importantly, our 2018 safety performance improved significantly compared to the previous year.
Our focus will be to continue making the necessary investments to deliver safe, reliable and cleaner energy to our customers. We began the transition of our generation portfolio to a greener and more efficient fleet nearly a decade ago. This transition started with the retirements of our smaller less efficient fossil fuel generation stations and the start of our utility-owned wind additions. In 2016, the Iowa Utility Board approved the first 500 of our 1,000-megawatt planned wind additions in Iowa; and in 2018, the remaining 500 megawatts was approved. Of the 1000 megawatts of approved new Iowa wind, we are on track to bring 470 megawatts into service next month and the remaining 530 megawatts in 2020.
In Wisconsin, we're making great progress on our 730-megawatt West Riverside Energy Center. This highly efficient natural gas resource is over 70% complete and expected to go into service by the end of this year. In 2018, we advanced renewable energy in Wisconsin with the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin approval to purchase 55 megawatts of the Forward Energy Wind Center and the approval to construct a 150-megawatt wind farm in Kossuth County, Iowa. We continue to power what's next as we advance our clean energy vision.
In 2018, we installed environmental controls at 2 generating stations. We tie up 480 megawatts of capacity and advanced decommissioning efforts at 4 facilities in our Iowa business. We now have permanently retired approximately 30% of our fossil fuel generation capacity since 2005. And by 2050, we will eliminate all existing coal from our energy mix.
Once facilities are decommissioned, we are restoring and redeveloping the land, rain gardens, pollinator habitats and sites for solar panels are just some of the ways that we are sustainably reusing our assets. A great example of this is in Beloit, Wisconsin. This year Beloit College will open their powerhouse facility. The college is repurposing our decommissioned Blackhawk Generating Station into a state-of-the-art student center. These are just a few examples of how we are putting our core value of act for tomorrow into practice. 
Thank you for your interest in Alliant Energy. I will now turn the call over to Robert."

As we closed out National Engineers Week!, I would like to begin my remarks by taking a moment to recognize Pat, John and the more than 350 other engineers at Alliant Energy for their contributions to our company'",863,"Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. As we closed out National Engineers Week!, I would like to begin my remarks by taking a moment to recognize Pat, John and the more than 350 other engineers at Alliant Energy for their contributions to our company's past, present and future success. Alliant Energy engineers have been at the center of virtually every major project at our company and their skills and expertise enable us to improve the lives of our customers. Thank you.
Yesterday, we announced 2018 non-GAAP earnings of $2.17 per share compared to $1.93 per share in 2017. The key drivers for the $0.24 increase were higher margins from increasing rate base, the net temperature impact on retail electric and gas sales and higher allowance for funds used during construction. These items were closely offset by higher depreciation expense.
We provided additional details on the earnings variance drivers for the year on Slides 3 and 4.
In 2018, temperatures in our service territory increased Alliant Energy's retail electric and gas margins by approximately $0.11 per share. Due to WPL's earnings sharing mechanism, we have reserved a higher margins resulting from the temperature impacts at WPL and will give those back to our Wisconsin retail customers in the future. In addition, Alliant Energy's performance pay is based on earnings. As a result, a portion of the higher earnings from the temperature impacts will be offset by higher performance pay expense. Therefore, the 2018 temperature impacts, net of reserves for WPL's earnings sharing mechanism and additional performance pay expense are estimated to be a $0.06 per share increase in earnings.
Our consolidated 2019 earnings guidance range continues to be $2.17 per share to $2.31 per share. Our walk from the midpoint of the 2018 non-GAAP temperature-normalized EPS to the midpoint of the 2019 earnings guidance range are shown on Slide 5. 
The key drivers of the 6% growth in EPS are related to investments in our core utility business, including WPL's West Riverside Energy Center and our wind expansion program in Iowa. These investments were reflected in WPL's approved electric rates for 2019 and will be reflected in IPL's electric interim rates following our retail electric rate filing next month.  
Slide 6 has been provided to assist you in modeling the effective tax rates for our 2 utilities in our consolidated group. We estimate a consolidated effective tax rate of 11% for 2019.
We continue to focus on controlling costs for our customers. In Wisconsin, we created the electric and gas customer bills by approximately $40 million in 2018 for current year tax savings generated by Federal Tax Reform. Going forward, we expect to hold electric and gas base rates flat for the next 2 years by using fuel savings and excess deferred taxes resulting from Federal Tax Reform to offset the cost of utility investments, including bringing our new highly efficient West Riverside Energy Center into service at the end of this year. 
We have made significant progress for our Iowa customers as well. In 2018, we generated almost $50 million of tax savings from Federal Tax Reform that we're giving to our electric and gas customers. We also negotiated reduced transportation rates for coal deliveries, lowered energy efficiency charges beginning in 2019 and advocated for a lower independent adder charge by our transmission service provider, all helping reduced expenses for our customers.
In December 2018, the Iowa Utilities Board approved the agreement to terminate the Duane Arnold Energy Center purchase power agreement with NextEra early, which will begin serving our customers' money in 2021. 
Lastly, as we bring on into service our planned wind projects in 2019 and 2020, we expect production tax credits and lower fuel expenses to largely offset the impact of increases in rate base from these wind project.
Moving to our financing plans. Our 2019 plan remains unchanged from the plan we shared last November, including issuing up to $400 million of new common equity. $370 million of this equity was price to equity forward agreement executed in December 2018. We expect to settle those equity forward agreements over the next 6 months to fund capital expenditures for our 2 utilities. The remaining $25 million will be issued ratably during 2019 through our share redirect program. 
In 2019, we also plan to issue up to $600 million of long-term debt at IPL and up to $400 million of long-term debt at WPL. The 2019 financing plan is driven by the robust capital expenditure plans for our utilities, regulatory decisions on delivering tax reform benefits to our customers and the approved increase in WPL's common equity percentage by PSCW. These 2019 financing plans support our objective of maintaining capital structures at our 2 utilities, consistent with their most recent regulatory decision. We will adjust the financing plan if market conditions warrant and as our external financing needs are reassessed.
Lastly, we've included our regulatory initiatives note on Slide 7. These regulatory initiatives are important components of our operational and financial goals for 2019. 
We very much appreciate your continued interest in our company. 
At this time, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session."

2018 was another excellent year for our company. I'm happy to share our financial results with you today. Our 2018 financial results did benefit from higher sales due to more extreme temperatures than normal. Our non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.17 include a $0.06 net benefit from temperatures. When we normalize for temperature, our adjusted earnings per share of $2.11 is 6% above last year's as shown on Slide 2. 
2018 was a fifth year in a row that we achieved at least 5% to 7% earnings per share growth and increased our dividend by at least 6%. I'm also reaffirming our 2019 earnings guidance midpoint of $2.24 per share and our long-term earnings growth guidance of 5% to 7% re-based off our 2018 temperature-normalized results.
Our long-term growth guidance through 2022 is supported by our capital expenditure plan, modest sales growth, constructive regulatory outcomes and assumes normal temperatures.  
Now on March 1, we plan to file our first future test year rate reviews in Iowa. For electric customers, a 2018 test year will be used for interim rates and a 2020 future test year for final rates. For gas customers, review will be based only on the 2020 future test year. Under Iowa statutes, rate reviews must generally be decided within 10 months. Therefore, we expect final orders in both the electric and gas reviews by year-end. 
As I shared with you previously, the electric rate review will include recovery of our significant investments in wind energy, enhancements to our distribution network and upgrades to customer service technologies.
Interim rates based on the 2018 test year will also include known and measurable rate base additions that occur by the end of the first quarter. 
Since the English Farms and Upland Prairie Wind Farms are expected to be in service in late March, interim electric rates will be effective on April 1, so those projects can be included. Customers will receive the benefits of reduced fuel cost and PTCs from the wind farms concurrent with the implementation of interim rates.
We will also be requesting modifications to simplify our rates and to reduce the huge variance in summer and winter pricing that has frustrated our customers for decades. We will also be proposing new product offerings for customers interested in partnering with us in their renewable energy efforts. And we're requesting a renewable energy writer, which would allow recovery of new investments in renewable energy when they are placed in service if that project has already received advanced ratemaking approval. 
While the base rate increase and the benefits from lower fuel costs and PTCs will vary by customer class, the overall net impact on electric customer bills will be in the low- to mid-single digits. Further details will be available after the filing is made next week.
I must acknowledge that our financial and operational results are achieved through the hard work and dedication of my several employees. These employees proudly serve customers each and every day and safely restore service no matter the conditions. This past year brought many challenging days, including dealing with major flooding, blizzards, ice storms, tornadoes and extreme temperatures. And during the recent polar vortex, I'm pleased to report that our system held up well and our employees were able to maintain gas and electric system integrity and reliability. 
So on behalf of our customers and investors, I'd like to thank all of our employees for providing excellent service even in the toughest conditions.  
Now to summarize, I'm very pleased with our 2018 accomplishments, and our team is committed to again deliver on our financial and operational goals for 2019. We have a great track record and will continue to deliver results as we focus on the following: completing our large construction projects on time and at below budget in a very sustainable and safe manner; advancing affordable and clear energy through substantial investments in wind; construction of our West Riverside Energy Center and additional fossil plant retirements; delivering on 5% to 7% earnings growth guidance; and a 60% to 70% common dividend payout target. And we will continue to manage the company to strike a balance between capital investment, operational and financial discipline and cost impact to customers.
Before I turn the call over to John, I would like to congratulate him on being named my successor effective July 1. I'm so proud of what we've accomplished at Alliant Energy in my 7 years as CEO, and I know that under John's leadership, the company will continue to thrive. Congratulations, John. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to John to provide updates on several of our key strategic priorities."

My thanks as well for your thoughtful leadership and the strong relationships you've developed across our company, industry and investor community. We wish you all the best as you transition into a well-deserved retirement.
Good morning, everyone. 2018 was a solid year for Alliant Energy, both financially and operationally. Pat provided a great overview of our key accomplishments. I'll focus my comments on key operational achievements, and Robert will address financial outcomes and regulatory matters. I'm pleased to report that our investments in renewables, natural gas and grid operations are resulting in improved reliability and lower carbon intensity. Our fossil fuel generation capacity factors and grid reliability improved by nearly 10% compared to our 5-year average. And most importantly, our 2018 safety performance improved significantly compared to the previous year.
Our focus will be to continue making the necessary investments to deliver safe, reliable and cleaner energy to our customers. We began the transition of our generation portfolio to a greener and more efficient fleet nearly a decade ago. This transition started with the retirements of our smaller less efficient fossil fuel generation stations and the start of our utility-owned wind additions. In 2016, the Iowa Utility Board approved the first 500 of our 1,000-megawatt planned wind additions in Iowa; and in 2018, the remaining 500 megawatts was approved. Of the 1000 megawatts of approved new Iowa wind, we are on track to bring 470 megawatts into service next month and the remaining 530 megawatts in 2020.
In Wisconsin, we're making great progress on our 730-megawatt West Riverside Energy Center. This highly efficient natural gas resource is over 70% complete and expected to go into service by the end of this year. In 2018, we advanced renewable energy in Wisconsin with the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin approval to purchase 55 megawatts of the Forward Energy Wind Center and the approval to construct a 150-megawatt wind farm in Kossuth County, Iowa. We continue to power what's next as we advance our clean energy vision.
In 2018, we installed environmental controls at 2 generating stations. We tie up 480 megawatts of capacity and advanced decommissioning efforts at 4 facilities in our Iowa business. We now have permanently retired approximately 30% of our fossil fuel generation capacity since 2005. And by 2050, we will eliminate all existing coal from our energy mix.
Once facilities are decommissioned, we are restoring and redeveloping the land, rain gardens, pollinator habitats and sites for solar panels are just some of the ways that we are sustainably reusing our assets. A great example of this is in Beloit, Wisconsin. This year Beloit College will open their powerhouse facility. The college is repurposing our decommissioned Blackhawk Generating Station into a state-of-the-art student center. These are just a few examples of how we are putting our core value of act for tomorrow into practice. 
Thank you for your interest in Alliant Energy. I will now turn the call over to Robert."

As we closed out National Engineers Week!, I would like to begin my remarks by taking a moment to recognize Pat, John and the more than 350 other engineers at Alliant Energy for their contributions to our company'",863,"Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. As we closed out National Engineers Week!, I would like to begin my remarks by taking a moment to recognize Pat, John and the more than 350 other engineers at Alliant Energy for their contributions to our company's past, present and future success. Alliant Energy engineers have been at the center of virtually every major project at our company and their skills and expertise enable us to improve the lives of our customers. Thank you.
Yesterday, we announced 2018 non-GAAP earnings of $2.17 per share compared to $1.93 per share in 2017. The key drivers for the $0.24 increase were higher margins from increasing rate base, the net temperature impact on retail electric and gas sales and higher allowance for funds used during construction. These items were closely offset by higher depreciation expense.
We provided additional details on the earnings variance drivers for the year on Slides 3 and 4.
In 2018, temperatures in our service territory increased Alliant Energy's retail electric and gas margins by approximately $0.11 per share. Due to WPL's earnings sharing mechanism, we have reserved a higher margins resulting from the temperature impacts at WPL and will give those back to our Wisconsin retail customers in the future. In addition, Alliant Energy's performance pay is based on earnings. As a result, a portion of the higher earnings from the temperature impacts will be offset by higher performance pay expense. Therefore, the 2018 temperature impacts, net of reserves for WPL's earnings sharing mechanism and additional performance pay expense are estimated to be a $0.06 per share increase in earnings.
Our consolidated 2019 earnings guidance range continues to be $2.17 per share to $2.31 per share. Our walk from the midpoint of the 2018 non-GAAP temperature-normalized EPS to the midpoint of the 2019 earnings guidance range are shown on Slide 5. 
The key drivers of the 6% growth in EPS are related to investments in our core utility business, including WPL's West Riverside Energy Center and our wind expansion program in Iowa. These investments were reflected in WPL's approved electric rates for 2019 and will be reflected in IPL's electric interim rates following our retail electric rate filing next month.  
Slide 6 has been provided to assist you in modeling the effective tax rates for our 2 utilities in our consolidated group. We estimate a consolidated effective tax rate of 11% for 2019.
We continue to focus on controlling costs for our customers. In Wisconsin, we created the electric and gas customer bills by approximately $40 million in 2018 for current year tax savings generated by Federal Tax Reform. Going forward, we expect to hold electric and gas base rates flat for the next 2 years by using fuel savings and excess deferred taxes resulting from Federal Tax Reform to offset the cost of utility investments, including bringing our new highly efficient West Riverside Energy Center into service at the end of this year. 
We have made significant progress for our Iowa customers as well. In 2018, we generated almost $50 million of tax savings from Federal Tax Reform that we're giving to our electric and gas customers. We also negotiated reduced transportation rates for coal deliveries, lowered energy efficiency charges beginning in 2019 and advocated for a lower independent adder charge by our transmission service provider, all helping reduced expenses for our customers.
In December 2018, the Iowa Utilities Board approved the agreement to terminate the Duane Arnold Energy Center purchase power agreement with NextEra early, which will begin serving our customers' money in 2021. 
Lastly, as we bring on into service our planned wind projects in 2019 and 2020, we expect production tax credits and lower fuel expenses to largely offset the impact of increases in rate base from these wind project.
Moving to our financing plans. Our 2019 plan remains unchanged from the plan we shared last November, including issuing up to $400 million of new common equity. $370 million of this equity was price to equity forward agreement executed in December 2018. We expect to settle those equity forward agreements over the next 6 months to fund capital expenditures for our 2 utilities. The remaining $25 million will be issued ratably during 2019 through our share redirect program. 
In 2019, we also plan to issue up to $600 million of long-term debt at IPL and up to $400 million of long-term debt at WPL. The 2019 financing plan is driven by the robust capital expenditure plans for our utilities, regulatory decisions on delivering tax reform benefits to our customers and the approved increase in WPL's common equity percentage by PSCW. These 2019 financing plans support our objective of maintaining capital structures at our 2 utilities, consistent with their most recent regulatory decision. We will adjust the financing plan if market conditions warrant and as our external financing needs are reassessed.
Lastly, we've included our regulatory initiatives note on Slide 7. These regulatory initiatives are important components of our operational and financial goals for 2019. 
We very much appreciate your continued interest in our company. 
At this time, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session."

2018 was another excellent year for our company. I'm happy to share our financial results with you today. Our 2018 financial results did benefit from higher sales due to more extreme temperatures than normal. Our non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.17 include a $0.06 net benefit from temperatures. When we normalize for temperature, our adjusted earnings per share of $2.11 is 6% above last year's as shown on Slide 2. 
2018 was a fifth year in a row that we achieved at least 5% to 7% earnings per share growth and increased our dividend by at least 6%. I'm also reaffirming our 2019 earnings guidance midpoint of $2.24 per share and our long-term earnings growth guidance of 5% to 7% re-based off our 2018 temperature-normalized results.
Our long-term growth guidance through 2022 is supported by our capital expenditure plan, modest sales growth, constructive regulatory outcomes and assumes normal temperatures. 
Now on March 1, we plan to file our first future test year rate reviews in Iowa. For electric customers, a 2018 test year will be used for interim rates and a 2020 future test year for final rates. For gas customers, review will be based only on the 2020 future test year. Under Iowa statutes, rate reviews must generally be decided within 10 months. Therefore, we expect final orders in both the electric and gas reviews by year-end. 
As I shared with you previously, the electric rate review will include recovery of our significant investments in wind energy, enhancements to our distribution network and upgrades to customer service technologies.
Interim rates based on the 2018 test year will also include known and measurable rate base additions that occur by the end of the first quarter. 
Since the English Farms and Upland Prairie Wind Farms are expected to be in service in late March, interim electric rates will be effective on April 1, so those projects can be included. Customers will receive the benefits of reduced fuel cost and PTCs from the wind farms concurrent with the implementation of interim rates.
We will also be requesting modifications to simplify our rates and to reduce the huge variance in summer and winter pricing that has frustrated our customers for decades. We will also be proposing new product offerings for customers interested in partnering with us in their renewable energy efforts. And we're requesting a renewable energy writer, which would allow recovery of new investments in renewable energy when they are placed in service if that project has already received advanced ratemaking approval. 
While the base rate increase and the benefits from lower fuel costs and PTCs will vary by customer class, the overall net impact on electric customer bills will be in the low- to mid-single digits. Further details will be available after the filing is made next week.
I must acknowledge that our financial and operational results are achieved through the hard work and dedication of my several employees. These employees proudly serve customers each and every day and safely restore service no matter the conditions. This past year brought many challenging days, including dealing with major flooding, blizzards, ice storms, tornadoes and extreme temperatures. And during the recent polar vortex, I'm pleased to report that our system held up well and our employees were able to maintain gas and electric system integrity and reliability. 
So on behalf of our customers and investors, I'd like to thank all of our employees for providing excellent service even in the toughest conditions. 
Now to summarize, I'm very pleased with our 2018 accomplishments, and our team is committed to again deliver on our financial and operational goals for 2019. We have a great track record and will continue to deliver results as we focus on the following: completing our large construction projects on time and at below budget in a very sustainable and safe manner; advancing affordable and clear energy through substantial investments in wind; construction of our West Riverside Energy Center and additional fossil plant retirements; delivering on 5% to 7% earnings growth guidance; and a 60% to 70% common dividend payout target. And we will continue to manage the company to strike a balance between capital investment, operational and financial discipline and cost impact to customers.
Before I turn the call over to John, I would like to congratulate him on being named my successor effective July 1. I'm so proud of what we've accomplished at Alliant Energy in my 7 years as CEO, and I know that under John's leadership, the company will continue to thrive. Congratulations, John. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to John to provide updates on several of our key strategic priorities."

My thanks as well for your thoughtful leadership and the strong relationships you've developed across our company, industry and investor community.

My thanks as well for your thoughtful leadership and the strong relationships you've developed across our company, industry and investor community. We wish you all the best as you transition into a well-deserved retirement.
Good morning, everyone. 2018 was a solid year for Alliant Energy, both financially and operationally. Pat provided a great overview of our key accomplishments. I'll focus my comments on key operational achievements, and Robert will address financial outcomes and regulatory matters. I'm pleased to report that our investments in renewables, natural gas and grid operations are resulting in improved reliability and lower carbon intensity. Our fossil fuel generation capacity factors and grid reliability improved by nearly 10% compared to our 5-year average. And most importantly, our 2018 safety performance improved significantly compared to the previous year.
Our focus will be to continue making the necessary investments to deliver safe, reliable and cleaner energy to our customers. We began the transition of our generation portfolio to a greener and more efficient fleet nearly a decade ago. This transition started with the retirements of our smaller less efficient fossil fuel generation stations and the start of our utility-owned wind additions. In 2016, the Iowa Utility Board approved the first 500 of our 1,000-megawatt planned wind additions in Iowa; and in 2018, the remaining 500 megawatts was approved. Of the 1000 megawatts of approved new Iowa wind, we are on track to bring 470 megawatts into service next month and the remaining 530 megawatts in 2020.
In Wisconsin, we're making great progress on our 730-megawatt West Riverside Energy Center. This highly efficient natural gas resource is over 70% complete and expected to go into service by the end of this year. In 2018, we advanced renewable energy in Wisconsin with the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin approval to purchase 55 megawatts of the Forward Energy Wind Center and the approval to construct a 150-megawatt wind farm in Kossuth County, Iowa. We continue to power what's next as we advance our clean energy vision.
In 2018, we installed environmental controls at 2 generating stations. We tie up 480 megawatts of capacity and advanced decommissioning efforts at 4 facilities in our Iowa business. We now have permanently retired approximately 30% of our fossil fuel generation capacity since 2005. And by 2050, we will eliminate all existing coal from our energy mix.
Once facilities are decommissioned, we are restoring and redeveloping the land, rain gardens, pollinator habitats and sites for solar panels are just some of the ways that we are sustainably reusing our assets. A great example of this is in Beloit, Wisconsin. This year Beloit College will open their powerhouse facility. The college is repurposing our decommissioned Blackhawk Generating Station into a state-of-the-art student center. These are just a few examples of how we are putting our core value of act for tomorrow into practice. 
Thank you for your interest in Alliant Energy. I will now turn the call over to Robert."

As we closed out National Engineers Week!, I would like to begin my remarks by taking a moment to recognize Pat, John and the more than 350 other engineers at Alliant Energy for their contributions to our company'",863,"Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. As we closed out National Engineers Week!, I would like to begin my remarks by taking a moment to recognize Pat, John and the more than 350 other engineers at Alliant Energy for their contributions to our company's past, present and future success. Alliant Energy engineers have been at the center of virtually every major project at our company and their skills and expertise enable us to improve the lives of our customers. Thank you.
Yesterday, we announced 2018 non-GAAP earnings of $2.17 per share compared to $1.93 per share in 2017. The key drivers for the $0.24 increase were higher margins from increasing rate base, the net temperature impact on retail electric and gas sales and higher allowance for funds used during construction. These items were closely offset by higher depreciation expense.
We provided additional details on the earnings variance drivers for the year on Slides 3 and 4.
In 2018, temperatures in our service territory increased Alliant Energy's retail electric and gas margins by approximately $0.11 per share. Due to WPL's earnings sharing mechanism, we have reserved a higher margins resulting from the temperature impacts at WPL and will give those back to our Wisconsin retail customers in the future. In addition, Alliant Energy's performance pay is based on earnings. As a result, a portion of the higher earnings from the temperature impacts will be offset by higher performance pay expense. Therefore, the 2018 temperature impacts, net of reserves for WPL's earnings sharing mechanism and additional performance pay expense are estimated to be a $0.06 per share increase in earnings.
Our consolidated 2019 earnings guidance range continues to be $2.17 per share to $2.31 per share. Our walk from the midpoint of the 2018 non-GAAP temperature-normalized EPS to the midpoint of the 2019 earnings guidance range are shown on Slide 5. 
The key drivers of the 6% growth in EPS are related to investments in our core utility business, including WPL's West Riverside Energy Center and our wind expansion program in Iowa. These investments were reflected in WPL's approved electric rates for 2019 and will be reflected in IPL's electric interim rates following our retail electric rate filing next month. 
Slide 6 has been provided to assist you in modeling the effective tax rates for our 2 utilities in our consolidated group. We estimate a consolidated effective tax rate of 11% for 2019.
We continue to focus on controlling costs for our customers. In Wisconsin, we created the electric and gas customer bills by approximately $40 million in 2018 for current year tax savings generated by Federal Tax Reform. Going forward, we expect to hold electric and gas base rates flat for the next 2 years by using fuel savings and excess deferred taxes resulting from Federal Tax Reform to offset the cost of utility investments, including bringing our new highly efficient West Riverside Energy Center into service at the end of this year. 
We have made significant progress for our Iowa customers as well. In 2018, we generated almost $50 million of tax savings from Federal Tax Reform that we're giving to our electric and gas customers. We also negotiated reduced transportation rates for coal deliveries, lowered energy efficiency charges beginning in 2019 and advocated for a lower independent adder charge by our transmission service provider, all helping reduced expenses for our customers.
In December 2018, the Iowa Utilities Board approved the agreement to terminate the Duane Arnold Energy Center purchase power agreement with NextEra early, which will begin serving our customers' money in 2021. 
Lastly, as we bring on into service our planned wind projects in 2019 and 2020, we expect production tax credits and lower fuel expenses to largely offset the impact of increases in rate base from these wind project.
Moving to our financing plans. Our 2019 plan remains unchanged from the plan we shared last November, including issuing up to $400 million of new common equity. $370 million of this equity was price to equity forward agreement executed in December 2018. We expect to settle those equity forward agreements over the next 6 months to fund capital expenditures for our 2 utilities. The remaining $25 million will be issued ratably during 2019 through our share redirect program. 
In 2019, we also plan to issue up to $600 million of long-term debt at IPL and up to $400 million of long-term debt at WPL. The 2019 financing plan is driven by the robust capital expenditure plans for our utilities, regulatory decisions on delivering tax reform benefits to our customers and the approved increase in WPL's common equity percentage by PSCW. These 2019 financing plans support our objective of maintaining capital structures at our 2 utilities, consistent with their most recent regulatory decision. We will adjust the financing plan if market conditions warrant and as our external financing needs are reassessed.
Lastly, we've included our regulatory initiatives note on Slide 7. These regulatory initiatives are important components of our operational and financial goals for 2019. 
We very much appreciate your continued interest in our company. 
At this time, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session."

I'm pleased to share with you our first quarter 2019 results and highlight progress to date on key strategic priorities. We had a solid start to the year. Our first quarter results were in line with our expectations, with an additional $0.05 per share benefit from higher sales due to colder and normal temperatures. With these results, we're well positioned to deliver on our 2019 earnings guidance range of $2.17 to $2.31 per share.
In the first quarter, we also achieved a major milestone accelerating our progress to a cleaner energy with our English Farms and Upland Prairie Wind Farms been placed in service in late March. 
As you're well aware electric gas in Iowa on March 1, with the electric effective on April 1. This was the first time that included a forward-looking The electric increased includes recovery of the significant investments in our English Farms and Upland Prairie Wind Farms, enhancements to our distribution network and upgrades to customer service technologies. 
A large portion of this increase has been offset from the benefits of PTCs and reduced fee cost from the new wind farms.
As part of the electric filing, we requested a Renewable Energy Writer, which a preapproved investments in renewable energy when they're placed in service. If approved, this writer will reduce the likelihood of 2021 seeking full recovery of our next group of wind farms. The gas customers based only on the 2020 future test year, so for gas were not necessary. 
This requested base rate increase will be offset by reduced energy efficiency cost and lower forecast of natural gas process.
Under Iowa statute, rate generally be decided within 10 months. Therefore, we expect final orders in both the electric and gas reviews by year-end.

We continue to make great progress as we transition to a more efficient, modern and balance energy portfolio. In March, we achieved another major milestone when we placed 470 megawatts of wind into service for our Iowa customers. These 2 new wind farms, Upland Prairie and English Farms, were on schedule and below budget, containing our long track record of meeting or exceeding expectations established when we request construction authority from our regulators. 
And we're on track to install an additional 530 megawatts of new wind for Iowa customers in 2020. This added wind will complete the 1,000 megawatts of renewable investment approved by the Iowa Utilities Board. Construction is going well, and we plan to begin the turbine installation phase next month.
Our wind resources performed as expected in the first quarter, achieving an average capacity factor of 36%. Our new wind farms are expected to keep even higher capacity factors and provide energy production nearly 25% higher than existing. Wind energy brings many customer benefits, including reduced fuel cost, lower and local payments that support the royal communities we have the privilege to serve.
Another major milestone in the first quarter was the completion of a selective catalytic reduction system at our generating station in Iowa. This environmental improvement project supports compliance obligations under the cost pollution and advances our objective of improving overall intermissions. 
This project also represents the last planned control system for our fleet. As we continue to transition our energy mix, we're making great progress on the new West Riverside Energy Center located near Beloit, Wisconsin. This 730-megawatt highly efficient natural gas resource is over 80% complete and expected to go into service by the end of this year. 
The project is on track to be completed on time and on budget.  We're committed to providing reliable, economical energy in a sustainable manner. In addition to achieving on time and below budget project execution, we're advancing our environmental value to sustainable construction practices. I'm very pleased to report that the institute for Sustainable Infrastructure awarded our Upland Prairie and English Farm projects Gold Envision Certifications. This certification recognizes our commitment to environmental stewardship and our collaboration with local communities and landowners. 
I'm also pleased to share that we were notified that 2 of our recently added generating facilities, the Marshalltown combined cycle natural gas facility our solar project are 2 of 3 finalists for the innovation and sustainable engineering award that will be awarded at the international conference on sustainable infrastructure this fall. 
To be eligible for consideration, projects much demonstrate adherence to the principles of economic, social and environmental sustainability. It's an honor to be recognized for our sustainability efforts.
I thank you for your interest in Alliant Energy, and we'll now turn the call over to Robert."

Yesterday, we announced the first quarter 2019 earnings of $0.53 per share compared to $0.52 per share in the first quarter of 2018. 
Our utilities had a higher earnings year-over-year, driven by a higher electric and gas margins from increasing rate base and higher electric and gas sales due to colder temperatures, partially offset by higher depreciation expense.
Our nonutility businesses had lower earnings year-over-year, primarily driven by timing impacts of tax reform benefits recognized in the first quarter of 2018 and higher interest expense.
We provided additional details on the earnings variance drivers for the quarter on Slide 2.
Our consolidated 2019 earnings guidance range continues to be $2.17 to $2.31 per share. The key drivers of the projected 6% growth in earnings are related to investments in our core utility business, including our wind expansion program in Iowa and WPL's West Riverside Energy Center. 
First quarter earnings were in line with our expectations. To assist with modeling, please note that the 6% projected increase in earnings for 2019 were not be recognized consistently for all 4 quarters this year, as IPS increases went into effect April 1,  earnings growth mode to the last 3 quarters.
Slide 3 has been provided to assist you in modeling the effective tax rates for our 2 utilities and our consolidated group. We estimate a consolidated effective tax rate of 11% for 2019. As we continue adding wind generation to our portfolio, the resulting additional production tax credits are expected to result in lower effective tax rate into the future.
Moving to our financing plans. Please see for details of our 2019 plan, which remains unchanged. During the first quarter, Alliant Energy issued 1.1 million shares of new common equity under its forward-equity agreements. The remaining shares under the forward-equity agreements are expected to be issued by the end of the third quarter. 
To finance our wind expansion, we've also issued our second green bond at IPL in early April. Green bonds provide investors with an opportunity to invest in renewable projects and have help to lower our overall cost of debt for our Iowa customers.
The 2019 financing plan supports our objective of maintaining capital structures at the utilities consistent with our most recent regulatory decisions. We'll adjust the financing plan if market conditions warrant and as external financing needs are reassessed.
Lastly, we've included our regulatory initiatives note on Slide 5, with 2 notable developments in the first quarter. First, IPL received approval from the Iowa Utilities Board in March to a new energy efficiency plan for calendar year's 2019 through 2023. Effective June 1, our Iowa customers will start seeing direct financial savings from the new plant. And over the next 5 years, Iowa customers are expected to see approximately $180 million of lower energy efficiency cost compared to the previous 5-year plan.
Second is the electric and gas rate reviews filed by IPL on March 1. On Slide 6, we provided the procedural schedules for the IPL retail electric and gas you may monitor the progress of these rate review proceedings throughout the year. These regulatory initiatives are important components of our overall operational and financial goals for 2019.
We appreciate your continued interest in our company. At this time, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session."

I'm pleased to share with you our first quarter 2019 results and highlight progress to date on key strategic priorities.
We had a solid start to the year. Our first quarter results were in line with our expectations with an additional $0.05 per share benefit from higher sales due to colder than normal temperatures. With these results, we're well positioned to deliver on our 2019 earnings guidance range of $2.17 to $2.31 per share.
In the first quarter, we also achieved a major milestone accelerating our progress to a cleaner energy with our English Farms and Upland Prairie Wind Farms being placed in service in late March. 
As you're well aware, we've filed our electric and gas rate reviews in Iowa on March 1, with electric interim rates effective on April 1. This was the first filing that included a forward-looking test year. The electric interim rates increase includes recovery of the significant investments in our English Farms and Upland Prairie Wind Farms, enhancement to our distribution network and upgrades to customer service technologies.
A large portion of this increase has been offset from the benefits of PTCs and reduced fuel cost from the new wind farms.
As part of the electric filing, we requested a renewable energy writer which will allow recovery of preapproved investments in renewable energy when they're placed in service. If approved, this writer would reduce the likelihood of a 2021 test year rate review, seeking full recovery of our next group of wind farms. The gas customers, the rate review is based only on the 2020 future test year, so interim rates for gas were not necessary.
This requested base rate increase will be offset by reduced energy efficiency cost and lower forecasted natural gas prices.
Under Iowa statute, rate reviews must generally be decided within 10 months. Therefore, we expect final orders in both the electric and gas reviews by year-end.
As you know, the first quarter brought very extreme weather conditions to the Midwest. Our fleet did an excellent job maintaining the reliability of our generating stations, wind farms and electric and gas distribution systems during the polar vortex.
I'd like to thank them for their dedication to excellent customer service even in the toughest winter conditions. To summarize, our team is committed to, again, delivering on our financial and operating goals. We have a great track record and will continue to deliver results as we focus on the following: to change or complete our large construction projects on time and below budget in a very sustainable and safe manner; advancing affordable and cleaner energy through substantial investments in wind, construction of the West Riverside Energy Center and enhancements to a distribution network; delivering on 5% to 7% earnings growth guidance and a 60% to 70% common dividend payout target. We'll continue to manage the company to strike a balance between capital investment, operational and financial disciplines and cost impact to customers.
In closing, I invited to participate in our second virtual only annual shareholders meeting on May 16. We look forward to expanded participation from our share owners since you can now join the meeting from any location through your computer or telephone. I hope you all can participate.
And on a personal note, it has been a pleasure working with all of you, and I greatly appreciate the support and confidence you had in me and my management team throughout the years. I'm leaving the company in very good hands with John taking over on July 1. I'm so proud of what we accomplished at Alliant Energy in my 7 years as CEO and I know that under John's leadership, the company will continue to thrive. I wish you all well, and thank you for your support of our company.

I'm pleased to share with you our first quarter 2019 results and highlight progress to date on key strategic priorities.
We had a solid start to the year. Our first quarter results were in line with our expectations with an additional $0.05 per share benefit from higher sales due to colder than normal temperatures. With these results, we're well positioned to deliver on our 2019 earnings guidance range of $2.17 to $2.31 per share.
In the first quarter, we also achieved a major milestone accelerating our progress to a cleaner energy with our English Farms and Upland Prairie Wind Farms being placed in service in late March. 
As you're well aware, we've filed our electric and gas rate reviews in Iowa on March 1, with electric interim rates effective on April 1. This was the first filing that included a forward-looking test year. The electric interim rates increase includes recovery of the significant investments in our English Farms and Upland Prairie Wind Farms, enhancement to our distribution network and upgrades to customer service technologies.
A large portion of this increase has been offset from the benefits of PTCs and reduced fuel cost from the new wind farms.
As part of the electric filing, we requested a renewable energy writer which will allow recovery of preapproved investments in renewable energy when they're placed in service. If approved, this writer would reduce the likelihood of a 2021 test year rate review, seeking full recovery of our next group of wind farms. The gas customers, the rate review is based only on the 2020 future test year, so interim rates for gas were not necessary.
This requested base rate increase will be offset by reduced energy efficiency cost and lower forecasted natural gas prices.
Under Iowa statute, rate reviews must generally be decided within 10 months. Therefore, we expect final orders in both the electric and gas reviews by year-end.
As you know, the first quarter brought very extreme weather conditions to the Midwest. Our fleet did an excellent job maintaining the reliability of our generating stations, wind farms and electric and gas distribution systems during the polar vortex.
I'd like to thank them for their dedication to excellent customer service even in the toughest winter conditions. To summarize, our team is committed to, again, delivering on our financial and operating goals. We have a great track record and will continue to deliver results as we focus on the following: to change or complete our large construction projects on time and below budget in a very sustainable and safe manner; advancing affordable and cleaner energy through substantial investments in wind, construction of the West Riverside Energy Center and enhancements to a distribution network; delivering on 5% to 7% earnings growth guidance and a 60% to 70% common dividend payout target. We'll continue to manage the company to strike a balance between capital investment, operational and financial disciplines and cost impact to customers.
In closing, I invited to participate in our second virtual only annual shareholders meeting on May 16. We look forward to expanded participation from our share owners since you can now join the meeting from any location through your computer or telephone. I hope you all can participate.
And on a personal note, it has been a pleasure working with all of you, and I greatly appreciate the support and confidence you had in me and my management team throughout the years. I'm leaving the company in very good hands with John taking over on July 1. I'm so proud of what we accomplished at Alliant Energy in my 7 years as CEO and I know that under John's leadership, the company will continue to thrive. I wish you all well, and thank you for your support of our company.
With that, I'll turn the call over to John."

But also like to thank you for your tremendous contributions and dedicated service to our employees, our customers and share owners. We're all going to miss you, and we wish you the very best in retirement.
Good morning, everyone. Pat provided a great overview of our key accomplishments in the first quarter. I will focus my comments on key operational achievements, and Robert will address the financial outcomes and regulatory matters.
We continue to make great progress as we transition to a more efficient, modern and balanced energy portfolio. In March, we achieved another major milestone when we placed 470 megawatts of wind into service for our Iowa customers. These 2 new wind farms, Upland Prairie and English Farms, were on schedule and below budget, continuing our long track record of meeting or exceeding expectations established when we request construction authority from our regulators.
And we're on track to install an additional 530 megawatts of new wind for Iowa customers in 2020. This added wind will complete the 1,000 megawatts of renewable investment approved by the Iowa Utilities Board. Construction is going well, and we plan to begin the turbine installation phase next month.
Our wind resources performed as expected in the first quarter, achieving an average capacity factor of 36%. Our new wind farms are expected to achieve even higher capacity factors and provide energy production nearly 25% higher than existing. Wind energy brings many customer benefits, including reduced fuel costs, lower air emissions and local payments that support the rural communities we have the privilege to serve.
Another major milestone in the first quarter was the completion of a selective catalytic reduction system at our Ottumwa Generating Station in Iowa. This environmental improvement project supports compliance obligations under the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule and advances our objective of improving overall air emissions.
This project also represents the last planned air emission control system for our fleet. As we continue to transition our energy mix, we're making great progress on the new West Riverside Energy Center located near Beloit, Wisconsin. This 730-megawatt highly efficient natural gas resource is over 80% complete and expected to go into service by the end of this year. 
The project is on track to be completed on time and on budget.  We're committed to providing reliable, economical energy in a sustainable manner. In addition to achieving on-time and below-budget project execution, we are advancing our environmental value through sustainable construction practices. I'm very pleased to report that the Institute for Sustainable Infrastructure awarded our Upland Prairie and English Farm projects Gold Envision Certifications. This certification recognizes our commitment to environmental stewardship and our collaboration with local communities and landowners.
I'm also pleased to share that we were notified that 2 of our recently added generating facilities, the Marshalltown combined cycle natural gas facility and our Dubuque solar project are 2 of 3 finalists for the Innovation in Sustainable Engineering Award that will be awarded at the international conference on sustainable infrastructure this fall.
To be eligible for consideration, projects much demonstrate adherence to the principles of economic, social and environmental sustainability. It's an honor to be recognized for our sustainability efforts.
I thank you for your interest in Alliant Energy, and we'll now turn the call over to Robert."

Yesterday, we announced first quarter 2019 earnings of $0.53 per share compared to $0.52 per share in the first quarter of 2018.Our utilities had higher earnings year-over-year, driven by higher electric and gas",573,"Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Yesterday, we announced first quarter 2019 earnings of $0.53 per share compared to $0.52 per share in the first quarter of 2018.
Our utilities had higher earnings year-over-year, driven by higher electric and gas margins from increasing rate base and higher electric and gas sales due to colder temperatures, partially offset by higher depreciation expense.
Our nonutility businesses had lower earnings year-over-year, primarily driven by timing impacts of tax reform benefits recognized in the first quarter of 2018 and higher interest expense.
We have provided additional details on the earnings variance drivers for the quarter on Slide 2.
Our consolidated 2019 earnings guidance range continues to be $2.17 to $2.31 per share. The key drivers of the projected 6% growth in earnings are related to investments in our core utility business, including our wind expansion program in Iowa and WPL's West Riverside Energy Center. 
First quarter earnings were in line with our expectations. To assist with modeling, please note that the 6% projected increase in earnings for 2019 will not be recognized consistently for all 4 quarters this year, as IPL's interim rate increase went into effect April 1, thus skewing the earnings growth more to the last 3 quarters.
Slide 3 has been provided to assist you in modeling the effective tax rates for our 2 utilities and our consolidated group. We estimate a consolidated effective tax rate of 11% for 2019. As we continue adding wind generation to our portfolio, the resulting additional production tax credits are expected to result in lower effective tax rates into the future.
Moving to our financing plans. Please see Slide 4 for details of our 2019 plan, which remains unchanged. During the first quarter, Alliant Energy issued 1.1 million shares of new common equity under its forward-equity agreements. The remaining shares under the forward-equity agreements are expected to be issued by the end of the third quarter.
To finance our wind expansion, we also issued our second green bond at IPL in early April. Green bonds provide investors with an opportunity to invest in renewable projects and have helped to lower our overall cost of debt for our Iowa customers.
The 2019 financing plan supports our objective of maintaining capital structures at our 2 utilities consistent with our most recent regulatory decisions. We'll adjust the financing plan if market conditions warrant and as our external financing needs are reassessed.
Lastly, we've included our regulatory initiatives of note on Slide 5, with 2 notable developments in the first quarter. First, IPL received approval from the Iowa Utilities Board in March to implement a new energy efficiency plan for calendar years 2019 through 2023. Effective June 1, our Iowa customers will start seeing direct financial savings from the new plan. And over the next 5 years, Iowa customers are expected to see approximately $180 million of lower energy efficiency cost compared to the previous 5-year plan.
Second is the electric and gas rate reviews filed by IPL on March 1. On Slide 6, we provided the procedural schedules for the IPL retail electric and gas dockets so that you may monitor the progress of these rate review proceedings throughout the year. These regulatory initiatives are important components of our overall operational and financial goals for 2019. We appreciate your continued interest in our company.
At this time, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session."

Our first quarter results were in l",649,"Thanks, Sue. Good morning, and thank you for  joining us today. I'm pleased to share with you our first quarter 2019 results and highlight progress to date on key strategic priorities.
We had a solid start to the year. Our first quarter results were in line with our expectations with an additional $0.05 per share benefit from higher sales due to colder than normal temperatures. With these results, we're well positioned to deliver on our 2019 earnings guidance range of $2.17 to $2.31 per share.
In the first quarter, we also achieved a major milestone accelerating our progress to a cleaner energy with our English Farms and Upland Prairie Wind Farms being placed in service in late March. 
As you're well aware, we've filed our electric and gas rate reviews in Iowa on March 1, with electric interim rates effective on April 1. This was the first filing that included a forward-looking test year. The electric interim rates increase includes recovery of the significant investments in our English Farms and Upland Prairie Wind Farms, enhancement to our distribution network and upgrades to customer service technologies.
A large portion of this increase has been offset from the benefits of PTCs and reduced fuel cost from the new wind farms.
As part of the electric filing, we requested a renewable energy writer which will allow recovery of preapproved investments in renewable energy when they're placed in service. If approved, this writer would reduce the likelihood of a 2021 test year rate review, seeking full recovery of our next group of wind farms. The gas customers, the rate review is based only on the 2020 future test year, so interim rates for gas were not necessary.
This requested base rate increase will be offset by reduced energy efficiency cost and lower forecasted natural gas prices.
Under Iowa statute, rate reviews must generally be decided within 10 months. Therefore, we expect final orders in both the electric and gas reviews by year-end.
As you know, the first quarter brought very extreme weather conditions to the Midwest. Our fleet did an excellent job maintaining the reliability of our generating stations, wind farms and electric and gas distribution systems during the polar vortex.
I'd like to thank them for their dedication to excellent customer service even in the toughest winter conditions. To summarize, our team is committed to, again, delivering on our financial and operating goals. We have a great track record and will continue to deliver results as we focus on the following: to change or complete our large construction projects on time and below budget in a very sustainable and safe manner; advancing affordable and cleaner energy through substantial investments in wind, construction of the West Riverside Energy Center and enhancements to a distribution network; delivering on 5% to 7% earnings growth guidance and a 60% to 70% common dividend payout target. We'll continue to manage the company to strike a balance between capital investment, operational and financial disciplines and cost impact to customers.
In closing, I invited to participate in our second virtual only annual shareholders meeting on May 16. We look forward to expanded participation from our share owners since you can now join the meeting from any location through your computer or telephone. I hope you all can participate.
And on a personal note, it has been a pleasure working with all of you, and I greatly appreciate the support and confidence you had in me and my management team throughout the years. I'm leaving the company in very good hands with John taking over on July 1. I'm so proud of what we accomplished at Alliant Energy in my 7 years as CEO and I know that under John's leadership, the company will continue to thrive. I wish you all well, and thank you for your support of our company.
With that, I'll turn the call over to John."

But also like to thank you for your tremendous contributions and dedicated service to our employees, our customers and share owners. We're all going to miss you, and we wish you the very best in retirement.
Good morning, everyone. Pat provided a great overview of our key accomplishments in the first quarter. I will focus my comments on key operational achievements, and Robert will address the financial outcomes and regulatory matters.
We continue to make great progress as we transition to a more efficient, modern and balanced energy portfolio. In March, we achieved another major milestone when we placed 470 megawatts of wind into service for our Iowa customers. These 2 new wind farms, Upland Prairie and English Farms, were on schedule and below budget, continuing our long track record of meeting or exceeding expectations established when we request construction authority from our regulators.
And we're on track to install an additional 530 megawatts of new wind for Iowa customers in 2020. This added wind will complete the 1,000 megawatts of renewable investment approved by the Iowa Utilities Board. Construction is going well, and we plan to begin the turbine installation phase next month.
Our wind resources performed as expected in the first quarter, achieving an average capacity factor of 36%. Our new wind farms are expected to achieve even higher capacity factors and provide energy production nearly 25% higher than existing. Wind energy brings many customer benefits, including reduced fuel costs, lower air emissions and local payments that support the rural communities we have the privilege to serve.
Another major milestone in the first quarter was the completion of a selective catalytic reduction system at our Ottumwa Generating Station in Iowa. This environmental improvement project supports compliance obligations under the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule and advances our objective of improving overall air emissions.
This project also represents the last planned air emission control system for our fleet. As we continue to transition our energy mix, we're making great progress on the new West Riverside Energy Center located near Beloit, Wisconsin. This 730-megawatt highly efficient natural gas resource is over 80% complete and expected to go into service by the end of this year. 
The project is on track to be completed on time and on budget.  We're committed to providing reliable, economical energy in a sustainable manner. In addition to achieving on-time and below-budget project execution, we are advancing our environmental value through sustainable construction practices. I'm very pleased to report that the Institute for Sustainable Infrastructure awarded our Upland Prairie and English Farm projects Gold Envision Certifications. This certification recognizes our commitment to environmental stewardship and our collaboration with local communities and landowners.
I'm also pleased to share that we were notified that 2 of our recently added generating facilities, the Marshalltown combined cycle natural gas facility and our Dubuque solar project are 2 of 3 finalists for the Innovation in Sustainable Engineering Award that will be awarded at the international conference on sustainable infrastructure this fall.
To be eligible for consideration, projects much demonstrate adherence to the principles of economic, social and environmental sustainability. It's an honor to be recognized for our sustainability efforts.
I thank you for your interest in Alliant Energy, and we'll now turn the call over to Robert."

Yesterday, we announced first quarter 2019 earnings of $0.53 per share compared to $0.52 per share in the first quarter of 2018.Our utilities had higher earnings year-over-year, driven by higher electric and gas",573,"Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Yesterday, we announced first quarter 2019 earnings of $0.53 per share compared to $0.52 per share in the first quarter of 2018.
Our utilities had higher earnings year-over-year, driven by higher electric and gas margins from increasing rate base and higher electric and gas sales due to colder temperatures, partially offset by higher depreciation expense.
Our nonutility businesses had lower earnings year-over-year, primarily driven by timing impacts of tax reform benefits recognized in the first quarter of 2018 and higher interest expense.
We have provided additional details on the earnings variance drivers for the quarter on Slide 2.
Our consolidated 2019 earnings guidance range continues to be $2.17 to $2.31 per share. The key drivers of the projected 6% growth in earnings are related to investments in our core utility business, including our wind expansion program in Iowa and WPL's West Riverside Energy Center. 
First quarter earnings were in line with our expectations. To assist with modeling, please note that the 6% projected increase in earnings for 2019 will not be recognized consistently for all 4 quarters this year, as IPL's interim rate increase went into effect April 1, thus skewing the earnings growth more to the last 3 quarters.
Slide 3 has been provided to assist you in modeling the effective tax rates for our 2 utilities and our consolidated group. We estimate a consolidated effective tax rate of 11% for 2019. As we continue adding wind generation to our portfolio, the resulting additional production tax credits are expected to result in lower effective tax rates into the future.
Moving to our financing plans. Please see Slide 4 for details of our 2019 plan, which remains unchanged. During the first quarter, Alliant Energy issued 1.1 million shares of new common equity under its forward-equity agreements. The remaining shares under the forward-equity agreements are expected to be issued by the end of the third quarter.
To finance our wind expansion, we also issued our second green bond at IPL in early April. Green bonds provide investors with an opportunity to invest in renewable projects and have helped to lower our overall cost of debt for our Iowa customers.
The 2019 financing plan supports our objective of maintaining capital structures at our 2 utilities consistent with our most recent regulatory decisions. We'll adjust the financing plan if market conditions warrant and as our external financing needs are reassessed.
Lastly, we've included our regulatory initiatives of note on Slide 5, with 2 notable developments in the first quarter. First, IPL received approval from the Iowa Utilities Board in March to implement a new energy efficiency plan for calendar years 2019 through 2023. Effective June 1, our Iowa customers will start seeing direct financial savings from the new plan. And over the next 5 years, Iowa customers are expected to see approximately $180 million of lower energy efficiency cost compared to the previous 5-year plan.
Second is the electric and gas rate reviews filed by IPL on March 1. On Slide 6, we provided the procedural schedules for the IPL retail electric and gas dockets so that you may monitor the progress of these rate review proceedings throughout the year. These regulatory initiatives are important components of our overall operational and financial goals for 2019. We appreciate your continued interest in our company.
At this time, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session."

I'm first going to give you the headlines of the quarter and then provide updates on several of our key strategic priorities. Robert will then provide details on our financial results and highlights of our regulatory schedule. So for the headlines. First, we delivered another solid quarter of financial and operating results. Second, we are reaffirming our earnings guidance and are trending toward delivering results in the upper half of the range. And third, we continue to execute according to plan on key strategic generation and distribution investments for our customers. We continue to make great progress as we transition to a more efficient, cleaner and balanced energy portfolio. In March, we placed 470 megawatts of wind into service for Iowa customers. The Upland Prairie and English Farm wind additions were on schedule and below budget, continuing our long track record of solid project execution. These projects were also awarded Envision Platinum Award Certification from ISI. To earn this honor, a project must demonstrate it delivers environmental, social and economic benefits to communities. The Platinum level is the highest rating possible and affirms that our investments in a clean energy future not only help us to reduce carbon emissions but are the right thing to do for our customers and communities. We'll make a nice progress with the remaining 530 megawatts of new wind for Iowa customers. This will complete IPL's total planned 1,000 megawatts of additional renewable energy by the end of 2020. Although we experienced some unfavorable weather this past spring, we've made adjustments and expect to deliver these projects on time and on budget.
Overall, our second quarter generation capacity factor was on par with our 5-year averages. While our core units are slight decrease, our gas and new wind units provided a balance with increased capacity factors. Wind energy and efficient natural gas generation bring many customer benefits, including reduced fuel costs, lower air emissions and local payments that support the world communities we have the privilege to serve. 
As we continue to transition our energy mix, we are building the new West Riverside Energy Center located near Beloit, Wisconsin. This 730-megawatt highly efficient natural gas resource is over 90% complete and is expected to be completed on time and on budget. Also, we're expanding our use of solar generation with the construction of a solar garden near our Marshalltown Generating Station, and we're well into the process for a similar solar installation at the West Riverside Center. Solar was the focus of some new tariffs recently approved by the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin. 3 new tariffs were approved that will help enable us to provide more renewable options for our customers. We're not large in size, they provide opportunities to bring tailored renewable solutions to our customers. 
And now our focus on what drives Alliant Energy's success, our work force. Many of you have heard or read about a series of devastating storms that hit our Wisconsin service territory on July 19 and 20. The storms produced 14 tornadoes, damaging straight-line winds and significant rainfall. At the peak of the storm, more than 30,000 of our customers were without power, and statewide totals were exceeding 250,000. After the storms cleared, I'm proud to share that we had 75% of our impacted customers back online within 36 hours, with those able to take power restored soon after. 
Our commitment to safety, the dedication of our teams and the strong partnerships we have with our communities and emergency response professionals are just a few of the many reasons I'm proud to lead our company as CEO.
Along with these storms, July brought with it higher temperatures, resulting in increased demand. Our estimated temperature impact on electric sales for July is $0.02 per share. I'm pleased to report that our generating fleet operated as expected during the higher temperatures, mitigating the impact of higher fuel cost for our customers. 
And finally, I'm excited to mention that next week we'll launch our 2019 Corporate Sustainability Report. This report reaffirms our commitment to provide economical energy in a sustainable manner and provides a broad view of our company's performance in the areas that are of most interest to our many stakeholders. Our everyday actions enhance the environmental, social and economic conditions of the communities we serve. We have the privilege of serving our customers for more than 100 years, and we look forward to continuing that tradition for decades to come. I encourage to review the online report and see how we're creating a better tomorrow for our customers, communities and investors. 
To summarize, our team is committed to delivering on our financial and operating goals. We have a great track record and will continue to deliver results as we focus on the following: Continuing our solid track record of project execution; completing projects on time, on budget and in a very sustainable and safe manner; advancing affordable and clean energy through smart investments in wind, solar, high-efficiency natural gas and the distribution network; consistently delivering on 5% to 7% earnings growth guidance; and 60% to 70% common dividend payout target. And we will continue to manage the company to strike a balance between capital investments, operational and financial discipline and cost impact to customers.

Yesterday, we announced second quarter 2019 earnings of $0.40 per share compared to $0.43 per share in the second quarter of 2018. Our utilities had lower earnings year-over-year, driven by lower electric and gas sales due to milder temperatures in the second quarter of 2019 and timing of income tax expense. The lower earnings were partially offset by higher revenue requirements due to increasing rate base. We have provided additional details on the earnings variance drivers for the quarter on Slide 2. 
Our consolidated 2019 earnings guidance continues to be a range between $2.17 and $2.31 per share. The key drivers of the projected 6% growth in EPS are related to investments in our core utility business, including the West Riverside Energy Center in Wisconsin and our wind expansion program in Iowa. Increasing our wind generation portfolio and operating our highly efficient natural gas generating units at higher capacity rates are resulting in lower fuel costs for our customers. 
Our second quarter production fuel and purchased power expenses dropped 20% when compared to the same period in 2018. This is just one example of how we are working to control cost for our customers. Our temperature-normalized electric sales for the first half of 2019 have been slightly lower than expected, primarily in our Iowa Utilities Industrial class. About half of the lower industrial sales in our Iowa jurisdiction are due to operations issues at some of the larger customers. Temperature-normalized retail electric sales at our Wisconsin Utility have increased over 2018 and including higher industrial sales from 2 large customers returning to normal operations after prolonged outages. 
As a reminder, industrial sales are in lower margins when compared to other retail classes. Thus, these changes in electric sales did not have a material impact to our earnings. To assist with modeling our results throughout 2019, please note that the 6% projected increase in earnings for 2019 will not be recognized consistently for all 4 quarters this year. First, the interim rate increase in Iowa went into effect in April 1, thus giving the earnings growth more than last 3 quarters. Second, our Iowa Utility has higher electric rates in the summer for mid-June through mid-September resulting in a higher proportion of earnings in the third quarter. Lastly, the timing of income tax expense recognition will result in lower earnings in the first half of the year and higher earnings in the second half of the year when compared to the quarter results in 2018. 
Slide 3 has been provided to assist you in modeling the effective tax rates for our 2 utilities and our consolidated group for the full year 2019. We estimate a consolidated effective tax rate of 11% for 2019. As we continue adding wind generation into our portfolio, the resulting additional PTCs are expected to result in lower effective tax rates for several years into the future.
Please see Slide 4 for details of our 2019 financing plan, which remains unchanged. In June, we completed the issuance of $350 million of debt at our Wisconsin Utility and used the proceeds to refinance $250 million of debt that matured in July and to reduce commercial paper outstanding. Through July, we have completed about 1/3 of the $400 million of new common equity issuances planned for 2019, largely through exercising a portion of the contracts entered into at the end of 2018. 
Lastly, we plan to issue up to $300 million of long-term debt at our Iowa Utility later this year to fund our wind expansion program in Iowa. These 2019 financing plans support our objectives of maintaining capital structures at our 2 utilities consistent with our most recent regulatory decisions. We expect to refresh our future capital expenditure plans and disclose our 2020 financing plans, including quantifying the 2020 new common equity news during our third quarter earnings call in November. 
Lastly, we've included our 2019 regulatory initiatives note on Slide 5. There have been 2 key developments to share with you since our last quarterly earnings call. First, our Wisconsin Utility filed its retail electric fuel only rate review in June to set the fuel cost monitoring level for 2020. Second, the rate reviews in Iowa continued to advance through the procedural schedules. As a reminder, we filed electric and gas rate reviews in Iowa in March and implemented electric interim rates at the beginning of the second quarter. The electric interim rate increase includes recovery of the investments in our English Farms and Upland Prairie projects, enhancements to our distribution network and upgrades to customer service technologies. Unfortunately, the increase due to these investments has been offset the benefits of PTCs and reduced fuel cost from the new wind projects being passed on to our customers beginning in April. This rate review filing also included the first forward-looking test year for Iowa Utility for 2020. 
The rate review proceeding is progressing according to plan. Yesterday, many of the 15 interveners in IPL's electric rate review proceedings filed direct testimony. We are still reviewing the details of the testimony. The Iowa Business Energy Coalition's testimony and methodology appears to generally consistent with how future test users are constructed and implied in other jurisdictions, although we have different viewpoints with some of their inputs and the end result. The officer consumer advocate in contrast has proposed a complicated and unique phased approach effectively applying future and historic elements within one test year, which we believe is inconsistent with the Iowa legislation. Interveners have raised issues with the proposed renewable energy writer, ROE and capital structure, PTC carry forwards and other topics. The viewpoints are a normal part of the rate reviews and we are generally unsurprised by the interveners position. We are proud of the investments that we've made on behalf of our customers and believe in the merits of the case that we put before the Iowa Utilities Board. We look forward to working with the interveners as the process continues. 
On Slide 6, we have provided the procedural schedules for the Iowa retail electric and gas dockets to help you monitor the progress of these rate review throughout the remainder of 2019. Under Iowa statues, rate reviews must generally be decided within 10 months. Therefore, we anticipate final orders in both the electric and gas rate reviews by year-end. We appreciate your continued interest in our company. 
At this time, I will turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session."

I'm first going to give you the headlines of the quarter and then provide updates on several of our key strategic priorities. Robert will then provide details on our financial results and highlights of our regulatory schedule. 
So for the headlines. First, we delivered another solid quarter of financial and operating results. Second, we are reaffirming our earnings guidance and are trending toward delivering results in the upper half of the range. And third, we continue to execute according to plan on key strategic generation and distribution investments for our customers. We continue to make great progress as we transition to a more efficient, cleaner and balanced energy portfolio. In March, we placed 470 megawatts of wind into service for our Iowa customers. The Upland Prairie and English Farms wind additions were on schedule and below budget, continuing our long track record of solid project execution. These projects were also awarded Envision Platinum Certification from ISI. To earn this honor, a project must demonstrate it delivers environmental, social and economic benefits to communities. The Platinum level is the highest rating possible and affirms that our investments in a clean energy future not only help us to reduce carbon emissions but are the right thing to do for our customers and communities. We make a nice progress with the remaining 530 megawatts of new wind for Iowa customers. This will complete IPL's total planned 1,000 megawatts of additional renewable energy by the end of 2020. Although we experienced some unfavorable weather this past spring, we've made adjustments and expect to deliver these projects on time and on budget.
Overall, our second quarter generation capacity factor was on par with our 5-year averages. While our coal units are a slight decrease, our gas and newer wind units provided a balance with increased capacity factors. Wind energy and efficient natural gas generation bring many customer benefits, including reduced fuel costs, lower air emissions and local payments that support the rural communities we have the privilege to serve. 
As we continue to transition our energy mix, we are building the new West Riverside Energy Center located near Beloit, Wisconsin. This 730-megawatt highly efficient natural gas resource is over 90% complete and is expected to be completed on time and on budget. Also, we're expanding our use of solar generation with the construction of a solar garden near our Marshalltown Generating Station, and we're well into the process for a similar solar installation at the West Riverside Energy Center. Solar was the focus of some new tariffs recently approved by the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin. Three new tariffs were approved that will help enable us to provide more renewable options for our customers. While not large in size, they provide opportunities to bring tailored renewable solutions to our customers. 
And now our focus on what drives Alliant Energy's success, our work force. Many of you have heard or read about a series of devastating storms that hit our Wisconsin service territory on July 19 and 20. The storms produced 14 tornadoes, damaging straight-line winds and significant rainfall. At the peak of the storm, more than 30,000 of our customers were without power, and statewide totals were exceeding 250,000. After the storms cleared, I'm proud to share that we had 75% of our impacted customers back online within 36 hours, with those able to take power restored soon after. 
Our commitment to safety, the dedication of our teams and the strong partnerships we have with our communities and emergency response professionals are just a few of the many reasons I'm proud to lead our company as CEO.
Along with these storms, July brought with it higher temperatures, resulting in increased demand. Our estimated temperature impact on electric sales for July is $0.02 per share. I'm pleased to report that our generating fleet operated as expected during the higher temperatures, mitigating the impact of higher fuel cost for our customers. 
And finally, I'm excited to mention that next week we'll launch our 2019 Corporate Sustainability Report. This report reaffirms our commitment to provide economical energy in a sustainable manner and provides a broad view of our company's performance in the areas that are of most interest to our many stakeholders. Our everyday actions enhance the environmental, social and economic conditions of the communities we serve. We've had the privilege of serving our customers for more than 100 years, and we look forward to continuing that tradition for decades to come. I encourage you to review the online report and see how we're creating a better tomorrow for our customers, communities and investors. 
To summarize, our team is committed to delivering on our financial and operating goals. We have a great track record and will continue to deliver results as we focus on the following: Continuing our solid track record of project execution; completing projects on time, on budget and in a very sustainable and safe manner; advancing affordable and clean energy through smart investments in wind, solar, high-efficiency natural gas and the distribution network; consistently delivering on 5% to 7% earnings growth guidance; and 60% to 70% common dividend payout target. And we will continue to manage the company to strike a balance between capital investments, operational and financial discipline and cost impact to customers. 
I thank you for your interest in Alliant Energy, and I'll now turn the call over to Robert."

Yesterday, we announced second quarter 2019 earnings of $0.40 per share compared to $0.43 per share in the second quarter of 2018. Our utilities had lower earnings year-over-year, driven by lower electric and gas sale",1089,"Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. Yesterday, we announced second quarter 2019 earnings of $0.40 per share compared to $0.43 per share in the second quarter of 2018. Our utilities had lower earnings year-over-year, driven by lower electric and gas sales due to milder temperatures in the second quarter of 2019 and timing of income tax expense. The lower earnings were partially offset by higher revenue requirements due to increasing rate base. We have provided additional details on the earnings variance drivers for the quarter on Slide 2. 
Our consolidated 2019 earnings guidance continues to be a range between $2.17 and $2.31 per share. The key drivers of the projected 6% growth in EPS are related to investments in our core utility business, including the West Riverside Energy Center in Wisconsin and our wind expansion program in Iowa. Increasing our wind generation portfolio and operating our highly efficient natural gas generating units at higher capacity rates are resulting in lower fuel costs for our customers. 
Our second quarter production fuel and purchased power expenses dropped 20% when compared to the same period in 2018. This is just one example of how we are working to control cost for our customers. Our temperature-normalized electric sales for the first half of 2019 have been slightly lower than expected, primarily in our Iowa utilities industrial class. About half of the lower industrial sales in our Iowa jurisdiction are due to operations issues at some of the larger customers. Temperature-normalized retail electric sales at our Wisconsin utility have increased over 2018, including higher industrial sales from 2 large customers returning to normal operations after prolonged outages. 
As a reminder, industrial sales are in lower margins when compared to other retail classes. Thus, these changes in electric sales did not have a material impact to our earnings. To assist with modeling our results throughout 2019, please note that the 6% projected increase in earnings for 2019 will not be recognized consistently for all 4 quarters this year. First, the interim rate increase in Iowa went into effect April 1, thus giving the earnings growth more to the last 3 quarters. Second, our Iowa utility has higher electric rates in the summer from mid-June through mid-September resulting in a higher proportion of earnings in the third quarter. Lastly, the timing of income tax expense recognition will result in lower earnings in the first half of the year and higher earnings in the second half of the year when compared to the quarterly results in 2018. 
Slide 3 has been provided to assist you in modeling the effective tax rates for our 2 utilities and our consolidated group for the full year 2019. We estimate a consolidated effective tax rate of 11% for 2019. As we continue adding wind generation into our portfolio, the resulting additional PTCs are expected to result in lower effective tax rates for several years into the future.
Please see Slide 4 for details of our 2019 financing plan, which remains unchanged. In June, we completed the issuance of $350 million of debt at our Wisconsin utility and used the proceeds to refinance $250 million of debt that matured in July and to reduce commercial paper outstanding. Through July, we have completed about 1/3 of the $400 million of new common equity issuances planned for 2019, largely through exercising a portion of the forward contracts entered into at the end of 2018. 
Lastly, we plan to issue up to $300 million of long-term debt at our Iowa utility later this year to fund our wind expansion program in Iowa. These 2019 financing plans support our objective of maintaining capital structures at our 2 utilities consistent with the most recent regulatory decisions. We expect to refresh our future capital expenditure plans and disclose our 2020 financing plans, including quantifying the 2020 new common equity needs during our third quarter earnings call in November. 
Lastly, we've included our 2019 regulatory initiatives note on Slide 5. There have been 2 key developments to share with you since our last quarterly earnings call. First, our Wisconsin Utility filed its retail electric fuel only rate review in June to set the fuel cost monitoring level for 2020. Second, the rate reviews in Iowa continued to advance through the procedural schedules. As a reminder, we filed electric and gas rate reviews in Iowa in March and implemented electric interim rates at the beginning of the second quarter. The electric interim rate increase includes recovery of the investments in our English Farms and Upland Prairie wind projects, enhancements to our distribution network and upgrades to customer service technologies. A portion of the increase due to these investments has been offset with the benefits of PTCs and reduced fuel cost from the new wind projects being passed on to our customers beginning in April. This rate review filing also included the first forward-looking test year for our Iowa Utility for 2020. 
The rate review proceeding is progressing according to plan. Yesterday, many of the 15 interveners in IPL's electric rate review proceedings filed direct testimony. We are still reviewing the details of the testimony. The Iowa Business Energy Coalition's testimony and methodology appears generally consistent with how future test years are constructed and implied in other jurisdictions, although we have different viewpoints with some of their inputs and the end result. The Office of Consumer Advocate in contrast has proposed a complicated and unique phased approach effectively applying future and historic elements within one test year, which we believe is inconsistent with the Iowa legislation. Interveners have raised issues with the proposed renewable energy rider, ROE and capital structure, PTC carry forwards and other topics. Divergent viewpoints are a normal part of the rate reviews, and we are generally unsurprised by the interveners position. We are proud of the investments that we've made on behalf of our customers and believe in the merits of the case that we put before the Iowa Utilities Board. We look forward to working with the interveners as the process continues. 
On Slide 6, we have provided the procedural schedules for the Iowa retail electric and gas dockets to help you monitor the progress of these rate reviews throughout the remainder of 2019. Under Iowa statutes, rate reviews must generally be decided within 10 months. Therefore, we anticipate final orders in both the electric and gas rate reviews by year-end. We appreciate your continued interest in our company. 
At this time, I will turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session."

I'm first going to give you the headlines of the quarter and then provide updates on several of our key strategic priorities. Robert will then provide details on our financial results and highlights of our regulatory schedule. 
So for the headlines. First, we delivered another solid quarter of financial and operating results. Second, we are reaffirming our earnings guidance and are trending toward delivering results in the upper half of the range. And third, we continue to execute according to plan on key strategic generation and distribution investments for our customers. We continue to make great progress as we transition to a more efficient, cleaner and balanced energy portfolio. In March, we placed 470 megawatts of wind into service for our Iowa customers. The Upland Prairie and English Farms wind additions were on schedule and below budget, continuing our long track record of solid project execution. These projects were also awarded Envision Platinum Certification from ISI. To earn this honor, a project must demonstrate it delivers environmental, social and economic benefits to communities. The Platinum level is the highest rating possible and affirms that our investments in a clean energy future not only help us to reduce carbon emissions but are the right thing to do for our customers and communities. We make a nice progress with the remaining 530 megawatts of new wind for Iowa customers. This will complete IPL's total planned 1,000 megawatts of additional renewable energy by the end of 2020. Although we experienced some unfavorable weather this past spring, we've made adjustments and expect to deliver these projects on time and on budget.
Overall, our second quarter generation capacity factor was on par with our 5-year averages. While our coal units are a slight decrease, our gas and newer wind units provided a balance with increased capacity factors. Wind energy and efficient natural gas generation bring many customer benefits, including reduced fuel costs, lower air emissions and local payments that support the rural communities we have the privilege to serve. 
As we continue to transition our energy mix, we are building the new West Riverside Energy Center located near Beloit, Wisconsin. This 730-megawatt highly efficient natural gas resource is over 90% complete and is expected to be completed on time and on budget. Also, we're expanding our use of solar generation with the construction of a solar garden near our Marshalltown Generating Station, and we're well into the process for a similar solar installation at the West Riverside Energy Center. Solar was the focus of some new tariffs recently approved by the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin. Three new tariffs were approved that will help enable us to provide more renewable options for our customers. While not large in size, they provide opportunities to bring tailored renewable solutions to our customers. 
And now I'll focus on what drives Alliant Energy's success, our work force. Many of you have heard or read about a series of devastating storms that hit our Wisconsin service territory on July 19 and 20. The storms produced 14 tornadoes, damaging straight-line winds and significant rainfall. At the peak of the storm, more than 30,000 of our customers were without power, and statewide totals were exceeding 250,000. After the storms cleared, I'm proud to share that we had 75% of our impacted customers back online within 36 hours, with those able to take power restored soon after. 
Our commitment to safety, the dedication of our teams and the strong partnerships we have with our communities and emergency response professionals are just a few of the many reasons I'm proud to lead our company as CEO.
Along with these storms, July brought with it higher temperatures, resulting in increased demand. Our estimated temperature impact on electric sales for July is $0.02 per share. I'm pleased to report that our generating fleet operated as expected during the higher temperatures, mitigating the impact of higher fuel cost for our customers. 
And finally, I'm excited to mention that next week we'll launch our 2019 Corporate Sustainability Report. This report reaffirms our commitment to provide economical energy in a sustainable manner and provides a broad view of our company's performance in the areas that are of most interest to our many stakeholders. Our everyday actions enhance the environmental, social and economic conditions of the communities we serve. We've had the privilege of serving our customers for more than 100 years, and we look forward to continuing that tradition for decades to come. I encourage you to review the online report and see how we're creating a better tomorrow for our customers, communities and investors. 
To summarize, our team is committed to delivering on our financial and operating goals. We have a great track record and will continue to deliver results as we focus on the following: Continuing our solid track record of project execution; completing projects on time, on budget and in a very sustainable and safe manner; advancing affordable and clean energy through smart investments in wind, solar, high-efficiency natural gas and the distribution network; consistently delivering on 5% to 7% earnings growth guidance; and 60% to 70% common dividend payout target. And we will continue to manage the company to strike a balance between capital investments, operational and financial discipline and cost impact to customers. 
I thank you for your interest in Alliant Energy, and I'll now turn the call over to Robert."

Yesterday, we announced second quarter 2019 earnings of $0.40 per share compared to $0.43 per share in the second quarter of 2018. Our utilities had lower earnings year-over-year, driven by lower electric and gas sales due to milder temperatures in the second quarter of 2019 and timing of income tax expense. The lower earnings were partially offset by higher revenue requirements due to increasing rate base. We have provided additional details on the earnings variance drivers for the quarter on Slide 2. 
Our consolidated 2019 earnings guidance continues to be a range between $2.17 and $2.31 per share. The key drivers of the projected 6% growth in EPS are related to investments in our core utility business, including the West Riverside Energy Center in Wisconsin and our wind expansion program in Iowa. Increasing our wind generation portfolio and operating our highly efficient natural gas generating units at higher capacity rates are resulting in lower fuel costs for our customers. 
Our second quarter production fuel and purchased power expenses dropped 20% when compared to the same period in 2018. This is just one example of how we are working to control cost for our customers. Our temperature-normalized electric sales for the first half of 2019 have been slightly lower than expected, primarily in our Iowa utilities industrial class. About half of the lower industrial sales in our Iowa jurisdiction are due to operations issues at some of the larger customers. Temperature-normalized retail electric sales at our Wisconsin utility have increased over 2018, including higher industrial sales from 2 large customers returning to normal operations after prolonged outages. 
As a reminder, industrial sales are in lower margins when compared to other retail classes. Thus, these changes in electric sales did not have a material impact to our earnings. To assist with modeling our results throughout 2019, please note that the 6% projected increase in earnings for 2019 will not be recognized consistently for all 4 quarters this year. First, the interim rate increase in Iowa went into effect April 1, thus giving the earnings growth more to the last 3 quarters. Second, our Iowa utility has higher electric rates in the summer from mid-June through mid-September resulting in a higher proportion of earnings in the third quarter. Lastly, the timing of income tax expense recognition will result in lower earnings in the first half of the year and higher earnings in the second half of the year when compared to the quarterly results in 2018. 
Slide 3 has been provided to assist you in modeling the effective tax rates for our 2 utilities and our consolidated group for the full year 2019. We estimate a consolidated effective tax rate of 11% for 2019. As we continue adding wind generation into our portfolio, the resulting additional PTCs are expected to result in lower effective tax rates for several years into the future.
Please see Slide 4 for details of our 2019 financing plan, which remains unchanged. In June, we completed the issuance of $350 million of debt at our Wisconsin utility and used the proceeds to refinance $250 million of debt that matured in July and to reduce commercial paper outstanding. Through July, we have completed about 1/3 of the $400 million of new common equity issuances planned for 2019, largely through exercising a portion of the forward contracts entered into at the end of 2018. 
Lastly, we plan to issue up to $300 million of long-term debt at our Iowa utility later this year to fund our wind expansion program in Iowa. These 2019 financing plans support our objective of maintaining capital structures at our 2 utilities consistent with the most recent regulatory decisions. We expect to refresh our future capital expenditure plans and disclose our 2020 financing plans, including quantifying the 2020 new common equity needs during our third quarter earnings call in November. 
Lastly, we've included our 2019 regulatory initiatives note on Slide 5. There have been 2 key developments to share with you since our last quarterly earnings call. First, our Wisconsin utility filed its retail electric fuel only rate review in June to set the fuel cost monitoring level for 2020. Second, the rate reviews in Iowa continued to advance through the procedural schedules. As a reminder, we filed electric and gas rate reviews in Iowa in March and implemented electric interim rates at the beginning of the second quarter. The electric interim rate increase includes recovery of the investments in our English Farms and Upland Prairie wind projects, enhancements to our distribution network and upgrades to customer service technologies. A portion of the increase due to these investments has been offset with the benefits of PTCs and reduced fuel cost from the new wind projects being passed on to our customers beginning in April. This rate review filing also included the first forward-looking test year for our Iowa Utility for 2020. 
The rate review proceeding is progressing according to plan. Yesterday, many of the 15 interveners in IPL's electric rate review proceedings filed direct testimony. We are still reviewing the details of the testimony. The Iowa Business Energy Coalition's testimony and methodology appears generally consistent with how future test years are constructed and implied in other jurisdictions, although we have different viewpoints with some of their inputs and the end result. The Office of Consumer Advocate in contrast has proposed a complicated and unique phased approach effectively applying future and historic elements within 1 test year, which we believe is inconsistent with the Iowa legislation. Interveners have raised issues with the proposed renewable energy rider, ROE and capital structure, PTC carryforwards and other topics. Divergent viewpoints are a normal part of the rate reviews, and we are generally unsurprised by the interveners' position. We are proud of the investments that we've made on behalf of our customers and believe in the merits of the case that we put before the Iowa Utilities Board. We look forward to working with the interveners as the process continues. 
On Slide 6, we have provided the procedural schedules for the Iowa retail electric and gas dockets to help you monitor the progress of these rate reviews throughout the remainder of 2019. Under Iowa statutes, rate reviews must generally be decided within 10 months. Therefore, we anticipate final orders in both the electric and gas rate reviews by year-end. We appreciate your continued interest in our company. 
At this time, I will turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session."

I'm first going to give you the headlines of the quarter and then provide updates on several of our key strategic priorities. Robert will then provide details on our financial results and highlights of our regulatory schedule. 
So for the headlines. First, we delivered another solid quarter of financial and operating results. Second, we are reaffirming our earnings guidance and are trending toward delivering results in the upper half of the range. And third, we continue to execute according to plan on key strategic generation and distribution investments for our customers. We continue to make great progress as we transition to a more efficient, cleaner and balanced energy portfolio. In March, we placed 470 megawatts of wind into service for our Iowa customers. The Upland Prairie and English Farms wind additions were on schedule and below budget, continuing our long track record of solid project execution. 
These projects were also awarded Envision Platinum Certification from ISI. To earn this honor, a project must demonstrate it delivers environmental, social and economic benefits to communities. The Platinum level is the highest rating possible and affirms that our investments in a clean energy future not only help us to reduce carbon emissions but are the right thing to do for our customers and communities. We make a nice progress with the remaining 530 megawatts of new wind for Iowa customers. This will complete IPL's total planned 1,000 megawatts of additional renewable energy by the end of 2020. Although we experienced some unfavorable weather this past spring, we've made adjustments and expect to deliver these projects on time and on budget.
Overall, our second quarter generation capacity factor was on par with our 5-year averages. While our coal units are a slight decrease, our gas and newer wind units provided a balance with increased capacity factors. Wind energy and efficient natural gas generation bring many customer benefits, including reduced fuel costs, lower air emissions and local payments that support the rural communities we have the privilege to serve. 
As we continue to transition our energy mix, we are building the new West Riverside Energy Center located near Beloit, Wisconsin. This 730-megawatt highly efficient natural gas resource is over 90% complete and is expected to be completed on time and on budget. Also, we're expanding our use of solar generation with the construction of a solar garden near our Marshalltown Generating Station, and we're well into the process for a similar solar installation at the West Riverside Energy Center. Solar was the focus of some new tariffs recently approved by the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin. Three new tariffs were approved that will help enable us to provide more renewable options for our customers. While not large in size, they provide opportunities to bring tailored renewable solutions to our customers. 
And now I'll focus on what drives Alliant Energy's success, our work force. Many of you have heard or read about a series of devastating storms that hit our Wisconsin service territory on July 19 and 20. The storms produced 14 tornadoes, damaging straight-line winds and significant rainfall. At the peak of the storm, more than 30,000 of our customers were without power, and statewide totals were exceeding 250,000. After the storms cleared, I'm proud to share that we had 75% of our impacted customers back online within 36 hours, with those able to take power restored soon after. 
Our commitment to safety, the dedication of our teams and the strong partnerships we have with our communities and emergency response professionals are just a few of the many reasons I'm proud to lead our company as CEO.
Along with these storms, July brought with it higher temperatures, resulting in increased demand. Our estimated temperature impact on electric sales for July is $0.02 per share. I'm pleased to report that our generating fleet operated as expected during the higher temperatures, mitigating the impact of higher fuel cost for our customers. 
And finally, I'm excited to mention that next week we'll launch our 2019 Corporate Sustainability Report. This report reaffirms our commitment to provide economical energy in a sustainable manner and provides a broad view of our company's performance in the areas that are of most interest to our many stakeholders. Our everyday actions enhance the environmental, social and economic conditions of the communities we serve. We've had the privilege of serving our customers for more than 100 years, and we look forward to continuing that tradition for decades to come. I encourage you to review the online report and see how we're creating a better tomorrow for our customers, communities and investors. 
To summarize, our team is committed to delivering on our financial and operating goals. We have a great track record and will continue to deliver results as we focus on the following: Continuing our solid track record of project execution; completing projects on time, on budget and in a very sustainable and safe manner; advancing affordable and clean energy through smart investments in wind, solar, high-efficiency natural gas and the distribution network; consistently delivering on 5% to 7% earnings growth guidance; and 60% to 70% common dividend payout target. And we will continue to manage the company to strike a balance between capital investments, operational and financial discipline and cost impact to customers.

Yesterday, we announced second quarter 2019 earnings of $0.40 per share compared to $0.43 per share in the second quarter of 2018. Our utilities had lower earnings year-over-year, driven by lower electric and gas sale",1088,"Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. Yesterday, we announced second quarter 2019 earnings of $0.40 per share compared to $0.43 per share in the second quarter of 2018. Our utilities had lower earnings year-over-year, driven by lower electric and gas sales due to milder temperatures in the second quarter of 2019 and timing of income tax expense. The lower earnings were partially offset by higher revenue requirements due to increasing rate base. We have provided additional details on the earnings variance drivers for the quarter on Slide 2. 
Our consolidated 2019 earnings guidance continues to be a range between $2.17 and $2.31 per share. The key drivers of the projected 6% growth in EPS are related to investments in our core utility business, including the West Riverside Energy Center in Wisconsin and our wind expansion program in Iowa. Increasing our wind generation portfolio and operating our highly efficient natural gas generating units at higher capacity rates are resulting in lower fuel costs for our customers. 
Our second quarter production fuel and purchased power expenses dropped 20% when compared to the same period in 2018. This is just one example of how we are working to control cost for our customers. Our temperature-normalized electric sales for the first half of 2019 have been slightly lower than expected, primarily in our Iowa utilities industrial class. About half of the lower industrial sales in our Iowa jurisdiction are due to operations issues at some of the larger customers. Temperature-normalized retail electric sales at our Wisconsin utility have increased over 2018, including higher industrial sales from 2 large customers returning to normal operations after prolonged outages. 
As a reminder, industrial sales are in lower margins when compared to other retail classes. Thus, these changes in electric sales did not have a material impact to our earnings. To assist with modeling our results throughout 2019, please note that the 6% projected increase in earnings for 2019 will not be recognized consistently for all 4 quarters this year. First, the interim rate increase in Iowa went into effect April 1, thus giving the earnings growth more to the last 3 quarters. Second, our Iowa utility has higher electric rates in the summer from mid-June through mid-September resulting in a higher proportion of earnings in the third quarter. Lastly, the timing of income tax expense recognition will result in lower earnings in the first half of the year and higher earnings in the second half of the year when compared to the quarterly results in 2018. 
Slide 3 has been provided to assist you in modeling the effective tax rates for our 2 utilities and our consolidated group for the full year 2019. We estimate a consolidated effective tax rate of 11% for 2019. As we continue adding wind generation into our portfolio, the resulting additional PTCs are expected to result in lower effective tax rates for several years into the future.
Please see Slide 4 for details of our 2019 financing plan, which remains unchanged. In June, we completed the issuance of $350 million of debt at our Wisconsin utility and used the proceeds to refinance $250 million of debt that matured in July and to reduce commercial paper outstanding. Through July, we have completed about 1/3 of the $400 million of new common equity issuances planned for 2019, largely through exercising a portion of the forward contracts entered into at the end of 2018. 
Lastly, we plan to issue up to $300 million of long-term debt at our Iowa utility later this year to fund our wind expansion program in Iowa. These 2019 financing plans support our objective of maintaining capital structures at our 2 utilities consistent with the most recent regulatory decisions. We expect to refresh our future capital expenditure plans and disclose our 2020 financing plans, including quantifying the 2020 new common equity needs during our third quarter earnings call in November. 
Lastly, we've included our 2019 regulatory initiatives note on Slide 5. There have been 2 key developments to share with you since our last quarterly earnings call. First, our Wisconsin utility filed its retail electric fuel only rate review in June to set the fuel cost monitoring level for 2020. Second, the rate reviews in Iowa continued to advance through the procedural schedules. As a reminder, we filed electric and gas rate reviews in Iowa in March and implemented electric interim rates at the beginning of the second quarter. The electric interim rate increase includes recovery of the investments in our English Farms and Upland Prairie wind projects, enhancements to our distribution network and upgrades to customer service technologies. A portion of the increase due to these investments has been offset with the benefits of PTCs and reduced fuel cost from the new wind projects being passed on to our customers beginning in April. This rate review filing also included the first forward-looking test year for our Iowa Utility for 2020. 
The rate review proceeding is progressing according to plan. Yesterday, many of the 15 interveners in IPL's electric rate review proceedings filed direct testimony. We are still reviewing the details of the testimony. The Iowa Business Energy Coalition's testimony and methodology appears generally consistent with how future test years are constructed and implied in other jurisdictions, although we have different viewpoints with some of their inputs and the end result. The Office of Consumer Advocate in contrast has proposed a complicated and unique phased approach effectively applying future and historic elements within 1 test year, which we believe is inconsistent with the Iowa legislation. Interveners have raised issues with the proposed renewable energy rider, ROE and capital structure, PTC carryforwards and other topics. Divergent viewpoints are a normal part of the rate reviews, and we are generally unsurprised by the interveners' position. We are proud of the investments that we've made on behalf of our customers and believe in the merits of the case that we put before the Iowa Utilities Board. We look forward to working with the interveners as the process continues. 
On Slide 6, we have provided the procedural schedules for the Iowa retail electric and gas dockets to help you monitor the progress of these rate reviews throughout the remainder of 2019. Under Iowa statutes, rate reviews must generally be decided within 10 months. Therefore, we anticipate final orders in both the electric and gas rate reviews by year-end. We appreciate your continued interest in our company. 
At this time, I will turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session."

Robert will provide more details on our financial results, our financing plans and our capital expenditure plan. 
Last night in our earnings release, we increased our earnings guidance for 2019 based on the sales performance experienced so far this year, which has been largely driven by weather. Our updated guidance reflects a $0.06 per share increase from the previous midpoint. We are forecasting another year of 5% to 7% growth, a ninth year in a row and a track record we intend to keep up. For 2020, we expect earnings between $2.34 and $2.48 per share. The midpoint of this range, $2.41, is a 7% increase from our forecasted 2019 temperature-normalized earnings per share of $2.25. 
Keeping with our plan to grow dividends commensurate with earnings growth, our Board of Directors has approved a 7% increase in our targeted annual common stock dividend to $1.52 per share. Later in this call, Robert will share more details about our financial results and guidance targets. 
Last night, we also shared our 5-year investment forecast, which totals $6.8 billion. Our investment plan reflects our continued journey to accelerate renewable energy, a path we've been on for more than a decade. Over the last year, we've been developing a clean energy blueprint. The first phase of this blueprint outlined several areas of investment with a focus on putting renewable energy to work for our Wisconsin customers and communities. Improving economics, sustainability goals and delivering on customer expectations are key drivers for our transition to renewable energy. 
Last week, we announced a key element of our clean energy blueprint, the expansion of our Wisconsin solar generation by up to 1,000 megawatts by the end of 2023. We are taking advantage of the continued cost reductions for solar generation along with the near-term opportunity to capture investment tax credits, which make solar a cost-effective renewable energy choice for our customers. 
When looking to transform our generation fleet, we thoughtfully balance many factors that include reliability, customer rates, strengthening the communities we serve and our talented employees who have served our customers with tremendous care and service for decades. These factors will guide us as we evaluate the path for future retirements of our Wisconsin coal facilities. More information will be shared over the course of the coming months as we further outline these elements in our Wisconsin clean energy blueprint. 
Our capital investment plan also reflects the planned investments in our electric and gas distribution systems designed to ensure our customers continue to benefit from safe, real and affordable energy. We are planning for the future needs of our customers and making investments in our communities to help drive economic development opportunities. Our plans include developing a strong distribution network that enables additional local energy resources. And we plan to move more of our electric lines from overhead to underground, further strengthening the grid and helping to reduce impacts from severe weather events. And our plans are mindful of customer cost impacts. We expect to reduce the number of substations and add devices that use smart sensors to detect problems and improve our response, resulting in more efficient and safe operations. 
Now let me update you on our progress with some of our current strategic projects. In Iowa, we continue to see great progress on the significant wind divestments we're making for our Iowa customers. Earlier this year, we placed 470 megawatts of wind into service, and we're making great progress with the remaining 530 megawatts of new wind. This will complete our planned 1,000 megawatts of new wind for our Iowa customers by the end of 2020. We are also nearing completion of our AMI meter deployment in Iowa with all meters expected to be installed and operating by the end of this year. 
For our Wisconsin customers, we're making progress constructing the 150-megawatt cost wind farm. We expect to place this project in service by the end of 2020. And we're nearing completion of our West Riverside Energy Center, a 730-megawatt highly efficient natural gas facility that will be an important complement to our renewable generation resources. We expect to continue our long track record of delivering projects on time and on budget. 
The third quarter also saw strong operating performance from our existing gas generation with year-to-date capacity factors exceeding 70%. Low natural gas prices and strong wind resources resulted in lower fuel costs for our customers. The financial and operational results we are communicating today would not be possible without the dedication of our employees and the strong community partnerships we have developed. We're delivering on our purpose to serve customers and build strong communities. 
Recently, the new commerce park in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin was certified by the State for Economic Development. Later this month, the  Iowa Economic Development Commission will recognize Alliant Energy at the Economic Impact Awards for our commitment to the Prairie View Industrial Center and also the Alliant Energy digital manufacturing lab, both located near Iowa State University. These achievements would not have been possible without the countless employee and community officials who contributed their time, energy and talent. 
I'm excited about our accomplishments and look forward to achieving our goals for 2020. I'll summarize the key areas of focus. Continuing our solid track record of project execution; completing projects on time, on budget in a very sustainable and safe manner; advancing affordable and clean energy through smart investments in renewables, high-efficiency natural gas and distribution networks; consistently delivering on 5% to 7% earnings growth guidance; and a 60% to 70% common dividend payout target; and we will continue to manage the company to strike a balance between capital investment, operational and financial discipline and cost impact to customers. 
With Veterans Day only a few days away, I'd like to take a moment and pay tribute to all veterans. And the many proud veterans that work here at Alliant Energy. I also want to extend my thanks and appreciation to all the military families for everything they do while their loved ones are away from home. I thank you for your interest in Alliant Energy. I'll now turn the call over to Robert."
312949,641599769,1856669,"Alliant Energy Corporation, Q3 2019 Earnings Call, Nov 07, 2019",2019-11-07,"Earnings Calls","Alliant Energy Corporation","Executives","Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. Yesterday, we announced third quarter earnings of $0.94 per share compared to non-GAAP earnings of $0.85 per share in the third quarter of 2018. Our higher earnings year-over-year were driven by higher rent requiremen",1018,"Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. Yesterday, we announced third quarter earnings of $0.94 per share compared to non-GAAP earnings of $0.85 per share in the third quarter of 2018. Our higher earnings year-over-year were driven by higher rent requirements due to increasing rate base and the timing of income tax expense. These higher earnings were partially offset by higher depreciation and financing expenses. We provided additional details on the earnings variance drivers for the quarter on Slide 2 and 3. 
Through the first 9 months of this year, temperatures in our service territory have increased retail electric and gas margins by approximately $0.05 per share. In 2018, the year-to-date temperature impacts net of reserves for WPL's earnings sharing mechanism and additional performance fee expense were also a $0.05 per share increase in earnings. 
As John mentioned, last night, we issued our consolidated 2020 earnings guidance range of $2.34 to $2.48 per share. The key drivers of 7% growth in EPS are related to investments in our core utility business including WPL's West Riverside generating facility and IPL's wind expansion program. These investments were reflected in WPL's approved electric rates for 2020 and IPL's retail electric rate review settlement, which is subject to the Iowa Utility Board's final decision. 
Our guidance assumes IPL's new 2020 electric base rates will go into effect in the first quarter of next year. The 2020 guidance range assumes a 0.5% growth in electric sales when compared to temperature-normalized sales for 2019. We are forecasting most of the sales growth from commercial and industrial customers. 
The details of our capital expenditure plan are shown on Slide 4. For your convenience, we provided a walk from the previous capital plan to our current capital plan on Slide 5. You will see on the capital plan walk, we have increased our forecasted investments in renewables and decreased electric and gas distribution investments when comparing last year's plan to this year's plan. This is consistent with our objective to make the best investment decisions on behalf of our customers with a constant focus on customer affordability. 
Slide 6 has been provided to assist you in modeling the effective tax rates for our 2 utilities and our consolidated group. We estimate a consolidated effective tax rate of positive 10% for 2019 and negative 11% for 2020. The additional production tax credits from the new wind projects being placed in service and the excess deferred taxes being returned to customers in 2020 are the primary drivers for the decrease in the effective tax rate. The production tax credits and excess deferred tax benefits will flow back to customers, resulting in lower electric margins next year. Thus, decreases in the effective tax rate related to PTCs and excess deferred tax benefits are largely earnings neutral. 
We remain very focused on controlling costs for our customers. We continue delivering the benefits from federal tax reform and lower fuel costs to our customers in both Wisconsin and Iowa. In Wisconsin, we will hold electric and gas base rates flat through 2020 by using fuel savings and excess deferred taxes for federal tax reform to offset the cost of utility investments including the highly efficient West Riverside Energy Center, which will be placed in service in the coming months. 
In Iowa, we'll be falling back tax benefits to customers as part of the 2020 test year retail electric rate review settlements. And as we bring 530 megawatts of new wind projects into service next year for our Iowa customers, we expect production tax credits and lower fuel expenses to largely offset the impact of increases in renewables rate base. In addition, we've added new wind PPAs and amended the Duane Arnold PPA, which will begin saving our Iowa customers' money in 2021. 
Moving to our financing plans, which have been summarized on Slide 7. We have completed our 2019 long-term debt financing with the issuance of a $300 million green bond at IPL in September to finance wind generation projects in Iowa. We plan to issue the remaining approximately $200 million of new common equity under the 2019 equity forward agreement by year-end. 
As we look to next year, our 2020 financing plan includes issuing up to $250 million of new common equity and up to $950 million of new long-term debt across our 2 utilities and energy finance. $650 million of long-term debt will be maturing next year. So a majority of the proceeds from the 2020 financing plan will be used to refinance existing debt. 
The 2020 financing plan is driven by the robust capital expenditure plans for the utilities, the September 2020 DAC PPA termination payment, regulatory decisions on delivering tax reform benefits to our customers and the settled IPL rate review, which would increase IPL's allowed common equity component of its capital structure by 200 basis points. 
Lastly, we have included our regulatory initiatives as noted on Slide 8. Since last quarter, we filed settlement agreements in both the IPL, retail electric and gas test year 2020 rate reviews. We expect the Iowa Utility Board's decision on these settlements by year-end. We also filed a construction authority request with the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin to expand natural gas capacity by 20% in Western Wisconsin. We expect a decision on that filing by the second quarter of 2020. 
Next year, in Wisconsin, we anticipate filing a certificate of public convenience and necessity for additional solar generation and retail electric and gas rate review for test years 2021 and 2022. The these regulatory initiatives are important components of our operational and financial results. We very much appreciate your continued support of our company and look forward to meeting with many of you at the EEI Finance Conference next week. 
Later today, we expect to post on our website the EEI investor presentation and the November 2019 fact book, which detailed the separate IPL and WPL updated capital expenditures through 2023 as well as provide updated rate base and construction work in progress forecast. 
At this time, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session."

So as we announced last night and this morning, we're planning on issuing up to $250 million of new common equity for 2020. And to answer your question beyond 2020, right now, we do not expect any material equity issuances. We do have a direct plan where individual shareholders are allowed to reinvest their dividends, which generally roughly about $25 million a year in proceeds, and we expect that to continue on beyond 2020, but that's the only equity we see in the foreseeable future. 
Regarding the remaining $225 million for 2020, we have had success in the past issuing equity under ATM programs when we've had smaller needs for equity. And last year, as many of you are aware, we did issue an equity forward or a larger equity issuance of $375 million. This amount at $225 million really gives us a lot of flexibility to use either one of those types of programs in the future. I'd also indicate that the timing of this will largely dependent on our financing needs and the market conditions. So also a lot of flexibility there. So we have not yet determined what method to use, but see, like I said, a lot of flexibility in our opportunities going forward."

But we are very fortunate we've got a very diversified mix of industrial customers, more agricultural based in Iowa and more manufacturing based in Wisconsin. So nothing significant. I would note too that the lower sales that we have seen from our industrial customers. So they have generally lower margins. So it's not been enough to have any material impact on our drivers for earnings. The economies in 2 states as a measure of unemployment are remaining strong. They're well below the national average. And we have seen some growth in our customer accounts. I think we've added about 5,000 electric customers relative to this time last year. So all in all, no concerns from us, but we're definitely watching some of the ongoing trade issues as it impacts our agricultural-based economies in the 2 states."

I look forward to sharing highlights of our strong year-to-date financial and operational performance along with sharing key elements of our plan to Power What’s Next for our customers and communities. Robert will provide more details on our financial results, our financing plans and our capital expenditure plan.
Last night in our earnings release, we increased our earnings guidance for 2019 based on the sales performance experienced so far this year, which has been largely driven by weather. Our updated guidance reflects a $0.06 per share increase from the previous midpoint. We are forecasting another year of 5% to 7% growth, our ninth year in a row and a track record we intend to keep up. For 2020, we expect earnings between $2.34 and $2.48 per share. The midpoint of this range, $2.41, is a 7% increase from our forecasted 2019 temperature-normalized earnings per share of $2.25.
Keeping with our plan to grow dividends commensurate with earnings growth, our Board of Directors has approved a 7% increase in our targeted annual common stock dividend to $1.52 per share. Later in this call, Robert will share more details about our financial results and guidance targets.
Last night, we also shared our 5-year investment forecast, which totals $6.8 billion. Our investment plan reflects our continued journey to accelerate renewable energy, a path we've been on for more than a decade. Over the last year, we've been developing a clean energy blueprint. The first phase of this blueprint outlined several areas of investment with a focus on putting renewable energy to work for our Wisconsin customers and communities. Improving economics, sustainability goals and delivering on customer expectations are key drivers for our transition to renewable energy.
Last week, we announced a key element of our clean energy blueprint, the expansion of our Wisconsin solar generation by up to 1,000 megawatts by the end of 2023. We're taking advantage of the continued cost reductions for solar generation along with the near-term opportunity to capture investment tax credits, which make solar a cost-effective renewable energy choice for our customers.
When looking to transform our generation fleet, we thoughtfully balance many factors that include reliability, customer rates, strengthening the communities we serve and our talented employees who have served our customers with tremendous care and service for decades. These factors will guide us as we evaluate the path for future retirements of our Wisconsin coal facilities. More information will be shared over the course of the coming months as we further outline these elements in our Wisconsin clean energy blueprint.
Our capital investment plan also reflects the planned investments in our electric and gas distribution systems designed to ensure our customers continue to benefit from safe, real and affordable energy. We're planning for the future needs of our customers and making investments in our communities to help drive economic development opportunities.
Our plans include developing a strong distribution network that enables additional local energy resources. And we plan to move more of our electric lines from overhead to underground, further strengthening the grid and helping to reduce impacts from severe weather events. And our plans are mindful of customer cost impacts. We expect to reduce the number of substations and add devices that use smart sensors to detect problems and improve our response resulting in more efficient and safe operations.
Now let me update you on our progress with some of our current strategic projects. In Iowa, we continue to see great progress on the significant wind divestments we're making for our Iowa customers. Earlier this year, we placed 470 megawatts of wind into service, and we're making great progress with the remaining 530 megawatts of new wind. This will complete our planned 1,000 megawatts of new wind for our Iowa customers by the end of 2020. We are also nearing completion of our AMI meter deployment in Iowa with all meters expected to be installed and operating by the end of this year.
For our Wisconsin customers, we're making progress constructing the 150-megawatt Kossuth wind farm. We expect to place this project in service by the end of 2020. And we're nearing completion of our West Riverside Energy Center, a 730-megawatt highly efficient natural gas facility that will be an important complement to our renewable generation resources. We expect to continue our long track record of delivering projects on time and on budget.
The third quarter also saw strong operating performance from our existing gas generation with year-to-date capacity factors exceeding 70%. Low natural gas prices and strong wind resources resulted in lower fuel costs for our customers. The financial and operational results we are communicating today would not be possible without the dedication of our employees and the strong community partnerships we have developed. We're delivering on our purpose to serve customers and build strong communities.
Recently, the new Commerce Park in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin was certified by the state for economic development. Later this month, the Ames Iowa Economic Development Commission will recognize Alliant Energy at the Economic Impact Awards for our commitment to the Prairie View Industrial Center and also the Alliant Energy digital manufacturing lab, both located near Iowa State University. These achievements would not have been possible without the countless employee and community officials who contributed their time, energy and talents.
I'm excited about our accomplishments and look forward to achieving our goals for 2020. I'll summarize the key areas of focus: continuing our solid track record of project execution; completing projects on time, on budget in a very sustainable and safe manner; advancing affordable and clean energy through smart investments in renewables, high-efficiency natural gas and distribution networks; consistently delivering on 5% to 7% earnings growth guidance; and a 60% to 70% common dividend payout target; and we will continue to manage the company to strike a balance between capital investment, operational and financial discipline and cost impact to customers.
With Veterans Day only a few days away, I'd like to take a moment and pay tribute to all veterans and the many proud veterans that work here at Alliant Energy. I also want to extend my thanks and appreciation to all the military families for everything they do while their loved ones are away from home. I thank you for your interest in Alliant Energy.
I'll now turn the call over to Robert."
312949,641599769,1856801,"Alliant Energy Corporation, Q3 2019 Earnings Call, Nov 07, 2019",2019-11-07,"Earnings Calls","Alliant Energy Corporation","Executives","Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. Yesterday, we announced third quarter earnings of $0.94 per share compared to non-GAAP earnings of $0.85 per share in the third quarter of 2018. Our higher earnings year-over-year were driven by higher revenue require",1025,"Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. Yesterday, we announced third quarter earnings of $0.94 per share compared to non-GAAP earnings of $0.85 per share in the third quarter of 2018. Our higher earnings year-over-year were driven by higher revenue requirements due to increasing rate base and the timing of income tax expense. These higher earnings were partially offset by higher depreciation and financing expenses. We provided additional details on the earnings variance drivers for the quarter on Slides 2 and 3.
Through the first 9 months of this year, temperatures in our service territory have increased retail electric and gas margins by approximately $0.05 per share. In 2018, the year-to-date temperature impact net of reserves for WPL's earnings sharing mechanism and additional performance fee expense were also a $0.05 per share increase in earnings.
As John mentioned, last night, we issued our consolidated 2020 earnings guidance range of $2.34 to $2.48 per share. The key drivers of the 7% growth in EPS are related to investments in our core utility business including WPL's West Riverside generating facility and IPL's wind expansion program. These investments were reflected in WPL's approved electric rates for 2020, and IPL's retail electric rate review settlement, which is subject to the Iowa Utility Board's final decision. Our guidance assumes IPL's new 2020 electric base rates will go into effect in the first quarter of next year.
The 2020 guidance range assumes a 0.5% growth in electric sales when compared to temperature-normalized sales for 2019. We are forecasting most of the sales growth from commercial and industrial customers. The details of our capital expenditure plan are shown on Slide 4. For your convenience, we provided a walk from the previous capital plan to our current capital plan on Slide 5. You will see on the capital plan walk, we have increased our forecasted investments in renewables and decreased electric and gas distribution investments when comparing last year's plan to this year's plan. This is consistent with our objective to make the best investment decisions on behalf of our customers with a constant focus on customer affordability.
Slide 6 has been provided to assist you in modeling the effective tax rates for our 2 utilities and our consolidated group. We estimate a consolidated effective tax rate of positive 10% for 2019 and negative 11% for 2020. The additional production tax credits from the new wind projects being placed in service and the excess deferred taxes being returned to customers in 2020 are the primary drivers for the decrease in the effective tax rate. The production tax credits and excess deferred tax benefits will flow back to customers, resulting in lower electric margins next year. Thus, the decreases in the effective tax rate related to PTCs and excess deferred tax benefits are largely earnings neutral.
We remain very focused on controlling costs for our customers. We continue delivering the benefits from Federal Tax Reform and lower fuel costs to our customers in both Wisconsin and Iowa. In Wisconsin, we will hold electric and gas base rates flat through 2020 by using fuel savings and excess deferred taxes from federal tax reform to offset the cost of utility investments, including the highly efficient West Riverside Energy Center, which will be placed in service in the coming months.
In Iowa, we'll be falling back tax benefits to customers as part of the 2020 test year retail electric rate review settlements. And as we bring 530 megawatts of new wind projects into service next year for our Iowa customers, we expect production tax credits and lower fuel expenses to largely offset the impact of increases in renewables rate base. In addition, we've added new wind PPAs and amended the Duane Arnold PPA, which will begin saving our Iowa customers' money in 2021.
Moving to our financing plans, which have been summarized on Slide 7. We have completed our 2019 long-term debt financings with the issuance of a $300 million green bond at IPL in September to finance wind generation projects in Iowa. We plan to issue the remaining approximately $200 million of new common equity under the 2019 equity forward agreements by year-end.
As we look to next year, our 2020 financing plan includes issuing up to $250 million of new common equity and up to $950 million of new long-term debt across our 2 utilities in Alliant Energy Finance. $650 million of long-term debt will be maturing next year. So a majority of the proceeds from the 2020 financing plan will be used to refinance existing debt.
The 2020 financing plan is driven by the robust capital expenditure plans for the utilities, the September 2020 DAEC PPA termination payment, regulatory decisions on delivering tax reform benefits to our customers and the settled IPL rate review, which would increase IPL's allowed common equity component of its capital structure by 200 basis points.
Lastly, we have included our regulatory initiatives as noted on Slide 8. Since last quarter, we filed settlement agreements in both the IPL, retail electric and gas test year 2020 rate reviews. We expect the Iowa Utility Board's decision on these settlements by year-end. We also filed a construction authority request with the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin to expand natural gas capacity by 20% in Western Wisconsin. We expect a decision on that filing by the second quarter of 2020.
Next year, in Wisconsin, we anticipate filing a certificate of public convenience and necessity for additional solar generation and a retail electric and gas rate review for test years 2021 and 2022. These regulatory initiatives are important components of our operational and financial results. We very much appreciate your continued support of our company and look forward to meeting with many of you at the EEI Finance (sic) [ Financial ] Conference next week.
Later today, we expect to post on our website the EEI investor presentation and the November 2019 fact book, which detail the separate IPL and WPL updated capital expenditures through 2023 as well as provide updated rate base and construction work in progress forecast.
At this time, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session."

So as we announced last night and this morning, we're planning on issuing up to $250 million of new common equity for 2020. And to answer your question beyond 2020, right now, we do not expect any material equity issuances. We do have a Shareowner Direct Plan where individual shareowners are allowed to reinvest their dividends, which generally roughly about $25 million a year in proceeds, and we expect that to continue on beyond 2020, but that's the only equity we see in the foreseeable future.
Regarding the remaining $225 million for 2020, we have had success in the past issuing equity under ATM programs when we've had smaller needs for equity. And last year, as many of you are aware, we did issue an equity forward for a larger equity issuance of $375 million. This amount at $225 million really gives us a lot of flexibility to use either one of those types of programs in the future. I'd also indicate that the timing of this will largely be dependent on our financing needs and the market conditions. So also a lot of flexibility there. So we have not yet determined what method to use, but see, like I said, a lot of flexibility in our opportunities going forward."

This has largely been in our Iowa jurisdiction with our larger industrial customers due to various operating and business issues with those individual customers, including experience some pressure as a result of the agricultural economy challenges because of the ongoing trade issues. But we are very fortunate we've got a very diversified mix of industrial customers, more agricultural based in Iowa and more manufacturing based in Wisconsin. So nothing significant. I would note too the lower sales that we have seen from our industrial customers. So they have generally lower margins. So it's not been enough to have any material impact on our variance drivers for earnings. The economies in the 2 states as a measure of unemployment are remaining strong. They're well below the national average. And we have seen some growth in our customer accounts. I think we've added about 5,000 electric customers relative to this time last year. So all in all, no concerns from us, but we're definitely watching some of the ongoing trade issues as it impacts our agricultural-based economies in the 2 states."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us.

Robert will provide more details on our financial results, our financing plans and our capital expenditure plan.
Last night in our earnings release, we increased our earnings guidance for 2019 based on the sales performance experienced so far this year, which has been largely driven by weather. Our updated guidance reflects a $0.06 per share increase from the previous midpoint. We are forecasting another year of 5% to 7% growth, our ninth year in a row and a track record we intend to keep up. For 2020, we expect earnings between $2.34 and $2.48 per share. The midpoint of this range, $2.41, is a 7% increase from our forecasted 2019 temperature-normalized earnings per share of $2.25.
Keeping with our plan to grow dividends commensurate with earnings growth, our Board of Directors has approved a 7% increase in our targeted annual common stock dividend to $1.52 per share. Later in this call, Robert will share more details about our financial results and guidance targets.
Last night, we also shared our 5-year investment forecast, which totals $6.8 billion. Our investment plan reflects our continued journey to accelerate renewable energy, a path we've been on for more than a decade. Over the last year, we've been developing a clean energy blueprint. The first phase of this blueprint outlined several areas of investment with a focus on putting renewable energy to work for our Wisconsin customers and communities. Improving economics, sustainability goals and delivering on customer expectations are key drivers for our transition to renewable energy.
Last week, we announced a key element of our clean energy blueprint, the expansion of our Wisconsin solar generation by up to 1,000 megawatts by the end of 2023. We're taking advantage of the continued cost reductions for solar generation along with the near-term opportunity to capture investment tax credits, which make solar a cost-effective renewable energy choice for our customers.
When looking to transform our generation fleet, we thoughtfully balance many factors that include reliability, customer rates, strengthening the communities we serve and our talented employees who have served our customers with tremendous care and service for decades. These factors will guide us as we evaluate the path for future retirements of our Wisconsin coal facilities. More information will be shared over the course of the coming months as we further outline these elements in our Wisconsin clean energy blueprint.
Our capital investment plan also reflects the planned investments in our electric and gas distribution systems designed to ensure our customers continue to benefit from safe, real and affordable energy. We're planning for the future needs of our customers and making investments in our communities to help drive economic development opportunities.
Our plans include developing a strong distribution network that enables additional local energy resources. And we plan to move more of our electric lines from overhead to underground, further strengthening the grid and helping to reduce impacts from severe weather events. And our plans are mindful of customer cost impacts. We expect to reduce the number of substations and add devices that use smart sensors to detect problems and improve our response resulting in more efficient and safe operations.
Now let me update you on our progress with some of our current strategic projects. In Iowa, we continue to see great progress on the significant wind divestments we're making for our Iowa customers. Earlier this year, we placed 470 megawatts of wind into service, and we're making great progress with the remaining 530 megawatts of new wind. This will complete our planned 1,000 megawatts of new wind for our Iowa customers by the end of 2020. We are also nearing completion of our AMI meter deployment in Iowa with all meters expected to be installed and operating by the end of this year.
For our Wisconsin customers, we're making progress constructing the 150-megawatt Kossuth wind farm. We expect to place this project in service by the end of 2020. And we're nearing completion of our West Riverside Energy Center, a 730-megawatt highly efficient natural gas facility that will be an important complement to our renewable generation resources. We expect to continue our long track record of delivering projects on time and on budget.
The third quarter also saw strong operating performance from our existing gas generation with year-to-date capacity factors exceeding 70%. Low natural gas prices and strong wind resources resulted in lower fuel costs for our customers. The financial and operational results we are communicating today would not be possible without the dedication of our employees and the strong community partnerships we have developed. We're delivering on our purpose to serve customers and build strong communities.
Recently, the new Commerce Park in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin was certified by the state for economic development. Later this month, the Ames Iowa Economic Development Commission will recognize Alliant Energy at the Economic Impact Awards for our commitment to the Prairie View Industrial Center and also the Alliant Energy digital manufacturing lab, both located near Iowa State University. These achievements would not have been possible without the countless employee and community officials who contributed their time, energy and talents.
I'm excited about our accomplishments and look forward to achieving our goals for 2020. I'll summarize the key areas of focus: continuing our solid track record of project execution; completing projects on time, on budget in a very sustainable and safe manner; advancing affordable and clean energy through smart investments in renewables, high-efficiency natural gas and distribution networks; consistently delivering on 5% to 7% earnings growth guidance; and a 60% to 70% common dividend payout target; and we will continue to manage the company to strike a balance between capital investment, operational and financial discipline and cost impact to customers.
With Veterans Day only a few days away, I'd like to take a moment and pay tribute to all veterans and the many proud veterans that work here at Alliant Energy. I also want to extend my thanks and appreciation to all the military families for everything they do while their loved ones are away from home. I thank you for your interest in Alliant Energy.
I'll now turn the call over to Robert."
312949,641599769,1872760,"Alliant Energy Corporation, Q3 2019 Earnings Call, Nov 07, 2019",2019-11-07,"Earnings Calls","Alliant Energy Corporation","Executives","Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. Yesterday, we announced third quarter earnings of $0.94 per share compared to non-GAAP earnings of $0.85 per share in the third quarter of 2018. Our higher earnings year-over-year were driven by higher revenue require",1025,"Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. Yesterday, we announced third quarter earnings of $0.94 per share compared to non-GAAP earnings of $0.85 per share in the third quarter of 2018. Our higher earnings year-over-year were driven by higher revenue requirements due to increasing rate base and the timing of income tax expense. These higher earnings were partially offset by higher depreciation and financing expenses. We provided additional details on the earnings variance drivers for the quarter on Slides 2 and 3.
Through the first 9 months of this year, temperatures in our service territory have increased retail electric and gas margins by approximately $0.05 per share. In 2018, the year-to-date temperature impact net of reserves for WPL's earnings sharing mechanism and additional performance fee expense were also a $0.05 per share increase in earnings.
As John mentioned, last night, we issued our consolidated 2020 earnings guidance range of $2.34 to $2.48 per share. The key drivers of the 7% growth in EPS are related to investments in our core utility business including WPL's West Riverside generating facility and IPL's wind expansion program. These investments were reflected in WPL's approved electric rates for 2020, and IPL's retail electric rate review settlement, which is subject to the Iowa Utility Board's final decision. Our guidance assumes IPL's new 2020 electric base rates will go into effect in the first quarter of next year.
The 2020 guidance range assumes a 0.5% growth in electric sales when compared to temperature-normalized sales for 2019. We are forecasting most of the sales growth from commercial and industrial customers. The details of our capital expenditure plan are shown on Slide 4. For your convenience, we provided a walk from the previous capital plan to our current capital plan on Slide 5. You will see on the capital plan walk, we have increased our forecasted investments in renewables and decreased electric and gas distribution investments when comparing last year's plan to this year's plan. This is consistent with our objective to make the best investment decisions on behalf of our customers with a constant focus on customer affordability.
Slide 6 has been provided to assist you in modeling the effective tax rates for our 2 utilities and our consolidated group. We estimate a consolidated effective tax rate of positive 10% for 2019 and negative 11% for 2020. The additional production tax credits from the new wind projects being placed in service and the excess deferred taxes being returned to customers in 2020 are the primary drivers for the decrease in the effective tax rate. The production tax credits and excess deferred tax benefits will flow back to customers, resulting in lower electric margins next year. Thus, the decreases in the effective tax rate related to PTCs and excess deferred tax benefits are largely earnings neutral.
We remain very focused on controlling costs for our customers. We continue delivering the benefits from Federal Tax Reform and lower fuel costs to our customers in both Wisconsin and Iowa. In Wisconsin, we will hold electric and gas base rates flat through 2020 by using fuel savings and excess deferred taxes from federal tax reform to offset the cost of utility investments, including the highly efficient West Riverside Energy Center, which will be placed in service in the coming months.
In Iowa, we'll be falling back tax benefits to customers as part of the 2020 test year retail electric rate review settlements. And as we bring 530 megawatts of new wind projects into service next year for our Iowa customers, we expect production tax credits and lower fuel expenses to largely offset the impact of increases in renewables rate base. In addition, we've added new wind PPAs and amended the Duane Arnold PPA, which will begin saving our Iowa customers' money in 2021.
Moving to our financing plans, which have been summarized on Slide 7. We have completed our 2019 long-term debt financings with the issuance of a $300 million green bond at IPL in September to finance wind generation projects in Iowa. We plan to issue the remaining approximately $200 million of new common equity under the 2019 equity forward agreements by year-end.
As we look to next year, our 2020 financing plan includes issuing up to $250 million of new common equity and up to $950 million of new long-term debt across our 2 utilities in Alliant Energy Finance. $650 million of long-term debt will be maturing next year. So a majority of the proceeds from the 2020 financing plan will be used to refinance existing debt.
The 2020 financing plan is driven by the robust capital expenditure plans for the utilities, the September 2020 DAEC PPA termination payment, regulatory decisions on delivering tax reform benefits to our customers and the settled IPL rate review, which would increase IPL's allowed common equity component of its capital structure by 200 basis points.
Lastly, we have included our regulatory initiatives as noted on Slide 8. Since last quarter, we filed settlement agreements in both the IPL, retail electric and gas test year 2020 rate reviews. We expect the Iowa Utility Board's decision on these settlements by year-end. We also filed a construction authority request with the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin to expand natural gas capacity by 20% in Western Wisconsin. We expect a decision on that filing by the second quarter of 2020.
Next year, in Wisconsin, we anticipate filing a certificate of public convenience and necessity for additional solar generation and a retail electric and gas rate review for test years 2021 and 2022. These regulatory initiatives are important components of our operational and financial results. We very much appreciate your continued support of our company and look forward to meeting with many of you at the EEI Finance (sic) [ Financial ] Conference next week.
Later today, we expect to post on our website the EEI investor presentation and the November 2019 fact book, which detail the separate IPL and WPL updated capital expenditures through 2023 as well as provide updated rate base and construction work in progress forecast.
At this time, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session."

So as we announced last night and this morning, we're planning on issuing up to $250 million of new common equity for 2020. And to answer your question beyond 2020, right now, we do not expect any material equity issuances. We do have a Shareowner Direct Plan where individual shareowners are allowed to reinvest their dividends, which generally roughly about $25 million a year in proceeds, and we expect that to continue on beyond 2020, but that's the only equity we see in the foreseeable future.
Regarding the remaining $225 million for 2020, we have had success in the past issuing equity under ATM programs when we've had smaller needs for equity. And last year, as many of you are aware, we did issue an equity forward for a larger equity issuance of $375 million. This amount at $225 million really gives us a lot of flexibility to use either one of those types of programs in the future. I'd also indicate that the timing of this will largely be dependent on our financing needs and the market conditions. So also a lot of flexibility there. So we have not yet determined what method to use, but see, like I said, a lot of flexibility in our opportunities going forward."

But we are very fortunate we've got a very diversified mix of industrial customers, more agricultural based in Iowa and more manufacturing based in Wisconsin. So nothing significant. I would note too the lower sales that we have seen from our industrial customers. So they have generally lower margins. So it's not been enough to have any material impact on our variance drivers for earnings. The economies in the 2 states as a measure of unemployment are remaining strong. They're well below the national average. And we have seen some growth in our customer accounts. I think we've added about 5,000 electric customers relative to this time last year. So all in all, no concerns from us, but we're definitely watching some of the ongoing trade issues as it impacts our agricultural-based economies in the 2 states."

Robert will provide more details on our financial results, our financing plans and our capital expenditure plan.
Last night in our earnings release, we increased our earnings guidance for 2019 based on the sales performance experienced so far this year, which has been largely driven by weather. Our updated guidance reflects a $0.06 per share increase from the previous midpoint. We are forecasting another year of 5% to 7% growth, our ninth year in a row and a track record we intend to keep up. For 2020, we expect earnings between $2.34 and $2.48 per share. The midpoint of this range, $2.41, is a 7% increase from our forecasted 2019 temperature-normalized earnings per share of $2.25.
Keeping with our plan to grow dividends commensurate with earnings growth, our Board of Directors has approved a 7% increase in our targeted annual common stock dividend to $1.52 per share. Later in this call, Robert will share more details about our financial results and guidance targets.
Last night, we also shared our 5-year investment forecast, which totals $6.8 billion. Our investment plan reflects our continued journey to accelerate renewable energy, a path we've been on for more than a decade. Over the last year, we've been developing a clean energy blueprint. The first phase of this blueprint outlined several areas of investment with a focus on putting renewable energy to work for our Wisconsin customers and communities. Improving economics, sustainability goals and delivering on customer expectations are key drivers for our transition to renewable energy.
Last week, we announced a key element of our clean energy blueprint, the expansion of our Wisconsin solar generation by up to 1,000 megawatts by the end of 2023. We're taking advantage of the continued cost reductions for solar generation along with the near-term opportunity to capture investment tax credits, which make solar a cost-effective renewable energy choice for our customers.
When looking to transform our generation fleet, we thoughtfully balance many factors that include reliability, customer rates, strengthening the communities we serve and our talented employees who have served our customers with tremendous care and service for decades. These factors will guide us as we evaluate the path for future retirements of our Wisconsin coal facilities. More information will be shared over the course of the coming months as we further outline these elements in our Wisconsin clean energy blueprint.
Our capital investment plan also reflects the planned investments in our electric and gas distribution systems designed to ensure our customers continue to benefit from safe, real and affordable energy. We're planning for the future needs of our customers and making investments in our communities to help drive economic development opportunities.
Our plans include developing a strong distribution network that enables additional local energy resources. And we plan to move more of our electric lines from overhead to underground, further strengthening the grid and helping to reduce impacts from severe weather events. And our plans are mindful of customer cost impacts. We expect to reduce the number of substations and add devices that use smart sensors to detect problems and improve our response resulting in more efficient and safe operations.
Now let me update you on our progress with some of our current strategic projects. In Iowa, we continue to see great progress on the significant wind divestments we're making for our Iowa customers. Earlier this year, we placed 470 megawatts of wind into service, and we're making great progress with the remaining 530 megawatts of new wind. This will complete our planned 1,000 megawatts of new wind for our Iowa customers by the end of 2020. We are also nearing completion of our AMI meter deployment in Iowa with all meters expected to be installed and operating by the end of this year.
For our Wisconsin customers, we're making progress constructing the 150-megawatt Kossuth wind farm. We expect to place this project in service by the end of 2020. And we're nearing completion of our West Riverside Energy Center, a 730-megawatt highly efficient natural gas facility that will be an important complement to our renewable generation resources. We expect to continue our long track record of delivering projects on time and on budget.
The third quarter also saw strong operating performance from our existing gas generation with year-to-date capacity factors exceeding 70%. Low natural gas prices and strong wind resources resulted in lower fuel costs for our customers. The financial and operational results we are communicating today would not be possible without the dedication of our employees and the strong community partnerships we have developed. We're delivering on our purpose to serve customers and build strong communities.
Recently, the new Commerce Park in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin was certified by the state for economic development. Later this month, the Ames Iowa Economic Development Commission will recognize Alliant Energy at the Economic Impact Awards for our commitment to the Prairie View Industrial Center and also the Alliant Energy digital manufacturing lab, both located near Iowa State University. These achievements would not have been possible without the countless employee and community officials who contributed their time, energy and talents.
I'm excited about our accomplishments and look forward to achieving our goals for 2020. I'll summarize the key areas of focus: continuing our solid track record of project execution; completing projects on time, on budget in a very sustainable and safe manner; advancing affordable and clean energy through smart investments in renewables, high-efficiency natural gas and distribution networks; consistently delivering on 5% to 7% earnings growth guidance; and a 60% to 70% common dividend payout target; and we will continue to manage the company to strike a balance between capital investment, operational and financial discipline and cost impact to customers.
With Veterans Day only a few days away, I'd like to take a moment and pay tribute to all veterans and the many proud veterans that work here at Alliant Energy. I also want to extend my thanks and appreciation to all the military families for everything they do while their loved ones are away from home. I thank you for your interest in Alliant Energy.
I'll now turn the call over to Robert."
312949,641599769,1872761,"Alliant Energy Corporation, Q3 2019 Earnings Call, Nov 07, 2019",2019-11-07,"Earnings Calls","Alliant Energy Corporation","Executives","Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. Yesterday, we announced third quarter earnings of $0.94 per share compared to non-GAAP earnings of $0.85 per share in the third quarter of 2018. Our higher earnings year-over-year were driven by higher revenue require",1025,"Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. Yesterday, we announced third quarter earnings of $0.94 per share compared to non-GAAP earnings of $0.85 per share in the third quarter of 2018. Our higher earnings year-over-year were driven by higher revenue requirements due to increasing rate base and the timing of income tax expense. These higher earnings were partially offset by higher depreciation and financing expenses. We provided additional details on the earnings variance drivers for the quarter on Slides 2 and 3.
Through the first 9 months of this year, temperatures in our service territory have increased retail electric and gas margins by approximately $0.05 per share. In 2018, the year-to-date temperature impact net of reserves for WPL's earnings sharing mechanism and additional performance fee expense were also a $0.05 per share increase in earnings.
As John mentioned, last night, we issued our consolidated 2020 earnings guidance range of $2.34 to $2.48 per share. The key drivers of the 7% growth in EPS are related to investments in our core utility business including WPL's West Riverside generating facility and IPL's wind expansion program. These investments were reflected in WPL's approved electric rates for 2020, and IPL's retail electric rate review settlement, which is subject to the Iowa Utility Board's final decision. Our guidance assumes IPL's new 2020 electric base rates will go into effect in the first quarter of next year.
The 2020 guidance range assumes a 0.5% growth in electric sales when compared to temperature-normalized sales for 2019. We are forecasting most of the sales growth from commercial and industrial customers. The details of our capital expenditure plan are shown on Slide 4. For your convenience, we provided a walk from the previous capital plan to our current capital plan on Slide 5. You will see on the capital plan walk, we have increased our forecasted investments in renewables and decreased electric and gas distribution investments when comparing last year's plan to this year's plan. This is consistent with our objective to make the best investment decisions on behalf of our customers with a constant focus on customer affordability.
Slide 6 has been provided to assist you in modeling the effective tax rates for our 2 utilities and our consolidated group. We estimate a consolidated effective tax rate of positive 10% for 2019 and negative 11% for 2020. The additional production tax credits from the new wind projects being placed in service and the excess deferred taxes being returned to customers in 2020 are the primary drivers for the decrease in the effective tax rate. The production tax credits and excess deferred tax benefits will flow back to customers, resulting in lower electric margins next year. Thus, the decreases in the effective tax rate related to PTCs and excess deferred tax benefits are largely earnings neutral.
We remain very focused on controlling costs for our customers. We continue delivering the benefits from Federal Tax Reform and lower fuel costs to our customers in both Wisconsin and Iowa. In Wisconsin, we will hold electric and gas base rates flat through 2020 by using fuel savings and excess deferred taxes from federal tax reform to offset the cost of utility investments, including the highly efficient West Riverside Energy Center, which will be placed in service in the coming months.
In Iowa, we'll be falling back tax benefits to customers as part of the 2020 test year retail electric rate review settlements. And as we bring 530 megawatts of new wind projects into service next year for our Iowa customers, we expect production tax credits and lower fuel expenses to largely offset the impact of increases in renewables rate base. In addition, we've added new wind PPAs and amended the Duane Arnold PPA, which will begin saving our Iowa customers' money in 2021.
Moving to our financing plans, which have been summarized on Slide 7. We have completed our 2019 long-term debt financings with the issuance of a $300 million green bond at IPL in September to finance wind generation projects in Iowa. We plan to issue the remaining approximately $200 million of new common equity under the 2019 equity forward agreements by year-end.
As we look to next year, our 2020 financing plan includes issuing up to $250 million of new common equity and up to $950 million of new long-term debt across our 2 utilities in Alliant Energy Finance. $650 million of long-term debt will be maturing next year. So a majority of the proceeds from the 2020 financing plan will be used to refinance existing debt.
The 2020 financing plan is driven by the robust capital expenditure plans for the utilities, the September 2020 DAEC PPA termination payment, regulatory decisions on delivering tax reform benefits to our customers and the settled IPL rate review, which would increase IPL's allowed common equity component of its capital structure by 200 basis points.
Lastly, we have included our regulatory initiatives as noted on Slide 8. Since last quarter, we filed settlement agreements in both the IPL, retail electric and gas test year 2020 rate reviews. We expect the Iowa Utility Board's decision on these settlements by year-end. We also filed a construction authority request with the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin to expand natural gas capacity by 20% in Western Wisconsin. We expect a decision on that filing by the second quarter of 2020.
Next year, in Wisconsin, we anticipate filing a certificate of public convenience and necessity for additional solar generation and a retail electric and gas rate review for test years 2021 and 2022. These regulatory initiatives are important components of our operational and financial results. We very much appreciate your continued support of our company and look forward to meeting with many of you at the EEI Finance (sic) [ Financial ] Conference next week.
Later today, we expect to post on our website the EEI investor presentation and the November 2019 fact book, which detail the separate IPL and WPL updated capital expenditures through 2023 as well as provide updated rate base and construction work in progress forecast.
At this time, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session."

Regarding the remaining $225 million for 2020, we have had success in the past issuing equity under ATM programs when we've had smaller needs for equity. And last year, as many of you are aware, we did issue an equity forward for a larger equity issuance of $375 million. This amount at $225 million really gives us a lot of flexibility to use either one of those types of programs in the future. I'd also indicate that the timing of this will largely be dependent on our financing needs and the market conditions. So also a lot of flexibility there. So we have not yet determined what method to use, but see, like I said, a lot of flexibility in our opportunities going forward."

But we are very fortunate we've got a very diversified mix of industrial customers, more agricultural based in Iowa and more manufacturing based in Wisconsin. So nothing significant. I would note too the lower sales that we have seen from our industrial customers. So they have generally lower margins. So it's not been enough to have any material impact on our variance drivers for earnings. The economies in the 2 states as a measure of unemployment are remaining strong. They're well below the national average. And we have seen some growth in our customer accounts. I think we've added about 5,000 electric customers relative to this time last year.

Nothing significant. We're very confident that we're still going to get these wind projects in on-time and at/or below budget. But they have pushed out some of those wind projects maybe a few months.
