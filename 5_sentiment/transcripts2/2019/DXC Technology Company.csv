Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. As usual, I have my 4, 5 points to make, and then I'll turn this over to Paul and then we'll have plenty of time for any of your questions.First, non-GAAP EPS in the third quarter was $2.23. Adjusted EBIT w",1580,"Okay. Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. As usual, I have my 4, 5 points to make, and then I'll turn this over to Paul and then we'll have plenty of time for any of your questions.
First, non-GAAP EPS in the third quarter was $2.23. Adjusted EBIT was $840 million and adjusted EBIT margin was 16.2%, and we generated $503 million of adjusted free cash flow in the third quarter. In terms of revenue in the third quarter, revenue was $5.178 billion on a GAAP basis. In constant currency, revenue was down 2.6% year-over-year and was up 4.3% sequentially. Bookings were up 3% year-over-year and 22% up sequentially for a book-to-bill of 1.1x.
The third point around digital. In constant currency, our digital revenue grew 16.9% year-over-year and 9.5% sequentially, driven by strong bookings in the first half of the year, particularly in cloud. Digital bookings in the quarter were up 85% year-over-year for a book-to-bill of 2.1x. Bookings were very strong across all digital offering families, and cloud had a 3.3x book-to-bill in the quarter. Industry IP and BPS revenue was up 2.6% year-over-year and 6% sequentially and the industry IP, BPS book-to-bill was 0.8x.
Fourth, we continued to make strategic investments in digital assets and capabilities. As you know, we recently announced our plan to acquire Luxoft, a global at scale digital innovator with differentiated offerings and platforms, deep vertical expertise and a world-class digital talent workforce. Luxoft has over $900 million in revenue and has been growing at strong double-digit rates. We also announced our plan to acquire the services division of EG, one of the leading integrators of Microsoft Dynamics 365 in northern Europe.
And then finally, for fiscal 2019, we continue to target revenue in the range of $20.7 billion to $21.2 billion, and we're raising our non-GAAP EPS target to a range of $8.15 to $8.30.
So let me just go into a little more detail on each of those points before I turn it over to Paul. As I said, the third quarter non-GAAP EPS was $2.23. The effective tax rate was 20.4%. Third quarter adjusted EBIT was $840 million and the adjusted EBIT margin was 16.2%, up 160 basis points year-over-year and 30 basis points sequentially. This margin improvement reflects continued execution of the levers that we have previously discussed.
GBS segment profit margin was 18.2%, which was down 10 basis points year-over-year and 70 basis points sequentially. This reflects the investments we're making to accelerate digital hiring and expand our digital transformation capabilities.
In GIS, segment profit margin was 17.5%, up 320 basis points year-over-year and 120 basis points sequentially. The GIS margin expansion was driven by our ongoing global deployment of Bionix, delivery center rationalization and the benefit of some final milestone achievements on a few of our contracts. And adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $503 million or 81% of adjusted net income.
Now let me go to revenue. As I said, revenue in the third quarter was $5.178 billion on a GAAP basis. In constant currency, revenue was down 2.6% year-over-year and was up 4.3% sequentially. Bookings were up 3% year-over-year and 22% up sequentially for a book-to-bill of 1.1x. Since the end of October, we've hired over 1,000 digital employees. As we previously discussed, we centralized digital hiring efforts with a strong focus on our digital transformation centers. These roles include AWS and Azure architects, data scientists and DevOps engineers and others. We've also identified an additional 2,000 current DXC employees to be rescaled in digital technologies. We're rapidly correcting the hiring delays that we discussed in the second quarter and will continue to accelerate hiring and training efforts in support of our fastest-growing capabilities.
Now I also believe that the Luxoft acquisition will allow DXC to accelerate its digital hiring efforts and reduce the time to fulfill digital demand for clients. Luxoft's established digital delivery footprint will also improve the client proximity for many of DXC's digital capabilities.
In the third quarter, GBS revenue was $2.17 billion, down 4% year-over-year in constant currency and up 3.7% sequentially. The year-over-year decline was driven by the ongoing headwinds in legacy application services as well as the completion of several large transformation projects we previously discussed. GBS bookings in the quarter were up 3.1% sequentially for a book-to-bill of 1x.
GIS revenue in the quarter was $3 billion. GIS revenue was down 1.5% year-over-year in constant currency and was up 4.8% sequentially. The sequential revenue growth reflects the good progress made in our digital business, including cloud infrastructure, cybersecurity and our digital workplace offering. Overall, GIS bookings were up 38% sequentially and the book-to-bill in the quarter was 1.1x. This reflects continued strength in our cloud and digital workplace offerings and the bookings associated with them.
Now let me turn to digital industry IP and BPS. In constant currency, digital revenue was up 16.9% year-over-year. Digital bookings continue to be very strong with a 2 to 1 -- 2.1x book-to-bill, driven by our cloud infrastructure and, as I said, our digital workplace offerings. Our digital pipeline is also up more than 90% year-over-year, which reflects the strong demand we're seeing toward digital solutions. For example, we signed a large deal with a European automotive manufacturer that includes analytics, multi-platform cloud and security. The solution includes deep learning and simulation platforms designed to accelerate the R&D for autonomous vehicles. We're the only provider who could demonstrate the ability to deliver these infrastructure and analytics capabilities at scale.
In constant currency, our cloud infrastructure business grew 32% in the quarter and was up 13.4% sequentially, again reflecting the strength of our cloud bookings during the first half of the year. Book-to-bill in the quarter was 3.3x, including expanded deals with a major European bank and the automotive manufacturer I just highlighted. 
Our security business grew 4.5% year-over-year in constant currency and 11% sequentially, driven by strong growth in northern Europe and Asia. Book-to-bill in the quarter was 1.4x, including a deal of a large financial services provider where DXC is partnering with CrowdStrike to provide managed endpoint threat detection and response services. We're also seeing increased demand for our operational technology security solutions in the manufacturing and energy sectors.
Enterprise cloud apps and consulting grew 2.7% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. Bookings in the quarter were strong and the book-to-bill was 1.4x. Wins in the quarter included a ServiceNow deal with a major U.S. food manufacturer. The solution leverages Platform DXC and will migrate their existing IT services management processes onto a ServiceNow platform. We also won SAP S/4HANA deals with a European satellite operator and a multinational technology company.
In constant currency, industry IP and BPS revenue was up 2.6% year-over-year and 6% sequentially, reflecting the acquisition of Molina Medicaid health solutions, which expanded our business supporting state agencies in the administration of Medicaid programs and adds to our overall health care IP portfolio.
Now moving to my fourth point. We continue to make investments in digital assets and capabilities. As we discussed in November, we acquired argodesign, a digital design consultancy based in Austin. Argodesign will enhance DXC's capabilities in interface design and user experience, which are key elements in developing and delivering digital transformation solutions and scale. During the third quarter, we also completed the acquisitions of BusinessNow and TESM, which will further expand our industry-leading ServiceNow practice.
As we said, we recently announced the planned acquisition of Luxoft Holding. We believe this transaction will create significant value through revenue synergies and access to a broader pool of digital talent. Luxoft strengthens DXC's portfolio of digital offerings with proven capabilities in high-growth areas, including analytics and business intelligence, user experience, IoT and blockchain. Luxoft also has a very strong outsourced engineering business. 
Luxoft has highly skilled digital workforce of more than 13,000 people and, as I said earlier, an established digital recruiting engine. More than 80% of Luxoft's workforce has a Masters degree or Ph.D., and their engineering talent is primarily housed in central and eastern European delivery centers. This market provides a significant source of digital talent. We're estimating [ 2 to 3 ] -- $300 million to $400 million of incremental revenue for the combined company by fiscal year '22. We believe there's an opportunity to expand wallet share with each company's respective clients. Further, we'll be able to expand Luxoft's existing platforms into additional geographies and industries. Luxoft's digital talent acquisition capabilities will also accelerate DXC's ability to capitalize on digital demand from our clients. And we'll remain on track to close the Luxoft transaction by the end of June.
And in January, we announced a plan to acquire Microsoft Dynamics practice of EG. The combination of EG with DXC Eclipse will extend DXC's leadership as a global Dynamics 365 systems integrator and will greatly enhance the scale of DXC's capabilities in the Nordic region. 
And then my final point before I turn it over to Paul is we expect additional sequential revenue growth in the fourth quarter. We're still targeting revenue in the range of $20.7 billion to $21.2 billion, although we are currently trending toward the lower half of that range, given some of the currency headwinds that we see. We're increasing our non-GAAP EPS targets to a range of $8.15 to $8.30, reflecting our accelerated pace of share repurchases and a lower tax rate than originally planned.
So I'll turn it over to Paul then we'll be back for questions."

In the quarter, we had restructuring costs of $76 million on a pretax basis or $0.21 per diluted share. These costs represent severance related to workforce optimization programs, particularly in complex countries and also expenses associated with facilities and data center rationalization. Also in the quarter, we had $107 million pretax or $0.29 per diluted share of transaction, separation and integration-related costs, including the acquisition of Molina. Year-to-date, restructuring, transaction, separation and integration costs amounted to $723 million pretax or $1.94 per diluted share.
In the third quarter, amortization of acquired intangibles was $134 million pretax or $0.35 per diluted share. Excluding the impact of these special items, non-GAAP income before taxes from continuing operations was $786 million and non-GAAP EPS was $2.23.
Now before I turn to our third quarter results in more detail, I'd like to point out a correction that we included in the non-GAAP section of our press release regarding adjusted free cash flow. In the second quarter, DXC expanded the use of its receivable facility and should have excluded the benefits of that expansion from adjusted free cash flow. Year-to-date, adjusted free cash flow has now been revised to accurately reflect the net impact of the receivables facility, and that resulted in a $223 million net cumulative reduction year-to-date. As a result of that correction, adjusted free cash flow for the first 9 months was $1.2 billion or 68% of adjusted net income.
Now let me move on to our third quarter results in more detail. GAAP revenue in the third quarter was $5.178 billion, a sequential increase of 4.3%. Adjusted EBIT in the quarter was $840 million. Adjusted EBIT margin was 16.2%, reflecting the progress we're making in our margin improvement plans. For the fiscal year, we remain on track to deliver our $575 million cost takeout target. 
During the quarter, we continued to optimize our workforce and drive procurement efficiencies. We reduced our headcount by roughly 3,000 people during the quarter, and that is excluding sub [indiscernible] and the Molina acquisition. Year-over-year, total headcount [indiscernible] over 14,000, driven by ongoing productivity efforts, including our Bionix automation program.
In supply chain, we're driving procurement efficiencies, including increased use of consumption-based purchase agreements for infrastructure and software. We also have expanded our category management capabilities to better leverage our strategic suppliers and consolidate vendors.
Turning to real estate. We eliminated an additional 1.5 million square feet during the quarter. And we've also closed 7 data centers and are on track to exit 2 to 3 additional data centers this fiscal year. We also are reinvesting in the business this fiscal year, including the acceleration of digital hiring, continued deployment of Bionix, expansion of our digital transformation centers and the continued build-out of key offerings, including AWS and Microsoft Azure solutions.
In the quarter, our non-GAAP EPS tax rate was 20.4%, reflecting our global mix of income and the timing of certain changes in tax attributes in key foreign jurisdictions. For the full year, we now expect the tax rate to be at the lower end of our previous range of 24% to 28%, and that implies a tax rate of slightly above 30% in the fourth quarter. Year-to-date revenue was $15.5 billion. Adjusted EBIT was $2.4 billion [indiscernible] was 15.8% and booking were $14.9 billion for a book-to-bill of 1x.
Turning to our segment results. GBS revenue was $2.17 billion in the third quarter, a sequential increase of 3.7%. In the third quarter, GBS segment profit was $395 million and profit margins was 18.2%, and that is including the investment we're making in expanding our digital capabilities. Year-to-date, GBS revenue was $6.5 billion, segment profit was $1.2 billion, margin was [ 19.5% ] and bookings were $6.4 billion for a book-to-bill of 1x.
GIS revenue was $3.01 billion in the quarter, up 4.8% in constant currency sequentially. GIS segment profit in the third quarter was $528 million. Profit margin was 17.5%. Now the segment profit margin for GIS reflect the impact of actions we're taking to drive greater operating efficiencies, including delivery and data center rationalization as well as the benefit of final milestone achievement on a few contracts. Year-to-date, GIS revenue was $9 billion, segment profit was $1.5 billion, margin was 16.4% and bookings were $8.5 billion for a book-to-bill of 0.9x.
Now let me turn to other financial highlights. Adjusted free cash flow in the third quarter was $503 million or 81% of adjusted net income. As I previously covered, year-to-date adjusted free cash flow was $1.2 billion. Year-to-date free cash flow performance is impacted by an increase of 5 to 6 days in days sales outstanding, driven primarily by extended payment terms on large traditional contracts. Now we have efforts underway to improve our working capital performance and to incentivize our [indiscernible] to be even more focused on collections. However, given the time remaining this fiscal year, we're revising our adjusted free cash flow targets for the year to 70% to 80% of adjusted net income.
Our CapEx was [ $163 million ] in the quarter or 3% of revenue, including the benefit of asset dispositions. Year-to-date CapEx was $829 million or 5.4% of revenue. Cash at the end of the quarter was $2.5 billion. Our total debt was $7.56 billion, including capital leases for a net debt to total capital ratio of 26.9%. Following the announcement of the Luxoft acquisition, all 3 rating agencies reaffirmed DXC's rating and outlook.
Now during the third quarter, we paid $54 million in dividends and we've repurchased $797 million in shares for a total of $851 million in capital returned to shareholders. Year-to-date, we've returned $1.4 billion of capital to our shareholders in the form of [ 159 ] [indiscernible] dividend and $1.2 billion in share repurchases. In the fourth quarter, we expect to continue to return capital to shareholders but at a more moderate pace.
In closing, we continue to target revenue in the range of $20.7 billion to $21.2 billion. Although given our current -- the currency headwinds that we're seeing, we're trending toward the lower half of that range. We've raised our EPS target range to $8.15 to $8.30, reflecting the pace of share repurchases and a tax rate that's trending toward the lower end of our targeted range.
I'll now hand the call back to the operator for our Q&A session."

We've made -- we talked about this at the end of the second quarter. We clearly fell behind in the hiring. And we've made a big investment in the processes and our tools and frankly, much better planning at the account level. I can't tell you what little discipline does because that gives us a much better demand signal. And then we are able to turn the hiring machine and the processes on to get that done. The other thing to tell is we -- Jim have centralized a lot of this digital hiring, so we put a very thorough skills taxonomy together, and we're hiring these [indiscernible] to our digital delivery centers, and then we're deploying those people as the projects get firmed up and signed by the customer. That's a whole different process than trying to do this account by account. We're also seeing a significant improvement in the quality of the people and the skills that we're bringing in. So I think to net this out, I think we'll get to more of a steady state in terms of hiring for the first half of next fiscal year. But we'll continue to remix the workforce. Paul talked about 14,000 reduction is true, but on the other side of that is we've hired thousands of people into these new businesses. And that remix of the workforce, both reskilling of existing as well as bringing new people in, that's going to continue for a long time. So I think these digital delivery centers, I think that's helped us. We're getting better candidates. The tools, the processes, the discipline and frankly, people see that we're attracting, they see really good career opportunities in digital as they look at over the next medium to longer term. And one other point is probably longer answer than you're looking for. But I mean, Luxoft has really helped in terms of their brand and their reputation in the digital space as well. So I think this was a strong signal that we were serious about really jumpstarting or catapulting us and our skills into a slightly different space than where we were prior to the second quarter. Paul, I don't know if you want to add anything."

When exactly are they going to close? I don't know, that gets a little lumpy. I think it can continue in the fourth quarter and even into the first quarter based on what we see in the pipeline. But the more important trend is underneath that. And that is what I'll call shorter duration project [indiscernible]. I think I've mentioned this before but we now are compensating many of people in our delivery organization for what we call delivery-led growth. These are shorter-term projects where we can sign people very quickly and generate incremental revenue. Our digital projects are largely of shorter duration. They usually start out smaller and then tend to expand and scale over time. So the dynamics of our bookings are changing as our business model and portfolio begins to shift on total reliance on big deals, big TCV deals. That reliance is beginning to diminish as we move the portfolio to a much higher number, higher volume of digital projects. We consider that good. When we looked into Luxoft's book of business, it's the exact same profile that we're beginning to experience in our business. So that, I think, bodes well as we go forward."

We have all options on the table all the time. Candidly, I don't see a lot of divestitures as I look out because we have really remixed the portfolio quite dramatically over the last couple of years. I do think we'll see some more smaller tuck-in type acquisitions, particularly in the digital space. So as soon we get the Luxoft transaction completed, there's a whole series of smaller opportunities that can be added to that business model. We continue to look for areas where we can strengthen our IT portfolio like we did with Molina in health care. We're continuing to look at other practices to strengthen our really very strong position in Microsoft Dynamics 365 as well as ServiceNow where we've made significant investments. So I'd say that part of our capital allocation model that we've talked about will continue. And then, of course, the mix of returning share -- returning money to our shareholders as we've done, we've returned over $1 billion. We obviously thought our stock was a very good buy and have continued to plow money into that as well. So I don't see any major changes in the capital allocation model as we go forward. We got to tighten up, as Paul said, on our working capital management, particularly our days sales outstanding, and that's difficult because of there's a pretty strong push to try to extend those terms particularly on these large ITO contracts. Another thing as we look out long, we see working capital moving in our favor the shorter-term projects have a propensity to pay in a much quicker cycle than many of these large ITO contracts. So that's how we're thinking about it going forward is we've got a capital allocation model, we're going to stick with that. We're very pleased with the Luxoft transaction.

And as you look at the results of many of the players in this space, they're all relatively strong. The things that I think really came to life for me was, this came around Luxoft, in particular, is the different space that they are in. They are much more in what I'll call the business executive space, taking on digital projects that candidly, one DXC didn't see and in many cases weren't really considered because of the brand reputation we have around being able to run infrastructures and big application sets, those kinds of things. That is really going to change. And then the underlying thing that's so important is all of these smaller digital projects ultimately have to get integrated into mainstream IT in order to really see the transformative benefits of these digital projects. And that's what our unique value proposition is and we're staying with that along with our partners. And our partners bring a lot to the table here and again, Luxoft acquisition. Many of our partners work with Luxoft. And our clients are all, all on a digital journey, different places in that journey but all on that digital journey. So as I said many, many times, this is a generational shift and there is plenty of addressable market for everyone to participate in right now."

I think we will get to a more, as I said earlier on a previous question, we'll get to much more of a steady-state as we continue to remix our workforce. So in many cases, what you're seeing here is you're continuing to see an expansion of some of the margins in GIS because frankly, that's where a lot of the remix is taking place, and you're seeing a slight deterioration in the GBS margins. Overall, the margins for the company continue to expand. So I think it's a broader picture. It's going to be a remix. I don't think we'll continue what this sort of extraordinary effort to bootstrap ourselves in the digital hiring. But I honestly hope we have the demand going forward long term that we continue to do that. In many cases, we're hiring teams of people, not just individuals, because a lot of these digital projects require scrum leaders, they require data scientists, they require software engineers. So more and more, as we remix this business portfolio, these aren't individual skills that get applied. They're teams that get applied to a digital business solution.

Now I think it will continue to require us to go to market differently, source these opportunities differently as I just explained with Rod's question and then continue to hire into that demand. As I said, we use this annual billed revenue as sort of a metric internally. It's not ready for primetime yet in terms of audibility but we use it internally. And we have seen an acceleration of this as we've gone through this year. I mean, the first -- we got off to a fairly slow start in the first quarter. We picked up some steam in the second quarter. Third quarter is the first quarter we've actually made our internal objectives around our digital sales. So we're beginning to see that pick up of steam. Now we got caught short, as we fully admitted, we got caught a little short because the demand got out a little bit in front of our ability to then source the people. And as I said, sourcing people is not individuals, it's more teams. And sometimes, you can't get started with these projects [indiscernible] the whole team. Doesn't do any good to have just the data scientists show off or analytics if you also require software engineering as well. So that's the gap that we are closing. But I think the demand is there. This is a generational shift. We're making acquisitions. We're making investments. We're beginning to see that revenue tick up a little bit, we're beginning to see the sales tick up so those are encouraging signs. But I can promise you, it's not going to be a straight line here as we go forward.

And what we're finding is when we do partner more deeply like that, when I say partner, I'm talking about joint proposals, not 2 separate proposals that get stapled together in the lobby before we make the presentation. I'm talking about an integrated proposal. And we're seeing win rates go up dramatically, and I mean, dramatically like 20 points when we do that.

And already, [indiscernible] working within the regulatory framework of what we could do with Luxoft, see all kinds of opportunities.

Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. As usual, I have my 4, 5 points to make, and then, I'll turn this over to Paul. And then, we'll have plenty of time for any of your questions.First, non-GAAP EPS in the third quarter was $2.23. Adjusted EBI",1579,"Okay. Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. As usual, I have my 4, 5 points to make, and then, I'll turn this over to Paul. And then, we'll have plenty of time for any of your questions.
First, non-GAAP EPS in the third quarter was $2.23. Adjusted EBIT was $840 million and adjusted EBIT margin was 16.2%, and we generated $503 million of adjusted free cash flow in the third quarter. In terms of revenue in the third quarter, revenue was $5.178 billion on a GAAP basis. In constant currency, revenue was down 2.6% year-over-year and was up 4.3% sequentially. Bookings were up 3% year-over-year and 22% up sequentially for a book-to-bill of 1.1x.
A third point around digital. In constant currency, our digital revenue grew 16.9% year-over-year and 9.5% sequentially, driven by strong bookings in the first half of the year, particularly in cloud. Digital bookings in the quarter were up 85% year-over-year for a book-to-bill of 2.1x. Bookings were very strong across all digital offering families, and cloud has 3.3x book-to-bill in the quarter. Industry IP and BPS revenue was up 2.6% year-over-year and 6% sequentially, and the industry IP, BPS book-to-bill was 0.8x.
Fourth, we continued to make strategic investments in digital assets and capabilities. As you know, we recently announced our plan to acquire Luxoft, a global at-scale digital innovator, with differentiated offerings and platforms, deep vertical expertise and a world-class digital talent workforce. Luxoft has over $900 million in revenue, and has been growing at strong double-digit rates. We also announced our plan to acquire the services division of EG, one of the leading integrators of Microsoft Dynamics 365 in Northern Europe.
And then, finally, for fiscal 2019, we continue to target revenue in the range of $20.7 billion to $21.2 billion, and we're raising our non-GAAP EPS target to a range of $8.15 to $8.30.
So let me just go into a little more detail on each of those points before I turn it over to Paul. As I said, the third quarter non-GAAP EPS was $2.23. The effective tax rate was 20.4%. Third quarter adjusted EBIT was $840 million, and the adjusted EBIT margin was 16.2%, up 160 basis points year-over-year and 30 basis points sequentially. This margin improvement reflects continued execution of the levers that we have previously discussed.
GBS segment profit margin was 18.2%, which was down 10 basis points year-over-year and 70 basis points sequentially. This reflects the investments we're making to accelerate digital hiring and expand our digital transformation capabilities.
In GIS, segment profit margin was 17.5%, up 320 basis points year-over-year and 120 basis points sequentially. The GIS margin expansion was driven by our ongoing global deployment of Bionix, delivery center rationalization and the benefit of some final milestone achievements on a few of our contracts. And adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $503 million or 81% of adjusted net income.
Now let me go to revenue. As I said, revenue in the third quarter was $5.178 billion on a GAAP basis. In constant currency, revenue was down 2.6% year-over-year and was up 4.3% sequentially. Bookings were up 3% year-over-year and 22% up sequentially, for a book-to-bill of 1.1x. Since the end of October, we've hired over 1,000 digital employees. And as we previously discussed, we centralized digital hiring efforts with a strong focus on our digital transformation centers. These roles include AWS and Azure architects, data scientists, and DevOps engineers, and others. We've also identified an additional 2,000 current DXC employees to be reskilled in digital technologies. We're rapidly correcting the hiring delays that we discussed in the second quarter and will continue to accelerate hiring and training efforts in support of our fastest-growing capabilities.
Now I also believe that the Luxoft acquisition will allow DXC to accelerate its digital hiring efforts and reduce the time to fulfill digital demand for clients. Luxoft's established digital delivery footprint will also improve the client proximity for many of DXC's digital capabilities.
In the third quarter, GBS revenue was $2.17 billion, down 4% year-over-year in constant currency and up 3.7% sequentially. The year-over-year decline was driven by the ongoing headwinds in legacy application services as well as the completion of several large transformation projects we've previously discussed. GBS bookings in the quarter were up 3.1% sequentially, for a book-to-bill of 1x.
GIS revenue in the quarter was $3 billion. GIS revenue was down 1.5% year-over-year in constant currency, and was up 4.8% sequentially. The sequential revenue growth reflects the good progress made in our digital business, including cloud infrastructure, cybersecurity, and our digital workplace offering. Overall, GIS bookings were up 38% sequentially and the book-to-bill in the quarter was 1.1x. This reflects continued strength in our cloud and digital workplace offerings, and the bookings associated with them.
Now let me turn to digital industry IP and BPS. In constant currency, digital revenue was up 16.9% year-over-year. Digital bookings continue to be very strong with a 2 to 1 -- 2.1x book-to-bill, driven by our cloud infrastructure, and as I said, our digital workplace offerings. Our digital pipeline is also up more than 90% year-over-year, which reflects the strong demand we're seeing toward digital solutions. For example, we signed a large deal with a European automotive manufacturer that includes analytics, multi-platform cloud, and security. The solution includes deep learning and simulation platforms designed to accelerate the R&D for autonomous vehicles. We're the only provider who could demonstrate the ability to deliver these infrastructure and analytics capabilities at scale.
In constant currency, our cloud infrastructure business grew 32% in the quarter and was up 13.4% sequentially. Again, reflecting the strength of our cloud bookings during the first half of the year. Book-to-bill in the quarter was 3.3x, including expanded deals with a major European bank, and the automotive manufacturer I just highlighted.
Our security business grew 4.5% year-over-year in constant currency and 11% sequentially, driven by strong growth in Northern Europe and Asia. Book-to-bill in the quarter was 1.4x, including a deal with a large financial services provider, where DXC is partnering with CrowdStrike to provide managed endpoint threat detection and response services. We're also seeing increased demand for our operational technology security solutions in the manufacturing and energy sectors.
Enterprise cloud apps and consulting grew 2.7% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. Bookings in the quarter were strong and the book-to-bill was 1.4x. Wins in the quarter included a ServiceNow deal with a major U.S. food manufacturer. The solution leverages Platform DXC, and will migrate their existing IP services management processes on to a ServiceNow platform. We also won SAP S/4HANA deals with a European satellite operator and a multinational technology company.
In constant currency, industry IP and BPS revenue was up 2.6% year-over-year and 6% sequentially, reflecting the acquisition of Molina Medicaid Health Solutions, which expanded our business supporting state agencies in the administration of Medicaid programs, and adds to our overall health care IP portfolio.
Now moving to my fourth point. We continue to make investments in digital assets and capabilities. As we discussed in November, we acquired argodesign, the digital design consultancy based in Austin. Argodesign will enhance DXC's capabilities in interface design and user experience, which are key elements in developing and delivering digital transformation solutions and scale. During the third quarter, we also completed the acquisitions of BusinessNow and TESM, which will further expand our industry-leading ServiceNow practice.
As we said, we recently announced the planned acquisition of Luxoft Holding. We believe this transaction will create significant value through revenue synergies and access to a broader pool of digital talent. Luxoft strengthens DXC's portfolio of digital offerings with proven capabilities in high-growth areas, including analytics and business intelligence, user experience, IoT, and blockchain. Luxoft also has a very strong outsourced engineering business.
Luxoft has highly-skilled digital workforce of more than 13,000 people, and as I said earlier, an established digital recruiting engine. More than 80% of Luxoft's workforce has a Master's Degree or Ph.D., and their engineering talent is primarily housed in central and eastern European delivery centers. This market provides a significant source of digital talent. We're estimating 2 to 3 -- $300 million to $400 million of incremental revenue for the combined company by fiscal year '22. We believe there's an opportunity to expand wallet share with each company's respective clients. Further, we'll be able to expand Luxoft's existing platforms into additional geographies and industries. Luxoft's digital talent acquisition capabilities will also accelerate DXC's ability to capitalize on digital demand from our clients. And we'll remain on track to close the Luxoft transaction by the end of June.
And in January, we announced a plan to acquire Microsoft Dynamics ' practice of EG. The combination of EG with DXC Eclipse will extend DXC's leadership as a global Dynamics 365 systems integrator and will greatly enhance the scale of DXC's capabilities in the Nordic region. 
And then, my final point before I turn it over to Paul is we expect additional sequential revenue growth in the fourth quarter. We're still targeting revenue in the range of $20.7 billion to $21.2 billion, although we are currently trending towards the lower half of that range, given some of the currency headwinds that we see. We're increasing our non-GAAP EPS targets to a range of $8.15 to $8.30, reflecting our accelerated pace of share repurchases, and a lower tax rate than originally planned.
So I'll turn it over to Paul, and then, we'll be back for questions."

As usual, I'll start by covering some items that are excluded from our non-GAAP results.In the quarter, we had restructuring costs of $76 million on a pretax basis or $0.21 per diluted share. These costs represe",1078,"Thank you, Mike, and greetings, everyone. As usual, I'll start by covering some items that are excluded from our non-GAAP results.
In the quarter, we had restructuring costs of $76 million on a pretax basis or $0.21 per diluted share. These costs represent severance related to workforce optimization programs, particularly in complex countries, and also expenses associated with facilities and data center rationalization. Also in the quarter, we had $107 million pretax or $0.29 per diluted share of transaction, separation, and integration-related costs, including the acquisition of Molina. Year-to-date, restructuring, transaction, separation and integration costs amounted to $723 million pretax or $1.94 per diluted share.
In the third quarter, amortization of acquired intangibles was $134 million pretax or $0.35 per diluted share. Excluding the impact of these special items, non-GAAP income before taxes from continuing operations was $786 million and non-GAAP EPS was $2.23.
Now before I turn to our third quarter results in more detail, I'd like to point out a correction that we included in the non-GAAP section of our press release regarding adjusted free cash flow. In the second quarter, DXC expanded the use of its receivable facility, and should have excluded the benefit of that expansion from adjusted free cash flow. Year-to-date, adjusted free cash flow has now been revised to accurately reflect the net impact of the receivables facility, and that resulted in a $223 million net cumulative reduction year-to-date. As a result of that correction, adjusted free cash flow for the first 9 months was $1.2 billion or 68% of adjusted net income.
Now let me move on to our third quarter results in more detail. GAAP revenue in the third quarter was $5.178 billion, a sequential increase of 4.3%. Adjusted EBIT in the quarter was $840 million. Adjusted EBIT margin was 16.2%, reflecting the progress we're making in our margin improvement plans. For the fiscal year, we remain on track to deliver our $575 million cost takeout target.
During the quarter, we continued to optimize our workforce and drive procurement efficiencies. We reduced our headcount by roughly 3,000 people during the quarter, and that is excluding sub [indiscernible] and the Molina acquisition. Year-over-year, total headcount [indiscernible] over 14,000, driven by ongoing productivity efforts, including our Bionix automation program.
In supply chain, we're driving procurement efficiencies, including increased use of consumption-based purchase agreements for infrastructure and software. We also have expanded our category management capabilities to better leverage our strategic suppliers and consolidate vendors.
Turning to real estate. We eliminated an additional 1.5 million square feet during the quarter. And we've also closed 7 data centers and are on track to exit 2 to 3 additional data centers this fiscal year. We're also reinvesting in the business this fiscal year, including the acceleration of digital hiring, continued deployment of Bionix, expansion of our digital transformation centers and the continued build-out of key offerings,including AWS and Microsoft Azure solutions.
In the quarter, our non-GAAP EPS tax rate was 20.4%, reflecting our global mix of income and the timing of certain changes in tax attributes in key foreign jurisdictions. For the full year, we now expect the tax rate to be at the lower end of our previous range of 24% to 28%, and that implies a tax rate of slightly above 30% in the fourth quarter. Year-to-date, revenue was $15.5 billion. Adjusted EBIT was $2.4 billion [indiscernible] was 15.8%, and booking were $14.9 billion for a book-to-bill of 1x.
Turning to our segment results. GBS revenue was $2.17 billion in the third quarter, a sequential increase of 3.7%. In the third quarter, GBS segment profit was $395 million, and profit margins was 18.2%, and that is including the investment we are making in expanding our digital capabilities. Year-to-date, GBS revenue was $6.5 billion, segment profit was $1.2 billion, margin was 18.5%, and bookings were $6.4 billion for a book-to-bill of 1x.
GIS revenue was $3.01 billion in the quarter, up 4.8% in constant currency, sequentially. GIS segment profit in the third quarter was $528 million. Profit margin was 17.5%. Now the segment profit margin for GIS reflect the impact of actions we're taking to drive greater operating efficiencies, including delivery and data center rationalization, as well as the benefit of final milestone achievement on a few contracts. Year-to-date, GIS revenue was $9 billion, segment profit was $1.5 billion, margin was 16.4%, and bookings were $8.5 billion, for a book-to-bill of 0.9x.
Now let me turn to other financial highlights. Adjusted free cash flow in the third quarter was $503 million or 81% of adjusted net income. As I previously covered, year-to-date adjusted free cash flow was $1.2 billion. Year-to-date free cash flow performance is impacted by an increase of 5 to 6 days in days sales outstanding, driven primarily by extended payment terms on large traditional contracts. Now we have efforts underway to improve our working capital performance, and to incentivize our [indiscernible] to be even more focused on collections. However, given the time remaining this fiscal year, we're revising our adjusted free cash flow targets for the year to 70% to 80% of adjusted net income.
Our CapEx was $153 million in the quarter or 3% of revenue, including the benefit of asset dispositions. Year-to-date CapEx was $829 million or 5.4% of revenue. Cash at the end of the quarter was $2.5 billion. Our total debt was $7.56 billion, including capital leases, for a net debt to total capital ratio of 26.9%. Following the announcement of the Luxoft acquisition, all 3 rating agencies reaffirmed DXC's rating and outlook.
Now during the third quarter, we paid $54 million in dividends, and we've repurchased $797 million in shares for a total of $851 million in capital returned to shareholders. Year-to-date, we've returned $1.4 billion of capital to our shareholders in the form of $159 million [ in cash dividend ] and $1.2 billion in share repurchases. In the fourth quarter, we expect to continue to return capital to shareholders, but at a more moderate pace.
In closing, we continue to target revenue in the range of $20.7 billion to $21.2 billion. Although given our current -- the currency headwinds that we're seeing, we're trending toward the lower half of that range. We've raised our EPS target range to $8.15 to $8.30, reflecting the pace of share repurchases and a tax rate that's trending toward the lower end of our targeted range.
I'll now hand the call back to the operator for our Q&A session."

We've made -- we talked about this at the end of the second quarter. We clearly fell behind in the hiring. And we've made a big investment in the processes, and our tools, and frankly, much better planning at the account level. I can't tell you what little discipline does because that gives us a much better demand signal. And then, we are able to turn the hiring machine and the processes on to get that done. The other thing to tell is we -- Jim, have centralized a lot of this digital hiring. So we've put a very thorough skills taxonomy together, and we're hiring these people into our digital delivery centers. And then, we're deploying those people as the projects get firmed up and signed by the customer. That's a whole different process than trying to do this account by account. We're also seeing a significant improvement in the quality of the people and the skills that we're bringing in. So I think to net this out, I think we'll get to more of a steady state in terms of hiring sort of the first half of next fiscal year. But we'll continue to remix the workforce. I mean, Paul talked about 14,000 reduction is true, but on the other side of that is we've hired thousands of people into these new businesses. And that remix of the workforce, both the reskilling of existing as well as bringing new people in, that's going to continue for a long time. So I think these digital delivery centers, I think that's helped us. We're getting better candidates. The tools, the processes, the discipline, and frankly, people see that we're attracting, they see really good career opportunities in digital as they look out over the next medium to longer term. And one other point is probably a longer answer than you're looking for. But I mean, Luxoft has really helped in terms of their brand and their reputation in the digital space as well. So I think this was a strong signal that we were serious about really jump-starting or catapulting us and our skills into a slightly different space than where we were prior to the second quarter. Paul, I don't know if you want to add anything..."

When exactly are they going to close? I don't know. That gets a little lumpy. I think it can continue in the fourth quarter, and even into the first quarter based on what we see in the pipeline. But the more important trend is underneath that. And that is what I'll call shorter duration project-wide. I think I've mentioned this before, but we now are compensating many of our people in our delivery organization for what we call delivery-led growth. These are shorter-term projects where we can assign people very quickly and generate incremental revenue. Our digital projects are largely of shorter duration. They usually start out smaller, and then, tend to expand and scale over time. So the dynamics of our bookings are changing as our business model and portfolio begins to shift on a total reliance on big deals, big TCV deals. That reliance is beginning to diminish as we move the portfolio to a much higher number, higher volume of digital projects. We consider that good. When we looked into Luxoft's book of business, it's the exact same profile that we're beginning to experience in our business. So that, I think, bodes well as we go forward."

You said that. We have all options on the table all the time. Candidly, I don't see a lot of divestitures as I look out because we have really remixed the portfolio quite dramatically over the last couple of years. I do think we'll see some more smaller tuck-in type acquisitions, particularly, in the digital space. So assuming we get the Luxoft transaction completed, there's a whole series of smaller opportunities that can be added to that business model. We continue to look for areas where we can strengthen our IP portfolio, like we did with Molina in health care. Or continuing to look at other practices to strengthen our, really, very strong position in Microsoft Dynamics 365 as well as ServiceNow where we've made significant investments. So I'd say that part of our capital allocation model that we've talked about will continue. And then, of course, the mix of returning share -- returning money to our shareholders as we've done, we've returned over $1 billion. We obviously thought our stock was a very good buy and have continued to plow money into that as well. So I don't see any major changes in the capital allocation model as we go forward. We've got to tighten up, as Paul said, on our working capital management, particularly our days sales outstanding, and that's difficult because there is a pretty strong push to try to extend those terms, particularly on these large ITO contracts. And it's another thing, as we look out longer, we see working capital moving in our favor. These shorter-term projects have a propensity to pay in a much quicker cycle than many of these large ITO contracts. So that's how we're thinking about it going forward, is we've got a capital allocation model, we're going to stick with that. We're very pleased with the Luxoft transaction. We think it's a quality acquisition at a fair price. And I think there'll be things that we'll be able to add on to that platform as we go forward. Does that answer your question?"

And if you look at the results of many of the players in this space, they're all relatively strong. The thing that I think really came to life for me was, this came around Luxoft in particular, is the different space that they are in. They are much more in what I'll call the business executive space, taking on digital projects that candidly, one DXC didn't see, and in many cases, weren't really considered because of the brand reputation we have around being able to run infrastructures and big application sets, those kinds of things. That is really going to change. And then, the underlying thing that's so important is all of these smaller digital projects ultimately have to get integrated into mainstream IP in order to really see the transformative benefits of these digital projects. And that's what our unique value proposition is. And we're staying with that along with our partners. And our partners bring a lot to the table here. And again, the Luxoft acquisition. Many of our partners work with Luxoft. And our clients are all, all on a digital journey, different places in that journey, but all on that digital journey. So as I said many, many times, this is a generational shift, and there is plenty of addressable market for everyone to participate in right now."

I think we will get to a more, as I said earlier on a previous question, we'll get to much more of a steady-state as we continue to remix our workforce. So in many cases, what you're seeing here is you're continuing to see an expansion of some of the margins in GIS because frankly, that's where a lot of the remix is taking place, and you're seeing a slight deterioration in the GBS margins. Overall, the margins for the company continue to expand. So I think it's a broader picture. It's going to be a remix. I don't think we'll continue with this sort of extraordinary effort to bootstrap ourselves in the digital hiring. But I honestly hope we have the demand going forward long term that we continue to do that. And in many cases, we're hiring teams of people, not just individuals, because a lot of these digital projects require scrum leaders, they require data scientists, they require software engineers. So more and more, as we remix this business portfolio, these aren't individual skills that get applied. They're teams that get applied to a digital business solution.

But you go in, you rapidly prototype that, you demonstrate that it works, and then you take the next step and you begin to scale.

Now I think it will continue to require us to go to market differently, source these opportunities differently as I just explained with Rod's question, and then, continue to hire into that demand. As I said, we use this annual billed revenue as sort of a metric internally. It's not ready for prime time yet in terms of audibility. But we use it internally. And we have seen an acceleration of this as we've gone through this year. I mean, the first -- we got off to a fairly slow start in the first quarter. We picked up some steam in the second quarter. Third quarter is the first quarter we've actually made our internal objectives around our digital sales. So we're beginning to see that pick up of steam. Now we got caught short, as we fully admitted, we got caught a little short because the demand got out a little bit in front of our ability to then source the people. And as I said, sourcing people is not individuals, it's more teams. And sometimes, you can't get started with these projects until it's a whole team. It doesn't do any good to have just the data scientists show up or analytics, if you also require software engineering as well. So that's the gap that we are closing. But I think the demand is there. This is a generational shift. We're making acquisitions. We're making investments. We're beginning to see that revenue tick up a little bit, we're beginning to see the sales tick up so those are encouraging signs. But I can promise you, it's not going to be a straight line here as we go forward. There's always going to be some twists and turns in the road, but we're really comfortable with the business model that's beginning to emerge."

Not 2 separate proposals that get stapled together in the lobby before we make the presentation. I'm talking about an integrated proposal.

But the CapEx as a percentage of revenue, that was a big theme, especially in the CSC days. 3% seems low, but since there are conversations about the free cash flow, I was just wondering, like, how should we be thinking about that going forward? Because I'm just wondering what the sustainable run rate of that is."

Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. As usual, I have my 4, 5 points to make, and then, I'll turn this over to Paul. And then, we'll have plenty of time for any of your questions.First, non-GAAP EPS in the third quarter was $2.23. Adjusted EBI",1578,"Okay. Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. As usual, I have my 4, 5 points to make, and then, I'll turn this over to Paul. And then, we'll have plenty of time for any of your questions.
First, non-GAAP EPS in the third quarter was $2.23. Adjusted EBIT was $840 million and adjusted EBIT margin was 16.2%, and we generated $503 million of adjusted free cash flow in the third quarter. In terms of revenue in the third quarter, revenue was $5.178 billion on a GAAP basis. In constant currency, revenue was down 2.6% year-over-year and was up 4.3% sequentially. Bookings were up 3% year-over-year and 22% up sequentially for a book-to-bill of 1.1x.
A third point around digital. In constant currency, our digital revenue grew 16.9% year-over-year and 9.5% sequentially, driven by strong bookings in the first half of the year, particularly in cloud. Digital bookings in the quarter were up 85% year-over-year for a book-to-bill of 2.1x. Bookings were very strong across all digital offering families, and cloud has 3.3x book-to-bill in the quarter. Industry IP and BPS revenue was up 2.6% year-over-year and 6% sequentially, and the industry IP, BPS book-to-bill was 0.8x.
Fourth, we continued to make strategic investments in digital assets and capabilities. As you know, we recently announced our plan to acquire Luxoft, a global at-scale digital innovator, with differentiated offerings and platforms, deep vertical expertise and a world-class digital talent workforce. Luxoft has over $900 million in revenue, and has been growing at strong double-digit rates. We also announced our plan to acquire the services division of EG, one of the leading integrators of Microsoft Dynamics 365 in Northern Europe.
And then, finally, for fiscal 2019, we continue to target revenue in the range of $20.7 billion to $21.2 billion, and we're raising our non-GAAP EPS target to a range of $8.15 to $8.30.
So let me just go into a little more detail on each of those points before I turn it over to Paul. As I said, the third quarter non-GAAP EPS was $2.23. The effective tax rate was 20.4%. Third quarter adjusted EBIT was $840 million, and the adjusted EBIT margin was 16.2%, up 160 basis points year-over-year and 30 basis points sequentially. This margin improvement reflects continued execution of the levers that we have previously discussed.
GBS segment profit margin was 18.2%, which was down 10 basis points year-over-year and 70 basis points sequentially. This reflects the investments we're making to accelerate digital hiring and expand our digital transformation capabilities.
In GIS, segment profit margin was 17.5%, up 320 basis points year-over-year and 120 basis points sequentially. The GIS margin expansion was driven by our ongoing global deployment of Bionix, delivery center rationalization and the benefit of some final milestone achievements on a few of our contracts. And adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $503 million or 81% of adjusted net income.
Now let me go to revenue. As I said, revenue in the third quarter was $5.178 billion on a GAAP basis. In constant currency, revenue was down 2.6% year-over-year and was up 4.3% sequentially. Bookings were up 3% year-over-year and 22% up sequentially, for a book-to-bill of 1.1x. Since the end of October, we've hired over 1,000 digital employees. And as we previously discussed, we centralized digital hiring efforts with a strong focus on our digital transformation centers. These roles include AWS and Azure architects, data scientists, and DevOps engineers, and others. We've also identified an additional 2,000 current DXC employees to be reskilled in digital technologies. We're rapidly correcting the hiring delays that we discussed in the second quarter and will continue to accelerate hiring and training efforts in support of our fastest-growing capabilities.
Now I also believe that the Luxoft acquisition will allow DXC to accelerate its digital hiring efforts and reduce the time to fulfill digital demand for clients. Luxoft's established digital delivery footprint will also improve the client proximity for many of DXC's digital capabilities.
In the third quarter, GBS revenue was $2.17 billion, down 4% year-over-year in constant currency and up 3.7% sequentially. The year-over-year decline was driven by the ongoing headwinds in legacy application services as well as the completion of several large transformation projects we've previously discussed. GBS bookings in the quarter were up 3.1% sequentially, for a book-to-bill of 1x.
GIS revenue in the quarter was $3 billion. GIS revenue was down 1.5% year-over-year in constant currency, and was up 4.8% sequentially. The sequential revenue growth reflects the good progress made in our digital business, including cloud infrastructure, cybersecurity, and our digital workplace offering. Overall, GIS bookings were up 38% sequentially and the book-to-bill in the quarter was 1.1x. This reflects continued strength in our cloud and digital workplace offerings, and the bookings associated with them.
Now let me turn to digital industry IP and BPS. In constant currency, digital revenue was up 16.9% year-over-year. Digital bookings continue to be very strong with a 2 to 1 -- 2.1x book-to-bill, driven by our cloud infrastructure, and as I said, our digital workplace offerings. Our digital pipeline is also up more than 90% year-over-year, which reflects the strong demand we're seeing toward digital solutions. For example, we signed a large deal with a European automotive manufacturer that includes analytics, multi-platform cloud, and security. The solution includes deep learning and simulation platforms designed to accelerate the R&D for autonomous vehicles. We're the only provider who could demonstrate the ability to deliver these infrastructure and analytics capabilities at scale.
In constant currency, our cloud infrastructure business grew 32% in the quarter and was up 13.4% sequentially. Again, reflecting the strength of our cloud bookings during the first half of the year. Book-to-bill in the quarter was 3.3x, including expanded deals with a major European bank, and the automotive manufacturer I just highlighted.
Our security business grew 4.5% year-over-year in constant currency and 11% sequentially, driven by strong growth in Northern Europe and Asia. Book-to-bill in the quarter was 1.4x, including a deal with a large financial services provider, where DXC is partnering with CrowdStrike to provide managed endpoint threat detection and response services. We're also seeing increased demand for our operational technology security solutions in the manufacturing and energy sectors.
Enterprise cloud apps and consulting grew 2.7% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. Bookings in the quarter were strong and the book-to-bill was 1.4x. Wins in the quarter included a ServiceNow deal with a major U.S. food manufacturer. The solution leverages Platform DXC, and will migrate their existing IP services management processes on to a ServiceNow platform. We also won SAP S/4HANA deals with a European satellite operator and a multinational technology company.
In constant currency, industry IP and BPS revenue was up 2.6% year-over-year and 6% sequentially, reflecting the acquisition of Molina Medicaid Health Solutions, which expanded our business supporting state agencies in the administration of Medicaid programs, and adds to our overall health care IP portfolio.
Now moving to my fourth point. We continue to make investments in digital assets and capabilities. As we discussed in November, we acquired argodesign, the digital design consultancy based in Austin. Argodesign will enhance DXC's capabilities in interface design and user experience, which are key elements in developing and delivering digital transformation solutions and scale. During the third quarter, we also completed the acquisitions of BusinessNow and TESM, which will further expand our industry-leading ServiceNow practice.
As we said, we recently announced the planned acquisition of Luxoft Holding. We believe this transaction will create significant value through revenue synergies and access to a broader pool of digital talent. Luxoft strengthens DXC's portfolio of digital offerings with proven capabilities in high-growth areas, including analytics and business intelligence, user experience, IoT, and blockchain. Luxoft also has a very strong outsourced engineering business.
Luxoft has highly-skilled digital workforce of more than 13,000 people, and as I said earlier, an established digital recruiting engine. More than 80% of Luxoft's workforce has a Master's Degree or Ph.D., and their engineering talent is primarily housed in central and eastern European delivery centers. This market provides a significant source of digital talent. We're estimating 2 to 3 -- $300 million to $400 million of incremental revenue for the combined company by fiscal year '22. We believe there's an opportunity to expand wallet share with each company's respective clients. Further, we'll be able to expand Luxoft's existing platforms into additional geographies and industries. Luxoft's digital talent acquisition capabilities will also accelerate DXC's ability to capitalize on digital demand from our clients. And we'll remain on track to close the Luxoft transaction by the end of June.
And in January, we announced a plan to acquire Microsoft Dynamics' practice of EG. The combination of EG with DXC Eclipse will extend DXC's leadership as a global Dynamics 365 systems integrator and will greatly enhance the scale of DXC's capabilities in the Nordic region. 
And then, my final point before I turn it over to Paul is we expect additional sequential revenue growth in the fourth quarter. We're still targeting revenue in the range of $20.7 billion to $21.2 billion, although we are currently trending towards the lower half of that range, given some of the currency headwinds that we see. We're increasing our non-GAAP EPS targets to a range of $8.15 to $8.30, reflecting our accelerated pace of share repurchases, and a lower tax rate than originally planned.
So I'll turn it over to Paul, and then, we'll be back for questions."

As usual, I'll start by covering some items that are excluded from our non-GAAP results.In the quarter, we had restructuring costs of $76 million on a pretax basis or $0.21 per diluted share. These costs represe",1078,"Thank you, Mike, and greetings, everyone. As usual, I'll start by covering some items that are excluded from our non-GAAP results.
In the quarter, we had restructuring costs of $76 million on a pretax basis or $0.21 per diluted share. These costs represent severance related to workforce optimization programs, particularly in complex countries, and also expenses associated with facilities and data center rationalization. Also in the quarter, we had $107 million pretax or $0.29 per diluted share of transaction, separation, and integration-related costs, including the acquisition of Molina. Year-to-date, restructuring, transaction, separation and integration costs amounted to $723 million pretax or $1.94 per diluted share.
In the third quarter, amortization of acquired intangibles was $134 million pretax or $0.35 per diluted share. Excluding the impact of these special items, non-GAAP income before taxes from continuing operations was $786 million and non-GAAP EPS was $2.23.
Now before I turn to our third quarter results in more detail, I'd like to point out a correction that we included in the non-GAAP section of our press release regarding adjusted free cash flow. In the second quarter, DXC expanded the use of its receivable facility, and should have excluded the benefit of that expansion from adjusted free cash flow. Year-to-date, adjusted free cash flow has now been revised to accurately reflect the net impact of the receivables facility, and that resulted in a $223 million net cumulative reduction year-to-date. As a result of that correction, adjusted free cash flow for the first 9 months was $1.2 billion or 68% of adjusted net income.
Now let me move on to our third quarter results in more detail. GAAP revenue in the third quarter was $5.178 billion, a sequential increase of 4.3%. Adjusted EBIT in the quarter was $840 million. Adjusted EBIT margin was 16.2%, reflecting the progress we're making in our margin improvement plans. For the fiscal year, we remain on track to deliver our $575 million cost takeout target.
During the quarter, we continued to optimize our workforce and drive procurement efficiencies. We reduced our headcount by roughly 3,000 people during the quarter, and that is excluding sub [indiscernible] and the Molina acquisition. Year-over-year, total headcount [indiscernible] over 14,000, driven by ongoing productivity efforts, including our Bionix automation program.
In supply chain, we're driving procurement efficiencies, including increased use of consumption-based purchase agreements for infrastructure and software. We also have expanded our category management capabilities to better leverage our strategic suppliers and consolidate vendors.
Turning to real estate. We eliminated an additional 1.5 million square feet during the quarter. And we've also closed 7 data centers and are on track to exit 2 to 3 additional data centers this fiscal year. We're also reinvesting in the business this fiscal year, including the acceleration of digital hiring, continued deployment of Bionix, expansion of our digital transformation centers and the continued build-out of key offerings,including AWS and Microsoft Azure solutions.
In the quarter, our non-GAAP EPS tax rate was 20.4%, reflecting our global mix of income and the timing of certain changes in tax attributes in key foreign jurisdictions. For the full year, we now expect the tax rate to be at the lower end of our previous range of 24% to 28%, and that implies a tax rate of slightly above 30% in the fourth quarter. Year-to-date, revenue was $15.5 billion. Adjusted EBIT was $2.4 billion [indiscernible] was 15.8%, and booking were $14.9 billion for a book-to-bill of 1x.
Turning to our segment results. GBS revenue was $2.17 billion in the third quarter, a sequential increase of 3.7%. In the third quarter, GBS segment profit was $395 million, and profit margins was 18.2%, and that is including the investment we are making in expanding our digital capabilities. Year-to-date, GBS revenue was $6.5 billion, segment profit was $1.2 billion, margin was 18.5%, and bookings were $6.4 billion for a book-to-bill of 1x.
GIS revenue was $3.01 billion in the quarter, up 4.8% in constant currency, sequentially. GIS segment profit in the third quarter was $528 million. Profit margin was 17.5%. Now the segment profit margin for GIS reflect the impact of actions we're taking to drive greater operating efficiencies, including delivery and data center rationalization, as well as the benefit of final milestone achievement on a few contracts. Year-to-date, GIS revenue was $9 billion, segment profit was $1.5 billion, margin was 16.4%, and bookings were $8.5 billion, for a book-to-bill of 0.9x.
Now let me turn to other financial highlights. Adjusted free cash flow in the third quarter was $503 million or 81% of adjusted net income. As I previously covered, year-to-date adjusted free cash flow was $1.2 billion. Year-to-date free cash flow performance is impacted by an increase of 5 to 6 days in days sales outstanding, driven primarily by extended payment terms on large traditional contracts. Now we have efforts underway to improve our working capital performance, and to incentivize our [indiscernible] to be even more focused on collections. However, given the time remaining this fiscal year, we're revising our adjusted free cash flow targets for the year to 70% to 80% of adjusted net income.
Our CapEx was $153 million in the quarter or 3% of revenue, including the benefit of asset dispositions. Year-to-date CapEx was $829 million or 5.4% of revenue. Cash at the end of the quarter was $2.5 billion. Our total debt was $7.56 billion, including capital leases, for a net debt to total capital ratio of 26.9%. Following the announcement of the Luxoft acquisition, all 3 rating agencies reaffirmed DXC's rating and outlook.
Now during the third quarter, we paid $54 million in dividends, and we've repurchased $797 million in shares for a total of $851 million in capital returned to shareholders. Year-to-date, we've returned $1.4 billion of capital to our shareholders in the form of $159 million [ in cash dividend ] and $1.2 billion in share repurchases. In the fourth quarter, we expect to continue to return capital to shareholders, but at a more moderate pace.
In closing, we continue to target revenue in the range of $20.7 billion to $21.2 billion. Although given our current -- the currency headwinds that we're seeing, we're trending toward the lower half of that range. We've raised our EPS target range to $8.15 to $8.30, reflecting the pace of share repurchases and a tax rate that's trending toward the lower end of our targeted range.
I'll now hand the call back to the operator for our Q&A session."

We've made -- we talked about this at the end of the second quarter. We clearly fell behind in the hiring. And we've made a big investment in the processes, and our tools, and frankly, much better planning at the account level. I can't tell you what a little discipline does because that gives us a much better demand signal. And then, we are able to turn the hiring machine and the processes on to get that done. The other thing to tell is we -- Jim, have centralized a lot of this digital hiring. So we've put a very thorough skills taxonomy together, and we're hiring these people into our digital delivery centers. And then, we're deploying those people as the projects get firmed up and signed by the customer. That's a whole different process than trying to do this account by account. We're also seeing a significant improvement in the quality of the people and the skills that we're bringing in. So I think to net this out, I think we'll get to more of a steady state in terms of hiring sort of the first half of next fiscal year. But we'll continue to remix the workforce. I mean, Paul talked about 14,000 reduction is true, but on the other side of that is we've hired thousands of people into these new businesses. And that remix of the workforce, both the reskilling of existing as well as bringing new people in, that's going to continue for a long time. So I think these digital delivery centers, I think that's helped us. We're getting better candidates. The tools, the processes, the discipline, and frankly, people see that we're attracting, they see really good career opportunities in digital as they look out over the next medium to longer term. And one other point is probably a longer answer than you're looking for. But I mean, Luxoft has really helped in terms of their brand and their reputation in the digital space as well. So I think this was a strong signal that we were serious about really jump-starting or catapulting us and our skills into a slightly different space than where we were prior to the second quarter. Paul, I don't know if you want to add anything..."

When exactly are they going to close? I don't know. That gets a little lumpy. I think it can continue in the fourth quarter, and even into the first quarter based on what we see in the pipeline. But the more important trend is underneath that. And that is what I'll call shorter duration project work. I think I've mentioned this before, but we now are compensating many of our people in our delivery organization for what we call delivery-led growth. These are shorter-term projects where we can assign people very quickly and generate incremental revenue. Our digital projects are largely of shorter duration. They usually start out smaller, and then, tend to expand and scale over time. So the dynamics of our bookings are changing as our business model and portfolio begins to shift on a total reliance on big deals, big TCV deals. That reliance is beginning to diminish as we move the portfolio to a much higher number, higher volume of digital projects. We consider that good. When we looked into Luxoft's book of business, it's the exact same profile that we're beginning to experience in our business. So that, I think, bodes well as we go forward."

As you look at the balance between potentially doing more acquisitions, divestitures or other ways of unlocking shareholder value, maybe you can give us some insight into what your thought process is around that, over the short and long term. Are you more likely to be in the digital market to continue to buy stuff, divestitures, picking on acquisition for cost cutting?"

You said that. We have all options on the table all the time. Candidly, I don't see a lot of divestitures as I look out because we have really remixed the portfolio quite dramatically over the last couple of years. I do think we'll see some more smaller tuck-in type acquisitions, particularly, in the digital space. So assuming we get the Luxoft transaction completed, there's a whole series of smaller opportunities that can be added to that business model. We continue to look for areas where we can strengthen our IP portfolio, like we did with Molina in health care. Or continuing to look at other practices to strengthen our, really, very strong position in Microsoft Dynamics 365 as well as ServiceNow where we've made significant investments. So I'd say that part of our capital allocation model that we've talked about will continue. And then, of course, the mix of returning share -- returning money to our shareholders as we've done, we've returned over $1 billion. We obviously thought our stock was a very good buy and have continued to plow money into that as well. So I don't see any major changes in the capital allocation model as we go forward. We've got to tighten up, as Paul said, on our working capital management, particularly our days sales outstanding, and that's difficult because there is a pretty strong push to try to extend those terms, particularly on these large ITO contracts. And it's another thing, as we look out longer, we see working capital moving in our favor. These shorter-term projects have a propensity to pay in a much quicker cycle than many of these large ITO contracts. So that's how we're thinking about it going forward, is we've got a capital allocation model, we're going to stick with that. We're very pleased with the Luxoft transaction. We think it's a quality acquisition at a fair price. And I think there'll be things that we'll be able to add on to that platform as we go forward. Does that answer your question?"

And if you look at the results of many of the players in this space, they're all relatively strong. The thing that I think really came to life for me was, this came around Luxoft in particular, is the different space that they are in. They are much more in what I'll call the business executive space, taking on digital projects that candidly, one DXC didn't see, and in many cases, weren't really considered because of the brand reputation we have around being able to run infrastructures and big application sets, those kinds of things. That is really going to change. And then, the underlying thing that's so important is all of these smaller digital projects ultimately have to get integrated into mainstream IP in order to really see the transformative benefits of these digital projects. And that's what our unique value proposition is. And we're staying with that along with our partners. And our partners bring a lot to the table here. And again, the Luxoft acquisition. Many of our partners work with Luxoft. And our clients are all, all on a digital journey, different places in that journey, but all on that digital journey. So as I said many, many times, this is a generational shift, and there is plenty of addressable market for everyone to participate in right now."

I think we will get to a more, as I said earlier on a previous question, we'll get to much more of a steady-state as we continue to remix our workforce. So in many cases, what you're seeing here is you're continuing to see an expansion of some of the margins in GIS because frankly, that's where a lot of the remix is taking place, and you're seeing a slight deterioration in the GBS margins. Overall, the margins for the company continue to expand. So I think it's a broader picture. It's going to be a remix. I don't think we'll continue with this sort of extraordinary effort to bootstrap ourselves in the digital hiring. But I honestly hope we have the demand going forward long term that we continue to do that. And in many cases, we're hiring teams of people, not just individuals, because a lot of these digital projects require scrum leaders, they require data scientists, they require software engineers. So more and more, as we remix this business portfolio, these aren't individual skills that get applied. They're teams that get applied to a digital business solution.

So we go and we problem-solve. That usually results in some sort of statement of work or project that may not be huge. Some of these are measured in hundreds of thousands of dollars, not millions. But you go in, you rapidly prototype that, you demonstrate that it works, and then you take the next step and you begin to scale.

Now I think it will continue to require us to go to market differently, source these opportunities differently as I just explained with Rod's question, and then, continue to hire into that demand. As I said, we use this annual billed revenue as sort of a metric internally. It's not ready for prime time yet in terms of audibility. But we use it internally. And we have seen an acceleration of this as we've gone through this year. I mean, the first -- we got off to a fairly slow start in the first quarter. We picked up some steam in the second quarter. Third quarter is the first quarter we've actually made our internal objectives around our digital sales. So we're beginning to see that pick up steam. Now we got caught short, as we fully admitted, we got caught a little short because the demand got out a little bit in front of our ability to then source the people. And as I said, sourcing people is not individuals, it's more teams. And sometimes, you can't get started with these projects until it's a whole team. It doesn't do any good to have just the data scientists show up for analytics, if you also require software engineering as well. So that's the gap that we are closing. But I think the demand is there. This is a generational shift. We're making acquisitions. We're making investments. We're beginning to see that revenue tick up a little bit, we're beginning to see the sales tick up so those are encouraging signs.

So we will sit down with a Microsoft, or we'll sit down with an AWS, or we'll sit down with an AT&T, and we will select accounts where we're going to work together in that account. Now what we're finding is when we do partner more deeply like that, when I say partner, I'm talking about joint proposals. Not 2 separate proposals that get stapled together in the lobby before we make the presentation. I'm talking about an integrated proposal. And we're seeing win rates go up dramatically, and I mean, dramatically like 20 points when we do that. Now that is not only obvious to us, but it's also becoming clearer and clearer to our partners. Our partners do source incremental opportunities that we can go after.

And at the end of the day, the most important thing I'm trying to drive across the company is continued sequential growth and continued strong, digital performance underneath that. Now, our IP portfolio is also beginning to grow. It's not growing as much as it needs to grow, but it is beginning to grow.

Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. As usual, I have my 4, 5 points to make, and then, I'll turn this over to Paul. And then, we'll have plenty of time for any of your questions.First, non-GAAP EPS in the third quarter was $2.23. Adjusted EBI",1578,"Okay. Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. As usual, I have my 4, 5 points to make, and then, I'll turn this over to Paul. And then, we'll have plenty of time for any of your questions.
First, non-GAAP EPS in the third quarter was $2.23. Adjusted EBIT was $840 million and adjusted EBIT margin was 16.2%, and we generated $503 million of adjusted free cash flow in the third quarter. In terms of revenue in the third quarter, revenue was $5.178 billion on a GAAP basis. In constant currency, revenue was down 2.6% year-over-year and was up 4.3% sequentially. Bookings were up 3% year-over-year and 22% up sequentially for a book-to-bill of 1.1x.
A third point around digital. In constant currency, our digital revenue grew 16.9% year-over-year and 9.5% sequentially, driven by strong bookings in the first half of the year, particularly in cloud. Digital bookings in the quarter were up 85% year-over-year for a book-to-bill of 2.1x. Bookings were very strong across all digital offering families, and cloud has 3.3x book-to-bill in the quarter. Industry IP and BPS revenue was up 2.6% year-over-year and 6% sequentially, and the industry IP, BPS book-to-bill was 0.8x.
Fourth, we continued to make strategic investments in digital assets and capabilities. As you know, we recently announced our plan to acquire Luxoft, a global at-scale digital innovator, with differentiated offerings and platforms, deep vertical expertise and a world-class digital talent workforce. Luxoft has over $900 million in revenue, and has been growing at strong double-digit rates. We also announced our plan to acquire the services division of EG, one of the leading integrators of Microsoft Dynamics 365 in Northern Europe.
And then, finally, for fiscal 2019, we continue to target revenue in the range of $20.7 billion to $21.2 billion, and we're raising our non-GAAP EPS target to a range of $8.15 to $8.30.
So let me just go into a little more detail on each of those points before I turn it over to Paul. As I said, the third quarter non-GAAP EPS was $2.23. The effective tax rate was 20.4%. Third quarter adjusted EBIT was $840 million, and the adjusted EBIT margin was 16.2%, up 160 basis points year-over-year and 30 basis points sequentially. This margin improvement reflects continued execution of the levers that we have previously discussed.
GBS segment profit margin was 18.2%, which was down 10 basis points year-over-year and 70 basis points sequentially. This reflects the investments we're making to accelerate digital hiring and expand our digital transformation capabilities.
In GIS, segment profit margin was 17.5%, up 320 basis points year-over-year and 120 basis points sequentially. The GIS margin expansion was driven by our ongoing global deployment of Bionix, delivery center rationalization and the benefit of some final milestone achievements on a few of our contracts. And adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $503 million or 81% of adjusted net income.
Now let me go to revenue. As I said, revenue in the third quarter was $5.178 billion on a GAAP basis. In constant currency, revenue was down 2.6% year-over-year and was up 4.3% sequentially. Bookings were up 3% year-over-year and 22% up sequentially, for a book-to-bill of 1.1x. Since the end of October, we've hired over 1,000 digital employees. And as we previously discussed, we centralized digital hiring efforts with a strong focus on our digital transformation centers. These roles include AWS and Azure architects, data scientists, and DevOps engineers, and others. We've also identified an additional 2,000 current DXC employees to be reskilled in digital technologies. We're rapidly correcting the hiring delays that we discussed in the second quarter and will continue to accelerate hiring and training efforts in support of our fastest-growing capabilities.
Now I also believe that the Luxoft acquisition will allow DXC to accelerate its digital hiring efforts and reduce the time to fulfill digital demand for clients. Luxoft's established digital delivery footprint will also improve the client proximity for many of DXC's digital capabilities.
In the third quarter, GBS revenue was $2.17 billion, down 4% year-over-year in constant currency and up 3.7% sequentially. The year-over-year decline was driven by the ongoing headwinds in legacy application services as well as the completion of several large transformation projects we've previously discussed. GBS bookings in the quarter were up 3.1% sequentially, for a book-to-bill of 1x.
GIS revenue in the quarter was $3 billion. GIS revenue was down 1.5% year-over-year in constant currency, and was up 4.8% sequentially. The sequential revenue growth reflects the good progress made in our digital business, including cloud infrastructure, cybersecurity, and our digital workplace offering. Overall, GIS bookings were up 38% sequentially and the book-to-bill in the quarter was 1.1x. This reflects continued strength in our cloud and digital workplace offerings, and the bookings associated with them.
Now let me turn to digital industry IP and BPS. In constant currency, digital revenue was up 16.9% year-over-year. Digital bookings continue to be very strong with a 2 to 1 -- 2.1x book-to-bill, driven by our cloud infrastructure, and as I said, our digital workplace offerings. Our digital pipeline is also up more than 90% year-over-year, which reflects the strong demand we're seeing toward digital solutions. For example, we signed a large deal with a European automotive manufacturer that includes analytics, multi-platform cloud, and security. The solution includes deep learning and simulation platforms designed to accelerate the R&D for autonomous vehicles. We're the only provider who could demonstrate the ability to deliver these infrastructure and analytics capabilities at scale.
In constant currency, our cloud infrastructure business grew 32% in the quarter and was up 13.4% sequentially. Again, reflecting the strength of our cloud bookings during the first half of the year. Book-to-bill in the quarter was 3.3x, including expanded deals with a major European bank, and the automotive manufacturer I just highlighted.
Our security business grew 4.5% year-over-year in constant currency and 11% sequentially, driven by strong growth in Northern Europe and Asia. Book-to-bill in the quarter was 1.4x, including a deal with a large financial services provider, where DXC is partnering with CrowdStrike to provide managed endpoint threat detection and response services. We're also seeing increased demand for our operational technology security solutions in the manufacturing and energy sectors.
Enterprise cloud apps and consulting grew 2.7% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. Bookings in the quarter were strong and the book-to-bill was 1.4x. Wins in the quarter included a ServiceNow deal with a major U.S. food manufacturer. The solution leverages Platform DXC, and will migrate their existing IP services management processes on to a ServiceNow platform. We also won SAP S/4HANA deals with a European satellite operator and a multinational technology company.
In constant currency, industry IP and BPS revenue was up 2.6% year-over-year and 6% sequentially, reflecting the acquisition of Molina Medicaid Health Solutions, which expanded our business supporting state agencies in the administration of Medicaid programs, and adds to our overall health care IP portfolio.
Now moving to my fourth point. We continue to make investments in digital assets and capabilities. As we discussed in November, we acquired argodesign, the digital design consultancy based in Austin. Argodesign will enhance DXC's capabilities in interface design and user experience, which are key elements in developing and delivering digital transformation solutions and scale. During the third quarter, we also completed the acquisitions of BusinessNow and TESM, which will further expand our industry-leading ServiceNow practice.
As we said, we recently announced the planned acquisition of Luxoft Holding. We believe this transaction will create significant value through revenue synergies and access to a broader pool of digital talent. Luxoft strengthens DXC's portfolio of digital offerings with proven capabilities in high-growth areas, including analytics and business intelligence, user experience, IoT, and blockchain. Luxoft also has a very strong outsourced engineering business.
Luxoft has highly-skilled digital workforce of more than 13,000 people, and as I said earlier, an established digital recruiting engine. More than 80% of Luxoft's workforce has a Master's Degree or Ph.D., and their engineering talent is primarily housed in central and eastern European delivery centers. This market provides a significant source of digital talent. We're estimating 2 to 3 -- $300 million to $400 million of incremental revenue for the combined company by fiscal year '22. We believe there's an opportunity to expand wallet share with each company's respective clients. Further, we'll be able to expand Luxoft's existing platforms into additional geographies and industries. Luxoft's digital talent acquisition capabilities will also accelerate DXC's ability to capitalize on digital demand from our clients. And we'll remain on track to close the Luxoft transaction by the end of June.
And in January, we announced a plan to acquire Microsoft Dynamics' practice of EG. The combination of EG with DXC Eclipse will extend DXC's leadership as a global Dynamics 365 systems integrator and will greatly enhance the scale of DXC's capabilities in the Nordic region. 
And then, my final point before I turn it over to Paul is we expect additional sequential revenue growth in the fourth quarter. We're still targeting revenue in the range of $20.7 billion to $21.2 billion, although we are currently trending towards the lower half of that range, given some of the currency headwinds that we see. We're increasing our non-GAAP EPS targets to a range of $8.15 to $8.30, reflecting our accelerated pace of share repurchases, and a lower tax rate than originally planned.
So I'll turn it over to Paul, and then, we'll be back for questions."

In the quarter, we had restructuring costs of $76 million on a pretax basis or $0.21 per diluted share. These costs represent severance related to workforce optimization programs, particularly in complex countries, and also expenses associated with facilities and data center rationalization. Also in the quarter, we had $107 million pretax or $0.29 per diluted share of transaction, separation, and integration-related costs, including the acquisition of Molina. Year-to-date, restructuring, transaction, separation and integration costs amounted to $723 million pretax or $1.94 per diluted share.
In the third quarter, amortization of acquired intangibles was $134 million pretax or $0.35 per diluted share. Excluding the impact of these special items, non-GAAP income before taxes from continuing operations was $786 million and non-GAAP EPS was $2.23.
Now before I turn to our third quarter results in more detail, I'd like to point out a correction that we included in the non-GAAP section of our press release regarding adjusted free cash flow. In the second quarter, DXC expanded the use of its receivable facility, and should have excluded the benefit of that expansion from adjusted free cash flow. Year-to-date, adjusted free cash flow has now been revised to accurately reflect the net impact of the receivables facility, and that resulted in a $223 million net cumulative reduction year-to-date. As a result of that correction, adjusted free cash flow for the first 9 months was $1.2 billion or 68% of adjusted net income.
Now let me move on to our third quarter results in more detail. GAAP revenue in the third quarter was $5.178 billion, a sequential increase of 4.3%. Adjusted EBIT in the quarter was $840 million. Adjusted EBIT margin was 16.2%, reflecting the progress we're making in our margin improvement plans. For the fiscal year, we remain on track to deliver our $575 million cost takeout target.
During the quarter, we continued to optimize our workforce and drive procurement efficiencies. We reduced our headcount by roughly 3,000 people during the quarter, and that is excluding sub [indiscernible] and the Molina acquisition. Year-over-year, total headcount [indiscernible] over 14,000, driven by ongoing productivity efforts, including our Bionix automation program.
In supply chain, we're driving procurement efficiencies, including increased use of consumption-based purchase agreements for infrastructure and software. We also have expanded our category management capabilities to better leverage our strategic suppliers and consolidate vendors.
Turning to real estate. We eliminated an additional 1.5 million square feet during the quarter. And we've also closed 7 data centers and are on track to exit 2 to 3 additional data centers this fiscal year. We're also reinvesting in the business this fiscal year, including the acceleration of digital hiring, continued deployment of Bionix, expansion of our digital transformation centers and the continued build-out of key offerings, including AWS and Microsoft Azure solutions.
In the quarter, our non-GAAP EPS tax rate was 20.4%, reflecting our global mix of income and the timing of certain changes in tax attributes in key foreign jurisdictions. For the full year, we now expect the tax rate to be at the lower end of our previous range of 24% to 28%, and that implies a tax rate of slightly above 30% in the fourth quarter. Year-to-date, revenue was $15.5 billion. Adjusted EBIT was $2.4 billion [indiscernible] was 15.8%, and booking were $14.9 billion for a book-to-bill of 1x.
Turning to our segment results. GBS revenue was $2.17 billion in the third quarter, a sequential increase of 3.7%. In the third quarter, GBS segment profit was $395 million, and profit margins was 18.2%, and that is including the investment we are making in expanding our digital capabilities. Year-to-date, GBS revenue was $6.5 billion, segment profit was $1.2 billion, margin was 18.5%, and bookings were $6.4 billion for a book-to-bill of 1x.
GIS revenue was $3.01 billion in the quarter, up 4.8% in constant currency, sequentially. GIS segment profit in the third quarter was $528 million. Profit margin was 17.5%. Now the segment profit margin for GIS reflect the impact of actions we're taking to drive greater operating efficiencies, including delivery and data center rationalization, as well as the benefit of final milestone achievement on a few contracts. Year-to-date, GIS revenue was $9 billion, segment profit was $1.5 billion, margin was 16.4%, and bookings were $8.5 billion, for a book-to-bill of 0.9x.
Now let me turn to other financial highlights. Adjusted free cash flow in the third quarter was $503 million or 81% of adjusted net income. As I previously covered, year-to-date adjusted free cash flow was $1.2 billion. Year-to-date free cash flow performance is impacted by an increase of 5 to 6 days in days sales outstanding, driven primarily by extended payment terms on large traditional contracts. Now we have efforts underway to improve our working capital performance, and to incentivize our [indiscernible] to be even more focused on collections. However, given the time remaining this fiscal year, we're revising our adjusted free cash flow targets for the year to 70% to 80% of adjusted net income.
Our CapEx was $153 million in the quarter or 3% of revenue, including the benefit of asset dispositions. Year-to-date CapEx was $829 million or 5.4% of revenue. Cash at the end of the quarter was $2.5 billion. Our total debt was $7.56 billion, including capital leases, for a net debt to total capital ratio of 26.9%. Following the announcement of the Luxoft acquisition, all 3 rating agencies reaffirmed DXC's rating and outlook.
Now during the third quarter, we paid $54 million in dividends, and we've repurchased $797 million in shares for a total of $851 million in capital returned to shareholders. Year-to-date, we've returned $1.4 billion of capital to our shareholders in the form of $159 million [ in cash dividend ] and $1.2 billion in share repurchases. In the fourth quarter, we expect to continue to return capital to shareholders, but at a more moderate pace.
In closing, we continue to target revenue in the range of $20.7 billion to $21.2 billion. Although given our current -- the currency headwinds that we're seeing, we're trending toward the lower half of that range. We've raised our EPS target range to $8.15 to $8.30, reflecting the pace of share repurchases and a tax rate that's trending toward the lower end of our targeted range.
I'll now hand the call back to the operator for our Q&A session."

We've made -- we talked about this at the end of the second quarter. We clearly fell behind in the hiring. And we've made a big investment in the processes, and our tools, and frankly, much better planning at the account level. I can't tell you what a little discipline does because that gives us a much better demand signal. And then, we are able to turn the hiring machine and the processes on to get that done. The other thing to tell is we -- Jim, have centralized a lot of this digital hiring. So we've put a very thorough skills taxonomy together, and we're hiring these people into our digital delivery centers. And then, we're deploying those people as the projects get firmed up and signed by the customer. That's a whole different process than trying to do this account by account. We're also seeing a significant improvement in the quality of the people and the skills that we're bringing in. So I think to net this out, I think we'll get to more of a steady state in terms of hiring sort of the first half of next fiscal year. But we'll continue to remix the workforce. I mean, Paul talked about 14,000 reduction is true, but on the other side of that is we've hired thousands of people into these new businesses. And that remix of the workforce, both the reskilling of existing as well as bringing new people in, that's going to continue for a long time. So I think these digital delivery centers, I think that's helped us. We're getting better candidates. The tools, the processes, the discipline, and frankly, people see that we're attracting, they see really good career opportunities in digital as they look out over the next medium to longer term. And one other point is probably a longer answer than you're looking for. But I mean, Luxoft has really helped in terms of their brand and their reputation in the digital space as well. So I think this was a strong signal that we were serious about really jump-starting or catapulting us and our skills into a slightly different space than where we were prior to the second quarter.

And then, anything you can say relative to any potential new logos or how much you see kind of digital playing into the near-term bookings environment?"

That's not going to change. I mean, are we working on a lot of big deals? Yes, we are. When exactly are they going to close? I don't know. That gets a little lumpy.

When exactly are they going to close? I don't know. That gets a little lumpy. I think it can continue in the fourth quarter, and even into the first quarter based on what we see in the pipeline. But the more important trend is underneath that. And that is what I'll call shorter duration project work. I think I've mentioned this before, but we now are compensating many of our people in our delivery organization for what we call delivery-led growth. These are shorter-term projects where we can assign people very quickly and generate incremental revenue. Our digital projects are largely of shorter duration. They usually start out smaller, and then, tend to expand and scale over time. So the dynamics of our bookings are changing as our business model and portfolio begins to shift on a total reliance on big deals, big TCV deals. That reliance is beginning to diminish as we move the portfolio to a much higher number, higher volume of digital projects. We consider that good. When we looked into Luxoft's book of business, it's the exact same profile that we're beginning to experience in our business. So that, I think, bodes well as we go forward."

You said that. We have all options on the table all the time. Candidly, I don't see a lot of divestitures as I look out because we have really remixed the portfolio quite dramatically over the last couple of years. I do think we'll see some more smaller tuck-in type acquisitions, particularly, in the digital space. So assuming we get the Luxoft transaction completed, there's a whole series of smaller opportunities that can be added to that business model. We continue to look for areas where we can strengthen our IP portfolio, like we did with Molina in health care. Or continuing to look at other practices to strengthen our, really, very strong position in Microsoft Dynamics 365 as well as ServiceNow where we've made significant investments. So I'd say that part of our capital allocation model that we've talked about will continue. And then, of course, the mix of returning share -- returning money to our shareholders as we've done, we've returned over $1 billion. We obviously thought our stock was a very good buy and have continued to plow money into that as well. So I don't see any major changes in the capital allocation model as we go forward. We've got to tighten up, as Paul said, on our working capital management, particularly our days sales outstanding, and that's difficult because there is a pretty strong push to try to extend those terms, particularly on these large ITO contracts. And it's another thing, as we look out longer, we see working capital moving in our favor. These shorter-term projects have a propensity to pay in a much quicker cycle than many of these large ITO contracts. So that's how we're thinking about it going forward, is we've got a capital allocation model, we're going to stick with that. We're very pleased with the Luxoft transaction. We think it's a quality acquisition at a fair price. And I think there'll be things that we'll be able to add on to that platform as we go forward. Does that answer your question?"

And if you look at the results of many of the players in this space, they're all relatively strong. The thing that I think really came to life for me was, this came around Luxoft in particular, is the different space that they are in. They are much more in what I'll call the business executive space, taking on digital projects that candidly, one DXC didn't see, and in many cases, weren't really considered because of the brand reputation we have around being able to run infrastructures and big application sets, those kinds of things. That is really going to change. And then, the underlying thing that's so important is all of these smaller digital projects ultimately have to get integrated into mainstream IP in order to really see the transformative benefits of these digital projects. And that's what our unique value proposition is. And we're staying with that along with our partners. And our partners bring a lot to the table here. And again, the Luxoft acquisition. Many of our partners work with Luxoft. And our clients are all, all on a digital journey, different places in that journey, but all on that digital journey. So as I said many, many times, this is a generational shift, and there is plenty of addressable market for everyone to participate in right now."

I think we will get to a more, as I said earlier on a previous question, we'll get to much more of a steady-state as we continue to remix our workforce. So in many cases, what you're seeing here is you're continuing to see an expansion of some of the margins in GIS because frankly, that's where a lot of the remix is taking place, and you're seeing a slight deterioration in the GBS margins. Overall, the margins for the company continue to expand. So I think it's a broader picture. It's going to be a remix. I don't think we'll continue with this sort of extraordinary effort to bootstrap ourselves in the digital hiring. But I honestly hope we have the demand going forward long term that we continue to do that. And in many cases, we're hiring teams of people, not just individuals, because a lot of these digital projects require scrum leaders, they require data scientists, they require software engineers. So more and more, as we remix this business portfolio, these aren't individual skills that get applied. They're teams that get applied to a digital business solution.

Now I think it will continue to require us to go to market differently, source these opportunities differently as I just explained with Rod's question, and then, continue to hire into that demand. As I said, we use this annual billed revenue as sort of a metric internally. It's not ready for prime time yet in terms of audibility. But we use it internally. And we have seen an acceleration of this as we've gone through this year. I mean, the first -- we got off to a fairly slow start in the first quarter. We picked up some steam in the second quarter. Third quarter is the first quarter we've actually made our internal objectives around our digital sales. So we're beginning to see that pick up steam. Now we got caught short, as we fully admitted, we got caught a little short because the demand got out a little bit in front of our ability to then source the people. And as I said, sourcing people is not individuals, it's more teams. And sometimes, you can't get started with these projects until it's a whole team. It doesn't do any good to have just the data scientists show up for analytics, if you also require software engineering as well. So that's the gap that we are closing. But I think the demand is there. This is a generational shift. We're making acquisitions. We're making investments. We're beginning to see that revenue tick up a little bit, we're beginning to see the sales tick up so those are encouraging signs.

So we will sit down with a Microsoft, or we'll sit down with an AWS, or we'll sit down with an AT&T, and we will select accounts where we're going to work together in that account. Now what we're finding is when we do partner more deeply like that, when I say partner, I'm talking about joint proposals. Not 2 separate proposals that get stapled together in the lobby before we make the presentation. I'm talking about an integrated proposal. And we're seeing win rates go up dramatically, and I mean, dramatically like 20 points when we do that. Now that is not only obvious to us, but it's also becoming clearer and clearer to our partners. Our partners do source incremental opportunities that we can go after.

Most -- I got to tell you, I mean, the -- it's more -- it's done quite a bit to change the brand perception of DXC, that we're really serious about this. I went out to the Consumer Electronics Show out in Las Vegas. I'd never -- I haven't been there in 5 years. And I was just amazed that customer feedback in the projects that we are working on with Luxoft. So yes, we've gotten positive feedback from our partners. We've gotten positive feedback from Luxoft clients, and certainly our clients. Now having said that, there's a wait-and-see. There's not that much we can do right now. So right now is more talk than it is actual action. But we'll certainly get into that once we get the transaction closed. And we're in the process now of planning all the revenue synergies and all the other things that go along with getting prepared to close the transaction."

Thanks for taking the time today. As is my habit here, I've got [ 4 or 5 ] points. I'll go through those, go into a little bit more detail and then turn it over to Paul and then we'll have plenty of time for Q&A.
First, fourth quarter non-GAAP EPS was $2.19. For fiscal 2019, non-GAAP EPS was $8.34. Adjusted EBIT was $827 million in the quarter and the adjusted EBIT margin was 15.7%. For fiscal 2019, adjusted EBIT was $3.27 billion and the adjusted EBIT margin was 15.8%. We generated $917 million of adjusted free cash flow in the fourth quarter and for fiscal 2019, adjusted free cash flow was $2.1 billion.
Revenue in the fourth quarter was $5.28 billion on a GAAP basis. In constant currency, revenue was down 1% year-over-year and was up 1.7% sequentially. And for fiscal 2019, revenue was $20.75 billion and we had a book-to-bill of 1.1x in the quarter and 1x for the year. 
In constant currency, our digital revenue grew 22% year-over-year and 11.6% sequentially in the quarter. For fiscal 2019, digital revenue grew 15.8%. And the fourth quarter industry IP and BPS revenue was down 1.4% year-over-year and was roughly flat sequentially. And for fiscal 2019, industry IP and BPS revenue was down 0.3%. In the fourth quarter, our digital book-to-bill was 1.8x and our industry IP and BPS book-to-bill was 0.9x.
On my fourth point, we continue to make strategic investments in digital assets and capabilities, including the accelerated hiring efforts I've talked about before. We also expect to complete the acquisition of Luxoft by the end of June.
Now I'll go into each of these points in a little more detail then I'll cover our targets for fiscal 2020 and turn it over to Paul. As I said, fourth quarter non-GAAP EPS was $2.19 and the effective tax rate was 24.3%. For fiscal 2019, non-GAAP EPS was $8.34 and the effective tax rate for the full year was 23.2%. Fourth quarter adjusted EBIT was $827 million. The adjusted EBIT margin was 15.7%, roughly flat year-over-year and down 50 basis points sequentially, reflecting the investments in digital talent that we previously discussed as well as the upfront savings we're providing to clients to help accelerate their digital transformations.
For fiscal 2019, adjusted EBIT was $3.27 billion and the adjusted EBIT margin was 15.8%, an improvement of 200 basis points. The margin improvement reflects ongoing execution against our key cost-saving levers and the savings were in line with our fiscal '19 target that we've discussed before.
GBS segment profit margin was 20.4%, which was up 100 basis points year-over-year and 220 basis points sequentially. This reflects ongoing workforce optimization as well as the seasonality in the business. And for fiscal 2019, GBS margin was 18.9% and this was up 240 basis points from the prior year.
In GIS, segment profit margin was 14.1%, which was down 50 basis points year-over-year and down 340 basis points sequentially, reflecting the investments I just discussed and the milestone achievement payments I highlighted last quarter. And for fiscal 2019, the GIS margin was 15.8% and this was up 270 basis points from the prior year. Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $917 million or 155% of adjusted net income, reflecting improvements in working capital. And for fiscal 2019, adjusted free cash flow was $2.1 billion or 90% of adjusted net income.
Now turning to revenue. Revenue in the fourth quarter, as I said, was $5.28 billion on a GAAP basis. In constant currency, revenue was down 1% year-over-year and was up 1.7% sequentially. Bookings were up 18.9% year-over-year and 2.5% sequentially for a book-to-bill of 1.1x. Digital growth continues to offset more of the decline in our traditional business. And sequentially, digital revenue in the fourth quarter more than offset the decline in the traditional business. Now this balance between digital growth and traditional decline will continue to be lumpy as we go through the next year, but this is the revenue dynamic that we talked about before that will ultimately support long-term growth for the company.
For fiscal 2019, revenue was $20.75 billion on a GAAP basis and book-to-bill was 1x. In the fourth quarter, GBS revenue was $2.2 billion. This was down 3.1% year-over-year in constant currency and up 0.9% sequentially. The year-over-year decline reflects headwinds in the traditional applications business, including the completion of several contracts in addition to the impact of accelerated cloud adoption. 
Now one of the drivers of increased cloud adoption is the ability to lift and shift existing workloads, which often eliminates the services associated with rationalizing and refactoring applications. GBS bookings in the quarter were up 40% year-over-year and up 27% sequentially for a book-to-bill of 1.3x. And for fiscal 2019, GBS revenue was $8.68 billion and a book-to-bill of 1.1x.
In the fourth quarter, GIS revenue was $3.09 billion, which was up 0.6% year-over-year in constant currency and up 2.3% sequentially, driven by strong growth in our Workplace and Mobility business. Overall, GIS bookings of $2.97 billion were up 3.7% year-over-year and represent a book-to-bill of 1x. And for fiscal 2019, GIS revenue was $12.07 billion with a book-to-bill of 0.9x.
Now turning to our digital and our IP and BPS results. In constant currency, digital revenue was up 22% year-over-year and was up 11.6% sequentially. Digital bookings continue to be very strong with a 1.8x book-to-bill in the quarter, driven by continued strength in our cloud infrastructure and digital workplace bookings. And for fiscal 2019, digital revenue grew 15.8%.
Digital growth in the quarter was driven by enterprise and cloud applications, cloud infrastructure and as I said, digital workplace. All 3 businesses grew more than 20% year-over-year. The strong demand we're seeing for these capabilities is also reflected in our digital bookings and pipeline, both of which are up more than 50% year-over-year.
We're partnering with many of our clients to help generate savings to fund large digital transformations. In many cases, we provide these savings through lower operating costs on traditional services, which initially reduces revenue and profit on the account. In return, we secure commitments from the client to expand DXC's wallet share and future digital spend, which allows us to grow revenue and profit over time. 
A good example where we're leveraging our installed base to accelerate digital transformation is a contract we signed during the fourth quarter with a major global airline. Now building on our long-standing relationship with the client, we signed a [ 7-year ] transformation deal that provides upfront savings for the client through reduced operating costs. And in return, the client has committed to leverage those savings to fund digital transformation work with DXC. This results in an initial reduction in revenue profit on the account but drives top line and bottom line growth over the full life cycle of the contract.
Now let me talk about the offering families within digital. In constant currency, cloud infrastructure grew 25% in the quarter and was up 8.9% sequentially, driven by the accelerated cloud adoption I just talked about. Book-to-bill in the quarter was 1.5x, including the large airline deal as well as deals with the Australian tax office and a large European financial services institution. And for fiscal 2019, cloud infrastructure grew 22% in constant currency.
Enterprise cloud apps and consulting grew 20% year-over-year and 13.3% sequentially. Bookings in the quarter were strong with a book-to-bill of 1.4x. Wins in the quarter included a next-generation SAP deal with a South American utility provider and a CRM transformation program leveraging salesforce.com for a large oil and gas company. And for fiscal 2019, enterprise cloud apps and consulting grew 10.1% in constant currency.
Analytics revenue was down 4.9%, up year-over-year in constant currency and was up 3.2% sequentially. We're seeing good bookings momentum in this business, particularly in the automotive sector. DXC's robotic drive solution, streamlined data analysis and algorithmic training to reduce the time and cost to develop autonomous vehicles. These solutions are very complementary to Luxoft's automotive offerings, and we believe the combined company has a compelling value proposition in this space. Bookings in the quarter were up 67% year-over-year for a book-to-bill of 1.3x.
We've continued to build on this momentum and recently signed a deal with BMW Group, leveraging DXC's robotic drive solutions. We're supporting BMW's Autonomous Vehicle Development Program, gathering massive amounts of road travel data from the global BMW test fleet. Using DXC's digital solution, BMW's R&D teams will achieve significantly faster autonomous drive development cycles.
Now not all areas of digital have done as well. Our security business was down 1.3% year-over-year in constant currency and down 1.5% sequentially as growth in Asia and Southern Europe partially offset the declines in the U.K. and Northern Europe. Book-to-bill in the quarter was strong at 1.2x. In constant currency, industry IP and BPS revenue was down 1.4% year-over-year and was roughly flat sequentially. Industry IP and BPS was down 0.3% or roughly flat for fiscal 2019. 
We continue to ramp revenue on some of the large insurance BPS contracts that I talked about before. This is offsetting declines we're seeing in some of our more generic BPS business, particularly in the U.K. and Europe where a few clients have in-sourced the work. Bookings in the fourth quarter were up 59% year-over-year, including a large deal with the California Department of Health Care Services.
Now turning quickly to point 4. We continue to make significant investments in our digital talent, including accelerated hiring in our fastest-growing capabilities, expansion of our Digital Transformation Centers and capabilities and the ongoing build-out of our joint practices with partners such as AWS and Microsoft Azure. 
During the fourth quarter, we hired an additional 2,000 people in our digital capabilities with an emphasis on software engineers, DevOps engineers, SAP consultants, data scientists and security engineers. We're making these investments to continue scaling the digital go-to-market model I previously discussed. For example, DXC has entered into an engineering relationship with DreamWorks Animation to develop a cloud-based pipeline for digital content creation. We're jointly shaping this solution with DreamWorks leveraging our cloud, security and analytics solutions.
DXC will also expand our access to digital talent through the Luxoft acquisition. We'll leverage Luxoft's established presence in key markets such as Eastern Europe to attract digital talent, and we'll apply Luxoft's talent acquisition and management platform in support of DXC's broader digital capabilities. We expect to complete the Luxoft acquisition by the end of June. And as I've discussed, this acquisition builds on DXC's unique value proposition as an end-to-end mainstream IT and digital services market leader and strengthens the company's ability to design and deploy transformative digital solutions for clients at scale. 
The addition of Luxoft will bring clients new capabilities in digital engineering, additional depth in key verticals and an expanded portfolio of digital offerings. And while we continue to operate Luxoft as a separate entity to protect its strong brand established recurring engine, DXC will undertake several changes to quickly apply Luxoft's strengths and capabilities to our broader business and help drive growth. 
First, we're combining the existing industry expertise from both companies to create market-leading protocols in automotive and financial services. These 2 verticals will serve more than 20 major automotive OEMs and more than half of the top financial institutions in the Americas and Europe. DXC and Luxoft go-to-market teams will also work together to innovate and cross-sell solutions in other industry sectors where the company has a significant base of global business, including insurance and health care. 
Now to my fifth point before I turn it over to Paul. For fiscal 2020, we expect revenue in the range of $20.7 billion to $21.2 billion, reflecting the impact of currency as well as the revenue dynamic between digital and traditional I previously discussed. This target assumes that Luxoft closes, as I said, at the end of June. And we're targeting non-GAAP EPS of $7.75 to $8.50 and adjusted free cash flow to be 90% or more of adjusted net income. 
Now let me turn this over to Paul. Paul?"

As usual, I'll start by covering some items that are excluded from our non-GAAP results. In the current quarter, we had restructuring costs of $47 million on a pretax basis or $0.13 per diluted share after-tax. These costs represent severance related to workforce optimization programs and expenses associated with facilities and data center rationalization. 
Now also in the quarter, we had $96 million on a pretax basis or $0.24 per diluted share after-tax for transaction, separation and integration-related costs associated with recent acquisitions such as Molina as well as activities related to the Luxoft acquisition. For the full year, restructuring, transaction, separation and integration costs amounted to $866 million on a pretax basis or $2.31 per diluted share after-tax, driven by the cost of exiting more resources in complex countries and the higher-than-expected cost of exiting the shared IT environment with HDE. In addition, we had additional transactions costs associated with our digital acquisitions.
In the fourth quarter, amortization of acquired intangibles was $138 million on a pretax basis or $0.37 per diluted share after-tax. For the full year, amortization of acquired intangibles was $539 million on a pretax basis or $1.42 per diluted share after-tax. Also in the quarter, our annual remeasurement of pension assets and liabilities resulted in an accounting charge of $143 million. As of year-end, we had pension assets of $11.3 billion and pension liabilities of $11 billion for an overfunded pension position of $327 million. Excluding the impact of these special items, non-GAAP income from -- before taxes from continuing operations was $778 million for the quarter and non-GAAP EPS was $2.19. For the full year, non-GAAP income before taxes from continuing operations was $3.06 billion and non-GAAP EPS was $8.34. 
Now I move on to our fourth quarter and full year results in more detail. GAAP revenue in the fourth quarter was $5.28 billion and $20.75 billion for the full year. Adjusted EBIT in the quarter was $827 million. Adjusted EBIT margin was 15.7%, relatively flat year-over-year and down 50 basis points sequentially. Adjusted EBIT in the quarter reflects additional investments we are making in our digital business, including additional digital transformation centers, acquiring new digital talent and enhancements to Platform DXC and Bionix.
For fiscal 2019, adjusted EBIT was $3.27 billion. Adjusted EBIT margin was 15.8%, up 200 basis points compared with the prior year. The year-over-year margin improvement reflects continued progress on our cost takeout plans in line with our targets for the year. Throughout fiscal '19, we accelerated the deployment of our Bionix automation program, which combined with our other workforce optimization levers, allowed us to reduce our labor base by roughly 10,000 people or 7% on a net basis as we continue to shift the balance of our workforce to digital capabilities. 
In supply chain, we're consolidating our supplier base, managing demand, leveraging our scale to renegotiate and restructure agreements and shifting more of our work to strategic vendors.
Turning to facilities. We eliminated an additional 4.6 million square feet this year and we also rationalized 9 data centers. Since the merger, we have reduced our facilities' footprint by more than 30%.
So in summary, we delivered over $500 million of in-year savings, which is roughly line with our full year targets. And as we previously discussed, we reinvested roughly half of those savings throughout fiscal '19 and primarily, those investment went into digital capabilities.
In the quarter, our non-GAAP tax rate was 24.3%. And for the full year, the non-GAAP tax rate was 23.2%, reflecting the net benefit of certain tax attributes in foreign jurisdictions. In the fourth quarter, booking were [ $5.8 billion ] for a book-to-bill of 1.1x. And for the full year, bookings were $20.7 billion for a book-to-bill of 1x.
Now let's turn to our segment results. GBS revenue was $2.19 billion in the fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter, GBS segment profit was $447 million and profit margin was 20.4%. The improvement in profitability reflects ongoing workforce optimization and the seasonality of that business. For the full year, GBS revenue was $8.7 billion, segment profit was $1.6 billion. Margin was 18.9%. Booking were $9.3 billion for a book-to-bill of 1.1x.
GIS revenue was $3.09 billion in the fourth quarter. GIS segment profit in the fourth quarter was $436 million and the profit margin was 14.1%. Now the profit margin reflects investments we are making in Platform DXC, Bionix as well as digital talent acceleration. GIS margin also reflects the timing of exiting resources in some of our complex markets.
Now for the full year. GIS revenue was $12.1 billion. Segment profit was $1.9 billion. Margin was 15.8% and bookings were $11.5 billion for a book-to-bill of 0.9x.
Turning to other financial highlights. Adjusted free cash flow in the fourth quarter was $917 million. That's 155% of adjusted net income, reflecting tighter working capital management. For the full year, adjusted free cash flow was $2.1 billion or 90% of adjusted net income, which is in line with our original target for the full year.
Now our cash flow performance continues to exclude the impact of our receivables facility, even though these transactions represent an outright sale of receivables with no recourse to DXC. Now our CapEx was $316 million in the quarter or 6% of revenue. And for the full year, CapEx was $1.15 billion or 5.5% of revenue. 
Cash at the end of the fourth quarter and at the end of the year was $2.9 billion. Our total debt was $7.4 billion, including capitalized leases for a net debt-to-capitalization ratio of 23.6%.
During the quarter, we paid $51 million in dividends and repurchased $91 million of shares for a total of $142 million in capital returned to shareholders. And for the fiscal year, we returned $1.55 billion of capital to our shareholders in the form of $210 million in dividends and $1.34 billion in share repurchases. 
Now let me close by covering our fiscal '20 targets, which assume that the Luxoft transaction will close by the end of June. We are targeting revenue for the fiscal year to be in the range of $20.7 billion to $21.2 billion, and that includes roughly $250 million of currency headwinds from a stronger dollar compared with fiscal '19.
The revenue target reflects the impact of accelerated cloud adoptions on our traditional platform and application businesses. We're working with our clients to accelerate their digital transformation efforts by offering upfront savings on traditional services we provide. Near term, these actions reduce revenue and profit on those accounts, but in return, we expect to gain a greater share of their IT spend in digital, which should translate into higher revenue and profit over time.
Our fiscal '20 target for EPS is $7.75 to $8.50, reflecting the incremental investments we are making in our digital business as well as the near term impact of our efforts to accelerate clients' digital transformations. Now the EPS target also assumes a higher tax rate for fiscal '20 of 26% to 28%, reflecting a change in mix of tax attributes in foreign jurisdictions and delays in the implementation of our tax planning strategies. Now that is pending further clarification of U.S. tax reform regulations. Now these delays, however, do not impact our long-term targets for tax of 22% to 25%. 
I also would like to mention that we're working diligently to complete the filing of our 10-K by May 30. However, because of certain audit procedures regarding updates to the U.S. tax reform regulations, we may file the 10-K in early June within the extension period allowed by the SEC.
And lastly, our adjusted free cash flow target for fiscal '20 is 90% of adjusted net income. Now I'll turn the call back to the operator for the Q&A session."

And as a result, once they are clarified, we'll be able to implement our tax strategies. Until then, we're taking a little bit more risk and not optimizing our taxes. 
In terms of the margin progression, I think we'll see a dip in the first quarter. This is usually -- if I look at it compared to the prior year, but we'll see also the impact of some of the acceleration of the cloud transformation, digital transformation that we're doing with our clients and the savings that we're giving them upfront. We'll see that impact on the revenue upfront. That will also impact our margins, particularly on the GIS side. But we should start to see at least a point improvement every quarter from the first quarter on out until the end of the year. And again, this is assuming Luxoft comes to us in the second -- starting in the second quarter and is not going to be much of a contribution from the -- just the 10% or so contribution for the margin on the Luxoft business."

As we go forward, some of the skills may remix a little bit. In other words, we may need some additional analytic skills and less in some other areas so we'll continue to combine that. 
We're also really comfortable with this whole process we put in place where customers, company centers, we ideate with them, they get assigned to statements of work, approval of concepts. So I really feel very good about what we've been able to get done here on the digital skills. So we're not having problems finding people, recruiting people or onboarding them, and they're beginning to really contribute positively to the business as we go forward. You saw some of that in the growth that we reported. We're also continuing to reskill hundreds of current DXC employees.

Let me provide a little color for you. I won't use any specific names here, but an example would be a proposal I was working on this week as a matter of fact, where we would extend somewhere in the neighborhood of $30 million in operational savings in year. So this will be in year, $30 million of operational savings. And in return, we would be the service provider that would move applications to the cloud. We would provide some additional analytics. We would provide some additional cybersecurity and some additional, what I'll call, operational optimization. That would be worth somewhere in the neighborhood, after we get through the first 6 months to 12 months, probably $40 million to $50 million of incremental revenue. 
So what we're doing, and we're getting more and more comfortable with this model, is to provide those operational savings and then the customer commits to specific projects and workload. Now some of the revenue from those new projects are admittedly delayed a little bit, could be 90 days, could be 120 days, could be a little longer than that. But we're comfortable now that we're starting to get this model, get this into more of a standard process. And we're really encouraged by the receptivity on the part of our clients to this approach. So they can basically fund these digital programs through the operational savings that we give. And all we've got to be willing to do is to live with a little deferred recognition of some of the revenue and profitability. But we can grow these, then our view is we can take a lot of this traditional business and use that as an asset to fund future growth in the account and reposition DXC as not only a great operator of infrastructure but also a trusted digital partner."

That is definitely holding us back a little bit, but we have made the investment and we continue to invest and we've got the platforms now. We'll see how this..."

I'd say we're making these investments now. We continue to invest in Platform DXC. So yes, I mean, we're continuing with these investments.

We continue to invest in Platform DXC. So yes, I mean, we're continuing with these investments. The 2 biggest investments we're making from an IP standpoint is Platform DXC, which we view as critical to allow digital workloads, digital projects to be able to be integrated into mainstream IT. Now we brand this differently. We don't brand the Platform DXC the customers work we brand it X company platform. So because it's not a proprietary platform. It's very open and it's built on our partners' technology like ServiceNow and others. So we continue to invest in that. 
And we're continuing to invest in taking our own digital offerings and integrating them into Platform DXC. And then we continue to make a pretty significant investment in Bionix. We got very good yield out of Bionix. And as you know, Bionix is advanced analytics. It's lean as well as the tooling that goes along with that. So those are the 2 sort of generic investments we're making that cut across our whole portfolio. 
And then the investments that I mentioned we're making in digital, particularly in skills acquisition and, in some cases, hiring ahead for the demand. One of the things, Rod, is in this digital world, it's not like the old IPO world where you won a contract and you had a transition time of 6 months or 8 months and skills were a month late or 60 days late. It wasn't the end of the world. A lot of these digital projects are very perishable. People want to do it. There's -- it's measured in weeks, not months. And that's why we're building more of a bench in these DTCs to be able to respond. 
The other issue is that a lot of these digital projects are not prescribed offerings. It really results as a part of an ideation process, minimally viable product or a proof of concept, which also requires people to actually run that process and then they get assigned to the actual project. So digital Platform DXC, Bionix and then the investments I talked about the health care and insurance make up the bulk of that. But we are investing more. We are investing more because we see the opportunity and the growth, and we're getting more comfortable with the model as we go forward."

So these kids have access to not only what we're doing in DXC and our clients, but they also have access to learn and grow through partners like Microsoft and AWS and others. 
So -- and then finally, these recruits, if you will, see what we are doing with Luxoft and how we're entering that space from a digital engineering standpoint and then our global footprint, which gives them an opportunity to grow from a career path standpoint. Those are fairly compelling value propositions. And as I said, we're not having a lot of difficulty recruiting. 
And I'll just make one other comment since this is the last question. I just was down in a couple of our centers. I'd tell you, it's like entering a new world. I did a townhall meeting in our New Orleans digital delivery center transformation center. I mean, it's just such a diverse group of people. I looked out in the audience, there was probably 300 or 400 people down there now, just all kinds of backgrounds and there's -- the attitude is so different. I'd walk around all these ideation rooms and enter with whiteboards and clients and talking about new opportunities and innovation. I mean, it's -- and the tools that we have to help them with the -- it's just -- it's like a whole different world, which is just so exciting. 
And as we continue to drive more of this digital revenue, that becomes more and more what the company looks like and yet you combine that with our unbelievable capabilities operationally with our ITO business and our application business, it really is a great opportunity to co-create with the clients."

Thanks for taking the time today. As is my habit here, I've got 4 or 5 points. I'll go through those, go into a little bit more detail, and then turn it over to Paul and then we'll have plenty of time for Q&A.
First, fourth quarter non-GAAP EPS was $2.19. For fiscal 2019, non-GAAP EPS was $8.34. Adjusted EBIT was $827 million in the quarter, and the adjusted EBIT margin was 15.7%. For fiscal 2019, adjusted EBIT was $3.27 billion, and the adjusted EBIT margin was 15.8%. We generated $917 million of adjusted free cash flow in the fourth quarter. And for fiscal 2019, adjusted free cash flow was $2.1 billion.
Revenue in the fourth quarter was $5.28 billion on a GAAP basis. In constant currency, revenue was down 1% year-over-year and was up 1.7% sequentially. And for fiscal 2019, revenue was $20.75 billion, and we had a book-to-bill of 1.1x in the quarter and 1x for the year.
In constant currency, our digital revenue grew 22% year-over-year and 11.6% sequentially in the quarter. For fiscal 2019, digital revenue grew 15.8%. And the fourth quarter industry IP and BPS revenue was down 1.4% year-over-year and was roughly flat sequentially. And for fiscal 2019, industry IP and BPS revenue was down 0.3%. And in the fourth quarter, our digital book-to-bill was 1.8x, and our industry IP and BPS book-to-bill was 0.9x.
On my fourth point, we continue to make strategic investments in digital assets and capabilities, including the accelerated hiring efforts I've talked about before. We also expect to complete the acquisition of Luxoft by the end of June.
Now I'll go into each of these points in a little more detail, then I'll cover our targets for fiscal 2020 and turn it over to Paul. As I said, fourth quarter non-GAAP EPS was $2.19, and the effective tax rate was 24.3%. For fiscal 2019, non-GAAP EPS was $8.34, and the effective tax rate for the full year was 23.2%. Fourth quarter adjusted EBIT was $827 million. And the adjusted EBIT margin was 15.7%, roughly flat year-over-year and down 50 basis points sequentially, reflecting the investments in digital talent that we previously discussed as well as the upfront savings we're providing to clients to help accelerate their digital transformations.
For fiscal 2019, adjusted EBIT was $3.27 billion. And the adjusted EBIT margin was 15.8%, an improvement of 200 basis points. The margin improvement reflects ongoing execution against our key cost-saving levers, and the savings were in line with our fiscal '19 target that we've discussed before.
GBS segment profit margin was 20.4%, which was up 100 basis points year-over-year and 220 basis points sequentially. This reflects ongoing workforce optimization as well as the seasonality in the business. And for fiscal 2019, GBS margin was 18.9%, and this was up 240 basis points from the prior year.
In GIS, segment profit margin was 14.1%, which was down 50 basis points year-over-year and down 340 basis points sequentially, reflecting the investments I just discussed and the milestone achievement payments that I highlighted last quarter. And for fiscal 2019, the GIS margin was 15.8%, and this was up 270 basis points from the prior year. Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $917 million or 155% of adjusted net income, reflecting improvements in working capital. And for fiscal 2019, adjusted free cash flow was $2.1 billion or 90% of adjusted net income.
Now turning to revenue. Revenue in the fourth quarter, as I said, was $5.28 billion on a GAAP basis. In constant currency, revenue was down 1% year-over-year and was up 1.7% sequentially. Bookings were up 18.9% year-over-year and 2.5% sequentially for a book-to-bill of 1.1x.
Digital growth continues to offset more of the decline in our traditional business. And sequentially, digital revenue in the fourth quarter more than offset the decline in the traditional business. Now this balance between digital growth and traditional decline will continue to be lumpy as we go through the next year, but this is the revenue dynamic that we talked about before that will ultimately support long-term growth for the company.
For fiscal 2019, revenue was $20.75 billion on a GAAP basis, and book-to-bill was 1x. In the fourth quarter, GBS revenue was $2.2 billion. This was down 3.1% year-over-year in constant currency and up 0.9% sequentially. The year-over-year decline reflects headwinds in the traditional applications business, including the completion of several contracts in addition to the impact of accelerated cloud adoption. Now one of the drivers of increased cloud adoption is the ability to lift and shift existing workloads, which often eliminates the services associated with rationalizing and refactoring applications. GBS bookings in the quarter were up 40% year-over-year and up 27% sequentially for a book-to-bill of 1.3x. And for fiscal 2019, GBS revenue was $8.68 billion and a book-to-bill of 1.1x.
In the fourth quarter, GIS revenue was $3.09 billion, which was up 0.6% year-over-year in constant currency and up 2.3% sequentially driven by strong growth in our Workplace and Mobility business. Overall, GIS bookings of $2.97 billion were up 3.7% year-over-year and represent a book-to-bill of 1x. And for fiscal 2019, GIS revenue was $12.07 billion with a book-to-bill of 0.9x.
Now turning to digital and our IP and BPS results. In constant currency, digital revenue was up 22% year-over-year and was up 11.6% sequentially. Digital bookings continue to be very strong with a 1.8x book-to-bill in the quarter driven by continued strength in our cloud infrastructure and digital workplace bookings. And for fiscal 2019, digital revenue grew 15.8%. Digital growth in the quarter was driven by enterprise and cloud applications, cloud infrastructure and, as I said, digital workplace. All 3 businesses grew more than 20% year-over-year. The strong demand we're seeing for these capabilities is also reflected in our digital bookings and pipeline, both of which are up more than 50% year-over-year.
We're partnering with many of our clients to help generate savings to fund large digital transformations. In many cases, we provide these savings through lower operating costs on traditional services, which initially reduces revenue and profit on the account. And in return, we secure commitments from the client to expand DXC's wallet share and future digital spend, which allows us to grow revenue and profit over time.
A good example where we're leveraging our installed base to accelerate digital transformation is a contract we signed during the fourth quarter with a major global airline. Now building on our long-standing relationship with the client, we signed a 7-year transformation deal that provides upfront savings for the client through reduced operating costs. And in return, the client has committed to leverage those savings to fund digital transformation work with DXC. And this results in an initial reduction in revenue profit on the account but drives top line and bottom line growth over the full life cycle of the contract.
Now let me talk about the offering families within digital. In constant currency, cloud infrastructure grew 25% in the quarter and was up 8.9% sequentially driven by the accelerated cloud adoption I just talked about. Book-to-bill in the quarter was 1.5x, including the large airline deal as well as deals with the Australian tax office and a large European financial services institution. And for fiscal 2019, cloud infrastructure grew 22% in constant currency.
Enterprise cloud apps and consulting grew 20% year-over-year and 13.3% sequentially. Bookings in the quarter were strong with a book-to-bill of 1.4x. Wins in the quarter included a next-generation SAP deal with a South American utility provider and a CRM transformation program leveraging Salesforce.com for a large oil and gas company. And for fiscal 2019, enterprise cloud apps and consulting grew 10.1% in constant currency.
Analytics revenue was down 4.9%, up year-over-year in constant currency and was up 3.2% sequentially. We're seeing good bookings momentum in this business, particularly in the automotive sector. DXC's robotic drive solutions streamlined data analysis and algorithmic training to reduce the time and cost to develop autonomous vehicles. These solutions are very complementary to Luxoft's automotive offerings, and we believe the combined company has a compelling value proposition in this space. Bookings in the quarter were up 67% year-over-year for a book-to-bill of 1.3x.
We've continued to build on this momentum and recently signed a deal with BMW Group, leveraging DXC's robotic drive solutions. We're supporting BMW's autonomous vehicle development program, gathering massive amounts of road travel data from the global BMW test fleet. Using DXC's digital solution, BMW's R&D teams will achieve significantly faster autonomous drive development cycles.
Now not all areas of digital have done as well. Our security business was down 1.3% year-over-year in constant currency and down 1.5% sequentially as growth in Asia and Southern Europe partially offset the declines in the U.K. and Northern Europe. Book-to-bill in the quarter was strong at 1.2x. In constant currency, industry IP and BPS revenue was down 1.4% year-over-year and was roughly flat sequentially. Industry IP and BPS was down 0.3% or roughly flat for fiscal 2019. We continue to ramp revenue on some of the large insurance BPS contracts that I talked about before. This is offsetting declines we're seeing in some of our more generic BPS business, particularly in the U.K. and Europe where a few clients have in-sourced the work. Bookings in the fourth quarter were up 59% year-over-year, including a large deal with the California Department of Health Care Services.
Now turning quickly to point four. We continue to make significant investments in our digital talent, including accelerated hiring in our fastest-growing capabilities, expansion of our Digital Transformation Centers and capabilities and the ongoing build-out of our joint practices with partners such as AWS and Microsoft Azure.
During the fourth quarter, we hired an additional 2,000 people in our digital capabilities with an emphasis on software engineers, DevOps engineers, SAP consultants, data scientists and security engineers. We're making these investments to continue scaling the digital go-to-market model I previously discussed. For example, DXC has entered into an engineering relationship with DreamWorks Animation to develop a cloud-based pipeline for digital content creation. We're jointly shaping this solution with DreamWorks, leveraging our cloud, security and analytics solutions.
DXC will also expand our access to digital talent through the Luxoft acquisition. We'll leverage Luxoft's established presence in key markets such as Eastern Europe to attract digital talent, and we'll apply Luxoft's talent acquisition and management platform in support of DXC's broader digital capabilities. We expect to complete the Luxoft acquisition by the end of June. And as I've discussed, this acquisition builds on DXC's unique value proposition as an end-to-end mainstream IT and digital services market leader and strengthens the company's ability to design and deploy transformative digital solutions for clients at scale.
The addition of Luxoft will bring clients new capabilities in digital engineering, additional depth in key verticals and an expanded portfolio of digital offerings. And while we continue to operate Luxoft as a separate entity to protect its strong brand established recurring engine, DXC will undertake several changes to quickly apply Luxoft's strengths and capabilities to our broader business and help drive growth.
First, we're combining the existing industry expertise from both companies to create market-leading verticals in automotive and financial services. These 2 verticals will serve more than 20 major automotive OEMs and more than half of the top financial institutions in the Americas and Europe. DXC and Luxoft go-to-market teams will also work together to innovate and cross-sell solutions in other industry sectors where the company has a significant base of global business, including insurance and health care.
Now to my fifth point before I turn it over to Paul. For fiscal 2020, we expect revenue in the range of $20.7 billion to $21.2 billion, reflecting the impact of currency as well as the revenue dynamic between digital and traditional I previously discussed. This target assumes that Luxoft closes, as I said, at the end of June. And we're targeting non-GAAP EPS of $7.75 to $8.50 and adjusted free cash flow to be 90% or more of adjusted net income.
Now let me turn this over to Paul. Paul?"

As usual, I will start by covering some items that are excluded from our non-GAAP results. In the current quarter, we had restructuring costs of $47 million on a pretax basis or a $0.13 per diluted share after-tax. These costs represent severance related to workforce optimization programs and expenses associated with facilities and data center rationalization.
Now also in the quarter, we had $96 million on a pretax basis or $0.24 per diluted share after-tax for transaction, separation and integration-related costs associated with recent acquisitions such as Molina as well as activities related to the Luxoft acquisition. For the full year, restructuring, transaction, separation and integration costs amounted to $866 million on a pretax basis or $2.31 per diluted share after-tax driven by the cost of exiting more resources in complex countries and the higher-than-expected cost of exiting the shared IT environment with HPE. In addition, we had additional transactions costs associated with our digital acquisitions.
In the fourth quarter, amortization of acquired intangibles was $138 million on a pretax basis or $0.37 per diluted share after-tax. For the full year, amortization of acquired intangibles was $539 million on a pretax basis or $1.42 per diluted share after-tax. Also in the quarter, our annual remeasurement of pension assets and liabilities resulted in an accounting charge of $143 million. As of year-end, we had pension assets of $11.3 billion and pension liabilities of $11 billion for an overfunded pension position of $327 million. Excluding the impact of these special items, non-GAAP income from -- before taxes from continuing operations was $778 million for the quarter, and non-GAAP EPS was $2.19. For the full year, non-GAAP income before taxes from continuing operations was $3.06 billion, and non-GAAP EPS was $8.34.
Now I move on to our fourth quarter and full year results in more detail. GAAP revenue in the fourth quarter was $5.28 billion and $20.75 billion for the full year. Adjusted EBIT in the quarter was $827 million. Adjusted EBIT margin was 15.7%, relatively flat year-over-year and down 50 basis points sequentially. Adjusted EBIT in the quarter reflects additional investments we are making in our digital business, including additional digital transformation centers, acquiring new digital talent and enhancements to Platform DXC and Bionix.
For fiscal 2019, adjusted EBIT was $3.27 billion. Adjusted EBIT margin was 15.8%, up 200 basis points compared with the prior year. The year-over-year margin improvement reflects continued progress on our cost takeout plans in line with our targets for the year. Throughout fiscal '19, we accelerated the deployment of our Bionix automation program, which, combined with our other workforce optimization levers, allowed us to reduce our labor base by roughly 10,000 people or 7% on a net basis as we continue to shift the balance of our workforce to digital capabilities.
In supply chain, we're consolidating our supplier base, managing demand, leveraging our scale to renegotiate and restructure agreements and shifting more of our work to strategic vendors.
Turning to facilities. We eliminated an additional 4.6 million square feet this year, and we also rationalized 9 data centers. Since the merger, we have reduced our facilities footprint by more than 30%.
So in summary, we delivered over $500 million of in-year savings, which is roughly line with our full year targets. And as we previously discussed, we reinvested roughly half of those savings throughout fiscal '19. And primarily, those investments went into digital capabilities.
In the quarter, our non-GAAP tax rate was 24.3%. And for the full year, the non-GAAP tax rate was 23.2%, reflecting the net benefit of certain tax attributes in foreign jurisdictions. In the fourth quarter, bookings were $5.8 billion for a book-to-bill of 1.1x. And for the full year, bookings were $20.7 billion for a book-to-bill of 1x.
Now let's turn to our segment results. GBS revenue was $2.19 billion in the fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter, GBS segment profit was $447 million, and profit margin was 20.4%. The improvement in profitability reflects ongoing workforce optimization and the seasonality of that business. For the full year, GBS revenue was $8.7 billion. Segment profit was $1.6 billion. Margin was 18.9%. Booking were $9.3 billion for a book-to-bill of 1.1x.
GIS revenue was $3.09 billion in the fourth quarter. GIS segment profit in the fourth quarter was $436 million, and the profit margin was 14.1%. Now the profit margin reflects investments we are making in Platform DXC, Bionix as well as digital talent acceleration. GIS margin also reflects the timing of exiting resources in some of our complex markets. Now for the full year, GIS revenue was $12.1 billion, segment profit was $1.9 billion, margin was 15.8% and bookings were $11.5 billion for a book-to-bill of 0.9x.
Turning to other financial highlights. Adjusted free cash flow in the fourth quarter was $917 million. That's 155% of adjusted net income, reflecting tighter working capital management. For the full year, adjusted free cash flow was $2.1 billion or 90% of adjusted net income, which is in line with our original target for the full year.
Now our cash flow performance continues to exclude the impact of our receivables facility even though these transactions represent an outright sale of receivables with no recourse to DXC. Now our CapEx was $316 million in the quarter or 6% of revenue. And for the full year, CapEx was $1.15 billion or 5.5% of revenue. Cash at the end of the fourth quarter and at the end of the year was $2.9 billion. Our total debt was $7.4 billion, including capitalized leases for a net debt-to-capitalization ratio of 23.6%.
During the quarter, we paid $51 million in dividends and repurchased $91 million of shares for a total of $142 million in capital returned to shareholders. And for the fiscal year, we returned $1.55 billion of capital to our shareholders in the form of $210 million in dividends and $1.34 billion in share repurchases.
Now let me close by covering our fiscal '20 targets, which assume that the Luxoft transaction will close by the end of June. We are targeting revenue for the fiscal year to be in the range of $20.7 billion to $21.2 billion, and that includes roughly $250 million of currency headwinds from a stronger dollar compared with fiscal '19.
The revenue target reflects the impact of accelerated cloud adoptions on our traditional platform and application businesses. We're working with our clients to accelerate their digital transformation efforts by offering upfront savings on traditional services we provide. Near term, these actions reduce revenue and profit on those accounts. But in return, we expect to gain a greater share of their IT spend in digital, which should translate into a higher revenue and profit over time.
Our fiscal '20 target for EPS is $7.75 to $8.50, reflecting the incremental investments we are making in our digital business as well as the near-term impact of our efforts to accelerate clients' digital transformations. Now the EPS target also assumes a higher tax rate for fiscal '20 of 26% to 28%, reflecting a changing mix of tax attributes in foreign jurisdictions and delays in the implementation of our tax planning strategies. Now that is pending further clarification of U.S. tax reform regulations. Now these delays, however, do not impact our long-term targets for tax of 22% to 25%.
I also would like to mention that we're working diligently to complete the filing of our 10-K by May 30. However, because of certain audit procedures regarding updates to the U.S. tax reform regulations, we may file the 10-K in early June within the extension period allowed by the SEC. And lastly, our adjusted free cash flow target for fiscal '20 is 90% of adjusted net income.
Now I'll turn the call back to the operator for the Q&A session."

And as a result, once they are clarified, we'll be able to implement our tax strategies. Until then, we're taking a little bit more risk and not optimizing our taxes.
In terms of the margin progression, I think we'll see a dip in the first quarter. This is usually -- if I look at it compared to the prior year. But we'll see also the impact of some of the acceleration of the cloud transformation, digital transformation that we're doing with our clients and the savings that we're giving them upfront. We'll see that impact on the revenue upfront. That will also impact our margins, particularly on the GIS side. But we should start to see at least a point improvement every quarter from the first quarter on out until the end of the year. And again, this is assuming Luxoft comes to us in the second -- starting in the second quarter and is not going to be much of a contribution from the -- just a 10%-or-so contribution for the margin on the Luxoft business."

We're also really comfortable with this whole process we've put in place where customers come to these centers, we ideate with them, they get assigned to statements of work, approve our concepts, so I really feel very good about what we've been able to get done here on the digital skills. So we're not having problems finding people, recruiting people or onboarding them, and they're beginning to really contribute positively to the business as we go forward. You saw some of that in the growth that we reported.

Let me provide a little color for you. I won't use any specific names here but an example would be a proposal I was working on this week as a matter of fact where we would extend somewhere in the neighborhood of $30 million in operational savings in-year. So this will be in-year, $30 million of operational savings. And in return, we would be the service provider that would move applications to the cloud. We would provide some additional analytics. We would provide some additional cybersecurity and some additional, what I'll call, operational optimization. That would be worth somewhere in the neighborhood, after we get through the first 6 months to 12 months, probably $40 million to $50 million of incremental revenue.
So what we're doing, and we're getting more and more comfortable with this model, is to provide those operational savings and then the customer commits to specific projects and workload. Now some of the revenue from those new projects are admittedly delayed a little bit, could be 90 days, could be 120 days, could be a little longer than that. But we're comfortable now that we're starting to get this model, get this into more of a standard process, and we're really encouraged by the receptivity on the part of our clients to this approach. So they can basically fund these digital programs through the operational savings that we give. And all we've got to be willing to do is to live with a little deferred recognition of some of the revenue and profitability. When we can grow these, then our view is we can take a lot of this traditional business and use that as an asset to fund future growth in the account and reposition DXC as not only a great operator of infrastructure but also a trusted digital partner."

I think the -- nothing unusual except, as I mentioned to you, we are accelerating the program of giving -- working with our customers to give them upfront savings so that we can get a greater share of their IT spend overall on digital. And so that's why you see the upfront decline a little bit in the -- more pronounced in the first quarter, and then we expect to just really start to recover some of that throughout the year.
And we have some seasonality, as you may recall, from Q4 to Q1 that's been usually -- and a few -- last year, for example, alone, it was about $300 million. So this first quarter will be a little bit higher than that given again the plans that -- that we're working on to accelerate those digital transformations. But after that, as I mentioned, we see a progression, incremental revenue throughout the year, and then you top that off with the Luxoft that comes onboard for Q2, Q3 and Q4. And then from a margin perspective, as I mentioned earlier, it is a progression sequentially of about 1 point from where we would print in the first quarter."

We have invested over the last, I don't know, 1 year, 18 months on what we call a digital insurance platform.

We have invested over the last, I don't know, 1 year, 18 months on what we call a digital insurance platform. And fundamentally, this is taking different components that we had in our IP portfolio as well as some of the IP from our partners. And we put that into what we're referring to as a digital insurance platform.
Now we have now sold this in a couple of large insurance companies. Matter of fact, I was just in India last week and went through this whole approach with a couple of customers that we're visiting one of our centers in India. We are expecting that to begin to get some traction this coming fiscal year. It really has only been in the market, I don't know, 3 or 4 months, so the lead times on these things are quite lengthy because they're significant transformation projects.
So we are getting more and more encouraged that, that investment will begin to pay off. But to be quite candid with you, I don't know how to model that, I really don't know how -- I don't have enough customer wins and enough experience in implementing this new platform to be able to give you -- I don't have insights so I can't then share what -- how that's going to play out this year.
We've also done some of the same things with our health care platforms. And there also, we're beginning to see some traction. But I just don't have enough visibility yet to see that. So we have been disappointed by the IP performance over the last year. As I said, it's roughly flat. We were really hoping to get a couple points of growth. That is definitely holding us back a little bit. But we have made the investment, and we're going to continue to invest. And we've got the platforms now, we'll see how this begins to play out."

We continue to invest in Platform DXC. So yes, I mean we're continuing with these investments. The 2 biggest investments we're making from an IP standpoint is Platform DXC, which we view as critical to allow digital workloads, digital projects, to be able to be integrated into mainstream IT. Now we brand this differently. We don't brand it Platform DXC. The customers we're working with, we brand it x company platform so that -- because it's not a proprietary platform. It's very open, and it's built on our partners' technology like ServiceNow and others. So we continue to invest in that.
And we're continuing to invest in taking our own digital offerings and integrating them into Platform DXC. And then we continue to make a pretty significant investment in Bionix. We got very good yield out of Bionix. And as you know, Bionix is advanced analytics. It's lean as well as the tooling that goes along with that. So those are the 2 sort of generic investments we're making that cut across our whole portfolio and then the investments that I mentioned we're making in digital, particularly in skills acquisition and, in some cases, hiring ahead for the demand. One of the things, Rod, is in this digital world, it's not like the old IPO world where you won a contract and you had a transition time of 6 months or 8 months, and skills were a month late or 60 days late. It wasn't the end of the world. A lot of these digital projects are very perishable. People want to do it. There's -- it's measured in weeks, not months. And that's why we're building more of a bench in these DTCs to be able to respond.
The other issue is that a lot of these digital projects are not prescribed offerings. It really results as a part of an ideation process, a minimally viable product or a proof of concept, which also requires people to actually run that process, and then they get assigned to the actual project. So digital, Platform DXC, Bionix and then the investments I talked about in the health care and insurance make up the bulk of that. But we are investing more. We are investing more because we see the opportunity and the growth, and we're getting more comfortable with the model as we go forward."

One is we have an incredible client base, incredible client base. Two, we are working on some extremely innovative projects like the BMW project. We have an unbelievable relationship with our partners. So these kids have access to not only what we're doing in DXC and our clients, but they also have access to learn and grow through partners like Microsoft and AWS and others.
So -- and then finally, these recruits, if you will, see what we are doing with Luxoft and how we're entering that space from a digital engineering standpoint and then our global footprint, which gives them an opportunity to grow from a career path standpoint. Those are fairly compelling value propositions. And as I said, we're not having a lot of difficulty recruiting.
And I'll just make one other comment since this is the last question. I just was down in a couple of our centers. I'd tell you, it's like entering a new world. I did a town hall meeting in our New Orleans digital delivery center, transformation center. I mean it's just -- one, it's such a diverse group of people. I looked out in the audience, there was probably 300 or 400 people down there now, just all kinds of backgrounds, and there's -- the attitude is so different. I'd walk around in all these ideation rooms and enter with whiteboards and clients and talking about new opportunities and innovation. I mean it's -- and the tools that we have to help them with the -- it's just -- it's like a whole different world, which is just so exciting.
And as we continue to drive more of this digital revenue, that becomes more and more what the company looks like. And if you combine that with our unbelievable capabilities operationally with our ITO business and our application business, it really is a great opportunity to cocreate with the clients."

Thanks for taking the time today. As is my habit here, I've got 4 or 5 points. I'll go through those, go into a little bit more detail, and then turn it over to Paul and then we'll have plenty of time for Q&A.
First, fourth quarter non-GAAP EPS was $2.19. For fiscal 2019, non-GAAP EPS was $8.34. Adjusted EBIT was $827 million in the quarter, and the adjusted EBIT margin was 15.7%. For fiscal 2019, adjusted EBIT was $3.27 billion, and the adjusted EBIT margin was 15.8%. We generated $917 million of adjusted free cash flow in the fourth quarter. And for fiscal 2019, adjusted free cash flow was $2.1 billion.
Revenue in the fourth quarter was $5.28 billion on a GAAP basis. In constant currency, revenue was down 1% year-over-year and was up 1.7% sequentially. And for fiscal 2019, revenue was $20.75 billion, and we had a book-to-bill of 1.1x in the quarter and 1x for the year.
In constant currency, our digital revenue grew 22% year-over-year and 11.6% sequentially in the quarter. For fiscal 2019, digital revenue grew 15.8%. And the fourth quarter industry IP and BPS revenue was down 1.4% year-over-year and was roughly flat sequentially. And for fiscal 2019, industry IP and BPS revenue was down 0.3%. And in the fourth quarter, our digital book-to-bill was 1.8x, and our industry IP and BPS book-to-bill was 0.9x.
On my fourth point, we continue to make strategic investments in digital assets and capabilities, including the accelerated hiring efforts I've talked about before. We also expect to complete the acquisition of Luxoft by the end of June.
Now I'll go into each of these points in a little more detail, then I'll cover our targets for fiscal 2020 and turn it over to Paul. As I said, fourth quarter non-GAAP EPS was $2.19, and the effective tax rate was 24.3%. For fiscal 2019, non-GAAP EPS was $8.34, and the effective tax rate for the full year was 23.2%. Fourth quarter adjusted EBIT was $827 million. And the adjusted EBIT margin was 15.7%, roughly flat year-over-year and down 50 basis points sequentially, reflecting the investments in digital talent that we previously discussed as well as the upfront savings we're providing to clients to help accelerate their digital transformations.
For fiscal 2019, adjusted EBIT was $3.27 billion. And the adjusted EBIT margin was 15.8%, an improvement of 200 basis points. The margin improvement reflects ongoing execution against our key cost-saving levers, and the savings were in line with our fiscal '19 target that we've discussed before.
GBS segment profit margin was 20.4%, which was up 100 basis points year-over-year and 220 basis points sequentially. This reflects ongoing workforce optimization as well as the seasonality in the business. And for fiscal 2019, GBS margin was 18.9%, and this was up 240 basis points from the prior year.
In GIS, segment profit margin was 14.1%, which was down 50 basis points year-over-year and down 340 basis points sequentially, reflecting the investments I just discussed and the milestone achievement payments that I highlighted last quarter. And for fiscal 2019, the GIS margin was 15.8%, and this was up 270 basis points from the prior year. Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $917 million or 155% of adjusted net income, reflecting improvements in working capital. And for fiscal 2019, adjusted free cash flow was $2.1 billion or 90% of adjusted net income.
Now turning to revenue. Revenue in the fourth quarter, as I said, was $5.28 billion on a GAAP basis. In constant currency, revenue was down 1% year-over-year and was up 1.7% sequentially. Bookings were up 18.9% year-over-year and 2.5% sequentially for a book-to-bill of 1.1x.
Digital growth continues to offset more of the decline in our traditional business. And sequentially, digital revenue in the fourth quarter more than offset the decline in the traditional business. Now this balance between digital growth and traditional decline will continue to be lumpy as we go through the next year, but this is the revenue dynamic that we talked about before that will ultimately support long-term growth for the company.
For fiscal 2019, revenue was $20.75 billion on a GAAP basis, and book-to-bill was 1x. In the fourth quarter, GBS revenue was $2.2 billion. This was down 3.1% year-over-year in constant currency and up 0.9% sequentially. The year-over-year decline reflects headwinds in the traditional applications business, including the completion of several contracts in addition to the impact of accelerated cloud adoption. Now one of the drivers of increased cloud adoption is the ability to lift and shift existing workloads, which often eliminates the services associated with rationalizing and refactoring applications. GBS bookings in the quarter were up 40% year-over-year and up 27% sequentially for a book-to-bill of 1.3x. And for fiscal 2019, GBS revenue was $8.68 billion and a book-to-bill of 1.1x.
In the fourth quarter, GIS revenue was $3.09 billion, which was up 0.6% year-over-year in constant currency and up 2.3% sequentially driven by strong growth in our Workplace and Mobility business. Overall, GIS bookings of $2.97 billion were up 3.7% year-over-year and represent a book-to-bill of 1x. And for fiscal 2019, GIS revenue was $12.07 billion with a book-to-bill of 0.9x.
Now turning to digital and our IP and BPS results. In constant currency, digital revenue was up 22% year-over-year and was up 11.6% sequentially. Digital bookings continue to be very strong with a 1.8x book-to-bill in the quarter driven by continued strength in our cloud infrastructure and digital workplace bookings. And for fiscal 2019, digital revenue grew 15.8%. Digital growth in the quarter was driven by enterprise and cloud applications, cloud infrastructure and, as I said, digital workplace. All 3 businesses grew more than 20% year-over-year. The strong demand we're seeing for these capabilities is also reflected in our digital bookings and pipeline, both of which are up more than 50% year-over-year.
We're partnering with many of our clients to help generate savings to fund large digital transformations. In many cases, we provide these savings through lower operating costs on traditional services, which initially reduces revenue and profit on the account. And in return, we secure commitments from the client to expand DXC's wallet share and future digital spend, which allows us to grow revenue and profit over time.
A good example where we're leveraging our installed base to accelerate digital transformation is a contract we signed during the fourth quarter with a major global airline. Now building on our long-standing relationship with the client, we signed a 7-year transformation deal that provides upfront savings for the client through reduced operating costs. And in return, the client has committed to leverage those savings to fund digital transformation work with DXC. And this results in an initial reduction in revenue profit on the account but drives top line and bottom line growth over the full life cycle of the contract.
Now let me talk about the offering families within digital. In constant currency, cloud infrastructure grew 25% in the quarter and was up 8.9% sequentially driven by the accelerated cloud adoption I just talked about. Book-to-bill in the quarter was 1.5x, including the large airline deal as well as deals with the Australian tax office and a large European financial services institution. And for fiscal 2019, cloud infrastructure grew 22% in constant currency.
Enterprise cloud apps and consulting grew 20% year-over-year and 13.3% sequentially. Bookings in the quarter were strong with a book-to-bill of 1.4x. Wins in the quarter included a next-generation SAP deal with a South American utility provider and a CRM transformation program leveraging Salesforce.com for a large oil and gas company. And for fiscal 2019, enterprise cloud apps and consulting grew 10.1% in constant currency.
Analytics revenue was down 4.9%, up year-over-year in constant currency and was up 3.2% sequentially. We're seeing good bookings momentum in this business, particularly in the automotive sector. DXC's robotic drive solutions streamlined data analysis and algorithmic training to reduce the time and cost to develop autonomous vehicles. These solutions are very complementary to Luxoft's automotive offerings, and we believe the combined company has a compelling value proposition in this space. Bookings in the quarter were up 67% year-over-year for a book-to-bill of 1.3x.
We've continued to build on this momentum and recently signed a deal with BMW Group, leveraging DXC's robotic drive solutions. We're supporting BMW's autonomous vehicle development program, gathering massive amounts of road travel data from the global BMW test fleet. Using DXC's digital solution, BMW's R&D teams will achieve significantly faster autonomous drive development cycles.
Now not all areas of digital have done as well. Our security business was down 1.3% year-over-year in constant currency and down 1.5% sequentially as growth in Asia and Southern Europe partially offset the declines in the U.K. and Northern Europe. Book-to-bill in the quarter was strong at 1.2x. In constant currency, industry IP and BPS revenue was down 1.4% year-over-year and was roughly flat sequentially. Industry IP and BPS was down 0.3% or roughly flat for fiscal 2019. We continue to ramp revenue on some of the large insurance BPS contracts that I talked about before. This is offsetting declines we're seeing in some of our more generic BPS business, particularly in the U.K. and Europe where a few clients have in-sourced the work. Bookings in the fourth quarter were up 59% year-over-year, including a large deal with the California Department of Health Care Services.
Now turning quickly to point four. We continue to make significant investments in our digital talent, including accelerated hiring in our fastest-growing capabilities, expansion of our Digital Transformation Centers and capabilities and the ongoing build-out of our joint practices with partners such as AWS and Microsoft Azure.
During the fourth quarter, we hired an additional 2,000 people in our digital capabilities with an emphasis on software engineers, DevOps engineers, SAP consultants, data scientists and security engineers. We're making these investments to continue scaling the digital go-to-market model I previously discussed. For example, DXC has entered into an engineering relationship with DreamWorks Animation to develop a cloud-based pipeline for digital content creation. We're jointly shaping this solution with DreamWorks, leveraging our cloud, security and analytics solutions.
DXC will also expand our access to digital talent through the Luxoft acquisition. We'll leverage Luxoft's established presence in key markets such as Eastern Europe to attract digital talent, and we'll apply Luxoft's talent acquisition and management platform in support of DXC's broader digital capabilities. We expect to complete the Luxoft acquisition by the end of June. And as I've discussed, this acquisition builds on DXC's unique value proposition as an end-to-end mainstream IT and digital services market leader and strengthens the company's ability to design and deploy transformative digital solutions for clients at scale.
The addition of Luxoft will bring clients new capabilities in digital engineering, additional depth in key verticals and an expanded portfolio of digital offerings. And while we continue to operate Luxoft as a separate entity to protect its strong brand established recurring engine, DXC will undertake several changes to quickly apply Luxoft's strengths and capabilities to our broader business and help drive growth.
First, we're combining the existing industry expertise from both companies to create market-leading verticals in automotive and financial services. These 2 verticals will serve more than 20 major automotive OEMs and more than half of the top financial institutions in the Americas and Europe. DXC and Luxoft go-to-market teams will also work together to innovate and cross-sell solutions in other industry sectors where the company has a significant base of global business, including insurance and health care.
Now to my fifth point before I turn it over to Paul. For fiscal 2020, we expect revenue in the range of $20.7 billion to $21.2 billion, reflecting the impact of currency as well as the revenue dynamic between digital and traditional I previously discussed. This target assumes that Luxoft closes, as I said, at the end of June. And we're targeting non-GAAP EPS of $7.75 to $8.50 and adjusted free cash flow to be 90% or more of adjusted net income.
Now let me turn this over to Paul. Paul?"

In the current quarter, we had restructuring costs of $47 million on a pretax basis or a $0.13 per diluted share after-tax. These costs represent severance related to workforce optimization programs and expenses associated with facilities and data center rationalization.
Now also in the quarter, we had $96 million on a pretax basis or $0.24 per diluted share after-tax for transaction, separation and integration-related costs associated with recent acquisitions such as Molina as well as activities related to the Luxoft acquisition. For the full year, restructuring, transaction, separation and integration costs amounted to $866 million on a pretax basis or $2.31 per diluted share after-tax driven by the cost of exiting more resources in complex countries and the higher-than-expected cost of exiting the shared IT environment with HPE. In addition, we had additional transactions costs associated with our digital acquisitions.
In the fourth quarter, amortization of acquired intangibles was $138 million on a pretax basis or $0.37 per diluted share after-tax. For the full year, amortization of acquired intangibles was $539 million on a pretax basis or $1.42 per diluted share after-tax. Also in the quarter, our annual remeasurement of pension assets and liabilities resulted in an accounting charge of $143 million. As of year-end, we had pension assets of $11.3 billion and pension liabilities of $11 billion for an overfunded pension position of $327 million. Excluding the impact of these special items, non-GAAP income from -- before taxes from continuing operations was $778 million for the quarter, and non-GAAP EPS was $2.19. For the full year, non-GAAP income before taxes from continuing operations was $3.06 billion, and non-GAAP EPS was $8.34.
Now I move on to our fourth quarter and full year results in more detail. GAAP revenue in the fourth quarter was $5.28 billion and $20.75 billion for the full year. Adjusted EBIT in the quarter was $827 million. Adjusted EBIT margin was 15.7%, relatively flat year-over-year and down 50 basis points sequentially. Adjusted EBIT in the quarter reflects additional investments we are making in our digital business, including additional digital transformation centers, acquiring new digital talent and enhancements to Platform DXC and Bionix.
For fiscal 2019, adjusted EBIT was $3.27 billion. Adjusted EBIT margin was 15.8%, up 200 basis points compared with the prior year. The year-over-year margin improvement reflects continued progress on our cost takeout plans in line with our targets for the year. Throughout fiscal '19, we accelerated the deployment of our Bionix automation program, which, combined with our other workforce optimization levers, allowed us to reduce our labor base by roughly 10,000 people or 7% on a net basis as we continue to shift the balance of our workforce to digital capabilities.
In supply chain, we're consolidating our supplier base, managing demand, leveraging our scale to renegotiate and restructure agreements and shifting more of our work to strategic vendors.
Turning to facilities. We eliminated an additional 4.6 million square feet this year, and we also rationalized 9 data centers. Since the merger, we have reduced our facilities footprint by more than 30%.
So in summary, we delivered over $500 million of in-year savings, which is roughly line with our full year targets. And as we previously discussed, we reinvested roughly half of those savings throughout fiscal '19. And primarily, those investments went into digital capabilities.
In the quarter, our non-GAAP tax rate was 24.3%. And for the full year, the non-GAAP tax rate was 23.2%, reflecting the net benefit of certain tax attributes in foreign jurisdictions. In the fourth quarter, bookings were $5.8 billion for a book-to-bill of 1.1x. And for the full year, bookings were $20.7 billion for a book-to-bill of 1x.
Now let's turn to our segment results. GBS revenue was $2.19 billion in the fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter, GBS segment profit was $447 million, and profit margin was 20.4%. The improvement in profitability reflects ongoing workforce optimization and the seasonality of that business. For the full year, GBS revenue was $8.7 billion. Segment profit was $1.6 billion. Margin was 18.9%. Booking were $9.3 billion for a book-to-bill of 1.1x.
GIS revenue was $3.09 billion in the fourth quarter. GIS segment profit in the fourth quarter was $436 million, and the profit margin was 14.1%. Now the profit margin reflects investments we are making in Platform DXC, Bionix as well as digital talent acceleration. GIS margin also reflects the timing of exiting resources in some of our complex markets. Now for the full year, GIS revenue was $12.1 billion, segment profit was $1.9 billion, margin was 15.8% and bookings were $11.5 billion for a book-to-bill of 0.9x.
Turning to other financial highlights. Adjusted free cash flow in the fourth quarter was $917 million. That is 155% of adjusted net income, reflecting tighter working capital management. For the full year, adjusted free cash flow was $2.1 billion or 90% of adjusted net income, which is in line with our original target for the full year.
Now our cash flow performance continues to exclude the impact of our receivables facility even though these transactions represent an outright sale of receivables with no recourse to DXC. Now our CapEx was $316 million in the quarter or 6% of revenue. And for the full year, CapEx was $1.15 billion or 5.5% of revenue. Cash at the end of the fourth quarter and at the end of the year was $2.9 billion. Our total debt was $7.4 billion, including capitalized leases for a net debt-to-capitalization ratio of 23.6%.
During the quarter, we paid $51 million in dividends and repurchased $91 million of shares for a total of $142 million in capital returned to shareholders. And for the fiscal year, we returned $1.55 billion of capital to our shareholders in the form of $210 million in dividends and $1.34 billion in share repurchases.
Now let me close by covering our fiscal '20 targets, which assume that the Luxoft transaction will close by the end of June. We are targeting revenue for the fiscal year to be in the range of $20.7 billion to $21.2 billion, and that includes roughly $250 million of currency headwinds from a stronger dollar compared with fiscal '19.
The revenue target reflects the impact of accelerated cloud adoptions on our traditional platform and application businesses. We're working with our clients to accelerate their digital transformation efforts by offering upfront savings on traditional services we provide. Near term, these actions reduce revenue and profit on those accounts. But in return, we expect to gain a greater share of their IT spend in digital, which should translate into a higher revenue and profit over time.
Our fiscal '20 target for EPS is $7.75 to $8.50, reflecting the incremental investments we are making in our digital business as well as the near-term impact of our efforts to accelerate clients' digital transformations. Now the EPS target also assumes a higher tax rate for fiscal '20 of 26% to 28%, reflecting a changing mix of tax attributes in foreign jurisdictions and delays in the implementation of our tax planning strategies. Now that is pending further clarification of U.S. tax reform regulations. Now these delays, however, do not impact our long-term targets for tax of 22% to 25%.
I also would like to mention that we're working diligently to complete the filing of our 10-K by May 30. However, because of certain audit procedures regarding updates to the U.S. tax reform regulations, we may file the 10-K in early June within the extension period allowed by the SEC. And lastly, our adjusted free cash flow target for fiscal '20 is 90% of adjusted net income.
Now I'll turn the call back to the operator for the Q&A session."

And as a result, once they are clarified, we'll be able to implement our tax strategies. Until then, we're taking a little bit more risk and not optimizing our taxes.
In terms of the margin progression, I think we'll see a dip in the first quarter. This is usually -- if I look at it compared to the prior year. But we'll see also the impact of some of the acceleration of the cloud transformation, digital transformation that we're doing with our clients and the savings that we're giving them upfront. We'll see that impact on the revenue upfront. That will also impact our margins, particularly on the GIS side. But we should start to see at least a point improvement every quarter from the first quarter on out until the end of the year. And again, this is assuming Luxoft comes to us in the second -- starting in the second quarter and is not going to be much of a contribution from the -- just a 10%-or-so contribution for the margin on the Luxoft business."

In other words, we may need some additional analytic skills and less in some other areas, so we'll continue to combine that.
We're also really comfortable with this whole process we've put in place where customers come to these centers, we ideate with them, they get assigned to statements of work, approve our concepts, so I really feel very good about what we've been able to get done here on the digital skills. So we're not having problems finding people, recruiting people or onboarding them, and they're beginning to really contribute positively to the business as we go forward. You saw some of that in the growth that we reported.
We're also continuing to reskill hundreds of current DXC employees, so we're able to -- as we continue to move people off of the offerings where we have revenue runoff, we're increasingly retraining and reskilling so we can deploy them on other opportunities."

Let me provide a little color for you. I won't use any specific names here but an example would be a proposal I was working on this week as a matter of fact where we would extend somewhere in the neighborhood of $30 million in operational savings in-year. So this will be in-year, $30 million of operational savings. And in return, we would be the service provider that would move applications to the cloud. We would provide some additional analytics. We would provide some additional cybersecurity and some additional, what I'll call, operational optimization. That would be worth somewhere in the neighborhood, after we get through the first 6 months to 12 months, probably $40 million to $50 million of incremental revenue.
So what we're doing, and we're getting more and more comfortable with this model, is to provide those operational savings and then the customer commits to specific projects and workload. Now some of the revenue from those new projects are admittedly delayed a little bit, could be 90 days, could be 120 days, could be a little longer than that. But we're comfortable now that we're starting to get this model, get this into more of a standard process, and we're really encouraged by the receptivity on the part of our clients to this approach. So they can basically fund these digital programs through the operational savings that we give. And all we've got to be willing to do is to live with a little deferred recognition of some of the revenue and profitability. When we can grow these, then our view is we can take a lot of this traditional business and use that as an asset to fund future growth in the account and reposition DXC as not only a great operator of infrastructure but also a trusted digital partner."

I think the -- nothing unusual except, as I mentioned to you, we are accelerating the program of giving -- working with our customers to give them upfront savings so that we can get a greater share of their IT spend overall on digital. And so that's why you see the upfront decline a little bit in the -- more pronounced in the first quarter, and then we expect to just really start to recover some of that throughout the year.
And we have some seasonality, as you may recall, from Q4 to Q1 that's been usually -- and a few -- last year, for example, alone, it was about $300 million. So this first quarter will be a little bit higher than that given again the plans that -- that we're working on to accelerate those digital transformations. But after that, as I mentioned, we see a progression, incremental revenue throughout the year, and then you top that off with the Luxoft that comes onboard for Q2, Q3 and Q4.

We have invested over the last, I don't know, 1 year, 18 months on what we call a digital insurance platform. And fundamentally, this is taking different components that we had in our IP portfolio as well as some of the IP from our partners. And we put that into what we're referring to as a digital insurance platform.
Now we have now sold this in a couple of large insurance companies. Matter of fact, I was just in India last week and went through this whole approach with a couple of customers that we're visiting one of our centers in India. We are expecting that to begin to get some traction this coming fiscal year. It really has only been in the market, I don't know, 3 or 4 months, so the lead times on these things are quite lengthy because they're significant transformation projects.
So we are getting more and more encouraged that, that investment will begin to pay off. But to be quite candid with you, I don't know how to model that, I really don't know how -- I don't have enough customer wins and enough experience in implementing this new platform to be able to give you -- I don't have insights so I can't then share what -- how that's going to play out this year.
We've also done some of the same things with our health care platforms. And there also, we're beginning to see some traction. But I just don't have enough visibility yet to see that. So we have been disappointed by the IP performance over the last year. As I said, it's roughly flat. We were really hoping to get a couple points of growth. That is definitely holding us back a little bit. But we have made the investment, and we're going to continue to invest. And we've got the platforms now, we'll see how this begins to play out."

We continue to invest in Platform DXC. So yes, I mean we're continuing with these investments. The 2 biggest investments we're making from an IP standpoint is Platform DXC, which we view as critical to allow digital workloads, digital projects, to be able to be integrated into mainstream IT. Now we brand this differently. We don't brand it Platform DXC. The customers we're working with, we brand it x company platform so that -- because it's not a proprietary platform. It's very open, and it's built on our partners' technology like ServiceNow and others. So we continue to invest in that.
And we're continuing to invest in taking our own digital offerings and integrating them into Platform DXC. And then we continue to make a pretty significant investment in Bionix. We got very good yield out of Bionix. And as you know, Bionix is advanced analytics. It's lean as well as the tooling that goes along with that. So those are the 2 sort of generic investments we're making that cut across our whole portfolio and then the investments that I mentioned we're making in digital, particularly in skills acquisition and, in some cases, hiring ahead for the demand. One of the things, Rod, is in this digital world, it's not like the old IPO world where you won a contract and you had a transition time of 6 months or 8 months, and skills were a month late or 60 days late. It wasn't the end of the world. A lot of these digital projects are very perishable. People want to do it. There's -- it's measured in weeks, not months. And that's why we're building more of a bench in these DTCs to be able to respond.
The other issue is that a lot of these digital projects are not prescribed offerings. It really results as a part of an ideation process, a minimally viable product or a proof of concept, which also requires people to actually run that process, and then they get assigned to the actual project. So digital, Platform DXC, Bionix and then the investments I talked about in the health care and insurance make up the bulk of that. But we are investing more. We are investing more because we see the opportunity and the growth, and we're getting more comfortable with the model as we go forward."

We have an unbelievable relationship with our partners. So these kids have access to not only what we're doing in DXC and our clients, but they also have access to learn and grow through partners like Microsoft and AWS and others.
So -- and then finally, these recruits, if you will, see what we are doing with Luxoft and how we're entering that space from a digital engineering standpoint and then our global footprint, which gives them an opportunity to grow from a career path standpoint. Those are fairly compelling value propositions. And as I said, we're not having a lot of difficulty recruiting.
And I'll just make one other comment since this is the last question. I just was down in a couple of our centers. I'd tell you, it's like entering a new world. I did a town hall meeting in our New Orleans digital delivery center, transformation center. I mean it's just -- one, it's such a diverse group of people. I looked out in the audience, there was probably 300 or 400 people down there now, just all kinds of backgrounds, and there's -- the attitude is so different. I'd walk around in all these ideation rooms and enter with whiteboards and clients and talking about new opportunities and innovation. I mean it's -- and the tools that we have to help them with the -- it's just -- it's like a whole different world, which is just so exciting.
And as we continue to drive more of this digital revenue, that becomes more and more what the company looks like. And if you combine that with our unbelievable capabilities operationally with our ITO business and our application business, it really is a great opportunity to cocreate with the clients."

Thanks for taking the time today. As is my habit here, I've got 4 or 5 points. I'll go through those, go into a little bit more detail, and then turn it over to Paul and then we'll have plenty of time for Q&A.
First, fourth quarter non-GAAP EPS was $2.19. For fiscal 2019, non-GAAP EPS was $8.34. Adjusted EBIT was $827 million in the quarter, and the adjusted EBIT margin was 15.7%. For fiscal 2019, adjusted EBIT was $3.27 billion, and the adjusted EBIT margin was 15.8%. We generated $917 million of adjusted free cash flow in the fourth quarter. And for fiscal 2019, adjusted free cash flow was $2.1 billion.
Revenue in the fourth quarter was $5.28 billion on a GAAP basis. In constant currency, revenue was down 1% year-over-year and was up 1.7% sequentially. And for fiscal 2019, revenue was $20.75 billion, and we had a book-to-bill of 1.1x in the quarter and 1x for the year.
In constant currency, our digital revenue grew 22% year-over-year and 11.6% sequentially in the quarter. For fiscal 2019, digital revenue grew 15.8%. And the fourth quarter industry IP and BPS revenue was down 1.4% year-over-year and was roughly flat sequentially. And for fiscal 2019, industry IP and BPS revenue was down 0.3%. And in the fourth quarter, our digital book-to-bill was 1.8x, and our industry IP and BPS book-to-bill was 0.9x.
On my fourth point, we continue to make strategic investments in digital assets and capabilities, including the accelerated hiring efforts I've talked about before. We also expect to complete the acquisition of Luxoft by the end of June.
Now I'll go into each of these points in a little more detail, then I'll cover our targets for fiscal 2020 and turn it over to Paul. As I said, fourth quarter non-GAAP EPS was $2.19, and the effective tax rate was 24.3%. For fiscal 2019, non-GAAP EPS was $8.34, and the effective tax rate for the full year was 23.2%. Fourth quarter adjusted EBIT was $827 million. And the adjusted EBIT margin was 15.7%, roughly flat year-over-year and down 50 basis points sequentially, reflecting the investments in digital talent that we previously discussed as well as the upfront savings we're providing to clients to help accelerate their digital transformations.
For fiscal 2019, adjusted EBIT was $3.27 billion. And the adjusted EBIT margin was 15.8%, an improvement of 200 basis points. The margin improvement reflects ongoing execution against our key cost-saving levers, and the savings were in line with our fiscal '19 target that we've discussed before.
GBS segment profit margin was 20.4%, which was up 100 basis points year-over-year and 220 basis points sequentially. This reflects ongoing workforce optimization as well as the seasonality in the business. And for fiscal 2019, GBS margin was 18.9%, and this was up 240 basis points from the prior year.
In GIS, segment profit margin was 14.1%, which was down 50 basis points year-over-year and down 340 basis points sequentially, reflecting the investments I just discussed and the milestone achievement payments that I highlighted last quarter. And for fiscal 2019, the GIS margin was 15.8%, and this was up 270 basis points from the prior year. Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $917 million or 155% of adjusted net income, reflecting improvements in working capital. And for fiscal 2019, adjusted free cash flow was $2.1 billion or 90% of adjusted net income.
Now turning to revenue. Revenue in the fourth quarter, as I said, was $5.28 billion on a GAAP basis. In constant currency, revenue was down 1% year-over-year and was up 1.7% sequentially. Bookings were up 18.9% year-over-year and 2.5% sequentially for a book-to-bill of 1.1x.
Digital growth continues to offset more of the decline in our traditional business. And sequentially, digital revenue in the fourth quarter more than offset the decline in the traditional business. Now this balance between digital growth and traditional decline will continue to be lumpy as we go through the next year, but this is the revenue dynamic that we talked about before that will ultimately support long-term growth for the company.
For fiscal 2019, revenue was $20.75 billion on a GAAP basis, and book-to-bill was 1x. In the fourth quarter, GBS revenue was $2.2 billion. This was down 3.1% year-over-year in constant currency and up 0.9% sequentially. The year-over-year decline reflects headwinds in the traditional applications business, including the completion of several contracts in addition to the impact of accelerated cloud adoption. Now one of the drivers of increased cloud adoption is the ability to lift and shift existing workloads, which often eliminates the services associated with rationalizing and refactoring applications. GBS bookings in the quarter were up 40% year-over-year and up 27% sequentially for a book-to-bill of 1.3x. And for fiscal 2019, GBS revenue was $8.68 billion and a book-to-bill of 1.1x.
In the fourth quarter, GIS revenue was $3.09 billion, which was up 0.6% year-over-year in constant currency and up 2.3% sequentially driven by strong growth in our Workplace and Mobility business. Overall, GIS bookings of $2.97 billion were up 3.7% year-over-year and represent a book-to-bill of 1x. And for fiscal 2019, GIS revenue was $12.07 billion with a book-to-bill of 0.9x.
Now turning to digital and our IP and BPS results. In constant currency, digital revenue was up 22% year-over-year and was up 11.6% sequentially. Digital bookings continue to be very strong with a 1.8x book-to-bill in the quarter driven by continued strength in our cloud infrastructure and digital workplace bookings. And for fiscal 2019, digital revenue grew 15.8%. Digital growth in the quarter was driven by enterprise and cloud applications, cloud infrastructure and, as I said, digital workplace. All 3 businesses grew more than 20% year-over-year. The strong demand we're seeing for these capabilities is also reflected in our digital bookings and pipeline, both of which are up more than 50% year-over-year.
We're partnering with many of our clients to help generate savings to fund large digital transformations. In many cases, we provide these savings through lower operating costs on traditional services, which initially reduces revenue and profit on the account. And in return, we secure commitments from the client to expand DXC's wallet share and future digital spend, which allows us to grow revenue and profit over time.
A good example where we're leveraging our installed base to accelerate digital transformation is a contract we signed during the fourth quarter with a major global airline. Now building on our long-standing relationship with the client, we signed a 7-year transformation deal that provides upfront savings for the client through reduced operating costs. And in return, the client has committed to leverage those savings to fund digital transformation work with DXC. And this results in an initial reduction in revenue profit on the account but drives top line and bottom line growth over the full life cycle of the contract.
Now let me talk about the offering families within digital. In constant currency, cloud infrastructure grew 25% in the quarter and was up 8.9% sequentially driven by the accelerated cloud adoption I just talked about. Book-to-bill in the quarter was 1.5x, including the large airline deal as well as deals with the Australian tax office and a large European financial services institution. And for fiscal 2019, cloud infrastructure grew 22% in constant currency.
Enterprise cloud apps and consulting grew 20% year-over-year and 13.3% sequentially. Bookings in the quarter were strong with a book-to-bill of 1.4x. Wins in the quarter included a next-generation SAP deal with a South American utility provider and a CRM transformation program leveraging Salesforce.com for a large oil and gas company. And for fiscal 2019, enterprise cloud apps and consulting grew 10.1% in constant currency.
Analytics revenue was down 4.9%, up year-over-year in constant currency and was up 3.2% sequentially. We're seeing good bookings momentum in this business, particularly in the automotive sector. DXC's robotic drive solutions streamlined data analysis and algorithmic training to reduce the time and cost to develop autonomous vehicles. These solutions are very complementary to Luxoft's automotive offerings, and we believe the combined company has a compelling value proposition in this space. Bookings in the quarter were up 67% year-over-year for a book-to-bill of 1.3x.
We've continued to build on this momentum and recently signed a deal with BMW Group, leveraging DXC's robotic drive solutions. We're supporting BMW's autonomous vehicle development program, gathering massive amounts of road travel data from the global BMW test fleet. Using DXC's digital solution, BMW's R&D teams will achieve significantly faster autonomous drive development cycles.
Now not all areas of digital have done as well. Our security business was down 1.3% year-over-year in constant currency and down 1.5% sequentially as growth in Asia and Southern Europe partially offset the declines in the U.K. and Northern Europe. Book-to-bill in the quarter was strong at 1.2x. In constant currency, industry IP and BPS revenue was down 1.4% year-over-year and was roughly flat sequentially. Industry IP and BPS was down 0.3% or roughly flat for fiscal 2019. We continue to ramp revenue on some of the large insurance BPS contracts that I talked about before. This is offsetting declines we're seeing in some of our more generic BPS business, particularly in the U.K. and Europe where a few clients have in-sourced the work. Bookings in the fourth quarter were up 59% year-over-year, including a large deal with the California Department of Health Care Services.
Now turning quickly to point four. We continue to make significant investments in our digital talent, including accelerated hiring in our fastest-growing capabilities, expansion of our Digital Transformation Centers and capabilities and the ongoing build-out of our joint practices with partners such as AWS and Microsoft Azure.
During the fourth quarter, we hired an additional 2,000 people in our digital capabilities with an emphasis on software engineers, DevOps engineers, SAP consultants, data scientists and security engineers. We're making these investments to continue scaling the digital go-to-market model I previously discussed. For example, DXC has entered into an engineering relationship with DreamWorks Animation to develop a cloud-based pipeline for digital content creation. We're jointly shaping this solution with DreamWorks, leveraging our cloud, security and analytics solutions.
DXC will also expand our access to digital talent through the Luxoft acquisition. We'll leverage Luxoft's established presence in key markets such as Eastern Europe to attract digital talent, and we'll apply Luxoft's talent acquisition and management platform in support of DXC's broader digital capabilities. We expect to complete the Luxoft acquisition by the end of June. And as I've discussed, this acquisition builds on DXC's unique value proposition as an end-to-end mainstream IT and digital services market leader and strengthens the company's ability to design and deploy transformative digital solutions for clients at scale.
The addition of Luxoft will bring clients new capabilities in digital engineering, additional depth in key verticals and an expanded portfolio of digital offerings. And while we continue to operate Luxoft as a separate entity to protect its strong brand established recurring engine, DXC will undertake several changes to quickly apply Luxoft's strengths and capabilities to our broader business and help drive growth.
First, we're combining the existing industry expertise from both companies to create market-leading verticals in automotive and financial services. These 2 verticals will serve more than 20 major automotive OEMs and more than half of the top financial institutions in the Americas and Europe. DXC and Luxoft go-to-market teams will also work together to innovate and cross-sell solutions in other industry sectors where the company has a significant base of global business, including insurance and health care.
Now to my fifth point before I turn it over to Paul. For fiscal 2020, we expect revenue in the range of $20.7 billion to $21.2 billion, reflecting the impact of currency as well as the revenue dynamic between digital and traditional I previously discussed. This target assumes that Luxoft closes, as I said, at the end of June. And we're targeting non-GAAP EPS of $7.75 to $8.50 and adjusted free cash flow to be 90% or more of adjusted net income.
Now let me turn this over to Paul. Paul?"

As usual, I will start by covering some items that are excluded from our non-GAAP results. In the current quarter, we had restructuring costs of $47 million on a pretax basis or a $0.13 per diluted share after-tax. These costs represent severance related to workforce optimization programs and expenses associated with facilities and data center rationalization.
Now also in the quarter, we had $96 million on a pretax basis or $0.24 per diluted share after-tax for transaction, separation and integration-related costs associated with recent acquisitions such as Molina as well as activities related to the Luxoft acquisition. For the full year, restructuring, transaction, separation and integration costs amounted to $866 million on a pretax basis or $2.31 per diluted share after-tax driven by the cost of exiting more resources in complex countries and the higher-than-expected cost of exiting the shared IT environment with HPE. In addition, we had additional transactions costs associated with our digital acquisitions.
In the fourth quarter, amortization of acquired intangibles was $138 million on a pretax basis or $0.37 per diluted share after-tax. For the full year, amortization of acquired intangibles was $539 million on a pretax basis or $1.42 per diluted share after-tax. Also in the quarter, our annual remeasurement of pension assets and liabilities resulted in an accounting charge of $143 million. As of year-end, we had pension assets of $11.3 billion and pension liabilities of $11 billion for an overfunded pension position of $327 million. Excluding the impact of these special items, non-GAAP income from -- before taxes from continuing operations was $778 million for the quarter, and non-GAAP EPS was $2.19. For the full year, non-GAAP income before taxes from continuing operations was $3.06 billion, and non-GAAP EPS was $8.34.
Now I move on to our fourth quarter and full year results in more detail. GAAP revenue in the fourth quarter was $5.28 billion and $20.75 billion for the full year. Adjusted EBIT in the quarter was $827 million. Adjusted EBIT margin was 15.7%, relatively flat year-over-year and down 50 basis points sequentially. Adjusted EBIT in the quarter reflects additional investments we are making in our digital business, including additional digital transformation centers, acquiring new digital talent and enhancements to Platform DXC and Bionix.
For fiscal 2019, adjusted EBIT was $3.27 billion. Adjusted EBIT margin was 15.8%, up 200 basis points compared with the prior year. The year-over-year margin improvement reflects continued progress on our cost takeout plans in line with our targets for the year. Throughout fiscal '19, we accelerated the deployment of our Bionix automation program, which, combined with our other workforce optimization levers, allowed us to reduce our labor base by roughly 10,000 people or 7% on a net basis as we continue to shift the balance of our workforce to digital capabilities.
In supply chain, we're consolidating our supplier base, managing demand, leveraging our scale to renegotiate and restructure agreements and shifting more of our work to strategic vendors.
Turning to facilities. We eliminated an additional 4.6 million square feet this year, and we also rationalized 9 data centers. Since the merger, we have reduced our facilities footprint by more than 30%.
So in summary, we delivered over $500 million of in-year savings, which is roughly line with our full year targets. And as we previously discussed, we reinvested roughly half of those savings throughout fiscal '19. And primarily, those investments went into digital capabilities.
In the quarter, our non-GAAP tax rate was 24.3%. And for the full year, the non-GAAP tax rate was 23.2%, reflecting the net benefit of certain tax attributes in foreign jurisdictions. In the fourth quarter, bookings were $5.8 billion for a book-to-bill of 1.1x. And for the full year, bookings were $20.7 billion for a book-to-bill of 1x.
Now let's turn to our segment results. GBS revenue was $2.19 billion in the fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter, GBS segment profit was $447 million, and profit margin was 20.4%. The improvement in profitability reflects ongoing workforce optimization and the seasonality of that business. For the full year, GBS revenue was $8.7 billion. Segment profit was $1.6 billion. Margin was 18.9%. Booking were $9.3 billion for a book-to-bill of 1.1x.
GIS revenue was $3.09 billion in the fourth quarter. GIS segment profit in the fourth quarter was $436 million, and the profit margin was 14.1%. Now the profit margin reflects investments we are making in Platform DXC, Bionix as well as digital talent acceleration. GIS margin also reflects the timing of exiting resources in some of our complex markets. Now for the full year, GIS revenue was $12.1 billion, segment profit was $1.9 billion, margin was 15.8% and bookings were $11.5 billion for a book-to-bill of 0.9x.
Turning to other financial highlights. Adjusted free cash flow in the fourth quarter was $917 million. That is 155% of adjusted net income, reflecting tighter working capital management. For the full year, adjusted free cash flow was $2.1 billion or 90% of adjusted net income, which is in line with our original target for the full year.
Now our cash flow performance continues to exclude the impact of our receivables facility even though these transactions represent an outright sale of receivables with no recourse to DXC. Now our CapEx was $316 million in the quarter or 6% of revenue. And for the full year, CapEx was $1.15 billion or 5.5% of revenue. Cash at the end of the fourth quarter and at the end of the year was $2.9 billion. Our total debt was $7.4 billion, including capitalized leases for a net debt-to-capitalization ratio of 23.6%.
During the quarter, we paid $51 million in dividends and repurchased $91 million of shares for a total of $142 million in capital returned to shareholders. And for the fiscal year, we returned $1.55 billion of capital to our shareholders in the form of $210 million in dividends and $1.34 billion in share repurchases.
Now let me close by covering our fiscal '20 targets, which assume that the Luxoft transaction will close by the end of June. We are targeting revenue for the fiscal year to be in the range of $20.7 billion to $21.2 billion, and that includes roughly $250 million of currency headwinds from a stronger dollar compared with fiscal '19.
The revenue target reflects the impact of accelerated cloud adoptions on our traditional platform and application businesses. We're working with our clients to accelerate their digital transformation efforts by offering upfront savings on traditional services we provide. Near term, these actions reduce revenue and profit on those accounts. But in return, we expect to gain a greater share of their IT spend in digital, which should translate into a higher revenue and profit over time.
Our fiscal '20 target for EPS is $7.75 to $8.50, reflecting the incremental investments we are making in our digital business as well as the near-term impact of our efforts to accelerate clients' digital transformations. Now the EPS target also assumes a higher tax rate for fiscal '20 of 26% to 28%, reflecting a changing mix of tax attributes in foreign jurisdictions and delays in the implementation of our tax planning strategies. Now that is pending further clarification of U.S. tax reform regulations. Now these delays, however, do not impact our long-term targets for tax of 22% to 25%.
I also would like to mention that we're working diligently to complete the filing of our 10-K by May 30. However, because of certain audit procedures regarding updates to the U.S. tax reform regulations, we may file the 10-K in early June within the extension period allowed by the SEC. And lastly, our adjusted free cash flow target for fiscal '20 is 90% of adjusted net income.
Now I'll turn the call back to the operator for the Q&A session."

And as a result, once they are clarified, we'll be able to implement our tax strategies. Until then, we're taking a little bit more risk and not optimizing our taxes.
In terms of the margin progression, I think we'll see a dip in the first quarter. This is usually -- if I look at it compared to the prior year. But we'll see also the impact of some of the acceleration of the cloud transformation, digital transformation that we're doing with our clients and the savings that we're giving them upfront. We'll see that impact on the revenue upfront. That will also impact our margins, particularly on the GIS side. But we should start to see at least a point improvement every quarter from the first quarter on out until the end of the year. And again, this is assuming Luxoft comes to us in the second -- starting in the second quarter and is not going to be much of a contribution from the -- just a 10%-or-so contribution for the margin on the Luxoft business."

We're also really comfortable with this whole process we've put in place where customers come to these centers, we ideate with them, they get assigned to statements of work, approve our concepts, so I really feel very good about what we've been able to get done here on the digital skills. So we're not having problems finding people, recruiting people or onboarding them, and they're beginning to really contribute positively to the business as we go forward.

Let me provide a little color for you. I won't use any specific names here but an example would be a proposal I was working on this week as a matter of fact where we would extend somewhere in the neighborhood of $30 million in operational savings in-year. So this will be in-year, $30 million of operational savings. And in return, we would be the service provider that would move applications to the cloud. We would provide some additional analytics. We would provide some additional cybersecurity and some additional, what I'll call, operational optimization. That would be worth somewhere in the neighborhood after we get through the first 6 months to 12 months, probably $40 million to $50 million of incremental revenue.
So what we're doing, and we're getting more and more comfortable with this model, is to provide those operational savings and then the customer commits to specific projects and workload. Now some of the revenue from those new projects are admittedly delayed a little bit, could be 90 days, could be 120 days, could be a little longer than that. But we're comfortable now that we're starting to get this model, get this into more of a standard process, and we're really encouraged by the receptivity on the part of our clients to this approach. So they can basically fund these digital programs through the operational savings that we give. And all we've got to be willing to do is to live with a little deferred recognition of some of the revenue and profitability. When we can grow these, then our view is we can take a lot of this traditional business and use that as an asset to fund future growth in the account and reposition DXC as not only a great operator of infrastructure but also a trusted digital partner."

And we have some seasonality, as you may recall, from Q4 to Q1 that's been usually -- and a few -- last year, for example, alone, it was about $300 million. So this first quarter will be a little bit higher than that given again the plans that -- that we're working on to accelerate those digital transformations.

We have invested over the last, I don't know, 1 year, 18 months on what we call a digital insurance platform. And fundamentally, this is taking different components that we had in our IP portfolio as well as some of the IP from our partners. And we put that into what we're referring to as a digital insurance platform.
Now we have now sold this in a couple of large insurance companies. Matter of fact, I was just in India last week and went through this whole approach with a couple of customers that we're visiting one of our centers in India. We are expecting that to begin to get some traction this coming fiscal year. It really has only been in the market, I don't know, 3 or 4 months, so the lead times on these things are quite lengthy because they're significant transformation projects.
So we are getting more and more encouraged that, that investment will begin to pay off. But to be quite candid with you, I don't know how to model that, I really don't know how -- I don't have enough customer wins and enough experience in implementing this new platform to be able to give you -- I don't have insights so I can't then share what -- how that's going to play out this year.
We've also done some of the same things with our health care platforms. And there also, we're beginning to see some traction. But I just don't have enough visibility yet to see that. So we have been disappointed by the IP performance over the last year. As I said, it's roughly flat. We were really hoping to get a couple points of growth. That is definitely holding us back a little bit. But we have made the investment, and we're going to continue to invest. And we've got the platforms now, we'll see how this begins to play out."

The 2 biggest investments we're making from an IP standpoint is Platform DXC, which we view as critical to allow digital workloads, digital projects, to be able to be integrated into mainstream IT. Now we brand this differently. We don't brand it Platform DXC. The customers we're working with, we brand it x company platform so that -- because it's not a proprietary platform. It's very open, and it's built on our partners' technology like ServiceNow and others. So we continue to invest in that.
And we're continuing to invest in taking our own digital offerings and integrating them into Platform DXC. And then we continue to make a pretty significant investment in Bionix. We got very good yield out of Bionix. And as you know, Bionix is advanced analytics. It's lean as well as the tooling that goes along with that. So those are the 2 sort of generic investments we're making that cut across our whole portfolio and then the investments that I mentioned we're making in digital, particularly in skills acquisition and, in some cases, hiring ahead for the demand. One of the things, Rod, is in this digital world, it's not like the old IPO world where you won a contract and you had a transition time of 6 months or 8 months, and skills were a month late or 60 days late. It wasn't the end of the world. A lot of these digital projects are very perishable. People want to do it. There's -- it's measured in weeks, not months. And that's why we're building more of a bench in these DTCs to be able to respond.
The other issue is that a lot of these digital projects are not prescribed offerings. It really results as a part of an ideation process, a minimally viable product or a proof of concept, which also requires people to actually run that process, and then they get assigned to the actual project. So digital, Platform DXC, Bionix and then the investments I talked about in the health care and insurance make up the bulk of that. But we are investing more. We are investing more because we see the opportunity and the growth, and we're getting more comfortable with the model as we go forward."

So these kids have access to not only what we're doing in DXC and our clients, but they also have access to learn and grow through partners like Microsoft and AWS and others.
So -- and then finally, these recruits, if you will, see what we are doing with Luxoft and how we're entering that space from a digital engineering standpoint and then our global footprint, which gives them an opportunity to grow from a career path standpoint. Those are fairly compelling value propositions. And as I said, we're not having a lot of difficulty recruiting.
And I'll just make one other comment since this is the last question. I just was down in a couple of our centers. I'd tell you, it's like entering a new world. I did a town hall meeting in our New Orleans digital delivery center, transformation center. I mean it's just -- one, it's such a diverse group of people. I looked out in the audience, there was probably 300 or 400 people down there now, just all kinds of backgrounds, and there's -- the attitude is so different. I'd walk around in all these ideation rooms and enter with whiteboards and clients and talking about new opportunities and innovation. I mean it's -- and the tools that we have to help them with the -- it's just -- it's like a whole different world, which is just so exciting.

And then we'll be available for any questions.
First, our non-GAAP EPS in the first quarter was $1.74. The adjusted EBIT was $652 million, and the adjusted EBIT margin was 13.3%. And we generated $72 million of adjusted free cash flow in the first quarter. 
Our revenue in the first quarter was $4.89 billion on a GAAP basis. In constant currency, revenue was down 4.2% year-over-year, pretty much in line with what we expected. And The book-to-bill was 0.9x for the quarter, reflecting a couple of delays in some deals that we had expected to close in Q1.
In the first quarter, the Digital revenue grew 35% year-over-year primarily driven by enterprise and cloud apps, cloud infrastructure and our digital workplace. Our industry IP and BPS revenue grew 3.5% year-over-year. And the Digital book-to-bill was 1.3x, and the industry IP and BS -- BPS book-to-bill was 1.2x.
On my fourth point, in June, we completed the acquisition of Luxoft, which strengthens DXC's value proposition as an end-to-end mainstream IT and digital services market leader. We also announced a joint DXC and Microsoft Azure digital transformation practice, building on our long-standing relationship with Microsoft. And in the next few days, we also plan to announce a strategic partnership with Google Cloud, which will enable enterprise clients to modernize IT and integrated digital solutions by capitalizing on Google Cloud Platform. And I'll talk a little bit more about that in a moment.
And finally, we now expect additional currency headwinds for the full year. Combined with some of the delays in these deals as well as additional pressure on our traditional business, we are revising our revenue guidance for the whole year to a range of $20.2 billion to $20.7 billion. And given this lower revenue and some delays in cost savings, which I'll talk about in a moment, our non-GAAP EPS target is now $7 to $7.75. And we continue to target adjusted free cash flow of 90% or more of adjusted net income.
Now let me just go into a little more detail. I said the first quarter non-GAAP EPS was $1.74. The effective tax rate was 20.1%. The first quarter adjusted EBIT was $652 million and the adjusted EBIT margin was 13.3%, including the impact of the investments I discussed last quarter and accelerated mix shift to Digital and some delays in executing resources in high cost complex countries, and I'll provide a little more color on these points
As we discussed, we continued to make significant investments in digital talent, including both hiring new employees and upskilling our existing workforce. We also are expanding our digital transformation centers and investing in joint practices with partners such as AWS, Microsoft and Google. These investments are necessary to continue building on the strong momentum we have in the digital business, and we continue to plan on roughly $100 million of incremental investments this year.
The first quarter also has the most impact from the accelerated client savings we discussed last quarter. We are seeing these trade-offs translating to greater opportunities in qualified digital jail pipeline, which was up roughly 80% year-over-year in Q1. 
During the quarter, we saw an acceleration in the shift from traditional infrastructure to digital solutions. For example our cloud infrastructure business was up 36% year-over-year, which was faster growth than what we had expected. And as we migrate client workloads out of the legacy environments, there are stranded costs we have to address including assets as well as people. And given the accelerated pace and expanded scope of cloud migrations, we weren't able to get these costs out during the first quarter, but we're taking action and expect to remove the stranded costs by the end of the third quarter.
Our delivery team was also behind on it's fiscal '20 cost improvement plan, particularly on workforce actions in high-cost countries. Now as we continue to expand deployment of our Bionix automation program into additional geographies and client environments, it is taking longer to eliminate the headcount as we automate activities. And in some cases, we are required to implement the full automation solution prior to removing any of the resources. Now we're implementing actions to improve execution and second half profit, including accelerated labor pyramid improvements, reductions in non-billable and underutilized resources and further optimization of nonlabor spend such as hardware, maintenance and software rates. 
As I said, adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $72 million or 15% of adjusted net income, reflecting lumpiness of cash flow, including the timing of our sales commission payments, Our fiscal 2019 bonus payments and prepaid software enterprise license agreements. However, we continue to expect adjusted free cash flow to be 90% or more of adjusted net income for the year.
Now let me turn to revenue. As I said, in the first quarter, revenue was $4.89 billion on a GAAP basis. Now all revenue comparisons I'll discuss will be in constant currency. 
In the first quarter, revenue was down 4.2% year-over-year, in line with what we expected. And the book-to-bill in the quarter was 0.9, reflecting some delays on some large deals.
In the first quarter, GBS revenue was $2.2 billion, which was up 0.5% year-over-year. The year-over-year improvement reflects continued momentum in our enterprise and cloud applications business as well as the addition of Molina and 2 weeks of the Luxoft business. As I discussed last quarter, accelerated cloud adoption is eliminating some of the services associated with rationalizing and refactoring traditional applications. And this dynamic is an ongoing headwind for legacy applications services. GBS book-to-bill in the quarter was 1.1, and bookings were up 22% year-over-year, reflecting strong bookings in the enterprise cloud apps, analytics and industry IP and BPS.
GIS revenue was $2.7 billion in the first quarter, down 7.6% year-over-year. This reflects the accelerated client savings we've discussed last quarter as well as increased momentum in digital migrations. Cloud and digital workplace both grew more than 35% year-over-year. And similar to the dynamic I discussed in traditional applications, these accelerated shifts pressured the traditional GIS business as clients lift and shift existing workloads to recognize immediate savings. Over time, we typically grow revenue by migrating additional workloads into our multi-cloud environment, but the initial shift often results in less near-term revenue. And we're also seeing some slowdown in additional add-on project work in legacy environment as more investment is made in the digital solutions.
Now to offset these traditional headwinds, we're taking a much more aggressive approach on the GIS pipeline development. We've expanded our sales efforts, targeting large infrastructure outsourcing opportunities for new clients with a focus on deals that involve the modernization of the traditional environment and at the same time investing in digital projects. And we're still early this process, however, we're seeing good traction. Total infrastructure pipeline in the first quarter was up 32% year-over-year and 22% sequentially. And we expect to drive additional revenue during the second half of the year. The GIS book-to-bill in the quarter was 0.7x, reflecting the lumpiness in large deal signings and some of the delays that I had mentioned previously.
Now let me move on to our digital industry IP and BPS results. Digital revenue was up 35% year-over-year, including 2 weeks of revenue from Luxoft. Excluding Luxoft, Digital revenue grew 31%, and the book-to-bill in the quarter was 1.3x. As I've discussed, we are seeing good enterprise expensed environment in digital, particularly with respect to enterprise cloud migrations. As we partner with our clients in these transformations, we continue to see strong momentum in our cloud infrastructure solutions. This business grew 36% year-over-year, reflecting migrations and continued demand for multi-cloud solutions. And we're seeing good traction in this business across geographies and across industries.
For example during the first quarter, we won a deal with a major European aerospace and defense company to provide cloud migration, security and analytics services. We are leveraging our knowledge of the legacy estate to modernize the client's IT architecture and help them thrive in a highly competitive market. We built an Agile platform that enables development and deployment of solutions such as next generation smart factories, asset use optimization and application of artificial intelligence to everyday business challenges. 
Enterprise cloud apps and consulting continues to perform well with a 17.1% year-over-year growth, including strong growth in our Americas region, particularly in our Microsoft, ServiceNow and SAP practices. We're also partnered with Salesforce to win a major multiyear deal with 4 global luxury retail brands. We are providing development and support services on Salesforce Commerce Cloud, supporting roughly 35 B2C websites globally.
Security revenue performance improved in the quarter and grew 5.7% year-over-year with particular strength in Asia and Europe. And during the quarter, we won a multiyear deal that provides managed security services for a major European car manufacturer, leveraging standard DXC offerings as well as partnered offerings with [ Micro Focus, Fortify and Carbon Block. ] The solution includes threat intelligence, security event monitoring, vulnerability management, forensic investigations and regulatory and policy compliance controls.
We also saw a improved performance in industry IP and BPS. Revenue was up 3.5% year-over-year in constant currency driven by a 7% growth in our industry IP offerings. And with the addition of Molina, we are seeing strong demand in our U.S. state Medicaid business. During the first quarter, we signed add-on deals with Tennessee, California and Ohio worth over $100 million each. And industry IP and BPS book-to-bill in the quarter was 1.2x. 
Now my fourth point, during the first quarter, we completed the acquisition of Luxoft, which strengthens DXC's unique value proposition as a leading end-to-end IT services provider. As we previously announced, Luxoft will continue to be led by Dimitri , who will report directly to me. Luxoft brings a 13,000-person workforce that provides digital strategy consulting and engineering services for companies across North America, Europe and Asia. Luxoft will retain its brand and operate as a DXC Technology company, but we've already launched joint go-to-market efforts to cross-sell solutions to both companies' current clients and to target new clients across industry verticals. Processes and incentives have been put in place to promote and reward cross-selling, and we're encouraged by the early progress we're seeing in the joint pipeline of opportunities.
The acquisition also expands DXC's access to digital talent by leveraging Luxoft's presence in key markets, especially in Eastern Europe and by broadly deploying Luxoft's unique talent acquisition and management platform. We are undertaking several changes to quickly apply Luxoft's strengths and capabilities to DXC's business. 
Within Luxoft, we are creating industry-leading verticals in automotive and financial services. These 2 verticals will serve more than 20 major automotive OEMs and more than half of the top financial institutions in the Americas and Europe. And 2 key digital offerings, the Internet of Things and blockchain, will also be combined within Luxoft.
Now we continue to expect Luxoft to provide roughly $700 million in revenue during the last 3 quarters of the fiscal year, in addition to the 2 weeks of revenue we were able to recognize by closing the deal in the middle of June. 
Now turning to our partnerships. We recently announced a joint practice with Microsoft Azure. The DXC and Microsoft Azure digital transformation practice enhances our deep and long-standing relationship with Microsoft. This joint practice will provide clients with a highly integrated approach to modernizing their IT systems on Azure. And the result would be a reduced of time to digital and a more rapid movement of client workloads from legacy IT to a modern cloud architecture on Azure.
In addition, we recently signed a strategic partnership with Google Cloud. This partnership will allow us to modernize mission-critical IT for enterprise clients and integrate digital solutions capitalizing on the Google Cloud Platform. Now under our partnership agreement, DXC will also be launching centers of excellence for Google Cloud Platform and Google Cloud artificial intelligence to provide clients with secure, Agile and [ expandable ] cloud-based digital platforms that leverage our advanced analytics capability. And we'll be providing more information on this as the partnership evolves.
The Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud practice complement our ongoing cloud work with AWS, Oracle and VMware to give our clients access to the largest cloud providers in the world.
And my fifth point before I turn this over to Paul is we now expect an additional $150 million to $200 million of currency headwinds for the full year. And as I've discussed, we're also seeing more impact on our traditional business as accelerated client migrations pressure near-term revenue. And combined with some of the delays I've talked about, we're revising our revenue guidance for the full year to a range of $20.2 billion to $20.7 billion. In addition to this lower revenue outlook, delays in some of our cost savings actions will lower our margins, and our non-GAAP EPS target is now $7 to $7.75. And as I said, we continue to expect adjusted free cash flow to be 90% or more of adjusted net income. 
And with that, I will turn it over to Paul."

As usual, I'll start by covering some items that are excluded from our non-GAAP results.In the first quarter, we had restructuring costs of $142 million pretax or $0.42 per diluted share, and this is primarily related to workforce optim",1004,"Thank you, Mike. As usual, I'll start by covering some items that are excluded from our non-GAAP results.
In the first quarter, we had restructuring costs of $142 million pretax or $0.42 per diluted share, and this is primarily related to workforce optimization. Also in the quarter, we had $105 million pretax or $0.31 per diluted share of integration, separation and transaction-related costs, including costs associated with the Luxoft transaction. In the first quarter, amortization of acquired intangibles was $138 million pretax or $0.40 per diluted share. Excluding the impact of these special items, non-GAAP income before taxes from continuing operations was $591 million and non-GAAP EPS was $1.74.
Turning now to our first quarter results in more detail. GAAP revenue in Q1 was $4.89 billion, down 4.2% year-over-year in constant currency. Adjusted EBIT in the quarter was $652 million. Adjusted EBIT margin was 13.3%, reflecting the investments we are making to help clients accelerate their digital transformations with us as well as incremental investments we're making to support the continued momentum in our digital business.
Our EBIT margin in the quarter was lower than we had anticipated. We experienced delays in executing on our cost takeout plans. And while we reduced our headcount by 3,900 people in the quarter, we fell short of our expectations as we experienced delays in exiting resources in high-cost complex countries.
Also in our Bionix program, we've expanded beyond DXC's delivery centers into clients' environments. Now this involves reengineering of client processes before savings can be realized, and it is taking more time to execute on these joint efforts.
Now we still intend to execute on our original workforce optimization plans, but the benefit will now be pushed out into the second half of the year.
In the quarter, our non-GAAP tax rate was 20.1%, reflecting our global mix of income and the benefit of a return to provision true-up in certain foreign jurisdictions.
Turning now to our segment results. GBS revenue was $2.16 billion the first quarter, up 0.5% year-over-year in constant currency. In the first quarter, GBS segment profit was $366 million, and profit margin was 17% compared with 18.2% in the prior year. GBS margins reflect the investments we are making in hiring and training digital talent as well as in the expansion of our digital transformation centers.
GIS revenue was $2.73 billion in the first quarter. GIS segment profit in the first quarter was $340 million, and profit margin was 12.4%. GIS margin reflects the investment we are making to help accelerate our clients' digital transformations and the timing on some of our cost takeout actions.
Turning to other financial results. Adjusted free cash flow in the quarter was $72 million or 15% of adjusted net income. And this reflects the timing of annual payments for software licenses and maintenance, investment made to consolidate real estate facilities and the timing of refresh programs on a few large accounts. As a result, our CapEx was $357 million in the quarter or 7.3% of revenue, but we expect our CapEx to moderate over the course of the year. 
During the quarter, we paid $51 million in dividends. We also repurchased $400 million of shares through a combination of open market purchases and an accelerated share repurchase program. In total, we returned $451 million in capital to shareholders. And we continue to be opportunistic in returning more capital to our shareholders.
Cash at the end of the quarter was $1.9 billion. During the quarter, we funded the Luxoft acquisition with $2 billion of additional debt. We also paid down $430 million of current maturities of long-term debt. At the end of the quarter, our total debt was $9.4 billion including capitalized leases, for a net debt to total capitalization ratio of 36.5%.
Now let me close by covering our revised fiscal '20 targets. we're targeting revenue of $20.2 billion to $20.7 billion, including Luxoft. This revised outlook includes the impact of $150 million to $200 million of additional currency headwinds from a strengthening dollar since the beginning of May. 
Our revised outlook also reflects the near-term impact from delayed deal closings as well as slippage on a few large transformation milestones. However, we expect a second half improvement in revenue as those deals close and we convert on our strong pipeline, including cross-sell opportunities with Luxoft.
We are now targeting non-GAAP EPS of $7 to $7.75 for the full year, reflecting the impact of lower revenue as well as the first half delays in executing on our delivery cost takeout programs. 
We now expect to achieve $250 million to $300 million of cost savings this year versus our original target of $400 million. We expect a lower revenue and delays in cost takeout to impact second quarter margins by about 1 point sequentially, but we expect margins to improve in the second half of the year through labor actions, supply chain improvements and real estate consolidation.
Our workforce optimization actions include labor pyramids and location mix improvements. Now while we've driven significant productivity improvements in our delivery organization the last several quarters, we have additional opportunities to extract greater efficiencies from our middle-management layers, including the number of managers as well as their location mix.
In supply chain, we're in the process of renegotiating several large software contracts as well as driving additional vendor consolidation to achieve incremental savings. 
In real estate, we plan to eliminate an additional 600,000 square feet of office space and close 3 additional data centers throughout the year.
Our EPS target assumes a tax rate of 26% to 28% for the full year, reflecting our tax attributes in foreign jurisdictions as well as the increased liability due to the Luxoft acquisition. Given our lower tax rate in Q1, we expect a higher tax rate over the next 3 quarters of about 30%.
We continue to expect adjusted free cash flow to be 90% or more of adjusted net income. 
I'll now hand the call back to the operator for the Q&A session."

You're going to find out over the full year, we see probably upside to that performance. You're right, our industry IP in particular and BPS business has strengthened since we exited last fiscal year. 
I think the new news for me here as I look to the quarter were a couple of things. One, we saw a greater acceleration, particularly on the move to cloud. And that does impact our business. It impacts -- we've seen this impact certainly on the application business, but it also is impacting what I would refer to as sort of volumetrics. In many of our contracts, we get paid [indiscernible]. So we are seeing some greater acceleration there. Now we're seeing the other side of it too because our cloud infrastructure business is growing faster than what we had expected.
Now that's requiring us to take more actions from a cost standpoint and how we do that. We didn't execute that as quickly as we wanted to in the first quarter. And we think we can catch up on that as we go through the second, third, fourth quarter of this year. But that's primarily the new news is the acceleration of this cloud migration, and that does impact our infrastructure business in particular."

And that will just really be with us through the second quarter, but we expect to catch up in the third and fourth quarters.

As I said, some of those deals that we did, we saw that impact in the first quarter, okay? So my confidence level on that part of that strategy is very high as we are seeing that absolutely flow through. 
And if I look at the pipeline as I look out for the balance of the year in Digital, very strong. And that's before we even throw Luxoft into the equation. 
So from a strategy standpoint and a plan standpoint, that is working. Where we had some new news was the acceleration of the movement to cloud and the impact that is having on our traditional ideal business. And then our ability to respond to that in the first quarter from a cost standpoint, we were not able to respond quickly enough
The other factor I mentioned is Bionix. I'm really pleased with the progress we're making in Bionix, but that now is becoming much more client by client. And many clients are -- want to see that improvement from Bionix before we actually exit the people. And that's fine. That makes good sense.

Well, we look at our top 200 or 300 clients, which is what I look at. And of that, I'm not going to name any specific clients, but we are seeing an acceleration of this move to an cloud infrastructure. It is somewhat industry-specific. So some of the industries that are more exposed to like consumer packaged goods, for example, is migrating more rapidly to the cloud than let's say, financial services or insurance. So it's not so much that there's new clients that we're seeing this in. We're just seeing a slightly more rapid adoption of the cloud infrastructure in the top 200, 300 clients that we have.
Now that's being offset, it's being offset by some of this digital revenue that we talked about. And then what we -- now that we have what I call shored up, most of our March contracts and renewed most those large contracts, we don't have a lot of those on the horizon this year. We are being more aggressive in targeting now more new clients from an IT modernization standpoint.
That's what we are now seeing in the pipeline. So matter of fact, we got up stronger pipeline in traditional IP modernization than we had in years as we begin to make that shift to driving much more of a sort of aggressive offense to play around IT modernization."

There's certainly pricing pressure around some of those traditional outsourcing and IT modernization programs.

That being said also, you're absolutely right. I think the GBS business will be a little bit closer to its original target because that's where we have a whole lot of our digital assets.

Now we're going to try to do a better job of understanding that and forecasting it. But I got to tell you, there are some limits as to how you can forecast those volumes. This has not been a huge issue in the past because the volumes were quite stable. But what we're seeing with this accelerated shift to the clouds, some of those volumes are shifting around.

I mean you mentioned last quarter that you're pursuing these deals where you give clients upfront savings, but then you get a commitment to make up the spend gap over time by shifting into digital scope. So I'd like your take on whether this accelerated cloud shift is an outright negative. Or is it more of a situation where you're taking a hit now, but with the benefit later of a shift into more of a digital business mix, which is kind of a long-term goal that you're trying to accomplish?

And then we'll be available for any questions.
First, our non-GAAP EPS in the first quarter was $1.74. The adjusted EBIT was $652 million, and the adjusted EBIT margin was 13.3%. And we generated $72 million of adjusted free cash flow in the first quarter. 
Our revenue in the first quarter was $4.89 billion on a GAAP basis. In constant currency, revenue was down 4.2% year-over-year, pretty much in line with what we expected. And the book-to-bill was 0.9x for the quarter, reflecting a couple of delays in some deals that we had expected to close in Q1.
In the first quarter, the Digital revenue grew 35% year-over-year primarily driven by enterprise and cloud apps, cloud infrastructure and our digital workplace. Our industry IP and BPS revenue grew 3.5% year-over-year. And the Digital book-to-bill was 1.3x, and the industry IP and BS -- BPS book-to-bill was 1.2x.
On my fourth point, in June, we completed the acquisition of Luxoft, which strengthens DXC's value proposition as an end-to-end mainstream IT and digital services market leader. We also announced a joint DXC and Microsoft Azure digital transformation practice, building on our long-standing relationship with Microsoft. And in the next few days, we also plan to announce a strategic partnership with Google Cloud, which will enable enterprise clients to modernize IT and integrate digital solutions capitalizing on Google Cloud Platform. And I'll talk a little bit more about that in a moment.
And finally, we now expect additional currency headwinds for the full year. Combined with some of the delays in these deals as well as additional pressure on our traditional business, we're revising our revenue guidance for the whole year to a range of $20.2 billion to $20.7 billion. And given this lower revenue and some delays in cost savings, which I'll talk about in a moment, our non-GAAP EPS target is now $7 to $7.75. And we continue to target adjusted free cash flow of 90% or more of adjusted net income.
Now let me just go into a little more detail. As I said, the first quarter non-GAAP EPS was $1.74. The effective tax rate was 20.1%. The first quarter adjusted EBIT was $652 million, and the adjusted EBIT margin was 13.3%, including the impact of the investments I discussed last quarter, an accelerated mix shift to Digital and some delays executing resources in high-cost complex countries, and I'll provide a little more color on these points.
As we discussed, we continued to make significant investments in digital talent, including both hiring new employees and upskilling our existing workforce. We also are expanding our digital transformation centers and investing in joint practices with partners such as AWS, Microsoft and Google. These investments are necessary to continue building on the strong momentum we have in the digital business, and we continue to plan on roughly $100 million of incremental investments this year.
The first quarter also has the most impact from the accelerated client savings we discussed last quarter. We're seeing these trade-offs translate into greater opportunities and a qualified digital pipeline, which was up roughly 80% year-over-year in Q1. 
During the quarter, we saw an acceleration in the shift from traditional infrastructure to digital solutions. For example our cloud infrastructure business was up 36% year-over-year, which was faster growth than what we had expected. And as we migrate client workloads out of the legacy environments, there are stranded costs that we have to address including assets as well as people. Given the accelerated pace and expanded scope of cloud migrations, we weren't able to get these costs out during the first quarter, but we're taking action and expect to remove the stranded costs by the end of the third quarter.
Our delivery team was also behind on its fiscal '20 cost improvement plan, particularly on workforce actions in high-cost countries. As we continue to expand deployment of our Bionix automation program into additional geographies and client environments, it is taking longer to eliminate the headcount as we automate activities. And in some cases, we're required to implement the full automation solution prior to removing any of the resources. Now we're implementing actions to improve execution and second half profit, including accelerated labor pyramid improvements, reductions in nonbillable and underutilized resources and further optimization of nonlabor spend such as hardware maintenance and software rates. 
As I said, adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $72 million or 15% of adjusted net income, reflecting lumpiness of cash flow, including the timing of our sales commission payments, our fiscal 2019 bonus payments and prepaid software enterprise license agreements. However, we continue to expect adjusted free cash flow to be 90% or more of adjusted net income for the year.
Now let me turn to revenue. As I said, in the first quarter, revenue was $4.89 billion on a GAAP basis. Now all revenue comparisons I'll discuss will be in constant currency. 
In the first quarter, revenue was down 4.2% year-over-year, in line with what we expected. And the book-to-bill in the quarter was 0.9, reflecting some delays on some large deals.
In the first quarter, GBS revenue was $2.2 billion, which was up 0.5% year-over-year. The year-over-year improvement reflects continued momentum in our enterprise and cloud applications business as well as the addition of Molina and 2 weeks of the Luxoft business. As I discussed last quarter, accelerated cloud adoption is eliminating some of the services associated with rationalizing and refactoring traditional applications. And this dynamic is an ongoing headwind for legacy application services. GBS book-to-bill in the quarter was 1.1, and bookings were up 22% year-over-year, reflecting strong bookings in the enterprise cloud apps, analytics and industry IP and BPS.
GIS revenue was $2.7 billion in the first quarter, down 7.6% year-over-year. This reflects the accelerated client savings we've discussed last quarter as well as increased momentum in digital migrations. Cloud and digital workplace both grew more than 35% year-over-year. And similar to the dynamic I discussed in traditional applications, these accelerated shifts pressure the traditional GIS business as clients lift and shift existing workloads to recognize immediate savings. Over time, we typically grow revenue by migrating additional workloads into our multi-cloud environment, but the initial shift often results in less near-term revenue. And we're also seeing some slowdown in additional add-on project work in legacy environment as more investment is made in the digital solutions.
Now to offset these traditional headwinds, we're taking a much more aggressive approach on the GIS pipeline development. We've expanded our sales efforts, targeting large infrastructure outsourcing opportunities for new clients with a focus on deals that involve modernization of the traditional environment while at the same time investing in digital projects. We're still early in this process, however, we're seeing good traction. Total infrastructure pipeline in the first quarter was up 32% year-over-year and 22% sequentially. And we expect to drive additional revenue during the second half of the year. The GIS book-to-bill in the quarter was 0.7x, reflecting the lumpiness in large deal signings and some of the delays that I had mentioned previously.
Now let me move on to our digital industry IP and BPS results. Digital revenue was up 35% year-over-year, including 2 weeks of revenue from Luxoft. Excluding Luxoft, Digital revenue grew 31%, and the book-to-bill in the quarter was 1.3x. As I've discussed, we're seeing good enterprise spend environment in digital, particularly with respect to enterprise cloud migrations. As we partner with our clients on these transformations, we continue to see strong momentum in our cloud infrastructure solutions. This business grew 36% year-over-year, reflecting accelerated migrations and continued demand for multi-cloud solutions. And we're seeing good traction in this business across geographies and across industries.
For example during the first quarter, we won a deal with a major European aerospace and defense company to provide cloud migration, security and analytics services. We're leveraging our knowledge of the legacy estate to modernize the client's IT architecture and help them thrive in a highly competitive market. We built an Agile platform that enables development and deployment of solutions such as next generation smart factories, asset use optimization and application of artificial intelligence to everyday business challenges. 
Enterprise cloud apps and consulting continues to perform well with a 17.1% year-over-year growth, including strong growth in our Americas region, particularly in our Microsoft, ServiceNow and SAP practices. We're also partnered with Salesforce to win a major multiyear deal with 4 global luxury retail brands. We are providing development and support services on Salesforce Commerce Cloud, supporting roughly 35 B2C websites globally.
Security revenue performance improved in the quarter and grew 5.7% year-over-year with particular strength in Asia and Europe. And during the quarter, we won a multiyear deal to provide managed security services for a major European car manufacturer, leveraging standard DXC offerings as well as partnered offerings with Micro Focus, Fortify and Carbon Black. The solution includes threat intelligence, security event monitoring, vulnerability management, forensic investigations and regulatory and policy compliance controls.
We also saw improved performance in industry IP and BPS. Revenue was up 3.5% year-over-year in constant currency driven by a 7% growth in our industry IP offerings. And with the addition of Molina, we're seeing strong demand in our U.S. state Medicaid business. During the first quarter, we signed add-on deals with Tennessee, California and Ohio worth over $100 million each. And industry IP and BPS book-to-bill in the quarter was 1.2x. 
Now my fourth point, during the first quarter, we completed the acquisition of Luxoft, which strengthens DXC's unique value proposition as a leading end-to-end IT services provider. As we previously announced, Luxoft will continue to be led by Dmitry Loschinin, who will report directly to me. Luxoft brings a 13,000-person workforce that provides digital strategy consulting and engineering services for companies across North America, Europe and Asia. Luxoft will retain its brand and operate as a DXC Technology company, but we've already launched joint go-to-market efforts to cross-sell solutions to both companies' current clients and to target new clients across industry verticals. Processes, incentives have been put in place to promote and reward cross-selling, and we're encouraged by the early progress we're seeing in the joint pipeline of opportunities.
The acquisition also expands DXC's access to digital talent by leveraging Luxoft's presence in key markets, especially Eastern Europe, and by broadly deploying Luxoft's unique talent acquisition and management platform. We're undertaking several changes to quickly apply Luxoft's strengths and capabilities to DXC's business. 
Within Luxoft, we're creating industry-leading verticals in automotive and financial services. These 2 verticals will serve more than 20 major automotive OEMs and more than half of the top financial institutions in the Americas and Europe. And 2 key digital offerings, the Internet of Things and blockchain, will also be combined within Luxoft.
Now we continue to expect Luxoft to provide roughly $700 million in revenue during the last 3 quarters of the fiscal year in addition to the 2 weeks of revenue we were able to recognize by closing the deal in the middle of June. 
Now turning to our partnerships. We recently announced a joint practice with Microsoft Azure. The DXC and Microsoft Azure digital transformation practice enhances our deep and long-standing relationship with Microsoft. This joint practice will provide clients with a highly integrated approach to modernizing their IT systems on Azure. And the result would be a reduced time to digital and a more rapid movement of client workloads from legacy IT to a modern cloud architecture on Azure.
In addition, we recently signed a strategic partnership with Google Cloud. This partnership will allow us to modernize mission-critical IT for enterprise clients and integrate digital solutions capitalizing on the Google Cloud Platform. Now under our partnership agreement, DXC will also be launching centers of excellence for Google Cloud Platform and Google Cloud artificial intelligence to provide clients with secure, Agile and scalable cloud-based digital platforms that leverage our advanced analytics capability. And we'll be providing more information on this as the partnership evolves.
The Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud practice complement our ongoing cloud work with AWS, Oracle and VMware to give our clients access to the largest cloud providers in the world.
And my fifth point before I turn this over to Paul is we now expect an additional $150 million to $200 million of currency headwind for the full year. And as I've discussed, we're also seeing more impact on our traditional business as accelerated client migrations pressure near-term revenue. And combined with some of the delays I've talked about, we're revising our revenue guidance for the full year to a range of $20.2 billion to $20.7 billion. In addition to this lower revenue outlook, delays in some of our cost savings actions will lower our margins, and our non-GAAP EPS target is now $7 to $7.75. And as I said, we continue to expect adjusted free cash flow to be 90% or more of adjusted net income. 
And with that, I will turn it over to Paul."

As usual, I'll start by covering some items that are excluded from our non-GAAP results.
In the first quarter, we had restructuring costs of $142 million pretax or $0.42 per diluted share, and this is primarily related to workforce optimization. Also in the quarter, we had $105 million pretax or $0.31 per diluted share of integration, separation and transaction-related costs, including costs associated with the Luxoft transaction. In the first quarter, amortization of acquired intangibles was $138 million pretax or $0.40 per diluted share. Excluding the impact of these special items, non-GAAP income before taxes from continuing operations was $591 million and non-GAAP EPS was $1.74.
Turning now to our first quarter results in more detail. GAAP revenue in Q1 was $4.89 billion, down 4.2% year-over-year in constant currency. Adjusted EBIT in the quarter was $652 million. Adjusted EBIT margin was 13.3%, reflecting the investments we're making to help clients accelerate their digital transformations with us as well as incremental investments we're making to support the continued momentum in our digital business.
Our EBIT margin in the quarter was lower than we had anticipated. We experienced delays in executing on our cost takeout plans. And while we reduced our headcount by 3,900 people in the quarter, we fell short of our expectations as we experienced delays in exiting resources in high-cost complex countries.
Also in our Bionix program, we've expanded beyond DXC's delivery centers into clients' environments. Now this involves reengineering of client processes before savings can be realized, and it is taking more time to execute on these joint efforts.
Now we still intend to execute on our original workforce optimization plans, but the benefit will now be pushed out to the second half of the year.
In the quarter, our non-GAAP tax rate was 20.1%, reflecting our global mix of income and the benefit of a return to provision true-up in certain foreign jurisdictions.
Turning now to our segment results. GBS revenue was $2.16 billion in the first quarter, up 0.5% year-over-year in constant currency. In the first quarter, GBS segment profit was $366 million, and profit margin was 17% compared with 18.2% in the prior year. GBS margins reflect the investments we are making in hiring and training digital talent as well as the expansion of our digital transformation centers.
GIS revenue was $2.73 billion in the first quarter. GIS segment profit in the first quarter was $340 million, and profit margin was 12.4%. GIS margin reflects the investment we are making to help accelerate our clients' digital transformations and the timing on some of our cost takeout actions.
Turning to other financial results. Adjusted free cash flow in the quarter was $72 million or 15% of adjusted net income. And this reflects the timing of annual payments for software licenses and maintenance, investment made to consolidate real estate facilities and the timing of refresh programs on a few large accounts. As a result, our CapEx was $357 million in the quarter or 7.3% of revenue, but we expect our CapEx to moderate over the course of the year. 
During the quarter, we paid $51 million in dividends. We also repurchased $400 million of shares through a combination of open market purchases and an accelerated share repurchase program. In total, we returned $451 million in capital to shareholders. And we continue to be opportunistic in returning more capital to our shareholders.
Cash at the end of the quarter was $1.9 billion. During the quarter, we funded the Luxoft acquisition with $2 billion of additional debt. We also paid down $430 million of current maturities of long-term debt. At the end of the quarter, our total debt was $9.4 billion including capitalized leases, for a net debt to total capitalization ratio of 36.5%.
Now let me close by covering our revised fiscal '20 targets. We're targeting revenue of $20.2 billion to $20.7 billion, including Luxoft. This revised outlook includes the impact of $150 million to $200 million of additional currency headwinds from a strengthening dollar since the beginning of May. 
Our revised outlook also reflects the near-term impact from delayed deal closings as well as slippage on a few large transformation milestones. However, we expect a second half improvement in revenue as those deals close and we convert on our strong pipeline, including cross-sell opportunities with Luxoft.
We're now targeting non-GAAP EPS of $7 to $7.75 for the full year, reflecting the impact of lower revenue as well as the first half delays in executing on our delivery cost takeout programs. 
We now expect to achieve $250 million to $300 million of cost savings this year versus our original target of $400 million. We expect the lower revenue and delays in cost takeout to impact second quarter margins by about 1 point sequentially, but we expect margins to improve in the second half of the year through labor actions, supply chain improvements and real estate consolidation.
Our workforce optimization actions include labor pyramids and location mix improvements. Now while we've driven significant productivity improvements in our delivery organization the last several quarters, we have additional opportunities to extract greater efficiencies from our middle-management layers, including the number of managers as well as their location mix.
In supply chain, we're in the process of renegotiating several large software contracts as well as driving additional vendor consolidation to achieve incremental savings. 
In real estate, we plan to eliminate an additional 600,000 square feet of office space and close 3 additional data centers throughout the year.
Our EPS target assumes a tax rate of 26% to 28% for the full year, reflecting our tax attributes in foreign jurisdictions as well as the increased BEAT liability due to the Luxoft acquisition. Given our lower tax rate in Q1, we expect a higher tax rate over the next 3 quarters of about 30%.
We continue to expect adjusted free cash flow to be 90% or more of adjusted net income. 
I'll now hand the call back to the operator for the Q&A session."

And if I look out over the full year, we see probably upside to that performance. You're right, our industry IP in particular and BPS business has strengthened since we exited last fiscal year. 
I think the new news for me here as I look through the quarter were a couple of things. One, we saw a greater acceleration, particularly on the move to cloud. And that does impact our business. It impacts -- we've seen this impact certainly on the application business, but it also is impacting what I would refer to as sort of the volume metrics. In many of our contracts, we get paid on the amount of volume. So we are seeing some greater acceleration there. Now we're seeing the other side of it too because our cloud infrastructure business is growing faster than what we had expected.
Now that's requiring us to take more actions from a cost standpoint and how we do that. We didn't execute that as quickly as we wanted to in the first quarter. And we think we can catch up on that as we go through the second, third and fourth quarter of this year. But that's primarily the new news, is an acceleration of this cloud migration, and that does impact our infrastructure business in particular."

Again, when I step back and I look at this, the Digital revenue is clearly accelerating above the level that I thought. So just exclude Luxoft for a second, it was up 31%. That's about the fastest growth rate we've had in Digital revenue. And some of that is attributable to some of the deals we did. As I said, some of those deals that we did, we saw that impact in the first quarter, okay? So my confidence level on that part of the strategy is very high because we're seeing that absolutely flow through. 
And if I look at the pipeline as I look out for the balance of the year in Digital, very strong. And that's before we even throw Luxoft into the equation. 
So from a strategy standpoint and a plan standpoint, that is working. Where we had some new news was the acceleration of the movement to cloud and the impact that is having on our traditional ITO business. And then our ability to respond to that in the first quarter from a cost standpoint, we were not able to respond quickly enough.
The other factor I mentioned is Bionix. I'm really pleased with the progress we're making in Bionix, but that now is becoming much more client by client. And many clients are -- want to see that improvement from Bionix before we actually exit the people. And that's fine. That makes good sense. But that does delay some of the -- delay some of the cost takeout in the first quarter, and that then has an impact on the full year.
So that's fundamentally what's going on here. The digital strategy is working. As a matter of fact, it's accelerating. But at same time, we're seeing an acceleration of that impact, particularly on the infrastructure business."

And across that, I'm not going to name any specific client, but we are seeing an acceleration of this move to a cloud infrastructure. It is somewhat industry-specific. So some of the industries that we are more exposed to, like consumer packaged goods, for example, is migrating more rapidly to the cloud than let's say, financial services or insurance. So it's not so much that there's new clients that we're seeing this in. We're just seeing a slightly more rapid adoption of the cloud infrastructure in the top 200 or 300 clients that we have.
Now that's being offset -- it's being offset by some of this digital revenue that we talked about. And then what we -- now that we have what I'd call shored up most of our large contracts and renewed most of those large contracts, we don't have a lot of those on the horizon this year, we're being more aggressive in targeting now more new clients from an IT modernization standpoint.
That's what we're now seeing in the pipeline. As a matter of fact, we've got probably a stronger pipeline on traditional IT modernization than we've had in years as we begin to make that shift to driving much more of a sort of aggressive, offensive play around IT modernization."

My question is, is that spend as it shifts going completely away from DXC? Or is this more of a case where over time, that spend is still available to you, you can recover that spend, but at a lag effect? I mean you mentioned last quarter that you're pursuing these deals where you give clients upfront savings, but then you get a commitment to make up the spend gap over time by shifting into digital scope. So I'd like your take on whether this accelerated cloud shift is an outright negative. Or is it more of a situation where you're taking a hit now, but with the benefit later of a shift into more of a digital business mix, which is kind of the long-term goal that you're trying to accomplish? So how much of it is a negative versus an opportunity? Can you give us the balance on that right now?"

So it's much more of a lag effect. We're also doing other things where some of the revenue associated with the actual cloud is beginning to be captured as part of the contract. That is a lag effect as well. So I view it much more as a lag effect than just a negative. As a matter of fact, I go through this all the time.

I am going to follow my standard format, then turn this over to Paul. And then we'll be available for any questions.First, our non-GAAP EPS in the first quarter was $1.74.

And then we'll be available for any questions.
First, our non-GAAP EPS in the first quarter was $1.74. The adjusted EBIT was $652 million, and the adjusted EBIT margin was 13.3%. And we generated $72 million of adjusted free cash flow in the first quarter. 
Our revenue in the first quarter was $4.89 billion on a GAAP basis. In constant currency, revenue was down 4.2% year-over-year, pretty much in line with what we expected. And the book-to-bill was 0.9x for the quarter, reflecting a couple of delays in some deals that we had expected to close in Q1.
In the first quarter, the Digital revenue grew 35% year-over-year primarily driven by enterprise and cloud apps, cloud infrastructure and our digital workplace. Our industry IP and BPS revenue grew 3.5% year-over-year. And the Digital book-to-bill was 1.3x, and the industry IP and BS -- BPS book-to-bill was 1.2x.
On my fourth point, in June, we completed the acquisition of Luxoft, which strengthens DXC's value proposition as an end-to-end mainstream IT and digital services market leader. We also announced a joint DXC and Microsoft Azure digital transformation practice, building on our long-standing relationship with Microsoft. And in the next few days, we also plan to announce a strategic partnership with Google Cloud, which will enable enterprise clients to modernize IT and integrate digital solutions capitalizing on Google Cloud Platform. And I'll talk a little bit more about that in a moment.
And finally, we now expect additional currency headwinds for the full year. Combined with some of the delays in these deals as well as additional pressure on our traditional business, we're revising our revenue guidance for the whole year to a range of $20.2 billion to $20.7 billion. And given this lower revenue and some delays in cost savings, which I'll talk about in a moment, our non-GAAP EPS target is now $7 to $7.75. And we continue to target adjusted free cash flow of 90% or more of adjusted net income.
Now let me just go into a little more detail. As I said, the first quarter non-GAAP EPS was $1.74. The effective tax rate was 20.1%. The first quarter adjusted EBIT was $652 million, and the adjusted EBIT margin was 13.3%, including the impact of the investments I discussed last quarter, an accelerated mix shift to Digital and some delays executing resources in high-cost complex countries, and I'll provide a little more color on these points.
As we discussed, we continued to make significant investments in digital talent, including both hiring new employees and upskilling our existing workforce. We also are expanding our digital transformation centers and investing in joint practices with partners such as AWS, Microsoft and Google. These investments are necessary to continue building on the strong momentum we have in the digital business, and we continue to plan on roughly $100 million of incremental investments this year.
The first quarter also has the most impact from the accelerated client savings we discussed last quarter. We're seeing these trade-offs translate into greater opportunities and a qualified digital pipeline, which was up roughly 80% year-over-year in Q1. 
During the quarter, we saw an acceleration in the shift from traditional infrastructure to digital solutions. For example our cloud infrastructure business was up 36% year-over-year, which was faster growth than what we had expected. And as we migrate client workloads out of the legacy environments, there are stranded costs that we have to address including assets as well as people. Given the accelerated pace and expanded scope of cloud migrations, we weren't able to get these costs out during the first quarter, but we're taking action and expect to remove the stranded costs by the end of the third quarter.
Our delivery team was also behind on its fiscal '20 cost improvement plan, particularly on workforce actions in high-cost countries. As we continue to expand deployment of our Bionix automation program into additional geographies and client environments, it is taking longer to eliminate the headcount as we automate activities. And in some cases, we're required to implement the full automation solution prior to removing any of the resources. Now we're implementing actions to improve execution and second half profit, including accelerated labor pyramid improvements, reductions in nonbillable and underutilized resources and further optimization of nonlabor spend such as hardware maintenance and software rates. 
As I said, adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $72 million or 15% of adjusted net income, reflecting lumpiness of cash flow, including the timing of our sales commission payments, our fiscal 2019 bonus payments and prepaid software enterprise license agreements. However, we continue to expect adjusted free cash flow to be 90% or more of adjusted net income for the year.
Now let me turn to revenue. As I said, in the first quarter, revenue was $4.89 billion on a GAAP basis. Now all revenue comparisons I'll discuss will be in constant currency. 
In the first quarter, revenue was down 4.2% year-over-year, in line with what we expected. And the book-to-bill in the quarter was 0.9, reflecting some delays on some large deals.
In the first quarter, GBS revenue was $2.2 billion, which was up 0.5% year-over-year. The year-over-year improvement reflects continued momentum in our enterprise and cloud applications business as well as the addition of Molina and 2 weeks of the Luxoft business. As I discussed last quarter, accelerated cloud adoption is eliminating some of the services associated with rationalizing and refactoring traditional applications. And this dynamic is an ongoing headwind for legacy application services. GBS book-to-bill in the quarter was 1.1, and bookings were up 22% year-over-year, reflecting strong bookings in the enterprise cloud apps, analytics and industry IP and BPS.
GIS revenue was $2.7 billion in the first quarter, down 7.6% year-over-year. This reflects the accelerated client savings we've discussed last quarter as well as increased momentum in digital migrations. Cloud and digital workplace both grew more than 35% year-over-year. And similar to the dynamic I discussed in traditional applications, these accelerated shifts pressure the traditional GIS business as clients lift and shift existing workloads to recognize immediate savings. Over time, we typically grow revenue by migrating additional workloads into our multi-cloud environment, but the initial shift often results in less near-term revenue. And we're also seeing some slowdown in additional add-on project work in legacy environment as more investment is made in the digital solutions.
Now to offset these traditional headwinds, we're taking a much more aggressive approach on the GIS pipeline development. We've expanded our sales efforts, targeting large infrastructure outsourcing opportunities for new clients with a focus on deals that involve modernization of the traditional environment while at the same time investing in digital projects. We're still early in this process, however, we're seeing good traction. Total infrastructure pipeline in the first quarter was up 32% year-over-year and 22% sequentially. And we expect to drive additional revenue during the second half of the year. The GIS book-to-bill in the quarter was 0.7x, reflecting the lumpiness in large deal signings and some of the delays that I had mentioned previously.
Now let me move on to our digital industry IP and BPS results. Digital revenue was up 35% year-over-year, including 2 weeks of revenue from Luxoft. Excluding Luxoft, Digital revenue grew 31%, and the book-to-bill in the quarter was 1.3x. As I've discussed, we're seeing good enterprise spend environment in digital, particularly with respect to enterprise cloud migrations. As we partner with our clients on these transformations, we continue to see strong momentum in our cloud infrastructure solutions. This business grew 36% year-over-year, reflecting accelerated migrations and continued demand for multi-cloud solutions. And we're seeing good traction in this business across geographies and across industries.
For example during the first quarter, we won a deal with a major European aerospace and defense company to provide cloud migration, security and analytics services. We're leveraging our knowledge of the legacy estate to modernize the client's IT architecture and help them thrive in a highly competitive market. We built an Agile platform that enables development and deployment of solutions such as next generation smart factories, asset use optimization and application of artificial intelligence to everyday business challenges. 
Enterprise cloud apps and consulting continues to perform well with a 17.1% year-over-year growth, including strong growth in our Americas region, particularly in our Microsoft, ServiceNow and SAP practices. We're also partnered with Salesforce to win a major multiyear deal with 4 global luxury retail brands. We are providing development and support services on Salesforce Commerce Cloud, supporting roughly 35 B2C websites globally.
Security revenue performance improved in the quarter and grew 5.7% year-over-year with particular strength in Asia and Europe. And during the quarter, we won a multiyear deal to provide managed security services for a major European car manufacturer, leveraging standard DXC offerings as well as partnered offerings with Micro Focus, Fortify and Carbon Black. The solution includes threat intelligence, security event monitoring, vulnerability management, forensic investigations and regulatory and policy compliance controls.
We also saw improved performance in industry IP and BPS. Revenue was up 3.5% year-over-year in constant currency driven by a 7% growth in our industry IP offerings. And with the addition of Molina, we're seeing strong demand in our U.S. state Medicaid business. During the first quarter, we signed add-on deals with Tennessee, California and Ohio worth over $100 million each. And industry IP and BPS book-to-bill in the quarter was 1.2x. 
Now my fourth point, during the first quarter, we completed the acquisition of Luxoft, which strengthens DXC's unique value proposition as a leading end-to-end IT services provider. As we previously announced, Luxoft will continue to be led by Dmitry Loschinin, who will report directly to me. Luxoft brings a 13,000-person workforce that provides digital strategy consulting and engineering services for companies across North America, Europe and Asia. Luxoft will retain its brand and operate as a DXC Technology company, but we've already launched joint go-to-market efforts to cross-sell solutions to both companies' current clients and to target new clients across industry verticals. Processes, incentives have been put in place to promote and reward cross-selling, and we're encouraged by the early progress we're seeing in the joint pipeline of opportunities.
The acquisition also expands DXC's access to digital talent by leveraging Luxoft's presence in key markets, especially Eastern Europe, and by broadly deploying Luxoft's unique talent acquisition and management platform. We're undertaking several changes to quickly apply Luxoft's strengths and capabilities to DXC's business. 
Within Luxoft, we're creating industry-leading verticals in automotive and financial services. These 2 verticals will serve more than 20 major automotive OEMs and more than half of the top financial institutions in the Americas and Europe. And 2 key digital offerings, the Internet of Things and blockchain, will also be combined within Luxoft.
Now we continue to expect Luxoft to provide roughly $700 million in revenue during the last 3 quarters of the fiscal year in addition to the 2 weeks of revenue we were able to recognize by closing the deal in the middle of June. 
Now turning to our partnerships. We recently announced a joint practice with Microsoft Azure. The DXC and Microsoft Azure digital transformation practice enhances our deep and long-standing relationship with Microsoft. This joint practice will provide clients with a highly integrated approach to modernizing their IT systems on Azure. And the result would be a reduced time to digital and a more rapid movement of client workloads from legacy IT to a modern cloud architecture on Azure.
In addition, we recently signed a strategic partnership with Google Cloud. This partnership will allow us to modernize mission-critical IT for enterprise clients and integrate digital solutions capitalizing on the Google Cloud Platform. Now under our partnership agreement, DXC will also be launching centers of excellence for Google Cloud Platform and Google Cloud artificial intelligence to provide clients with secure, Agile and scalable cloud-based digital platforms that leverage our advanced analytics capability. And we'll be providing more information on this as the partnership evolves.
The Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud practice complement our ongoing cloud work with AWS, Oracle and VMware to give our clients access to the largest cloud providers in the world.
And my fifth point before I turn this over to Paul is we now expect an additional $150 million to $200 million of currency headwind for the full year. And as I've discussed, we're also seeing more impact on our traditional business as accelerated client migrations pressure near-term revenue. And combined with some of the delays I've talked about, we're revising our revenue guidance for the full year to a range of $20.2 billion to $20.7 billion. In addition to this lower revenue outlook, delays in some of our cost savings actions will lower our margins, and our non-GAAP EPS target is now $7 to $7.75. And as I said, we continue to expect adjusted free cash flow to be 90% or more of adjusted net income. 
And with that, I will turn it over to Paul."

As usual, I'll start by covering some items that are excluded from our non-GAAP results.
In the first quarter, we had restructuring costs of $142 million pretax or $0.42 per diluted share, and this is primarily related to workforce optimization. Also in the quarter, we had $105 million pretax or $0.31 per diluted share of integration, separation and transaction-related costs, including costs associated with the Luxoft transaction. In the first quarter, amortization of acquired intangibles was $138 million pretax or $0.40 per diluted share. Excluding the impact of these special items, non-GAAP income before taxes from continuing operations was $591 million and non-GAAP EPS was $1.74.
Turning now to our first quarter results in more detail. GAAP revenue in Q1 was $4.89 billion, down 4.2% year-over-year in constant currency. Adjusted EBIT in the quarter was $652 million. Adjusted EBIT margin was 13.3%, reflecting the investments we're making to help clients accelerate their digital transformations with us as well as incremental investments we're making to support the continued momentum in our digital business.
Our EBIT margin in the quarter was lower than we had anticipated. We experienced delays in executing on our cost takeout plans. And while we reduced our headcount by 3,900 people in the quarter, we fell short of our expectations as we experienced delays in exiting resources in high-cost complex countries.
Also in our Bionix program, we've expanded beyond DXC's delivery centers into clients' environments. Now this involves reengineering of client processes before savings can be realized, and it is taking more time to execute on these joint efforts.
Now we still intend to execute on our original workforce optimization plans, but the benefit will now be pushed out to the second half of the year.
In the quarter, our non-GAAP tax rate was 20.1%, reflecting our global mix of income and the benefit of a return to provision true-up in certain foreign jurisdictions.
Turning now to our segment results. GBS revenue was $2.16 billion in the first quarter, up 0.5% year-over-year in constant currency. In the first quarter, GBS segment profit was $366 million, and profit margin was 17% compared with 18.2% in the prior year. GBS margins reflect the investments we are making in hiring and training digital talent as well as the expansion of our digital transformation centers.
GIS revenue was $2.73 billion in the first quarter. GIS segment profit in the first quarter was $340 million, and profit margin was 12.4%. GIS margin reflects the investment we are making to help accelerate our clients' digital transformations and the timing on some of our cost takeout actions.
Turning to other financial results. Adjusted free cash flow in the quarter was $72 million or 15% of adjusted net income. And this reflects the timing of annual payments for software licenses and maintenance, investment made to consolidate real estate facilities and the timing of refresh programs on a few large accounts. As a result, our CapEx was $357 million in the quarter or 7.3% of revenue, but we expect our CapEx to moderate over the course of the year. 
During the quarter, we paid $51 million in dividends. We also repurchased $400 million of shares through a combination of open market purchases and an accelerated share repurchase program. In total, we returned $451 million in capital to shareholders. And we continue to be opportunistic in returning more capital to our shareholders.
Cash at the end of the quarter was $1.9 billion. During the quarter, we funded the Luxoft acquisition with $2 billion of additional debt. We also paid down $430 million of current maturities of long-term debt. At the end of the quarter, our total debt was $9.4 billion including capitalized leases, for a net debt to total capitalization ratio of 36.5%.
Now let me close by covering our revised fiscal '20 targets. We're targeting revenue of $20.2 billion to $20.7 billion, including Luxoft. This revised outlook includes the impact of $150 million to $200 million of additional currency headwinds from a strengthening dollar since the beginning of May. 
Our revised outlook also reflects the near-term impact from delayed deal closings as well as slippage on a few large transformation milestones. However, we expect a second half improvement in revenue as those deals close and we convert on our strong pipeline, including cross-sell opportunities with Luxoft.
We're now targeting non-GAAP EPS of $7 to $7.75 for the full year, reflecting the impact of lower revenue as well as the first half delays in executing on our delivery cost takeout programs. 
We now expect to achieve $250 million to $300 million of cost savings this year versus our original target of $400 million. We expect the lower revenue and delays in cost takeout to impact second quarter margins by about 1 point sequentially, but we expect margins to improve in the second half of the year through labor actions, supply chain improvements and real estate consolidation.
Our workforce optimization actions include labor pyramids and location mix improvements. Now while we've driven significant productivity improvements in our delivery organization the last several quarters, we have additional opportunities to extract greater efficiencies from our middle-management layers, including the number of managers as well as their location mix.
In supply chain, we're in the process of renegotiating several large software contracts as well as driving additional vendor consolidation to achieve incremental savings. 
In real estate, we plan to eliminate an additional 600,000 square feet of office space and close 3 additional data centers throughout the year.
Our EPS target assumes a tax rate of 26% to 28% for the full year, reflecting our tax attributes in foreign jurisdictions as well as the increased BEAT liability due to the Luxoft acquisition. Given our lower tax rate in Q1, we expect a higher tax rate over the next 3 quarters of about 30%.
We continue to expect adjusted free cash flow to be 90% or more of adjusted net income. 
I'll now hand the call back to the operator for the Q&A session."

And if I look out over the full year, we see probably upside to that performance. You're right, our industry IP in particular and BPS business has strengthened since we exited last fiscal year. 
I think the new news for me here as I look through the quarter were a couple of things. One, we saw a greater acceleration, particularly on the move to cloud. And that does impact our business. It impacts -- we've seen this impact certainly on the application business, but it also is impacting what I would refer to as sort of the volume metrics. In many of our contracts, we get paid on the amount of volume. So we are seeing some greater acceleration there. Now we're seeing the other side of it too because our cloud infrastructure business is growing faster than what we had expected.
Now that's requiring us to take more actions from a cost standpoint and how we do that. We didn't execute that as quickly as we wanted to in the first quarter. And we think we can catch up on that as we go through the second, third and fourth quarter of this year. But that's primarily the new news, is an acceleration of this cloud migration, and that does impact our infrastructure business in particular."

Again, when I step back and I look at this, the Digital revenue is clearly accelerating above the level that I thought. So just exclude Luxoft for a second, it was up 31%.

As I said, some of those deals that we did, we saw that impact in the first quarter, okay? So my confidence level on that part of the strategy is very high because we're seeing that absolutely flow through. 
And if I look at the pipeline as I look out for the balance of the year in Digital, very strong. And that's before we even throw Luxoft into the equation. 
So from a strategy standpoint and a plan standpoint, that is working. Where we had some new news was the acceleration of the movement to cloud and the impact that is having on our traditional ITO business. And then our ability to respond to that in the first quarter from a cost standpoint, we were not able to respond quickly enough.
The other factor I mentioned is Bionix. I'm really pleased with the progress we're making in Bionix, but that now is becoming much more client by client. And many clients are -- want to see that improvement from Bionix before we actually exit the people. And that's fine. That makes good sense. But that does delay some of the -- delay some of the cost takeout in the first quarter, and that then has an impact on the full year.

Now that's being offset -- it's being offset by some of this digital revenue that we talked about. And then what we -- now that we have what I'd call shored up most of our large contracts and renewed most of those large contracts, we don't have a lot of those on the horizon this year, we're being more aggressive in targeting now more new clients from an IT modernization standpoint.

I think the runoff and things like that, we've got a really pretty good handle on.

I think the runoff and things like that, we've got a really pretty good handle on. I think for me, what I -- what we need to do a little better job, and I'm going to qualify this because it's really not that easy to do, is some of the volume metrics. So again, the way our contracts are set up, you get paid based on volumes. It's a little difficult to forecast too far out what's going to happen with those volumes. And they do fluctuate month to month, and they certainly fluctuate quarter to quarter.
Now we're going to try to do a better job of understanding that and forecasting it. But I got to tell you, there are some limits as to how you can forecast those volumes. This has not been a huge issue in the past because the volumes were quite stable. But what we're seeing with this accelerated shift to the clouds, some of those volumes are shifting around. And that is now something we're going to have to get a better handle on and forecast. If we get enough data points, you'll be able to calculate with a little more precision. But that's the fundamental new news for me and what was different from what I saw coming out of last year."

And then we'll be available for any questions.
First, our non-GAAP EPS in the first quarter was $1.74. The adjusted EBIT was $652 million, and the adjusted EBIT margin was 13.3%. And we generated $72 million of adjusted free cash flow in the first quarter. 
Our revenue in the first quarter was $4.89 billion on a GAAP basis. In constant currency, revenue was down 4.2% year-over-year, pretty much in line with what we expected. And the book-to-bill was 0.9x for the quarter, reflecting a couple of delays in some deals that we had expected to close in Q1.
In the first quarter, the Digital revenue grew 35% year-over-year primarily driven by enterprise and cloud apps, cloud infrastructure and our digital workplace. Our industry IP and BPS revenue grew 3.5% year-over-year. And the Digital book-to-bill was 1.3x, and the industry IP and BS -- BPS book-to-bill was 1.2x.
On my fourth point, in June, we completed the acquisition of Luxoft, which strengthens DXC's value proposition as an end-to-end mainstream IT and digital services market leader. We also announced a joint DXC and Microsoft Azure digital transformation practice, building on our long-standing relationship with Microsoft. And in the next few days, we also plan to announce a strategic partnership with Google Cloud, which will enable enterprise clients to modernize IT and integrate digital solutions capitalizing on Google Cloud Platform. And I'll talk a little bit more about that in a moment.
And finally, we now expect additional currency headwinds for the full year. Combined with some of the delays in these deals as well as additional pressure on our traditional business, we're revising our revenue guidance for the whole year to a range of $20.2 billion to $20.7 billion. And given this lower revenue and some delays in cost savings, which I'll talk about in a moment, our non-GAAP EPS target is now $7 to $7.75. And we continue to target adjusted free cash flow of 90% or more of adjusted net income.
Now let me just go into a little more detail. As I said, the first quarter non-GAAP EPS was $1.74. The effective tax rate was 20.1%. The first quarter adjusted EBIT was $652 million, and the adjusted EBIT margin was 13.3%, including the impact of the investments I discussed last quarter, an accelerated mix shift to Digital and some delays executing resources in high-cost complex countries, and I'll provide a little more color on these points.
As we discussed, we continued to make significant investments in digital talent, including both hiring new employees and upskilling our existing workforce. We also are expanding our digital transformation centers and investing in joint practices with partners such as AWS, Microsoft and Google. These investments are necessary to continue building on the strong momentum we have in the digital business, and we continue to plan on roughly $100 million of incremental investments this year.
The first quarter also has the most impact from the accelerated client savings we discussed last quarter. We're seeing these trade-offs translate into greater opportunities and a qualified digital pipeline, which was up roughly 80% year-over-year in Q1. 
During the quarter, we saw an acceleration in the shift from traditional infrastructure to digital solutions. For example our cloud infrastructure business was up 36% year-over-year, which was faster growth than what we had expected. And as we migrate client workloads out of the legacy environments, there are stranded costs that we have to address including assets as well as people. Given the accelerated pace and expanded scope of cloud migrations, we weren't able to get these costs out during the first quarter, but we're taking action and expect to remove the stranded costs by the end of the third quarter.
Our delivery team was also behind on its fiscal '20 cost improvement plan, particularly on workforce actions in high-cost countries. As we continue to expand deployment of our Bionix automation program into additional geographies and client environments, it is taking longer to eliminate the headcount as we automate activities. And in some cases, we're required to implement the full automation solution prior to removing any of the resources. Now we're implementing actions to improve execution and second half profit, including accelerated labor pyramid improvements, reductions in nonbillable and underutilized resources and further optimization of nonlabor spend such as hardware maintenance and software rates. 
As I said, adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $72 million or 15% of adjusted net income, reflecting lumpiness of cash flow, including the timing of our sales commission payments, our fiscal 2019 bonus payments and prepaid software enterprise license agreements. However, we continue to expect adjusted free cash flow to be 90% or more of adjusted net income for the year.
Now let me turn to revenue. As I said, in the first quarter, revenue was $4.89 billion on a GAAP basis. Now all revenue comparisons I'll discuss will be in constant currency. 
In the first quarter, revenue was down 4.2% year-over-year, in line with what we expected. And the book-to-bill in the quarter was 0.9, reflecting some delays on some large deals.
In the first quarter, GBS revenue was $2.2 billion, which was up 0.5% year-over-year. The year-over-year improvement reflects continued momentum in our enterprise and cloud applications business as well as the addition of Molina and 2 weeks of the Luxoft business. As I discussed last quarter, accelerated cloud adoption is eliminating some of the services associated with rationalizing and refactoring traditional applications. And this dynamic is an ongoing headwind for legacy application services. GBS book-to-bill in the quarter was 1.1, and bookings were up 22% year-over-year, reflecting strong bookings in the enterprise cloud apps, analytics and industry IP and BPS.
GIS revenue was $2.7 billion in the first quarter, down 7.6% year-over-year. This reflects the accelerated client savings we've discussed last quarter as well as increased momentum in digital migrations. Cloud and digital workplace both grew more than 35% year-over-year. And similar to the dynamic I discussed in traditional applications, these accelerated shifts pressure the traditional GIS business as clients lift and shift existing workloads to recognize immediate savings. Over time, we typically grow revenue by migrating additional workloads into our multi-cloud environment, but the initial shift often results in less near-term revenue. And we're also seeing some slowdown in additional add-on project work in legacy environment as more investment is made in the digital solutions.
Now to offset these traditional headwinds, we're taking a much more aggressive approach on the GIS pipeline development. We've expanded our sales efforts, targeting large infrastructure outsourcing opportunities for new clients with a focus on deals that involve modernization of the traditional environment while at the same time investing in digital projects. We're still early in this process, however, we're seeing good traction. Total infrastructure pipeline in the first quarter was up 32% year-over-year and 22% sequentially. And we expect to drive additional revenue during the second half of the year. The GIS book-to-bill in the quarter was 0.7x, reflecting the lumpiness in large deal signings and some of the delays that I had mentioned previously.
Now let me move on to our digital industry IP and BPS results. Digital revenue was up 35% year-over-year, including 2 weeks of revenue from Luxoft. Excluding Luxoft, Digital revenue grew 31%, and the book-to-bill in the quarter was 1.3x. As I've discussed, we're seeing good enterprise spend environment in digital, particularly with respect to enterprise cloud migrations. As we partner with our clients on these transformations, we continue to see strong momentum in our cloud infrastructure solutions. This business grew 36% year-over-year, reflecting accelerated migrations and continued demand for multi-cloud solutions. And we're seeing good traction in this business across geographies and across industries.
For example during the first quarter, we won a deal with a major European aerospace and defense company to provide cloud migration, security and analytics services. We're leveraging our knowledge of the legacy estate to modernize the client's IT architecture and help them thrive in a highly competitive market. We built an Agile platform that enables development and deployment of solutions such as next generation smart factories, asset use optimization and application of artificial intelligence to everyday business challenges. 
Enterprise cloud apps and consulting continues to perform well with a 17.1% year-over-year growth, including strong growth in our Americas region, particularly in our Microsoft, ServiceNow and SAP practices. We're also partnered with Salesforce to win a major multiyear deal with 4 global luxury retail brands. We are providing development and support services on Salesforce Commerce Cloud, supporting roughly 35 B2C websites globally.
Security revenue performance improved in the quarter and grew 5.7% year-over-year with particular strength in Asia and Europe. And during the quarter, we won a multiyear deal to provide managed security services for a major European car manufacturer, leveraging standard DXC offerings as well as partnered offerings with Micro Focus, Fortify and Carbon Black. The solution includes threat intelligence, security event monitoring, vulnerability management, forensic investigations and regulatory and policy compliance controls.
We also saw improved performance in industry IP and BPS. Revenue was up 3.5% year-over-year in constant currency driven by a 7% growth in our industry IP offerings. And with the addition of Molina, we're seeing strong demand in our U.S. state Medicaid business. During the first quarter, we signed add-on deals with Tennessee, California and Ohio worth over $100 million each. And industry IP and BPS book-to-bill in the quarter was 1.2x. 
Now my fourth point, during the first quarter, we completed the acquisition of Luxoft, which strengthens DXC's unique value proposition as a leading end-to-end IT services provider. As we previously announced, Luxoft will continue to be led by Dmitry Loschinin, who will report directly to me. Luxoft brings a 13,000-person workforce that provides digital strategy consulting and engineering services for companies across North America, Europe and Asia. Luxoft will retain its brand and operate as a DXC Technology company, but we've already launched joint go-to-market efforts to cross-sell solutions to both companies' current clients and to target new clients across industry verticals. Processes, incentives have been put in place to promote and reward cross-selling, and we're encouraged by the early progress we're seeing in the joint pipeline of opportunities.
The acquisition also expands DXC's access to digital talent by leveraging Luxoft's presence in key markets, especially Eastern Europe, and by broadly deploying Luxoft's unique talent acquisition and management platform. We're undertaking several changes to quickly apply Luxoft's strengths and capabilities to DXC's business. 
Within Luxoft, we're creating industry-leading verticals in automotive and financial services. These 2 verticals will serve more than 20 major automotive OEMs and more than half of the top financial institutions in the Americas and Europe. And 2 key digital offerings, the Internet of Things and blockchain, will also be combined within Luxoft.
Now we continue to expect Luxoft to provide roughly $700 million in revenue during the last 3 quarters of the fiscal year in addition to the 2 weeks of revenue we were able to recognize by closing the deal in the middle of June. 
Now turning to our partnerships. We recently announced a joint practice with Microsoft Azure. The DXC and Microsoft Azure digital transformation practice enhances our deep and long-standing relationship with Microsoft. This joint practice will provide clients with a highly integrated approach to modernizing their IT systems on Azure. And the result would be a reduced time to digital and a more rapid movement of client workloads from legacy IT to a modern cloud architecture on Azure.
In addition, we recently signed a strategic partnership with Google Cloud. This partnership will allow us to modernize mission-critical IT for enterprise clients and integrate digital solutions capitalizing on the Google Cloud Platform. Now under our partnership agreement, DXC will also be launching centers of excellence for Google Cloud Platform and Google Cloud artificial intelligence to provide clients with secure, Agile and scalable cloud-based digital platforms that leverage our advanced analytics capability. And we'll be providing more information on this as the partnership evolves.
The Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud practice complement our ongoing cloud work with AWS, Oracle and VMware to give our clients access to the largest cloud providers in the world.
And my fifth point before I turn this over to Paul is we now expect an additional $150 million to $200 million of currency headwind for the full year. And as I've discussed, we're also seeing more impact on our traditional business as accelerated client migrations pressure near-term revenue. And combined with some of the delays I've talked about, we're revising our revenue guidance for the full year to a range of $20.2 billion to $20.7 billion. In addition to this lower revenue outlook, delays in some of our cost savings actions will lower our margins, and our non-GAAP EPS target is now $7 to $7.75. And as I said, we continue to expect adjusted free cash flow to be 90% or more of adjusted net income. 
And with that, I will turn it over to Paul."

As usual, I'll start by covering some items that are excluded from our non-GAAP results.In the first quarter, we had restructuring costs of $142 million pretax or $0.42 per diluted share, and this is primarily related to workforce optim",1003,"Thank you, Mike. As usual, I'll start by covering some items that are excluded from our non-GAAP results.
In the first quarter, we had restructuring costs of $142 million pretax or $0.42 per diluted share, and this is primarily related to workforce optimization. Also in the quarter, we had $105 million pretax or $0.31 per diluted share of integration, separation and transaction-related costs, including costs associated with the Luxoft transaction. In the first quarter, amortization of acquired intangibles was $138 million pretax or $0.40 per diluted share. Excluding the impact of these special items, non-GAAP income before taxes from continuing operations was $591 million and non-GAAP EPS was $1.74.
Turning now to our first quarter results in more detail. GAAP revenue in Q1 was $4.89 billion, down 4.2% year-over-year in constant currency. Adjusted EBIT in the quarter was $652 million. Adjusted EBIT margin was 13.3%, reflecting the investments we're making to help clients accelerate their digital transformations with us as well as incremental investments we're making to support the continued momentum in our digital business.
Our EBIT margin in the quarter was lower than we had anticipated. We experienced delays in executing on our cost takeout plans. And while we reduced our headcount by 3,900 people in the quarter, we fell short of our expectations as we experienced delays in exiting resources in high-cost complex countries.
Also in our Bionix program, we've expanded beyond DXC's delivery centers into clients' environments. Now this involves reengineering of client processes before savings can be realized, and it is taking more time to execute on these joint efforts.
Now we still intend to execute on our original workforce optimization plans, but the benefit will now be pushed out to the second half of the year.
In the quarter, our non-GAAP tax rate was 20.1%, reflecting our global mix of income and the benefit of a return to provision true-up in certain foreign jurisdictions.
Turning now to our segment results. GBS revenue was $2.16 billion in the first quarter, up 0.5% year-over-year in constant currency. In the first quarter, GBS segment profit was $366 million, and profit margin was 17% compared with 18.2% in the prior year. GBS margins reflect the investments we are making in hiring and training digital talent as well as the expansion of our digital transformation centers.
GIS revenue was $2.73 billion in the first quarter. GIS segment profit in the first quarter was $340 million, and profit margin was 12.4%. GIS margin reflects the investment we are making to help accelerate our clients' digital transformations and the timing on some of our cost takeout actions.
Turning to other financial results. Adjusted free cash flow in the quarter was $72 million or 15% of adjusted net income. And this reflects the timing of annual payments for software licenses and maintenance, investment made to consolidate real estate facilities and the timing of refresh programs on a few large accounts. As a result, our CapEx was $357 million in the quarter or 7.3% of revenue, but we expect our CapEx to moderate over the course of the year. 
During the quarter, we paid $51 million in dividends. We also repurchased $400 million of shares through a combination of open market purchases and an accelerated share repurchase program. In total, we returned $451 million in capital to shareholders. And we continue to be opportunistic in returning more capital to our shareholders.
Cash at the end of the quarter was $1.9 billion. During the quarter, we funded the Luxoft acquisition with $2 billion of additional debt. We also paid down $430 million of current maturities of long-term debt. At the end of the quarter, our total debt was $9.4 billion including capitalized leases, for a net debt to total capitalization ratio of 36.5%.
Now let me close by covering our revised fiscal '20 targets. We're targeting revenue of $20.2 billion to $20.7 billion, including Luxoft. This revised outlook includes the impact of $150 million to $200 million of additional currency headwinds from a strengthening dollar since the beginning of May. 
Our revised outlook also reflects the near-term impact from delayed deal closings as well as slippage on a few large transformation milestones. However, we expect a second half improvement in revenue as those deals close and we convert on our strong pipeline, including cross-sell opportunities with Luxoft.
We're now targeting non-GAAP EPS of $7 to $7.75 for the full year, reflecting the impact of lower revenue as well as the first half delays in executing on our delivery cost takeout programs. 
We now expect to achieve $250 million to $300 million of cost savings this year versus our original target of $400 million. We expect the lower revenue and delays in cost takeout to impact second quarter margins by about 1 point sequentially, but we expect margins to improve in the second half of the year through labor actions, supply chain improvements and real estate consolidation.
Our workforce optimization actions include labor pyramids and location mix improvements. Now while we've driven significant productivity improvements in our delivery organization the last several quarters, we have additional opportunities to extract greater efficiencies from our middle-management layers, including the number of managers as well as their location mix.
In supply chain, we're in the process of renegotiating several large software contracts as well as driving additional vendor consolidation to achieve incremental savings. 
In real estate, we plan to eliminate an additional 600,000 square feet of office space and close 3 additional data centers throughout the year.
Our EPS target assumes a tax rate of 26% to 28% for the full year, reflecting our tax attributes in foreign jurisdictions as well as the increased BEAT liability due to the Luxoft acquisition. Given our lower tax rate in Q1, we expect a higher tax rate over the next 3 quarters of about 30%.
We continue to expect adjusted free cash flow to be 90% or more of adjusted net income. 
I'll now hand the call back to the operator for the Q&A session."

And if I look out over the full year, we see probably upside to that performance. You're right, our industry IP in particular and BPS business has strengthened since we exited last fiscal year. 
I think the new news for me here as I look through the quarter were a couple of things. One, we saw a greater acceleration, particularly on the move to cloud. And that does impact our business. It impacts -- we've seen this impact certainly on the application business, but it also is impacting what I would refer to as sort of the volume metrics. In many of our contracts, we get paid on the amount of volume. So we are seeing some greater acceleration there. Now we're seeing the other side of it too because our cloud infrastructure business is growing faster than what we had expected.
Now that's requiring us to take more actions from a cost standpoint and how we do that. We didn't execute that as quickly as we wanted to in the first quarter. And we think we can catch up on that as we go through the second, third and fourth quarter of this year. But that's primarily the new news, is an acceleration of this cloud migration, and that does impact our infrastructure business in particular."

As I said, some of those deals that we did, we saw that impact in the first quarter, okay? So my confidence level on that part of the strategy is very high because we're seeing that absolutely flow through. 
And if I look at the pipeline as I look out for the balance of the year in Digital, very strong. And that's before we even throw Luxoft into the equation. 
So from a strategy standpoint and a plan standpoint, that is working. Where we had some new news was the acceleration of the movement to cloud and the impact that is having on our traditional ITO business. And then our ability to respond to that in the first quarter from a cost standpoint, we were not able to respond quickly enough.
The other factor I mentioned is Bionix. I'm really pleased with the progress we're making in Bionix, but that now is becoming much more client by client. And many clients are -- want to see that improvement from Bionix before we actually exit the people. And that's fine. That makes good sense. But that does delay some of the -- delay some of the cost takeout in the first quarter, and that then has an impact on the full year.

And across that, I'm not going to name any specific client, but we are seeing an acceleration of this move to a cloud infrastructure. It is somewhat industry-specific. So some of the industries that we are more exposed to, like consumer packaged goods, for example, is migrating more rapidly to the cloud than let's say, financial services or insurance. So it's not so much that there's new clients that we're seeing this in. We're just seeing a slightly more rapid adoption of the cloud infrastructure in the top 200 or 300 clients that we have.
Now that's being offset -- it's being offset by some of this digital revenue that we talked about. And then what we -- now that we have what I'd call shored up most of our large contracts and renewed most of those large contracts, we don't have a lot of those on the horizon this year, we're being more aggressive in targeting now more new clients from an IT modernization standpoint.
That's what we're now seeing in the pipeline. As a matter of fact, we've got probably a stronger pipeline on traditional IT modernization than we've had in years as we begin to make that shift to driving much more of a sort of aggressive, offensive play around IT modernization."

Think about that as SAP and the upgrade to S/4HANA. So we are running into some of those players more often, and we're having quite a bit of success with that. On traditional, more traditional outsourcing things, we see the same competitors we've seen. We haven't really seen any difference in that. I would say there's quite a bit of price competition. There's certainly pricing pressure around some of those traditional outsourcing and IT modernization programs. But many of our competitors are seeing the same, exactly the same dynamics in their infrastructure business that we are seeing. There's not significant differences there.

And they do fluctuate month to month, and they certainly fluctuate quarter to quarter.
Now we're going to try to do a better job of understanding that and forecasting it. But I got to tell you, there are some limits as to how you can forecast those volumes. This has not been a huge issue in the past because the volumes were quite stable. But what we're seeing with this accelerated shift to the clouds, some of those volumes are shifting around.

My style is one of focus and clarity, which is what we plan to provide during this call. I'll begin by covering a few highlights from my observations on the business, then I'll hand the call over to Paul to discuss the second quarter results and full year outlook. After that, I'll walk through DXC's strategy moving forward, specifically the enterprise technology stack. Next, we will cover the results of the strategic review of our assets, then I'll close by providing additional color on our priorities. 
Over the past 2 months, I have met with 40 of our largest customers, each of our strategic partners and more than 80,000 of our people around the world. DXC has experienced and loyal global talent base that I've had the opportunity to meet many of these people since taking the role, and I've been extremely impressed with the quality of our talent. Our global operations talent, the people who work with our customers every day, are very loyal to DXC and to our customers. I've personally met numerous people who have been with the company for more than 30 years. 
DXC has significant scale and global reach across technology offerings. For example, we have over $2 billion of cloud and security revenue, we also have $1.4 billion of revenue in data analytics and digital engineering. Building on that point, DXC has a loyal customer base that includes many of the largest companies in the world where we run their mission critical systems. We have the opportunities in many of these accounts to increase share of wallet. 
As I've taken a fresh look at DXC's businesses, I've been very pleased with our core capabilities. This includes ITO and applications as well as digital solutions. We have a strong foundation to build on. I've also been very pleased with DXC's differentiated solutions in IP in key industries, such as automotive, insurance, health care and travel and transportation. Finally, I've been impressed with the company's track record of enhancing capabilities through targeted strategic acquisitions, including innovative assets like Luxoft and recently, Blueleader and Virtual Clarity. Blueleader will enhance our SAP application capabilities, and Virtual Clarity will strengthen our capabilities in delivering cloud assessments and transformation road maps to our customers. 
I've also seen several areas for improvement that DXC needs to address to enable growth. First, our delivery teams were not able to execute the more complicated phase of operational cost improvements. This includes areas like pyramid optimization, the broader deployment of DXC's automation program called Bionix, along with operational excellence leveraging Six Sigma principles. We need to focus more on our people and strengthening our employee value proposition. Our people need to be clear about their career path at DXC, the opportunities to work with new clients and also the opportunities for reskilling and retraining. Being clear about these items will help create an environment where people are acknowledged, recognized and rewarded, which will improve employee satisfaction and increase retention. 
We also need to focus more on selling integrated solutions. We have an opportunity to shift from providing individual services for many of our customers to integrated industry solutions, leveraging multiple DXC offerings and capabilities. 
Next, execution challenges from recent delivery actions have negatively impacted some of our large customers, which results in lower margins, delayed revenue and bookings as customers have placed the additional work on hold. We have recovery plans underway for these accounts but we need to do a better job running operations. By doing this, we will earn the right to expand our footprint with customers. The current operating model is complex, resulting in unclear accountabilities as well as slow decision-making. We will be simplifying this structure with greater emphasis on our regions and industries. 
Finally, DXC provides mission-critical services to many of our customers, particularly in ITO. But this business has been under-emphasized. We have the opportunity to invest and strengthen this business. Doing this well will provide a foundation of future growth with our existing customers. 
Overall, I believe that each of these points is fixable and we're already on the case. I've made 5 senior hires to augment our leadership team focused on each of these challenges. Mary will focus on our people as our CHRO. Kristen will focus on simplifying our operating model as VP of Corporate Operations. Vinod will focus on Global Delivery Innovation, specifically pyramiding, scaling technology and Six Sigma to deliver enhanced service to our customers as EVP of Global Delivery Transformation. Steve and David will focus on running our accounts to make sure we are listening to the voice of the customer when we are providing services in 2 of our largest regions of the Americas and U.K. Again, we believe there's an exciting path forward to run this business more effectively while also unlocking value. 
On the left side, running the business involves a stronger focus on customers, people and operational execution. On customers, we will invest to stabilize key accounts and assure that our delivery is meeting our clients' expectations. Doing this will ensure that we earn the right to walk the halls and help them with additional work as they think through their strategies. On people, we will make investments to acknowledge, recognize and reward our people, which will strengthen our employee value proposition. As I discussed, we have started adding outstanding talent to our DXC leadership team, and we will continue to add in the areas of account management, sales and delivery. 
On operational execution, we will invest to enhance delivery. We will simplify the way we work together to drive increased accountability. And going forward, we will also reemphasize our ITO business, which is critical to our success. On the right side of the slide, unlocking value includes a clear outlook, execution of a new strategy as well as evaluating strategic alternatives. We'll execute a focused strategy around what I call the enterprise technology stack. We will sell industry solutions and focus on our existing customers. We will also be pursuing strategic alternatives for 3 businesses that do not fit in our focused strategy. These businesses comprise roughly of 25% of our current revenue. Additionally, we will continue to pursue a balanced capital allocation approach while maintaining our investment-grade credit profile. Paul will now cover our second quarter results and update around our second half outlook."

As usual, I'll start by covering some items that are excluded from our non-GAAP results. In the second quarter, we had restructuring costs of $32 million pretax or $0.11 per diluted share, primarily related to workforce optimization. Also in the quarter, we had $53 million pretax or $0.18 per diluted share of integration and transaction-related costs. In the second quarter, amortization of acquired intangible was $151 million pretax or $0.45 per diluted share. 
Also in the quarter, we recorded a goodwill impairment, which was triggered by the decline in our market capitalization. As part of the reconciliation of the balance sheet carrying value of our reported units to market values, we recorded a $2.9 billion noncash impairment charge or $11.10 per diluted share. 
During the second quarter, we received $666 million from HPE for the arbitration award related to the capital lease dispute. We excluded $632 million or $2.43 per diluted share from our results and this represents the damaged portions of the award. In the quarter, we had a $29 million tax adjustment related to a reconciliation of prior restructuring charges specific to a period back in the fiscal '13 or $0.11 per diluted share. Excluding the impact of these special items, our non-GAAP income before taxes from continuing operations was $492 million and our non-GAAP EPS was $1.38. Now this includes $0.10 of benefit from the interest portion of the HPE arbitration award and a $0.04 of expense related to payments made to Mike Lawrie in connection with his retirement. 
Now let me turn to our second quarter results in more detail. Revenue in the second quarter was $4.85 billion on a GAAP basis. All revenue comparisons I'll discuss will be in constant currency. In the second quarter, revenue was down 0.8% year-over-year, driven by the impact of continued acceleration of cloud migrations. Digital revenue in the second quarter was $1.51 billion, up 52% year-over-year, including Luxoft and up 30% excluding Luxoft. Traditional revenue was $2.4 billion, down 18.5%, which was a few points off from what we had anticipated. 
Industry IP and BPS revenue was $908 million, up 0.3%. Adjusted EBIT in the quarter was $529 million and our adjusted EBIT margin was 10.9%. In the quarter, continued delays in our delivery cost actions as well as cost overruns on a few European transformation contracts contributed to lower-than-expected profit performance. In the quarter, our non-GAAP tax rate was 26.4%, reflecting our global mix of income and the benefit of ongoing tax planning initiatives. Book-to-bill in the quarter was 0.8x as we've seen further delays on several large deals. Digital book-to-bill was 1.2x, traditional book-to-bill was 0.6x and industry IP and BPS book-to-bill was 0.7x. 
Now let's turn to our segment results. GBS revenue was $2.29 billion, up 10.5% year-over-year. Excluding Luxoft, GBS revenue was up 0.4% year-over-year. GBS segment profit was $359 million and profit margin for that segment was 15.7%. Our GBS margin reflects the investment we're making in hiring and training digital talent as well as the slower pace of cost takeout in complex countries. GBS book-to-bill in the quarter was 0.9x, primarily driven by lower-than-expected bookings in industry IP and BPS. 
Our GIS revenue was $2.57 billion, down 9.1% year-over-year. GIS segment profit was $243 million and profit margins was 9.5%. GIS margin reflects the impact of stranded costs related to the decline in our traditional ITO business as well as a slowdown in our delivery cost takeout actions as we work with select customers to improve service. GIS book-to-bill in the quarter was 0.7x, reflecting delayed deals and lower-than-expected conversion of pipeline opportunities. 
Now let me turn to other financial results in the quarter. Adjusted free cash flow in the quarter was $739 million or about 204% of adjusted net income. Now this reflects improved working capital management and expanded use of our receivable facility by $235 million in the quarter. Now this facility is a true sale nonrecourse facility. Our CapEx was $342 million in the quarter or 7.1% of revenue. During the quarter, we repurchased $250 million of shares and paid $56 million in dividend. In total, we returned $306 million in capital to our shareholders. We have limited opportunities to repurchase more shares during the quarter because of the CEO transition and an ongoing evaluation of strategic alternatives for several of our businesses. We now expect to be more opportunistic in returning capital to our shareholders, but we will maintain a very close look at our investment credit profile. 
Cash at the end of the quarter was $2.9 billion, and at the end of the quarter, our total debt was $9.2 billion and including capitalized leases, so our net debt to total capital ratio was 34.9%. 
Now let me turn and provide more details on our new financial targets for the fiscal year. We're now targeting revenue in the range of $19.5 billion to $19.8 billion. This revised revenue guidance is driven by 3 primary factors: First, we've had seen additional delays in several large deals that we expected to close during the second quarter, and that was particularly in the Americas and the U.K. We also lost a few deals during the quarter that were previously included in our second half revenue plans, and as a result now, we expect about $275 million less revenue this year. 
Second, due to execution at existing customers, we now expect $250 million less revenue this year. $75 million of that amount is due to certain customers placing revenue opportunities on hold. This was due to recent delivery execution issues. Now we have recovery plans underway to improve service levels on these accounts. We also adjusted our revenue outlook by $175 million to reflect potential disruptions, given the announcements that we are pursuing strategic alternatives for 3 of our businesses. 
Now third, we now expect $100 million less revenue in our traditional infrastructure and application businesses. We're investing in our ITO business to mitigate these declines and capitalize on the pipeline of opportunities, with an aggressive focus on modernization of customer environments. Now the revised revenue outlook of $19.5 billion to $19.8 billion for the year assume a slight increase in the second half revenue compared with the first half. 
Turning to EPS. We're now targeting adjusted EPS in the range of $5.25 to $5.75 per share. Let me cover some of the key drivers of this revised outlook: First, the reduced revenue forecast will translate to roughly $275 million less EBIT for this year or $0.73 per share, including the impact of potential disruptions related to the strategic alternatives announcement; second, we now expect $170 million less benefit from cost takeout actions this year or $0.47 per share. Now as we move into this more complex phase of operational improvements, including the broader deployment of Bionix, we've seen a need for greater customer engagement as well as more experienced talent, which is impacting the pace of our cost takeout. We've also experienced delays in several global initiatives such as delivery center consolidation, maintenance optimization and enterprise license rationalization, and those translate into an additional $0.10 per share in EPS. We continue to believe that these cost actions are achievable, but it is taking longer to execute than we had originally planned. 
Third, we expect $70 million or $0.20 of EPS from higher-than-expected cost overall on a few large complex customer transformation programs. This is concentrated to a few European contracts and we expect to resolve this issue -- these issues within this fiscal year. Fourth, our revised EPS outlook includes $100 million or $0.28 per share of additional second half investments to strengthen our operations in core Infrastructure Services and to augment talent in key areas such as accounts management and industry sales. This investment also includes our recovery plans on key accounts. 
The revised EPS target of $5.25 to $5.75 per share assume a range of $2.13 to $2.63 versus $3.12 in the first half of the year, and our EBIT margin between 9.5% and 10.5% for the second half of the year versus the 12.1% in the first half. Our cash flow target for the full year is now 80% or more of adjusted net income, and this reflects more conservative working capital assumptions for the second half as well as the timing of a contract settlement payment that we expect to make this year, but we will recover that amount in fiscal '21 from insurance coverage. Now I'll turn back the call to Mike to discuss our strategic priorities and planned actions."

We are clearly not pleased with this revised guidance and the poor execution against our cost plans. We are taking steps to improve our performance with a focus on customers, people and operational execution. We also believe that we will be able to unlock value due to a focused strategy. Going forward, DXC will run as one company focused on the enterprise technology stack versus a traditional business and a digital business. Customers will see 1 DXC, not 2. 
To the left of this slide is what I refer to as the enterprise technology stack. The enterprise technology stack mimics the strategic thinking of how our customers view their technology journey and it starts with ITO. This is the foundation and DXC has an installed base that is second to none. The next level includes cloud with security services, which reflects the fact that customers are buying those services bundled. Moving up the stack, the application layer is critical where we rationalize and modernize and manage customer workloads. Then we can leverage analytics capabilities to harvest data and ultimately provide engineering services to generate business insights for our customers. 
We cannot deliver the technology stack on its own. We have to also provide deep industry expertise, and we will do this by providing integrated industry solutions to our customers. Let me share with you some of the feedback I've heard from our customers, which is on the right side of this slide. DXC runs mission-critical systems and operations for our customers. They expect these to be run silently and effectively. Many of our customers need to upgrade these systems and they want to partner with someone they can trust. This trust requires a deep understanding of their environments with demonstrated experience executing at scale. Also, our customers recognize that not all the workloads are going to migrate to the cloud. They need a provider who can support on-premise assets as well as private and public cloud environments. 
Security is also a top concern and customers expect us to bring deep expertise to them in this area. Our customers are looking to scale their digital capabilities. That includes analytics that produce business insights, and they want to grow with a service provider who has scale. Overall, the key message is that DXC is missing opportunities with our customers. We need to show visible reinvestment to strengthen customer confidence, capture these opportunities moving forward and position DXC for growth. 
With that in mind, we've conducted a review of our portfolio to understand how well DXC's current businesses align against the enterprise technology stack and our focused strategy. First, I was very pleased to see that DXC has capabilities add scale against each layer of the enterprise technology stack. We have $5.4 billion in ITO revenue, $2.1 billion in cloud and security, $5.4 billion in applications and industry IP and $1.4 billion in data analytics and engineering services, including the Luxoft business and roughly $500 million of advisory revenue. 
Now I'd like to discuss the outcome of the review of DXC's current businesses. We evaluated each of our businesses against the following criteria: one, importance to the enterprise technology stack; two, the ability to create industry solutions; three, what our customers wanted; and four, the potential to unlock value. Out of that analysis, we decided to pursue strategic alternatives for 3 businesses, the U.S. state and local health and human services business, our horizontal BPS business and our workplace and mobility business. Combined, these businesses represent about 25% of DXC's total revenue. 
These businesses are strong. Our workplace and our U.S. state and local health and human services businesses are market leaders, and we have meaningful IP in our horizontal BPS business. When I say strategic alternatives, that could involve a range of actions to unlock value, including potential divestitures to strategic or financial buyers, a spin-off or other transactions. Throughout this process, we will remain closely engaged with our customers and our people, ensuring we are meeting our commitments to both. 
Paul will now provide some color on our longer-term financial expectations based on these plans."

Now excluding those 3 businesses, by fiscal '22, we would expect the company to have more than $15 billion of revenue, with at least half of the revenue coming from digital offerings. We also expect margins to be at 12% or more even after accounting for investments. This margin level is consistent with global industry peers. 
We're also taking a conservative view on cash flow conversion while continuing to perform above industry benchmarks. We also assume that we will be able to generate net capital proceeds of roughly $5 billion from these 3 businesses. We expect to deploy $4.25 billion or more to repurchase shares and pay dividends over the next 10 quarters. Now this represents about 50% of our current market cap. We also expect to reduce our debt by more than $2.5 billion as we will continue to pursue a balanced capital allocation approach and protect our investment-grade credit profile, with a target debt-to-EBITDA of 2x or less. 
In fiscal '22, we expect at least $7 per share of adjusted EPS and at least $5.25 of EPS after restructuring, transaction and integration costs. This outlook reflects our plan to moderate these costs over the next couple of years. I'll now turn the call back to Mike."

So in conclusion, here's why I'm excited to lead DXC at this particular point in time. As someone who has lived in the IT services industry for over 30 years and has seen all the different ways service firms can compete, it's very clear to me that DXC has a unique opportunity due to 3 factors: one, DXC has significant scope and scale along with mission-critical positions at large customers; two, DXC, in recent history, has reduced its cost structure in an industry where being cost-efficient boosts your ability to compete; three, customers are facing transformation challenges across the enterprise technology stack, and they are in need of DXC's deep ITO capabilities and experience. 
Customers need a partner like DXC to help them modernize their ITO layer, optimize their data architectures and make it all secure and orchestrated across the public, private and hybrid clouds. This will now be our main thrust in DXC's focused strategy to leverage our ITO expertise to help customers across the enterprise technology stack. We're equipped with a much improved cost structure, and we're going to raise the bar by investing in our people and in our customer service, plus we're going to move away from businesses that are not core to transforming the enterprise technology stack and focus on the businesses that are integral to our focused strategy and our customers' needs.

By emphasizing again what I clearly heard from customers and through my industry expertise and experience is that when you deliver for your customers, simply put, you get more business, you get the ability to move up the stack, not just stay in the ITO layer. So what this strategy is all about is an end strategy. It's both digital along with ITO and applications. 
The other thing is, because of this underperformance, what you heard Paul say, is that we've had work put on hold. We've had growth put on hold. And the market's not going away, right? Meaning, I understand that, look, it's decreasing but we also said and validated that not all the workloads are going to go to the cloud. 70% of today's workloads will continue to be on-prem or in the private clouds in 2023. So look, Rod, I put all that together and basically said, look, our focused strategy needs to be around the enterprise technology stack. Anything that is going to lend itself to not allow us to focus on that, we should put in the strategic alternative bucket, but the bottom line is the end strategy will help us grow."

And as far as your -- the trajectory right now, as Mike mentioned, we are just really going to be looking at strategic alternatives for 25% of the revenue of the company, those 3 businesses. And so we have a whole lot of work ahead of us right now and then we'll learn more over the coming months. So one thing we can say to you is that we know where we're headed in the near term. We know where we're going by fiscal '22. So in due time, we'll provide you with some of the greater visibility into how fiscal '21 will be shaping up."

But we're also still hearing you guys talk about cost cuts that, I guess, came from the prior plans and how some of that was coming at a different pace. I guess, I'm just curious why you're even bothering. On a net basis, shouldn't we just be talking about investments now in the business, given that you really do have a target of a margin profile that is now in the low double digits and potentially could even be lower? I think investors would probably be okay with that, if it meant a revenue payback that would lead to some inflection. So can you just talk about where we are on a net basis? Are you investing now a lot more than you're cutting in costs? And is that the right margin profile, that low double-digit 12% range? And then I just have 1 follow-up."

But look, we are definitely going to invest more for the rest of 2020 than the cost takeout. The problem is there's still opportunities, right, for us to get costs so I want to make sure that we are gearing up to go after those. When I look at pyramid optimization, the Bionix tool, right, that we have is a strong tool, but it needs to be scaled across the regions. And then when I look at operational excellence, I want to make sure we've got an organization that is refining the cost structure, all right, maybe not as cutting as much as we have, all right? 
The second thing is on the investments. The investments are very targeted towards our customers, towards our people and also the operational execution. So when I say that operational execution piece, that's where I'm coming back to building teams and augmenting the capabilities that are here to continue to come after that. I mean, I said in my comments that part of the things that I'm excited about is you got to continue to look at that cost structure to compete in this space. And I think with our new focused strategy right around the enterprise technology stack, I think we're focused on the right areas with the right cost structure, with the right customers and we should be able to grow. What I would definitely leave you with is a lot more investment than it is cost. The other thing I would say on the numbers is when you listen to Paul, those numbers are relatively flat across the board on revenue and on EPS."

My style is one of focus and clarity, which is what we plan to provide during this call. I'll begin by covering a few highlights from my observations on the business, then I'll hand the call over to Paul to discuss the second quarter results and full year outlook. After that, I'll walk through DXC's strategy moving forward, specifically the enterprise technology stack. Next, we will cover the results of the strategic review of our assets, then I'll close by providing additional color on our priorities. 
Over the past 2 months, I have met with 40 of our largest customers, each of our strategic partners and more than 80,000 of our people around the world. DXC has experienced and loyal global talent base that I've had the opportunity to meet many of these people since taking the role, and I've been extremely impressed with the quality of our talent. Our global operations talent, the people who work with our customers every day, are very loyal to DXC and to our customers. I've personally met numerous people who have been with the company for more than 30 years.
DXC has significant scale and global reach across technology offerings. For example, we have over $2 billion of cloud and security revenue. We also have $1.4 billion of revenue in data analytics and digital engineering. Building on that point, DXC has a loyal customer base that includes many of the largest companies in the world where we run their mission-critical systems. We have the opportunities in many of these accounts to increase share of wallet.
As I've taken a fresh look at DXC's businesses, I've been very pleased with our core capabilities. This includes ITO and applications as well as digital solutions. We have a strong foundation to build on. I've also been very pleased with DXC's differentiated solutions in IP in key industries such as automotive, insurance, health care and travel and transportation. 
Finally, I've been impressed with the company's track record of enhancing capabilities through targeted strategic acquisitions, including innovative assets like Luxoft and recently, Bluleader and Virtual Clarity. Bluleader will enhance our SAP application capabilities, and Virtual Clarity will strengthen our capabilities in delivering cloud assessments and transformation road maps to our customers.
I have also seen several areas for improvement that DXC needs to address to enable growth. First, our delivery teams were not able to execute the more complicated phase of operational cost improvements. This includes areas like pyramid optimization, the broader deployment of DXC's automation program called Bionix, along with operational excellence leveraging Six Sigma principles. We need to focus more on our people and strengthening our employee value proposition. Our people need to be clear about their career path at DXC, the opportunities to work with new clients and also the opportunities for reskilling and retraining. Being clear about these items will help create an environment where people are acknowledged, recognized and rewarded, which will improve employee satisfaction and increase retention. 
We also need to focus more on selling integrated solutions. We have an opportunity to shift from providing individual services for many of our customers, to integrated industry solutions, leveraging multiple DXC offerings and capabilities.
Next, execution challenges from recent delivery actions have negatively impacted some of our large customers, which results in lower margins, delayed revenue and bookings as customers have placed the additional work on hold. We have recovery plans underway for these accounts, but we need to do a better job running operations. By doing this, we will earn the right to expand our footprint with customers. The current operating model is complex, resulting in unclear accountabilities as well as slow decision-making. We will be simplifying this structure with greater emphasis on our regions and industries. 
Finally, DXC provides mission-critical services to many of our customers, particularly in ITO. But this business has been under-emphasized. We have the opportunity to invest and strengthen this business. Doing this well will provide a foundation of future growth with our existing customers. 
Overall, I believe that each of these points is fixable and we're already on the case. I've made 5 senior hires to augment our leadership team focused on each of these challenges. Mary will focus on our people as our CHRO. Kristin will focus on simplifying our operating model as VP of Corporate Operations. Vinod will focus on Global Delivery Innovation, specifically pyramiding, scaling technology and Six Sigma to deliver enhanced service to our customers as EVP of Global Delivery Transformation. Steve and David will focus on running our accounts to make sure we are listening to the voice of the customer when we are providing services in 2 of our largest regions of the Americas and UKIIMEA. Again, we believe there's an exciting path forward to run this business more effectively while also unlocking value.
On the left side, running the business involves a stronger focus on customers, people and operational execution. On customers, we will invest to stabilize key accounts and assure that our delivery is meeting our clients' expectations. Doing this will ensure that we earn the right to walk the halls and help them with additional work as they think through their strategies. 
On people, we will make investments to acknowledge, recognize and reward our people, which will strengthen our employee value proposition. As I discussed, we have started adding outstanding talent to our DXC leadership team, and we will continue to add in the areas of account management, sales and delivery.
On operational execution, we will invest to enhance delivery. We will simplify the way we work together to drive increased accountability. And going forward, we will also reemphasize our ITO business, which is critical to our success. On the right side of the slide, unlocking value includes a clear outlook, execution of a new strategy as well as evaluating strategic alternatives. We will execute a focused strategy around what I call the enterprise technology stack. We will sell industry solutions and focus on our existing customers. We will also be pursuing strategic alternatives for 3 businesses that do not fit in our focused strategy. These businesses comprise roughly of 25% of our current revenue. Additionally, we will continue to pursue a balanced capital allocation approach while maintaining our investment-grade credit profile. Paul will now cover our second quarter results and update around our second half outlook."

As usual, I'll start by covering some items that are excluded from our non-GAAP results. In the second quarter, we had restructuring costs of $32 million pretax or $0.11 per diluted share primarily related to workforce optimization. Also, in the quarter, we had $53 million pretax or $0.18 per diluted share of integration and transaction-related costs. In the second quarter, amortization of acquired intangible was $151 million pretax or $0.45 per diluted share.
Also, in the quarter, we recorded a goodwill impairment, which was triggered by the decline in our market capitalization. As part of the reconciliation of the balance sheet carrying value of our reported units to market values, we recorded a $2.9 billion noncash impairment charge or $11.10 per diluted share.
During the second quarter, we received $666 million from HPE for the arbitration award related to the capital lease dispute. We excluded $632 million or $2.43 per diluted share from our results, and this represents the damaged portions of the award. In the quarter, we had a $29 million tax adjustment related to a reconciliation of prior restructuring charges specific to a period back in the fiscal '13 or $0.11 per diluted share. Excluding the impact of these special items, our non-GAAP income before taxes from continuing operations was $492 million and our non-GAAP EPS was $1.38. Now this includes $0.10 of benefit from the interest portion of the HPE arbitration award and a $0.04 of expense related to payments made to Mike Lawrie in connection with his retirement. 
Now let me turn to our second quarter results in more detail. Revenue in the second quarter was $4.85 billion on a GAAP basis. All revenue comparisons I'll discuss will be in constant currency. In the second quarter, revenue was down 0.8% year-over-year driven by the impact of continued acceleration of cloud migrations. Digital revenue in the second quarter was $1.51 billion, up 52% year-over-year, including Luxoft and up 30%, excluding Luxoft. Traditional revenue was $2.4 billion, down 18.5%, which was a few points off from what we had anticipated.
Industry IP and BPS revenue was $908 million, up 0.3%. Adjusted EBIT in the quarter was $529 million, and our adjusted EBIT margin was 10.9%. In the quarter, continued delays in our delivery cost actions as well as cost overruns on a few European transformation contracts contributed to lower-than-expected profit performance. In the quarter, our non-GAAP tax rate was 26.4%, reflecting our global mix of income and the benefit of ongoing tax planning initiatives. Book-to-bill in the quarter was 0.8x as we've seen further delays on several large deals. Digital book-to-bill was 1.2x. Traditional book-to-bill was 0.6x. And industry IP and BPS book-to-bill was 0.7x. 
Now let's turn to our segment results. GBS revenue was $2.29 billion, up 10.5% year-over-year. Excluding Luxoft, GBS revenue was up 0.4% year-over-year. GBS segment profit was $359 million and profit margin for that segment was 15.7%. Our GBS margin reflects the investment we're making in hiring and training digital talent as well as the slower pace of cost takeout in complex countries. GBS book-to-bill in the quarter was 0.9x primarily driven by lower-than-expected bookings in industry IP and BPS. 
Our GIS revenue was $2.57 billion, down 9.1% year-over-year. GIS segment profit was $243 million and profit margin was 9.5%. GIS margin reflects the impact of stranded costs related to the decline in our traditional ITO business as well as a slowdown in our delivery cost takeout actions as we work with select customers to improve service. GIS book-to-bill in the quarter was 0.7x, reflecting delayed deals and lower-than-expected conversion of pipeline opportunities. 
Now let me turn to other financial results in the quarter. Adjusted free cash flow in the quarter was $739 million or about 204% of adjusted net income. Now this reflects improved working capital management and expanded use of our receivable facility by $235 million in the quarter. Now this facility is a true sale nonrecourse facility. Our CapEx was $342 million in the quarter or 7.1% of revenue. 
During the quarter, we repurchased $250 million of shares and paid $56 million in dividend. In total, we returned $306 million in capital to our shareholders. We had limited opportunities to repurchase more shares during the quarter because of the CEO transition and an ongoing evaluation of strategic alternatives for several of our businesses. We now expect to be more opportunistic in returning capital to our shareholders, but we will maintain a very close look at our investment credit profile.
Cash at the end of the quarter was $2.9 billion, and at the end of the quarter, our total debt was $9.2 billion and including capitalized leases, so our net debt-to-total-capital ratio was 34.9%.
Now let me turn and provide more details on our new financial targets for the fiscal year. We're now targeting revenue in the range of $19.5 billion to $19.8 billion. This revised revenue guidance is driven by 3 primary factors. First, we had seen additional delays in several large deals that we expected to close during the second quarter, and that was particularly in the Americas and the U.K. We also lost a few deals during the quarter that were previously included in our second half revenue plans, and as a result now, we expect about $275 million less revenue this year.
Second, due to execution at existing customers, we now expect $250 million less revenue this year. $75 million of that amount is due to certain customers placing revenue opportunities on hold. This was due to recent delivery execution issues. Now we have recovery plans underway to improve service levels on these accounts. We also adjusted our revenue outlook by $175 million to reflect potential disruptions given the announcement that we are pursuing strategic alternatives for 3 of our businesses.
Now third, we now expect $100 million less revenue in our traditional infrastructure and application businesses. We're investing in our ITO business to mitigate these declines and capitalize on the pipeline of opportunities, with an aggressive focus on modernization of customer environments. Now the revised revenue outlook of $19.5 billion to $19.8 billion for the year assume a slight increase in the second half revenue compared with the first half. 
Turning to EPS. We're now targeting adjusted EPS in the range of $5.25 to $5.75 per share. Let me cover some of the key drivers of this revised outlook. First, the reduced revenue forecast will translate to roughly $275 million less EBIT for this year or $0.73 per share, including the impact of potential disruptions related to the strategic alternatives announcement. Second, we now expect $170 million less benefit from cost takeout actions this year or $0.47 per share. Now as we move into this more complex phase of operational improvements, including the broader deployment of Bionix, we've seen a need for greater customer engagement as well as more experienced talent, which is impacting the pace of our cost takeout. 
We've also experienced delays in several global initiatives such as delivery center consolidation, maintenance optimization and enterprise license rationalization, and those translate into an additional $0.10 per share in EPS. We continue to believe that these cost actions are achievable, but it is taking longer to execute than we had originally planned. 
Third, we expect $70 million or $0.20 of EPS from higher-than-expected cost overruns on a few large complex customer transformation programs. This is concentrated to a few European contracts, and we expect to resolve this issue -- these issues within this fiscal year. Fourth, our revised EPS outlook includes $100 million or $0.28 per share of additional second half investments to strengthen our operations in core infrastructure services and to augment talent in key areas such as accounts management and industry sales. This investment also includes our recovery plans on key accounts.
The revised EPS target of $5.25 to $5.75 per share assume a range of $2.13 to $2.63 versus $3.12 in the first half of the year and our EBIT margin between 9.5% and 10.5% for the second half of the year versus the 12.1% in the first half. Our cash flow target for the full year is now 80% or more of adjusted net income, and this reflects more conservative working capital assumptions for the second half as well as the timing of a contract settlement payment that we expect to make this year, but we will recover that amount in fiscal '21 from insurance coverage. 
Now I'll turn back the call to Mike to discuss our strategic priorities and planned actions."

We are clearly not pleased with this revised guidance and the poor execution against our cost plans. We are taking steps to improve our performance with a focus on customers, people and operational execution. We also believe that we will be able to unlock value due to a focused strategy. Going forward, DXC will run as one company focused on the enterprise technology stack versus a traditional business and a digital business. Customers will see 1 DXC, not 2.
To the left of this slide is what I refer to as the enterprise technology stack. The enterprise technology stack mimics the strategic thinking of how our customers view their technology journey and it starts with ITO. This is the foundation, and DXC has an installed base that is second to none. The next level includes cloud with security services, which reflects the fact that customers are buying those services bundled. Moving up the stack, the application layer is critical, where we rationalize and modernize and manage customer workloads. Then we can leverage analytics capabilities to harvest data and ultimately provide engineering services to generate business insights for our customers.
We cannot deliver the technology stack on its own. We have to also provide deep industry expertise, and we will do this by providing integrated industry solutions to our customers. 
Let me share with you some of the feedback I've heard from our customers, which is on the right side of this slide. DXC runs mission-critical systems and operations for our customers. They expect these to be run silently and effectively. Many of our customers need to upgrade these systems and they want to partner with someone they can trust. This trust requires a deep understanding of their environments, with demonstrated experience executing at scale. Also, our customers recognize that not all the workloads are going to migrate to the cloud. They need a provider who can support on-premise assets as well as private and public cloud environments.
Security is also a top concern, and customers expect us to bring deep expertise to them in this area. Our customers are looking to scale their digital capabilities. That includes analytics that produce business insights, and they want to grow with a service provider who has scale. 
Overall, the key message is that DXC is missing opportunities with our customers. We need to show visible reinvestment to strengthen customer confidence, capture these opportunities moving forward and position DXC for growth.
With that in mind, we've conducted a review of our portfolio to understand how well DXC's current businesses align against the enterprise technology stack and our focused strategy. First, I was very pleased to see that DXC has capability to add scale against each layer of the enterprise technology stack. We have $5.4 billion in ITO revenue, $2.1 billion in cloud and security, $5.4 billion in applications and industry IP and $1.4 billion in data analytics and engineering services, including the Luxoft business, and roughly $500 million of advisory revenue. 
Now I'd like to discuss the outcome of the review of DXC's current businesses. We evaluated each of our businesses against the following criteria: one, importance to the enterprise technology stack; two, the ability to create industry solutions; three, what our customers wanted; and four, the potential to unlock value. Out of that analysis, we decided to pursue strategic alternatives for 3 businesses, the U.S. state and local health and human services business, our horizontal BPS business and our workplace and mobility business. Combined, these businesses represent about 25% of DXC's total revenue. 
These businesses are strong. Our workplace and our U.S. state and local health and human services businesses are market leaders, and we have meaningful IP in our horizontal BPS business. When I say strategic alternatives, that could involve a range of actions to unlock value, including potential divestitures to strategic or financial buyers, a spin-off or other transactions. Throughout this process, we will remain closely engaged with our customers and our people, ensuring we are meeting our commitments to both.
Paul will now provide some color on our longer-term financial expectations based on these plans."

Now excluding those 3 businesses, by fiscal '22, we would expect the company to have more than $15 billion of revenue, with at least half of the revenue coming from digital offerings. We also expect margins to be at 12% or more even after accounting for investments. This margin level is consistent with global industry peers.
We're also taking a conservative view on cash flow conversion while continuing to perform above industry benchmarks. We also assume that we will be able to generate net capital proceeds of roughly $5 billion from these 3 businesses. We expect to deploy $4.25 billion or more to repurchase shares and pay dividends over the next 10 quarters. Now this represents about 50% of our current market cap. We also expect to reduce our debt by more than $2.5 billion as we will continue to pursue a balanced capital allocation approach and protect our investment-grade credit profile, with a target debt-to-EBITDA of 2x or less.
In fiscal '22, we expect at least $7 per share of adjusted EPS and at least $5.25 of EPS after restructuring, transaction and integration costs. This outlook reflects our plan to moderate these costs over the next couple of years. 
I'll now turn the call back to Mike."

So in conclusion, here's why I'm excited to lead DXC at this particular point in time. As someone who has lived in the IT services industry for over 30 years and has seen all the different ways service firms can compete, it's very clear to me that DXC has a unique opportunity due to 3 factors: one, DXC has significant scope and scale, along with mission-critical positions at large customers; two, DXC, in recent history, has reduced its cost structure in an industry where being cost-efficient boosts your ability to compete; three, customers are facing transformation challenges across the enterprise technology stack, and they are in need of DXC's deep ITO capabilities and experience.
Customers need a partner like DXC to help them modernize their ITO layer, optimize their data architectures and make it all secure and orchestrated across the public, private and hybrid clouds. This will now be our main thrust in DXC's focused strategy, to leverage our ITO expertise to help customers across the enterprise technology stack. We're equipped with a much improved cost structure, and we're going to raise the bar by investing in our people and in our customer service, plus we're going to move away from businesses that are not core to transforming the enterprise technology stack and focus on the businesses that are integral to our focused strategy and our customers' needs.

And look, the bottom line is the way I see it is we've got a unique position of strength in the ITO layer, all right? We also have unemphasized the ITO. By emphasizing again what I clearly heard from customers and through my industry expertise and experience is that when you deliver for your customers, simply put, you get more business, you get the ability to move up the stack, not just stay in the ITO layer. So what this strategy is all about is an end strategy. It's both digital, along with ITO and applications.
The other thing is, because of this underperformance, what you heard Paul say, is that we've had work put on hold. We've had growth put on hold. And the market's not going away, right? Meaning, I understand that, look, it's decreasing, but we also said and validated that not all the workloads are going to go to the cloud. 70% of today's workloads will continue to be on-prem or in the private clouds in 2023. 
So look, Rod, I put all that together and basically said, look, our focused strategy needs to be around the enterprise technology stack. Anything that is going to lend itself to not allow us to focus on that we should put in the strategic alternative bucket, but the bottom line is the end strategy will help us grow."

As Mike mentioned, we're going to be making investments and reemphasizing the traditional business, but -- and also, particularly, the ITO business as well as the application business.

And for the rest of the businesses across the stack, to continue to grow at or above market rates, which we have already been showing through our results. 
So that's basically what the assumptions are on the near term. And we are confident that the outlook that we are putting here is we're going to be able to achieve. In fact, our internal plan actually would be to try to do better than that. That's why you have the pluses that are showing up across that page.
And as far as your -- the trajectory right now, as Mike mentioned, we are just really going to be looking at strategic alternatives for 25% of the revenue of the company, those 3 businesses. And so we have a whole lot of work ahead of us right now and then we'll learn more over the coming months. So one thing we can say to you is that we know where we're headed near-term.

On a net basis, shouldn't we just be talking about investments now in the business, given that you really do have a target of a margin profile that is now in the low double digits and potentially could even be lower? I think investors would probably be okay with that, if it meant a revenue payback that would lead to some inflection. So can you just talk about where we are on a net basis?

And then when I look at operational excellence, I want to make sure we've got an organization that is refining the cost structure, all right, maybe not as cutting as much as we have, all right? 
The second thing is on the investments. The investments are very targeted towards our customers, towards our people and also the operational execution. So when I say that operational execution piece, that's where I'm coming back to building teams and augmenting the capabilities that are here to continue to come after that. I mean I said in my comments that part of the things that I'm excited about is you got to continue to look at that cost structure to compete in this space. And I think with our new focused strategy right around the enterprise technology stack, I think we're focused on the right areas with the right cost structure, with the right customers, and we should be able to grow. But I would definitely leave you with it's a lot more investment than it is cost.

My style is one of focus and clarity, which is what we plan to provide during this call. I'll begin by covering a few highlights from my observations on the business, then I'll hand the call over to Paul to discuss the second quarter results and full year outlook. After that, I'll walk through DXC's strategy moving forward, specifically the enterprise technology stack. Next, we will cover the results of the strategic review of our assets, then I'll close by providing additional color on our priorities. 
Over the past 2 months, I have met with 40 of our largest customers, each of our strategic partners and more than 80,000 of our people around the world. DXC has experienced and loyal global talent base that I've had the opportunity to meet many of these people since taking the role, and I've been extremely impressed with the quality of our talent. Our global operations talent, the people who work with our customers every day, are very loyal to DXC and to our customers. I've personally met numerous people who have been with the company for more than 30 years.
DXC has significant scale and global reach across technology offerings. For example, we have over $2 billion of cloud and security revenue. We also have $1.4 billion of revenue in data analytics and digital engineering. Building on that point, DXC has a loyal customer base that includes many of the largest companies in the world where we run their mission-critical systems. We have the opportunities in many of these accounts to increase share of wallet.
As I've taken a fresh look at DXC's businesses, I've been very pleased with our core capabilities. This includes ITO and applications as well as digital solutions. We have a strong foundation to build on. I've also been very pleased with DXC's differentiated solutions and IP in key industries such as automotive, insurance, health care and travel and transportation. 
Finally, I've been impressed with the company's track record of enhancing capabilities through targeted strategic acquisitions, including innovative assets like Luxoft and recently, Bluleader and Virtual Clarity. Bluleader will enhance our SAP application capabilities, and Virtual Clarity will strengthen our capabilities in delivering cloud assessments and transformation road maps to our customers.
I have also seen several areas for improvement that DXC needs to address to enable growth. First, our delivery teams were not able to execute the more complicated phase of operational cost improvements. This includes areas like pyramid optimization, the broader deployment of DXC's automation program called Bionix, along with operational excellence leveraging Six Sigma principles. We need to focus more on our people and strengthening our employee value proposition. Our people need to be clear about their career path at DXC, the opportunities to work with new clients and also the opportunities for reskilling and retraining. Being clear about these items will help create an environment where people are acknowledged, recognized and rewarded, which will improve employee satisfaction and increase retention. 
We also need to focus more on selling integrated solutions. We have an opportunity to shift from providing individual services for many of our customers, to integrated industry solutions, leveraging multiple DXC offerings and capabilities.
Next, execution challenges from recent delivery actions have negatively impacted some of our large customers, which results in lower margins, delayed revenue and bookings as customers have placed the additional work on hold. We have recovery plans underway for these accounts, but we need to do a better job running operations. By doing this, we will earn the right to expand our footprint with customers. The current operating model is complex, resulting in unclear accountabilities as well as slow decision-making. We will be simplifying this structure with greater emphasis on our regions and industries. 
Finally, DXC provides mission-critical services to many of our customers, particularly in ITO. But this business has been under-emphasized. We have the opportunity to invest and strengthen this business. Doing this well will provide a foundation of future growth with our existing customers. 
Overall, I believe that each of these points is fixable and we're already on the case. I've made 5 senior hires to augment our leadership team focused on each of these challenges. Mary will focus on our people as our CHRO. Kristin will focus on simplifying our operating model as VP of Corporate Operations. Vinod will focus on Global Delivery Innovation, specifically pyramiding, scaling technology and Six Sigma to deliver enhanced service to our customers as EVP of Global Delivery Transformation. Steve and David will focus on running our accounts to make sure we are listening to the voice of the customer when we are providing services in 2 of our largest regions of the Americas and UKIIMEA. Again, we believe there's an exciting path forward to run this business more effectively while also unlocking value.
On the left side, running the business involves a stronger focus on customers, people and operational execution. On customers, we will invest to stabilize key accounts and assure that our delivery is meeting our clients' expectations. Doing this will ensure that we earn the right to walk the halls and help them with additional work as they think through their strategies. 
On people, we will make investments to acknowledge, recognize and reward our people, which will strengthen our employee value proposition. As I discussed, we have started adding outstanding talent to our DXC leadership team, and we will continue to add in the areas of account management, sales and delivery.
On operational execution, we will invest to enhance delivery. We will simplify the way we work together to drive increased accountability. And going forward, we will also reemphasize our ITO business, which is critical to our success. On the right side of the slide, unlocking value includes a clear outlook, execution of a new strategy as well as evaluating strategic alternatives. We will execute a focused strategy around what I call the enterprise technology stack. We will sell industry solutions and focus on our existing customers. We will also be pursuing strategic alternatives for 3 businesses that do not fit in our focused strategy. These businesses comprise roughly of 25% of our current revenue. Additionally, we will continue to pursue a balanced capital allocation approach while maintaining our investment-grade credit profile. Paul will now cover our second quarter results and update around our second half outlook."

As usual, I'll start by covering some items that are excluded from our non-GAAP results. In the second quarter, we had restructuring costs of $32 million pretax or $0.11 per diluted share primarily related to workforce optimization. Also, in the quarter, we had $53 million pretax or $0.18 per diluted share of integration and transaction-related costs. In the second quarter, amortization of acquired intangible was $151 million pretax or $0.45 per diluted share.
Also, in the quarter, we recorded a goodwill impairment, which was triggered by the decline in our market capitalization. As part of the reconciliation of the balance sheet carrying value of our reported units to market values, we recorded a $2.9 billion noncash impairment charge or $11.10 per diluted share.
During the second quarter, we received $666 million from HPE for the arbitration award related to the capital lease dispute. We excluded $632 million or $2.43 per diluted share from our results, and this represents the damaged portions of the award. In the quarter, we had a $29 million tax adjustment related to a reconciliation of prior restructuring charges specific to a period back in the fiscal '13 or $0.11 per diluted share. Excluding the impact of these special items, our non-GAAP income before taxes from continuing operations was $492 million and our non-GAAP EPS was $1.38. Now this includes $0.10 of benefit from the interest portion of the HPE arbitration award and a $0.04 of expense related to payments made to Mike Lawrie in connection with his retirement. 
Now let me turn to our second quarter results in more detail. Revenue in the second quarter was $4.85 billion on a GAAP basis. All revenue comparisons I'll discuss will be in constant currency. In the second quarter, revenue was down 0.8% year-over-year driven by the impact of continued acceleration of cloud migrations. Digital revenue in the second quarter was $1.51 billion, up 52% year-over-year, including Luxoft and up 30%, excluding Luxoft. Traditional revenue was $2.4 billion, down 18.5%, which was a few points off from what we had anticipated.
Industry IP and BPS revenue was $908 million, up 0.3%. Adjusted EBIT in the quarter was $529 million, and our adjusted EBIT margin was 10.9%. In the quarter, continued delays in our delivery cost actions as well as cost overruns on a few European transformation contracts contributed to lower-than-expected profit performance. In the quarter, our non-GAAP tax rate was 26.4%, reflecting our global mix of income and the benefit of ongoing tax planning initiatives. Book-to-bill in the quarter was 0.8x as we've seen further delays on several large deals. Digital book-to-bill was 1.2x. Traditional book-to-bill was 0.6x. And industry IP and BPS book-to-bill was 0.7x. 
Now let's turn to our segment results. GBS revenue was $2.29 billion, up 10.5% year-over-year. Excluding Luxoft, GBS revenue was up 0.4% year-over-year. GBS segment profit was $359 million and profit margin for that segment was 15.7%. Our GBS margin reflects the investment we're making in hiring and training digital talent as well as the slower pace of cost takeout in complex countries. GBS book-to-bill in the quarter was 0.9x primarily driven by lower-than-expected bookings in industry IP and BPS. 
Our GIS revenue was $2.57 billion, down 9.1% year-over-year. GIS segment profit was $243 million and profit margin was 9.5%. GIS margin reflects the impact of stranded costs related to the decline in our traditional ITO business as well as a slowdown in our delivery cost takeout actions as we work with select customers to improve service. GIS book-to-bill in the quarter was 0.7x, reflecting delayed deals and lower-than-expected conversion of pipeline opportunities. 
Now let me turn to other financial results in the quarter. Adjusted free cash flow in the quarter was $739 million or about 204% of adjusted net income. Now this reflects improved working capital management and expanded use of our receivable facility by $235 million in the quarter. Now this facility is a true sale nonrecourse facility. Our CapEx was $342 million in the quarter or 7.1% of revenue. 
During the quarter, we repurchased $250 million of shares and paid $56 million in dividend. In total, we returned $306 million in capital to our shareholders. We had limited opportunities to repurchase more shares during the quarter because of the CEO transition and an ongoing evaluation of strategic alternatives for several of our businesses. We now expect to be more opportunistic in returning capital to our shareholders, but we will maintain a very close look at our investment credit profile.
Cash at the end of the quarter was $2.9 billion, and at the end of the quarter, our total debt was $9.2 billion and including capitalized leases, so our net debt-to-total-capital ratio was 34.9%.
Now let me turn and provide more details on our new financial targets for the fiscal year. We're now targeting revenue in the range of $19.5 billion to $19.8 billion. This revised revenue guidance is driven by 3 primary factors. First, we had seen additional delays in several large deals that we expected to close during the second quarter, and that was particularly in the Americas and the U.K. We also lost a few deals during the quarter that were previously included in our second half revenue plans, and as a result now, we expect about $275 million less revenue this year.
Second, due to execution at existing customers, we now expect $250 million less revenue this year. $75 million of that amount is due to certain customers placing revenue opportunities on hold. This was due to recent delivery execution issues. Now we have recovery plans underway to improve service levels on these accounts. We also adjusted our revenue outlook by $175 million to reflect potential disruptions given the announcement that we are pursuing strategic alternatives for 3 of our businesses.
Now third, we now expect $100 million less revenue in our traditional infrastructure and application businesses. We're investing in our ITO business to mitigate these declines and capitalize on the pipeline of opportunities, with an aggressive focus on modernization of customer environments. Now the revised revenue outlook of $19.5 billion to $19.8 billion for the year assume a slight increase in the second half revenue compared with the first half. 
Turning to EPS. We're now targeting adjusted EPS in the range of $5.25 to $5.75 per share. Let me cover some of the key drivers of this revised outlook. First, the reduced revenue forecast will translate to roughly $275 million less EBIT for this year or $0.73 per share, including the impact of potential disruptions related to the strategic alternatives announcement. Second, we now expect $170 million less benefit from cost takeout actions this year or $0.47 per share. Now as we move into this more complex phase of operational improvements, including the broader deployment of Bionix, we've seen a need for greater customer engagement as well as more experienced talent, which is impacting the pace of our cost takeout. 
We've also experienced delays in several global initiatives such as delivery center consolidation, maintenance optimization and enterprise license rationalization, and those translate into an additional $0.10 per share in EPS. We continue to believe that these cost actions are achievable, but it is taking longer to execute than we had originally planned. 
Third, we expect $70 million or $0.20 of EPS from higher-than-expected cost overruns on a few large complex customer transformation programs. This is concentrated to a few European contracts, and we expect to resolve this issue -- these issues within this fiscal year. Fourth, our revised EPS outlook includes $100 million or $0.28 per share of additional second half investments to strengthen our operations in core infrastructure services and to augment talent in key areas such as account management and industry sales. This investment also includes our recovery plans on key accounts.
The revised EPS target of $5.25 to $5.75 per share assume a range of $2.13 to $2.63 versus $3.12 in the first half of the year and our EBIT margin between 9.5% and 10.5% for the second half of the year versus the 12.1% in the first half. Our cash flow target for the full year is now 80% or more of adjusted net income, and this reflects more conservative working capital assumptions for the second half as well as the timing of a contract settlement payment that we expect to make this year, but we will recover that amount in fiscal '21 from insurance coverage. 
Now I'll turn back the call to Mike to discuss our strategic priorities and planned actions."

We are clearly not pleased with this revised guidance and the poor execution against our cost plans. We are taking steps to improve our performance with a focus on customers, people and operational execution. We also believe that we will be able to unlock value due to a focused strategy. Going forward, DXC will run as one company focused on the enterprise technology stack versus a traditional business and a digital business. Customers will see 1 DXC, not 2.
To the left of this slide is what I refer to as the enterprise technology stack. The enterprise technology stack mimics the strategic thinking of how our customers view their technology journey and it starts with ITO. This is the foundation, and DXC has an installed base that is second to none. The next level includes cloud with security services, which reflects the fact that customers are buying those services bundled. Moving up the stack, the application layer is critical, where we rationalize and modernize and manage customer workloads. Then we can leverage analytics capabilities to harvest data and ultimately provide engineering services to generate business insights for our customers.
We cannot deliver the technology stack on its own. We have to also provide deep industry expertise, and we will do this by providing integrated industry solutions to our customers. 
Let me share with you some of the feedback I've heard from our customers, which is on the right side of this slide. DXC runs mission-critical systems and operations for our customers. They expect these to be run silently and effectively. Many of our customers need to upgrade these systems and they want to partner with someone they can trust. This trust requires a deep understanding of their environments, with demonstrated experience executing at scale. Also, our customers recognize that not all the workloads are going to migrate to the cloud. They need a provider who can support on-premise assets as well as private and public cloud environments.
Security is also a top concern, and customers expect us to bring deep expertise to them in this area. Our customers are looking to scale their digital capabilities. That includes analytics that produce business insights, and they want to grow with a service provider who has scale. 
Overall, the key message is that DXC is missing opportunities with our customers. We need to show visible reinvestment to strengthen customer confidence, capture these opportunities moving forward and position DXC for growth.
With that in mind, we've conducted a review of our portfolio to understand how well DXC's current businesses align against the enterprise technology stack and our focused strategy. First, I was very pleased to see that DXC has capabilities at scale against each layer of the enterprise technology stack. We have $5.4 billion in ITO revenue, $2.1 billion in cloud and security, $5.4 billion in applications and industry IP and $1.4 billion in data analytics and engineering services, including the Luxoft business, and roughly $500 million of advisory revenue. 
Now I'd like to discuss the outcome of the review of DXC's current businesses. We evaluated each of our businesses against the following criteria: one, importance to the enterprise technology stack; two, the ability to create industry solutions; three, what our customers wanted; and four, the potential to unlock value. Out of that analysis, we decided to pursue strategic alternatives for 3 businesses, the U.S. state and local health and human services business, our horizontal BPS business and our workplace and mobility business. Combined, these businesses represent about 25% of DXC's total revenue. 
These businesses are strong. Our workplace and our U.S. state and local health and human services businesses are market leaders, and we have meaningful IP in our horizontal BPS business. When I say strategic alternatives, that could involve a range of actions to unlock value, including potential divestitures to strategic or financial buyers, a spin-off or other transactions. Throughout this process, we will remain closely engaged with our customers and our people, ensuring we are meeting our commitments to both.
Paul will now provide some color on our longer-term financial expectations based on these plans."

Now excluding those 3 businesses, by fiscal '22, we would expect the company to have more than $15 billion of revenue, with at least half of the revenue coming from digital offerings. We also expect margins to be at 12% or more even after accounting for investments. This margin level is consistent with global industry peers.
We're also taking a conservative view on cash flow conversion while continuing to perform above industry benchmarks. We also assume that we will be able to generate net capital proceeds of roughly $5 billion from these 3 businesses. We expect to deploy $4.25 billion or more to repurchase shares and pay dividends over the next 10 quarters. Now this represents about 50% of our current market cap. We also expect to reduce our debt by more than $2.5 billion as we will continue to pursue a balanced capital allocation approach and protect our investment-grade credit profile, with a target debt-to-EBITDA of 2x or less.
In fiscal '22, we expect at least $7 per share of adjusted EPS and at least $5.25 of EPS after restructuring, transaction and integration costs. This outlook reflects our plan to moderate these costs over the next couple of years. 
I'll now turn the call back to Mike."

So in conclusion, here's why I'm excited to lead DXC at this particular point in time. As someone who has lived in the IT services industry for over 30 years and has seen all the different ways service firms can compete, it's very clear to me that DXC has a unique opportunity due to 3 factors: one, DXC has significant scope and scale, along with mission-critical positions at large customers; two, DXC, in recent history, has reduced its cost structure in an industry where being cost-efficient boosts your ability to compete; three, customers are facing transformation challenges across the enterprise technology stack, and they are in need of DXC's deep ITO capabilities and experience.
Customers need a partner like DXC to help them modernize their ITO layer, optimize their data architectures and make it all secure and orchestrated across the public, private and hybrid clouds. This will now be our main thrust in DXC's focused strategy, to leverage our ITO expertise to help customers across the enterprise technology stack. We're equipped with a much improved cost structure, and we're going to raise the bar by investing in our people and in our customer service, plus we're going to move away from businesses that are not core to transforming the enterprise technology stack and focus on the businesses that are integral to our focused strategy and our customers' needs.

The other thing is, because of this underperformance, what you heard Paul say, is that we've had work put on hold. We've had growth put on hold. And the market's not going away, right? Meaning, I understand that, look, it's decreasing, but we also said and validated that not all the workloads are going to go to the cloud. 70% of today's workloads will continue to be on-prem or in the private clouds in 2023. 
So look, Rod, I put all that together and basically said, look, our focused strategy needs to be around the enterprise technology stack. Anything that is going to lend itself to not allow us to focus on that we should put in the strategic alternative bucket, but the bottom line is the end strategy will help us grow."

And for the rest of the businesses across the stack, to continue to grow at or above market rates, which we have already been showing through our results. 
So that's basically what the assumptions are on the near term. And we are confident that the outlook that we are putting here is we're going to be able to achieve. In fact, our internal plan actually would be to try to do better than that. That's why you have the pluses that are showing up across that page.
And as far as your -- the trajectory right now, as Mike mentioned, we are just really going to be looking at strategic alternatives for 25% of the revenue of the company, those 3 businesses.

On a net basis, shouldn't we just be talking about investments now in the business, given that you really do have a target of a margin profile that is now in the low double digits and potentially could even be lower? I think investors would probably be okay with that, if it meant a revenue payback that would lead to some inflection. So can you just talk about where we are on a net basis?

The problem is there's still opportunities, right, for us to get costs, so I want to make sure that we are gearing up to go after those.

And then when I look at operational excellence, I want to make sure we've got an organization that is refining the cost structure, all right, maybe not as cutting as much as we have, all right? 
The second thing is on the investments. The investments are very targeted towards our customers, towards our people and also the operational execution. So when I say that operational execution piece, that's where I'm coming back to building teams and augmenting the capabilities that are here to continue to come after that. I mean I said in my comments that part of the things that I'm excited about is you got to continue to look at that cost structure to compete in this space. And I think with our new focused strategy right around the enterprise technology stack, I think we're focused on the right areas with the right cost structure, with the right customers, and we should be able to grow. But I would definitely leave you with it's a lot more investment than it is cost.

I'll begin by covering a few highlights from my observations on the business, then I'll hand the call over to Paul to discuss the second quarter results and full year outlook. After that, I'll walk through DXC's strategy moving forward, specifically the enterprise technology stack. Next, we will cover the results of the strategic review of our assets, then I'll close by providing additional color on our priorities. 
Over the past 2 months, I have met with 40 of our largest customers, each of our strategic partners and more than 80,000 of our people around the world. DXC has experienced and loyal global talent base that I've had the opportunity to meet many of these people since taking the role, and I've been extremely impressed with the quality of our talent. Our global operations talent, the people who work with our customers every day, are very loyal to DXC and to our customers. I've personally met numerous people who have been with the company for more than 30 years.
DXC has significant scale and global reach across technology offerings. For example, we have over $2 billion of cloud and security revenue. We also have $1.4 billion of revenue in data analytics and digital engineering. Building on that point, DXC has a loyal customer base that includes many of the largest companies in the world where we run their mission-critical systems. We have the opportunities in many of these accounts to increase share of wallet.
As I've taken a fresh look at DXC's businesses, I've been very pleased with our core capabilities. This includes ITO and applications as well as digital solutions. We have a strong foundation to build on. I've also been very pleased with DXC's differentiated solutions and IP in key industries such as automotive, insurance, health care and travel and transportation. 
Finally, I've been impressed with the company's track record of enhancing capabilities through targeted strategic acquisitions, including innovative assets like Luxoft and recently, Bluleader and Virtual Clarity. Bluleader will enhance our SAP application capabilities, and Virtual Clarity will strengthen our capabilities in delivering cloud assessments and transformation road maps to our customers.
I have also seen several areas for improvement that DXC needs to address to enable growth. First, our delivery teams were not able to execute the more complicated phase of operational cost improvements. This includes areas like pyramid optimization, the broader deployment of DXC's automation program called Bionix, along with operational excellence leveraging Six Sigma principles. We need to focus more on our people and strengthening our employee value proposition. Our people need to be clear about their career path at DXC, the opportunities to work with new clients and also the opportunities for reskilling and retraining. Being clear about these items will help create an environment where people are acknowledged, recognized and rewarded, which will improve employee satisfaction and increase retention. 
We also need to focus more on selling integrated solutions. We have an opportunity to shift from providing individual services for many of our customers, to integrated industry solutions, leveraging multiple DXC offerings and capabilities.
Next, execution challenges from recent delivery actions have negatively impacted some of our large customers, which results in lower margins, delayed revenue and bookings as customers have placed the additional work on hold. We have recovery plans underway for these accounts, but we need to do a better job running operations. By doing this, we will earn the right to expand our footprint with customers. The current operating model is complex, resulting in unclear accountabilities as well as slow decision-making. We will be simplifying this structure with greater emphasis on our regions and industries. 
Finally, DXC provides mission-critical services to many of our customers, particularly in ITO. But this business has been under-emphasized. We have the opportunity to invest and strengthen this business. Doing this well will provide a foundation of future growth with our existing customers. 
Overall, I believe that each of these points is fixable and we're already on the case. I've made 5 senior hires to augment our leadership team focused on each of these challenges. Mary will focus on our people as our CHRO. Kristin will focus on simplifying our operating model as VP of Corporate Operations. Vinod will focus on Global Delivery Innovation, specifically pyramiding, scaling technology and Six Sigma to deliver enhanced service to our customers as EVP of Global Delivery Transformation. Steve and David will focus on running our accounts to make sure we are listening to the voice of the customer when we are providing services in 2 of our largest regions of the Americas and UKIIMEA. Again, we believe there's an exciting path forward to run this business more effectively while also unlocking value.
On the left side, running the business involves a stronger focus on customers, people and operational execution. On customers, we will invest to stabilize key accounts and assure that our delivery is meeting our clients' expectations. Doing this will ensure that we earn the right to walk the halls and help them with additional work as they think through their strategies. 
On people, we will make investments to acknowledge, recognize and reward our people, which will strengthen our employee value proposition. As I discussed, we have started adding outstanding talent to our DXC leadership team, and we will continue to add in the areas of account management, sales and delivery.
On operational execution, we will invest to enhance delivery. We will simplify the way we work together to drive increased accountability. And going forward, we will also reemphasize our ITO business, which is critical to our success. On the right side of the slide, unlocking value includes a clear outlook, execution of a new strategy as well as evaluating strategic alternatives. We will execute a focused strategy around what I call the enterprise technology stack. We will sell industry solutions and focus on our existing customers. We will also be pursuing strategic alternatives for 3 businesses that do not fit in our focused strategy. These businesses comprise roughly of 25% of our current revenue. Additionally, we will continue to pursue a balanced capital allocation approach while maintaining our investment-grade credit profile. Paul will now cover our second quarter results and update around our second half outlook."

As usual, I'll start by covering some items that are excluded from our non-GAAP results. In the second quarter, we had restructuring costs of $32 million pretax or $0.11 per diluted share primarily related to workforce optimization. Also, in the quarter, we had $53 million pretax or $0.18 per diluted share of integration and transaction-related costs. In the second quarter, amortization of acquired intangible was $151 million pretax or $0.45 per diluted share.
Also, in the quarter, we recorded a goodwill impairment, which was triggered by the decline in our market capitalization. As part of the reconciliation of the balance sheet carrying value of our reported units to market values, we recorded a $2.9 billion noncash impairment charge or $11.10 per diluted share.
During the second quarter, we received $666 million from HPE for the arbitration award related to the capital lease dispute. We excluded $632 million or $2.43 per diluted share from our results, and this represents the damaged portions of the award. In the quarter, we had a $29 million tax adjustment related to a reconciliation of prior restructuring charges specific to a period back in the fiscal '13 or $0.11 per diluted share. Excluding the impact of these special items, our non-GAAP income before taxes from continuing operations was $492 million and our non-GAAP EPS was $1.38. Now this includes $0.10 of benefit from the interest portion of the HPE arbitration award and a $0.04 of expense related to payments made to Mike Lawrie in connection with his retirement. 
Now let me turn to our second quarter results in more detail. Revenue in the second quarter was $4.85 billion on a GAAP basis. All revenue comparisons I'll discuss will be in constant currency. In the second quarter, revenue was down 0.8% year-over-year driven by the impact of continued acceleration of cloud migrations. Digital revenue in the second quarter was $1.51 billion, up 52% year-over-year, including Luxoft and up 30%, excluding Luxoft. Traditional revenue was $2.4 billion, down 18.5%, which was a few points off from what we had anticipated.
Industry IP and BPS revenue was $908 million, up 0.3%. Adjusted EBIT in the quarter was $529 million, and our adjusted EBIT margin was 10.9%. In the quarter, continued delays in our delivery cost actions as well as cost overruns on a few European transformation contracts contributed to lower-than-expected profit performance. In the quarter, our non-GAAP tax rate was 26.4%, reflecting our global mix of income and the benefit of ongoing tax planning initiatives. Book-to-bill in the quarter was 0.8x as we've seen further delays on several large deals. Digital book-to-bill was 1.2x. Traditional book-to-bill was 0.6x. And industry IP and BPS book-to-bill was 0.7x. 
Now let's turn to our segment results. GBS revenue was $2.29 billion, up 10.5% year-over-year. Excluding Luxoft, GBS revenue was up 0.4% year-over-year. GBS segment profit was $359 million and profit margin for that segment was 15.7%. Our GBS margin reflects the investment we're making in hiring and training digital talent as well as the slower pace of cost takeout in complex countries. GBS book-to-bill in the quarter was 0.9x primarily driven by lower-than-expected bookings in industry IP and BPS. 
Our GIS revenue was $2.57 billion, down 9.1% year-over-year. GIS segment profit was $243 million and profit margin was 9.5%. GIS margin reflects the impact of stranded costs related to the decline in our traditional ITO business as well as a slowdown in our delivery cost takeout actions as we work with select customers to improve service. GIS book-to-bill in the quarter was 0.7x, reflecting delayed deals and lower-than-expected conversion of pipeline opportunities. 
Now let me turn to other financial results in the quarter. Adjusted free cash flow in the quarter was $739 million or about 204% of adjusted net income. Now this reflects improved working capital management and expanded use of our receivable facility by $235 million in the quarter. Now this facility is a true sale nonrecourse facility. Our CapEx was $342 million in the quarter or 7.1% of revenue. 
During the quarter, we repurchased $250 million of shares and paid $56 million in dividend. In total, we returned $306 million in capital to our shareholders. We had limited opportunities to repurchase more shares during the quarter because of the CEO transition and an ongoing evaluation of strategic alternatives for several of our businesses. We now expect to be more opportunistic in returning capital to our shareholders, but we will maintain a very close look at our investment credit profile.
Cash at the end of the quarter was $2.9 billion, and at the end of the quarter, our total debt was $9.2 billion and including capitalized leases, so our net debt-to-total-capital ratio was 34.9%.
Now let me turn and provide more details on our new financial targets for the fiscal year. We're now targeting revenue in the range of $19.5 billion to $19.8 billion. This revised revenue guidance is driven by 3 primary factors. First, we had seen additional delays in several large deals that we expected to close during the second quarter, and that was particularly in the Americas and the U.K. We also lost a few deals during the quarter that were previously included in our second half revenue plans, and as a result now, we expect about $275 million less revenue this year.
Second, due to execution at existing customers, we now expect $250 million less revenue this year. $75 million of that amount is due to certain customers placing revenue opportunities on hold. This was due to recent delivery execution issues. Now we have recovery plans underway to improve service levels on these accounts. We also adjusted our revenue outlook by $175 million to reflect potential disruptions given the announcement that we are pursuing strategic alternatives for 3 of our businesses.
Now third, we now expect $100 million less revenue in our traditional infrastructure and application businesses. We're investing in our ITO business to mitigate these declines and capitalize on the pipeline of opportunities, with an aggressive focus on modernization of customer environments. Now the revised revenue outlook of $19.5 billion to $19.8 billion for the year assume a slight increase in the second half revenue compared with the first half. 
Turning to EPS. We're now targeting adjusted EPS in the range of $5.25 to $5.75 per share. Let me cover some of the key drivers of this revised outlook. First, the reduced revenue forecast will translate to roughly $275 million less EBIT for this year or $0.73 per share, including the impact of potential disruptions related to the strategic alternatives announcement. Second, we now expect $170 million less benefit from cost takeout actions this year or $0.47 per share. Now as we move into this more complex phase of operational improvements, including the broader deployment of Bionix, we've seen a need for greater customer engagement as well as more experienced talent, which is impacting the pace of our cost takeout. 
We've also experienced delays in several global initiatives such as delivery center consolidation, maintenance optimization and enterprise license rationalization, and those translate into an additional $0.10 per share in EPS. We continue to believe that these cost actions are achievable, but it is taking longer to execute than we had originally planned. 
Third, we expect $70 million or $0.20 of EPS from higher-than-expected cost overruns on a few large complex customer transformation programs. This is concentrated to a few European contracts, and we expect to resolve this issue -- these issues within this fiscal year. Fourth, our revised EPS outlook includes $100 million or $0.28 per share of additional second half investments to strengthen our operations in core infrastructure services and to augment talent in key areas such as account management and industry sales. This investment also includes our recovery plans on key accounts.
The revised EPS target of $5.25 to $5.75 per share assume a range of $2.13 to $2.63 versus $3.12 in the first half of the year and our EBIT margin between 9.5% and 10.5% for the second half of the year versus the 12.1% in the first half. Our cash flow target for the full year is now 80% or more of adjusted net income, and this reflects more conservative working capital assumptions for the second half as well as the timing of a contract settlement payment that we expect to make this year, but we will recover that amount in fiscal '21 from insurance coverage. 
Now I'll turn back the call to Mike to discuss our strategic priorities and planned actions."

We are clearly not pleased with this revised guidance and the poor execution against our cost plans. We are taking steps to improve our performance with a focus on customers, people and operational execution. We also believe that we will be able to unlock value due to a focused strategy. Going forward, DXC will run as one company focused on the enterprise technology stack versus a traditional business and a digital business. Customers will see 1 DXC, not 2.
To the left of this slide is what I refer to as the enterprise technology stack. The enterprise technology stack mimics the strategic thinking of how our customers view their technology journey and it starts with ITO. This is the foundation, and DXC has an installed base that is second to none. The next level includes cloud with security services, which reflects the fact that customers are buying those services bundled. Moving up the stack, the application layer is critical, where we rationalize and modernize and manage customer workloads. Then we can leverage analytics capabilities to harvest data and ultimately provide engineering services to generate business insights for our customers.
We cannot deliver the technology stack on its own. We have to also provide deep industry expertise, and we will do this by providing integrated industry solutions to our customers. 
Let me share with you some of the feedback I've heard from our customers, which is on the right side of this slide. DXC runs mission-critical systems and operations for our customers. They expect these to be run silently and effectively. Many of our customers need to upgrade these systems and they want to partner with someone they can trust. This trust requires a deep understanding of their environments, with demonstrated experience executing at scale. Also, our customers recognize that not all the workloads are going to migrate to the cloud. They need a provider who can support on-premise assets as well as private and public cloud environments.
Security is also a top concern, and customers expect us to bring deep expertise to them in this area. Our customers are looking to scale their digital capabilities. That includes analytics that produce business insights, and they want to grow with a service provider who has scale. 
Overall, the key message is that DXC is missing opportunities with our customers. We need to show visible reinvestment to strengthen customer confidence, capture these opportunities moving forward and position DXC for growth.
With that in mind, we've conducted a review of our portfolio to understand how well DXC's current businesses align against the enterprise technology stack and our focused strategy. First, I was very pleased to see that DXC has capabilities at scale against each layer of the enterprise technology stack. We have $5.4 billion in ITO revenue, $2.1 billion in cloud and security, $5.4 billion in applications and industry IP and $1.4 billion in data analytics and engineering services, including the Luxoft business, and roughly $500 million of advisory revenue. 
Now I'd like to discuss the outcome of the review of DXC's current businesses. We evaluated each of our businesses against the following criteria: one, importance to the enterprise technology stack; two, the ability to create industry solutions; three, what our customers wanted; and four, the potential to unlock value. Out of that analysis, we decided to pursue strategic alternatives for 3 businesses, the U.S. state and local health and human services business, our horizontal BPS business and our workplace and mobility business. Combined, these businesses represent about 25% of DXC's total revenue. 
These businesses are strong. Our workplace and our U.S. state and local health and human services businesses are market leaders, and we have meaningful IP in our horizontal BPS business. When I say strategic alternatives, that could involve a range of actions to unlock value, including potential divestitures to strategic or financial buyers, a spin-off or other transactions. Throughout this process, we will remain closely engaged with our customers and our people, ensuring we are meeting our commitments to both.
Paul will now provide some color on our longer-term financial expectations based on these plans."

Now excluding those 3 businesses, by fiscal '22, we would expect the company to have more than $15 billion of revenue, with at least half of the revenue coming from digital offerings. We also expect margins to be at 12% or more even after accounting for investments. This margin level is consistent with global industry peers.
We're also taking a conservative view on cash flow conversion while continuing to perform above industry benchmarks. We also assume that we will be able to generate net capital proceeds of roughly $5 billion from these 3 businesses. We expect to deploy $4.25 billion or more to repurchase shares and pay dividends over the next 10 quarters. Now this represents about 50% of our current market cap. We also expect to reduce our debt by more than $2.5 billion as we will continue to pursue a balanced capital allocation approach and protect our investment-grade credit profile, with a target debt-to-EBITDA of 2x or less.
In fiscal '22, we expect at least $7 per share of adjusted EPS and at least $5.25 of EPS after restructuring, transaction and integration costs. This outlook reflects our plan to moderate these costs over the next couple of years. 
I'll now turn the call back to Mike."

So in conclusion, here's why I'm excited to lead DXC at this particular point in time. As someone who has lived in the IT services industry for over 30 years and has seen all the different ways service firms can compete, it's very clear to me that DXC has a unique opportunity due to 3 factors: one, DXC has significant scope and scale, along with mission-critical positions at large customers; two, DXC, in recent history, has reduced its cost structure in an industry where being cost-efficient boosts your ability to compete; three, customers are facing transformation challenges across the enterprise technology stack, and they are in need of DXC's deep ITO capabilities and experience.
Customers need a partner like DXC to help them modernize their ITO layer, optimize their data architectures and make it all secure and orchestrated across the public, private and hybrid clouds. This will now be our main thrust in DXC's focused strategy, to leverage our ITO expertise to help customers across the enterprise technology stack.

And look, the bottom line is the way I see it is we've got a unique position of strength in the ITO layer, all right? We also have unemphasized the ITO. By emphasizing again what I clearly heard from customers and through my industry expertise and experience is that when you deliver for your customers, simply put, you get more business, you get the ability to move up the stack, not just stay in the ITO layer. So what this strategy is all about is an end strategy. It's both digital, along with ITO and applications.
The other thing is, because of this underperformance, what you heard Paul say, is that we've had work put on hold. We've had growth put on hold. And the market's not going away, right? Meaning, I understand that, look, it's decreasing, but we also said and validated that not all the workloads are going to go to the cloud. 70% of today's workloads will continue to be on-prem or in the private clouds in 2023. 
So look, Rod, I put all that together and basically said, look, our focused strategy needs to be around the enterprise technology stack. Anything that is going to lend itself to not allow us to focus on that we should put in the strategic alternative bucket, but the bottom line is the end strategy will help us grow."

So that's basically what the assumptions are on the near term. And we are confident that the outlook that we are putting here is we're going to be able to achieve. In fact, our internal plan actually would be to try to do better than that. That's why you have the pluses that are showing up across that page.

On a net basis, shouldn't we just be talking about investments now in the business, given that you really do have a target of a margin profile that is now in the low double digits and potentially could even be lower? I think investors would probably be okay with that, if it meant a revenue payback that would lead to some inflection. So can you just talk about where we are on a net basis?

And then when I look at operational excellence, I want to make sure we've got an organization that is refining the cost structure, all right, maybe not as cutting as much as we have, all right? 
The second thing is on the investments. The investments are very targeted towards our customers, towards our people and also the operational execution. So when I say that operational execution piece, that's where I'm coming back to building teams and augmenting the capabilities that are here to continue to come after that. I mean I said in my comments that part of the things that I'm excited about is you got to continue to look at that cost structure to compete in this space.

Was it a number of different accounts? Are they going to competitors? I'm just kind of curious around the timing associated with that."

So first of all, look, I mean, when you look at the beginning, I mentioned about our cost profile, right? We were very focused on cost to date in 2020. In terms of the accounts, when you push on that, I don't see the accounts as being widespread, but we're definitely focused on investing in roughly 20, 30 accounts, all right? And I take a different lens on what good looks like. I want these clients, all right, to be very delighted about our service. That's how you get more work. So I sit there and go, ""Look, I want to take a different focus on these things and make sure that assuming we do the ITO layer, we can move up the enterprise stack."" What was your next question?"

This is us looking at our clients, all right, dealing with their movement from the ITO layer to the cloud, all right?

When that happens, the clients obviously aren't happy, okay? And they put us on hold in terms of additional work. 
And like I said in my customer comments, customers want to grow with people they trust, and they've trusted us for years. So the fact that we've deemphasized this business a bit, all right, we've got to get back in there and basically shore up that relationship again, and then that will help us grow. So that's the logic there."
