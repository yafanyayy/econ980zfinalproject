The last 2 to 3 years, we've seen a heavy amount of supply entering many markets across the United States. Statistically, and in particular, if you look at the amount of deliveries that took place since 2017",543,"Okay. Sure. Good morning, Shirley. No question. The last 2 to 3 years, we've seen a heavy amount of supply entering many markets across the United States. Statistically, and in particular, if you look at the amount of deliveries that took place since 2017, which was roughly over $4 billion, last year, just over $5 billion, our view for 2019 is likely to be similar to 2018 deliveries. So if you just look at those 3 years, there's no question there's been a lot of new product that's entered the market. The totality of that is -- and it's -- full view is pretty commanding. It's about 90 million square feet, plus or minus 1,200 to 1,500 properties. So as we've talked over the last few quarters, we've been very transparent around markets that we've see the most impact from all the supply entering. Another part of the delivery and the complexion of these properties is something I talked about last quarter, which not only is it a heavy level of deliveries, but on average, the size of many of these properties are much bigger than they've been historically. So you've got a number of owners out in some of these markets that, frankly, don't have the tools or capabilities to operate them in a traditional way. So I think there's an element of both disappointment and potentially -- and ultimately some level of distress that could come from that as they learn and see the challenges of running these larger properties. So you also asked about, okay, how are you we thinking about the shift. So there's a couple of good things here. One is, first of all, the markets that have seen these delivery levels, many of the markets have actually absorbed the product well, and we've been encouraged by that. It points to the resiliency of the product type itself and the depth of many of those markets, consumer behavior, all those kinds of things. But there's still a number of markets that continue to be impacted. Those include Denver, Dallas, Chicago, Charlotte, where again we have seen this overhang from amount of new supply entering, and we don't see that really changing here in the near term. The good news, however, is there is a lower level of deliveries anticipated going into many of those markets going into 2019. Some of our better markets, again going into 2019, include Boston, Philadelphia, L.A., New York, Atlanta, San Francisco, Orlando. So we do see some additional product coming in to Boston, for instance, New York. And again, we're going to keep our eyes wide open around the potential impact from that additional supply. The good news is the West Coast, outside of Portland, has been pretty resilient to supply additions. And again, we see very good metrics and just overall consumer and customer activity coming to those markets because we have far less in competition. So with all that said, we still feel like we're not out of, again, a heavy supply environment, but on the flip side, we continued to be encouraged by some of the things that we've seen through 2018, particularly in the fourth quarter, and how we're feeling activities kind of playing through as we begin 2019."

We generally like to talk about move-in rates more, just given their -- they have the wheel impact to our revenue as it's what customer actually rent from us. Street rates were down about 1.4% in the quarter. Overall, move-in rates were down about 3.5%, but I think that -- now talking about move-in rates really masked what happened in the fourth quarter. So as we talk about the customer behavior and trends that we saw through the quarter, you really need to talk about move-in and move-out volumes as well. So as we started the fourth quarter, we were down about 110 basis points in occupancy. We closed the quarter positive 20 basis points in occupancy. And so what happened through the fourth quarter -- what we saw were pretty encouraging customer trends throughout the quarter, flat move-in volumes year-over-year which is the best quarter for move-in volumes all year. And so how did we achieve that? A combination of increased advertising spend, where we saw good customer response there, as well as attracting customers with that lower move-in rate that I just highlighted. In addition to that, we benefited from what is a continued trend throughout 2018, and that is consistent sticky existing customers. So lower move-ins, again, in the fourth quarter, which drove the occupancy pickup. So overall, as we sit here today, we were encouraged by customer trends through the fourth quarter that largely holding through the beginning part of the first quarter and, obviously, with the seasonally slow part of the year. So we need to watch how that progresses as we get into the busy season here in the next several months."

What we've discovered throughout the year is the real power of the Public Storage brand online and the reception that we're receiving to that increased spend. So we've been encouraged by that as well and we'll continue to use that tool as we get into 2019. So that was a fourth quarter -- certainly, a decision to drive traffic, and we're continuing to push a little harder on that lever to drive traffic in the first quarter of 2019 as well."

And obviously, we'll update that as we go through the year, but there continues to be pressure there. On-site property manager payroll continues to be another pressure point, with the very tight labor market out there. And certainly, throughout 2018, we've grown some efficiencies while at the same time being able to increase wage rates to attract the right employees at the property level. On down the list, marketing spend, I just touched on. We expect to continue to spend online as our primary tool there to drive traffic, and we did see good response there and we're seeing good response here in the beginning of 2019 as well."

I mean that's been historically, and we would look up on that as the absolute right time to start getting much more aggressive and going out and acquiring properties in an environment where there",651,"Yes. Ronald, to start with the -- your final question, yes. I mean that's been historically, and we would look up on that as the absolute right time to start getting much more aggressive and going out and acquiring properties in an environment where there is an elevated level of stress. What comes with that is the opportunity to buy at much better valuations that we think would potentially be the right time to again start accumulating on a much more aggressive basis. If you look at our acquisition volume, not only for 2018, but the last 2 or 3 years, we've been very disciplined around the price point at which we've decided to go ahead and acquire assets. We found some good values out in the markets but have also shied away from the fogginess that has played through and is, in fact, still part of the market today, where, again, there's a lot of capital that still wants to come in to the sector. There are pro formas out there that we think are not reasonable. I think there's a population of owners that I talked to a moment ago that are starting to see the reality very different than the expected either returns or time lines type of potential lease-up and revenue stabilization on these assets. So for all those reasons, we're prepared and we've got the balance sheet ready, obviously, to go out and be very aggressive when more of those stress starts entering the market. Anecdotally, I would say, there are a few more reverse inquiries coming to us that would include some owners out there that may be now not needing pro forma and are seeing some stress points from either the lenders or maybe some of the partners or, frankly, they're just saying, wow, this is very different than I thought it was going to be and it may be the right time to exit. So we're going to continue to track and look for those kinds of opportunities. What you saw in our quarterly numbers, which is consistent really through obviously 2018, is we've got a very strong and healthy development pipeline. We think that 2 a property, where we're out putting all of our not only internal metrics and everything that we do from studying submarket to submarket. We've got a very good opportunity to continue to deliver brand-new generation pipe product into our own ownership structure, where we can build this kind of product for, say, $120 per square foot, which in today's environment could trade almost on a multiple higher than that. So we are very focused and we pivoted into a vibrant development program, plus or minus 5 years ago. We see a lot of good opportunity there. We have shifted more of our efforts into our own redevelopment as well, where, again, we've got great locations, iconic opportunities to take very well-performing assets and potentially make them even bigger or, again, more profitable ultimately by doing some kind of redevelopment or expansion. So many of the tools and capabilities that we've learned through ground-up development are being applied to our redevelopment portfolio which is again shifting from waiting even more on that spectrum right now. Part of what's driving that, land costs are in many markets, getting more expensive. There is a little bit more cost pressure relative to components of construction, whether it's steel, labor, concrete. So we're keeping a very close on that. But overall, we think that we'll continue to deliver very good returns with the development pipeline that we have ahead of us. And then the properties that we've put in the market over the last 3 or 4 years continue to do very well. They're meeting, if not exceeding, expectations, and we continue to think that's a very appropriate use of our own capital and we're getting very good returns from that strategy."

My last question would be just looking at the end-of-period metrics, the square-foot occupancy.

We're seeing good resiliency, and again with many of the things that we continue to use that are unique to us for 2018, we saw some good traction, particularly in the second half of the year. So sitting here today, we feel like we're in a better place. Now going into moving and busy season, we'll see how that plays through. We're just a few we weeks from that. But all things considered, we feel like in a better place going into that than we were 1 year ago. And we'll continue to see and figure out how to maneuver around the supply that continues to come on to the markets as well. So it's a little bit of a 2-edged sword, but all things considered, we're on balance and we're encouraged."

And I think the only thing -- I'd add a couple of things to that. One is that you have to look back several years to think about where we were in the beginning of the development cycle with occupancies north of 95%. Certainly, watched the last several years, some of that occupancy would be given up in some of the supply impacted markets. And as we look at those markets today, we have been impacted in some areas. We expect to be impacted in others. And so there's more of a put and take around markets where we're seeing some improvement and markets where we're seeing deterioration based on that new supply. I think your question around the period-end math, you did the math right, the 1.3% and the 0.2% gives you 1.5% aggregate contract rent as we go into 2019. As we look at trends, since January 1, as I highlighted earlier on the call, pretty consistent. So occupancy trends have been consistent with that time period or up about 30 basis points in occupancy today. And contract rent continues to be impacted by rent rolldown and existing tenant rate increases, but I think that period-end math you did is right."

That move-in move-out spread that you highlighted of, call it, 16%, did deteriorate. That was a strategy to drive the move-in volume that we achieved during the quarter. So it's hard to talk about rate without volume. So I talked about the move-in volume that we achieved was the best move-in volume that we achieved throughout 2018. And so it's really a combination of both of those factors. But certainly, there is rental rate pressure in many of the markets that Joe highlighted having been impacted by new supply. We're going to see some new markets enter that list and I'm sure that we'll see some rental rate impact in those markets as we get through 2019. So I think the environment there remains a challenging one. But as I said earlier, the flip side of that is our existing tenant base continues to perform very well and move-outs were down on a volume basis. Those sticky customers afford us the ability to send rental rate increases as we get through the busy months here. And so we've been encouraged by those trends. And I think those customers are supported by the macro environment, right? Wage growth, the employment market, things like that are all contributing to the performance and behavior of our existing tenant base."

Smede, what we did in 2017 was put into all of our properties, our Web Champ 2, which we talked about, to some degree, through 2018. So full year 2018, we had Web Champ 2 which again is our customer interface system throughout the entire organization. There's no question based on its design. We were able to optimize labor hours along with training. It's a much more intuitive system. So new employees were able to come into the company on a much more efficient training program. So we saw some good traction there. And I'd say we've got a lot of that work through the system. So there may not be, going into 2019, the same level of our additional benefit. But the great news is, the system itself continues to evolve from a functionality standpoint and efficiency standpoint. It's all built around making the customer experience that much more efficient and timely, coupled with, again, easier to learn, use and adopt by new employees. So a lot of that traction I think went to the system in 2018. The thing that we'll see, which is something Tom has already talked about is the price pressure we're seeing in labor over all is the toughest employment that we've seen well over a decade. So we're looking at many ways to optimize our labor force, the size of it. But at the end of the day, many of our properties fundamentally need that key single person each and every day to run a property. We really can't cut beyond that until we are at a point where we can do something as forward thinking as what you're asking is we can actually -- properties without people. So we're not at that point yet. It's an interesting concept, but that's something clearly downstream that we'll have to take a fair amount of time to figure out how to put any of those kinds of opportunities into the system."

So the offering is very compelling. We've got a backlog that continues to build. Pete and his team are now out much doing outbound efforts. So what has taken place with our entrée into the business, which I think is similar to others over time, is it does take a number of quarters to kind of get a pipeline built because many of the properties that typically come into these programs are being built. So we have a healthy backlog that includes a number of those properties.

That includes a number of enhancements that we're going to be delivering to our existing products. So through our development program over the last few years, we've come up with what we've labeled our generation 5 product that has a number of components and elements that we think are really well suited to go back to our existing assets and basically use it as an opportunity to do a refresh of the physical part of the assets as well as looking at some opportunities to improve from a cost and efficiency standpoint, things like utilities, et cetera. So it includes simple things like paint, which, again we've learned over time and done a lot of testing, that using a dominant amount of orange plays well not only for curb appeal but lines up with a lot of thing things that we do on our online efforts. Simplifying edge, some of the office environments, retooling them to make them much more customer-oriented. We have now a paperless environment with Web Champ 2. So we need fewer filing cabinets and went back and use office space in a very different and efficient way. And then to the efficiency side of the equation, we're doing things, like internal and external LED, upgrading landscaping. So we have less water usage. We are looking at solar. So we're doing some testing on solar as we speak. So there's a number of, I think, meaningful investments that you're going to see as we use really the enhanced capabilities that we've seen and good reaction to our generation 5 product as we've delivered that new product in many markets across the United States now into our existing portfolio. So this year, we're likely to spend plus or minus about $100 million on that effort. It's going to launch in many parts of the West Coast. So when you're out here towards the end of the year, for instance, at NAREIT, we may have an opportunity to actually display and show some of that. Well, a number of you are in town. So we're excited about what kind of traction we're getting from this. We're getting very good reaction from customers and employees, and we're really excited about the overall benefits that we're going to see in the existing portfolio."

Well, when you look at the number of properties within that pool that will be stabilized as of January 1, 2017, and would be appropriate to roll in, and when we make that determination, it will be based on both our occupancy as well as the rental rate and revenue growth associated with those properties as well as cost of operation. So our philosophy is to ensure that those properties that are added are stabilized versus the other properties within the market, within the market where those properties are. I would expect that many of our 2016 acquisitions as well as some of our 2013 to 2015 developments will roll in to the same-store pool. They will be stabilized when we roll them in, and so we won't be talking about any sort of revenue benefit associated with rolling those properties in given the fact that there stabilized when they're rolling in. And there's probably some expansions as well in the 2013 to 2015 period that are in the other categories that will be rolled in. As well as any other category, there are properties impacted by natural disasters, damage, et cetera, that we'll evaluate. So don't have a number for you at this point, but certainly we'll be prepared to talk about that for the first quarter call."

No question, for the last 2 to 3 years, we've seen a heavy amount of supply entering many markets across the United States. Statistically, and in particular, if you look at the amount of deliveries that took place since 2017, which was roughly over $4 billion, last year, just over $5 billion, our view for 2019 is just likely to be similar to 2018 deliveries. So if you just look at those 3 years, there's no question there's been a lot of new product that's entered the market. The totality of that is -- and its full view is pretty commanding. It's about 90 million square feet, plus or minus 1,200 to 1,500 properties. So as we've talked over the last few quarters, we've been very transparent around the markets that we've seen the most impact from all the supply entering. Another part of the delivery and the complexion of these properties is something I talked about last quarter, which not only is it a heavy level of deliveries, but on average, the size of many of these properties are much bigger than they've been historically. So you've got a number of owners out in some of these markets that frankly don't have the tools or capabilities to operate them in a traditional way. So I think there's an element of both disappointment and potentially -- and ultimately some level of distress that could come from that as they learn and see the challenges of running these larger properties. So you also asked about, okay, how are we thinking about the shift. So there's a couple of good things here. One is, first of all, the markets that have seen these delivery levels, many of the markets have actually absorbed the product well, and we've been encouraged by that. It points to the resiliency of the product type itself and the depth of many of those markets, consumer behavior, all those kinds of things. But there's still a number of markets that continue to be impacted. Those include Denver, Dallas, Chicago, Charlotte, where, again, we have seen this overhang from the amount of new supply entering, and we don't see that really changing here in the near term. The good news, however, is there is a lower level of deliveries anticipated going into many of those markets going into 2019. Some of our better markets, again going into 2019, include Boston, Philadelphia, L.A., New York, Atlanta, San Francisco, Orlando. So we do see some additional product coming into Boston, for instance, New York. And again, we're going to keep our eyes wide open around the potential impact from that additional supply. The good news is the West Coast, outside of Portland, has been pretty resilient to supply additions. And again, we see very good metrics and just overall consumer and customer activity coming to those markets because we have far less new competition. So with all that said, we still feel like we're not out of, again, a heavy supply environment, but on the flip side, we continue to be encouraged by some of the things that we've seen through 2018, particularly in the fourth quarter, and how we're feeling activities kind of playing through as we begin 2019."

We generally like to talk about move-in rates more, just given their -- they have the real impact to our revenue as it's what customers actually rent from us. Street rates were down about 1.4% in the quarter. Overall, move-in rates were down about 3.5%, but I think that talking about move-in rates really masked what happened in the fourth quarter, so as we talk about the customer behavior and trends that we saw through the quarter, you really need to talk about move-in and move-out volumes as well. So as we started the fourth quarter, we were down about 110 basis points in occupancy. We closed the quarter positive 20 basis points in occupancy. And so what happened through the fourth quarter, what we saw were pretty encouraging customer trends throughout the quarter, flat move-in volumes year-over-year, which is the best quarter for move-in volumes all year. And so how did we achieve that, a combination of increased advertising spend, where we saw good customer response there, as well as attracting customers with that lower move-in rate that I just highlighted. In addition to that, we benefited from what is a continued trend throughout 2018, and that is consistent sticky existing customers. So lower move-ins, again, in the fourth quarter, which drove the occupancy pickup. So overall, as we sit here today, we were encouraged by customer trends through the fourth quarter that are largely holding through the beginning part of the first quarter, and obviously, we're at the seasonally slow part of the year. So we'll need to watch how that progresses as we get into the busy season here in the next several months."

And obviously, we'll update that as we go through the year, but there continues to be pressure there.

And certainly, throughout 2018, we'll grow some efficiencies, while, at the same time, being able to increase wage rates to attract the right employees at the property level.

We expect to continue to spend online as our primary tool there to drive traffic, and we did see good response there and we're seeing a good response here in the beginning of 2019 as well."

Ronald, to start with the -- your final question, yes, I mean, that's been historically, and we would look upon that as the absolute right time to start getting much more aggressive and going out and acquiring properties in an environment where there is an elevated level of stress. What comes with that is the opportunity to buy at much better valuations that we think would potentially be the right time to again start accumulating on a much more aggressive basis. If you look at our acquisition volume, not only for 2018, but the last 2 or 3 years, we've been very disciplined around the price point at which we've decided to go ahead and acquire assets. We found some good values out in the markets, but have also shied away from the frothiness that has played through and is, in fact, still part of the market today, where, again, there's a lot of capital that still wants to come into the sector. There are pro formas out there that we think are not reasonable. I think there's a population of owners that I talked to a moment ago that are starting to see the reality very different than the expected, either returns or time lines, tied to potential lease-up and revenue stabilization on these assets. So for all those reasons, we're prepared and we've got the balance sheet ready, obviously, to go out and be very aggressive when more of that stress starts entering the market. Anecdotally, I would say, there are a few more reverse inquiries coming to us that would include some owners out there that may be now not needing pro forma and are seeing some stress points from either the lenders or maybe some of the partners or frankly are just saying, wow, this is very different than I thought it was going to be and it may be the right time to exit. So we're going to continue to track and look for those kinds of opportunities. What you saw in our quarterly numbers, which is consistent really through, obviously, 2018, is we've got a very strong and healthy development pipeline. We think that to a property, where we're out putting all of our, not only internal metrics and everything that we do from studying submarket to submarket, we've got a very good opportunity to continue to deliver brand-new generation-type product into our own ownership structure, where we can build this kind of product for, say, $120 a square foot, which, in today's environment, could trade almost on a multiple higher than that. So we are very focused and we pivoted into a vibrant development program, plus or minus 5 years ago. We see a lot of good opportunity there. We have shifted more of our efforts into our own redevelopment as well, where, again, we've got great locations, iconic opportunities to take very well-performing assets and potentially make them even bigger or again, more profitable, ultimately, by doing some kind of either redevelopment or expansion. So many of the tools and capabilities that we've learned through ground-up development are being applied to our redevelopment portfolio, which is again shifting from awaiting even more on that spectrum right now. Part of what's driving that, land costs are, in many markets, getting more expensive. There is a little bit more cost pressure relative to components of construction, whether it's steel, labor, concrete. So we're keeping a very close eye on that. But overall, we think that we'll continue to deliver very good returns with the development pipeline that we have ahead of us. And then the properties that we've put in, in the market over the last 3 or 4 years continue to do very well. They're meeting, if not exceeding expectations, and we continue to think that's a very appropriate use of our own capital and we're getting very good returns from that strategy."

We're seeing good resiliency, and again, with many of the things that we continue to use that are unique to us for 2018, we saw some good traction, particularly in the second half of the year. So sitting here today, we feel like we're in a better place. Now going into moving and busy season, we'll see how that plays through. We're just a few weeks from that. But all things considered, we feel like we're in a better place going into that than we were a year ago. And we'll continue to see and figure out how to maneuver around the supply that continues to come onto the markets as well.

And I think the only thing -- I'd add a couple of things to that. One is that you have to look back several years to think about where we were at the beginning of the development cycle with occupancies north of 95%. Certainly watched in the last several years some of that occupancy be given up in some of the supply-impacted markets. And as we look at those markets today, we have been impacted in some areas. We expect to be impacted in others. And so there's more of a put and take around markets where we're seeing some improvement and markets where we're seeing deterioration based on that new supply. I think your question around the period-end math, you did the math right. The 1.3% and the 0.2% gives you 1.5% aggregate contract rent as we go into 2019. As we look at trends, since January 1, as I highlighted earlier on the call, pretty consistent. So occupancy trends have been consistent with that time period. We're up about 30 basis points in occupancy today. And contract rent continues to be impacted by rent roll-down and existing tenant rate increases, but I think that period-end math you did is right."

That move-in, move-out spread that you highlighted of, call it, 16%, did deteriorate. That was a strategy to drive the move-in volume that we achieved during the quarter. So it's hard to talk about rate without volume. So I talked about the move-in volume that we achieved was the best move-in volume that we achieved throughout 2018. And so it's really a combination of both of those factors. But certainly, the -- there is rental rate pressure in many of the markets that Joe highlighted to having been impacted by new supply. We're going to see some new markets enter that list, and I'm sure that we'll see some rental rate impact in those markets as we get through 2019. So I think the environment there remains a challenging one. But as I said earlier, the flip side of that is our existing tenant base continues to perform very well and move-outs were down on a volume basis. And those sticky customers afford us the ability to send rental rate increases as we get through the busy months here, and so we've been encouraged by those trends. And I think those customers are supported by the macro environment, right? Wage growth, the employment market, things like that are all contributing to the performance and behavior of our existing tenant base."

So full year 2018, we had Web Champ 2, which, again, is our customer interface system, throughout the entire organization. There's no question, based on its design, we were able to optimize labor hours, along with training. It's a much more intuitive system. So new employees were able to come into the company on a much more efficient training program. So we saw some good traction there. And I'd say we've got a lot of that work through the system. So there may not be, going into 2019, the same level of additional benefit. But the great news is the system itself continues to evolve from a functionality standpoint and efficiency standpoint. It's all built around making the customer experience that much more efficient and timely, coupled with, again, easier to learn, use and adopt by new employees. So a lot of that traction, I think, went through the system in 2018. The thing that we'll see, which is something Tom has already talked about, is the price pressure we're seeing in labor overall is the toughest employment arena that we've seen in well over a decade. So we're looking at many ways to optimize our labor force, the size of it. But at the end of the day, many of our properties fundamentally need that key single person each and every day to run a property. And we really can't cut beyond that until we are at a point where we can do something as forward-thinking as what you're asking, is we can actually run properties without people. So we're not at that point yet. It's an interesting concept. But that's something clearly downstream that we'll have to take a fair amount of time to figure out how to put any of those kinds of opportunities into the system."

And so short answer is we've kind of lapped that differential and the period-end is as close to 2019 as you're going to get. And so I would point you to that as an indicator to look towards."

That includes a number of enhancements that we're going to be delivering to our existing products. So through our development program over the last few years, we've come up with what we've labeled our generation 5 product that has a number of components and elements that we think are really well-suited to go back to our existing assets and basically use it as an opportunity to do a refresh of the physical part of the assets as well as looking at some opportunities to improve from a cost and efficiency standpoint, things like utilities, et cetera. So it includes simple things like paint, which, again, we've learned over time and done a lot of testing, that using a dominant amount of orange plays well not only for curb appeal, but lines up with a lot of things that we do on our online efforts, simple signage, some of the office environments, retooling them to make them much more customer-oriented. We have now a paperless environment with Web Champ 2. So we need fewer filing cabinets and with that, can use office space in a very different and more efficient way. And then to the efficiency side of the equation, we're doing things like internal and external LED, upgrading landscaping, so we have less water usage. We are looking at solar, so we're doing some testing on solar as we speak. So there's a number of, I think, meaningful investments that you're going to see as we use really the enhanced capabilities that we've seen and good reaction to our generation 5 product as we've delivered that new product in many markets across the United States, now into our existing portfolio. So this year, we're likely to spend, plus or minus, about $100 million on that effort. It's going to launch in many parts of the West Coast. So when you're out here towards the end of the year, for instance, at NAREIT, we may have an opportunity to actually display and show some of that while a number of you are in town. So we're excited about what kind of traction that we're getting from this. We're getting very good reaction from customers and employees. And we're really excited about the overall benefits that we're going to see in the existing portfolio."

I would expect that many of our 2016 acquisitions as well as some of our 2013 to 2015 developments will roll into the same-store pool. They will be stabilized when we roll them in, and so we won't be talking about any sort of revenue benefit associated with rolling those properties in, given the fact that they're stabilized when they're going in. And there's probably some expansions as well in the 2013 to 2015 period that are in the other categories that will be rolled in as well as in the other category, there are properties impacted by natural disasters, damage, et cetera, that we'll evaluate.

No question, for the last 2 to 3 years, we've seen a heavy amount of supply entering many markets across the United States. Statistically, and in particular, if you look at the amount of deliveries that took place since",544,"Okay. Sure. Good morning, Shirley. No question, for the last 2 to 3 years, we've seen a heavy amount of supply entering many markets across the United States. Statistically, and in particular, if you look at the amount of deliveries that took place since 2017, which was roughly over $4 billion, last year, just over $5 billion, our view for 2019 is it's likely to be similar to 2018 deliveries. So if you just look at those 3 years, there's no question there's been a lot of new product that's entered the market. The totality of that is -- and its full view is pretty commanding. It's about 90 million square feet, plus or minus 1,200 to 1,500 properties. So as we've talked over the last few quarters, we've been very transparent around the markets that we've seen the most impact from all the supply entering. Another part of the delivery and the complexion of these properties is something I talked about last quarter, which not only is it a heavy level of deliveries, but on average, the size of many of these properties are much bigger than they've been historically. So you've got a number of owners out in some of these markets that frankly don't have the tools or capabilities to operate them in a traditional way. So I think there's an element of both disappointment and potentially -- and ultimately some level of distress that could come from that as they learn and see the challenges of running these larger properties. So you also asked about, okay, how are we thinking about the shift. So there's a couple of good things here. One is, first of all, the markets that have seen these delivery levels, many of the markets have actually absorbed the product well, and we've been encouraged by that. It points to the resiliency of the product type itself and the depth of many of those markets, consumer behavior, all those kinds of things. But there's still a number of markets that continue to be impacted. Those include Denver, Dallas, Chicago, Charlotte, where, again, we have seen this overhang from the amount of new supply entering, and we don't see that really changing here in the near term. The good news, however, is there is a lower level of deliveries anticipated going into many of those markets going into 2019. Some of our better markets, again going into 2019, include Boston, Philadelphia, L.A., New York, Atlanta, San Francisco, Orlando. So we do see some additional product coming into Boston, for instance, New York. And again, we're going to keep our eyes wide open around the potential impact from that additional supply. The good news is the West Coast, outside of Portland, has been pretty resilient to supply additions. And again, we see very good metrics and just overall consumer and customer activity coming to those markets because we have far less new competition. So with all that said, we still feel like we're not out of, again, a heavy supply environment, but on the flip side, we continue to be encouraged by some of the things that we've seen through 2018, particularly in the fourth quarter, and how we're feeling activities kind of playing through as we begin 2019."

We generally like to talk about move-in rates more, just given their -- they have the real impact to our revenue as it's what customers actually rent from us. Street rates were down about 1.4% in the quarter. Overall, move-in rates were down about 3.5%, but I think that talking about move-in rates really masked what happened in the fourth quarter, so as we talk about the customer behavior and trends that we saw through the quarter, you really need to talk about move-in and move-out volumes as well. So as we started the fourth quarter, we were down about 110 basis points in occupancy. We closed the quarter positive 20 basis points in occupancy. And so what happened through the fourth quarter, what we saw were pretty encouraging customer trends throughout the quarter, flat move-in volumes year-over-year, which is the best quarter for move-in volumes all year. And so how did we achieve that? A combination of increased advertising spend, where we saw good customer response there, as well as attracting customers with that lower move-in rate that I just highlighted. In addition to that, we benefited from what is a continued trend throughout 2018, and that is consistent sticky existing customers. So lower move-ins, again, in the fourth quarter, which drove the occupancy pickup. So overall, as we sit here today, we were encouraged by customer trends through the fourth quarter that are largely holding through the beginning part of the first quarter, and obviously, we're at the seasonally slow part of the year. So we'll need to watch how that progresses as we get into the busy season here in the next several months."

And obviously, we'll update that as we go through the year, but there continues to be pressure there. On-site property manager payroll continues to be another pressure point, with the very tight labor market out there. And certainly, throughout 2018, we'll grow some efficiencies, while, at the same time, being able to increase wage rates to attract the right employees at the property level.

Ronald, to start with the -- your final question, yes, I mean, that's been historically, and we would look upon that as the absolute right time to start getting much more aggressive and going out and acquiring properties in an environment where there is an elevated level of stress. What comes with that is the opportunity to buy at much better valuations that we think would potentially be the right time to again start accumulating on a much more aggressive basis. If you look at our acquisition volume, not only for 2018, but the last 2 or 3 years, we've been very disciplined around the price point at which we've decided to go ahead and acquire assets. We found some good values out in the markets, but have also shied away from the frothiness that has played through and is, in fact, still part of the market today, where, again, there's a lot of capital that still wants to come into the sector. There are pro formas out there that we think are not reasonable. I think there's a population of owners that I talked to a moment ago that are starting to see the reality very different than the expected, either returns or time lines, tied to potential lease-up and revenue stabilization on these assets. So for all those reasons, we're prepared and we've got the balance sheet ready, obviously, to go out and be very aggressive when more of that stress starts entering the market. Anecdotally, I would say, there are a few more reverse inquiries coming to us that would include some owners out there that may be now not needing pro forma and are seeing some stress points from either their lenders or maybe some of their partners or frankly are just saying, wow, this is very different than I thought it was going to be and it may be the right time to exit. So we're going to continue to track and look for those kinds of opportunities. What you saw in our quarterly numbers, which is consistent really through, obviously, 2018, is we've got a very strong and healthy development pipeline. We think that to a property, where we're out putting all of our, not only internal metrics and everything that we do from studying submarket to submarket, we've got a very good opportunity to continue to deliver brand-new generation-type product into our own ownership structure, where we can build this kind of product for, say, $120 a square foot, which, in today's environment, could trade almost on a multiple higher than that. So we are very focused and we pivoted into a vibrant development program, plus or minus 5 years ago. We see a lot of good opportunity there. We have shifted more of our efforts into our own redevelopment as well, where, again, we've got great locations, iconic opportunities to take very well-performing assets and potentially make them even bigger or again, more profitable, ultimately, by doing some kind of either redevelopment or expansion. So many of the tools and capabilities that we've learned through ground-up development are being applied to our redevelopment portfolio, which is again shifting from awaiting even more on that spectrum right now. Part of what's driving that, land costs are, in many markets, getting more expensive. There is a little bit more cost pressure relative to components of construction, whether it's steel, labor, concrete. So we're keeping a very close eye on that. But overall, we think that we'll continue to deliver very good returns with the development pipeline that we have ahead of us. And then the properties that we've put in, in the market over the last 3 or 4 years continue to do very well. They're meeting, if not exceeding expectations, and we continue to think that's a very appropriate use of our own capital and we're getting very good returns from that strategy."

But sitting here today compared to where we were a year ago, I would say that, yes, we have an outlook that's shifted to be more encouraged around many of the things that we're seeing, which include, again, the resiliency and the sector at large, the product type and the way it, as we know, behaves from a lease-up, fill-up standpoint. We're seeing good resiliency, and again, with many of the things that we continue to use that are unique to us for 2018, we saw some good traction, particularly in the second half of the year. So sitting here today, we feel like we're in a better place. Now going into moving and busy season, we'll see how that plays through. We're just a few weeks from that. But all things considered, we feel like we're in a better place going into that than we were a year ago. And we'll continue to see and figure out how to maneuver around the supply that continues to come onto the markets as well. So it's a little bit of a 2-edged sword, but all things considered, we're on balance, feeling more encouraged."

And I think the only thing -- I'd add a couple of things to that. One is that you have to look back several years to think about where we were at the beginning of the development cycle with occupancies north of 95%. Certainly watched in the last several years some of that occupancy be given up in some of the supply-impacted markets. And as we look at those markets today, we have been impacted in some areas. We expect to be impacted in others. And so there's more of a put and take around markets where we're seeing some improvement and markets where we're seeing deterioration based on that new supply. I think your question around the period-end math, you did the math right. The 1.3% and the 0.2% gives you 1.5% aggregate contract rent as we go into 2019. As we look at trends, since January 1, as I highlighted earlier on the call, pretty consistent. So occupancy trends have been consistent with that time period. We're up about 30 basis points in occupancy today. And contract rent continues to be impacted by rent roll-down and existing tenant rate increases, but I think that period-end math you did is right."

That move-in, move-out spread that you highlighted of, call it, 16%, did deteriorate. That was a strategy to drive the move-in volume that we achieved during the quarter. So it's hard to talk about rate without volume. So I talked about the move-in volume that we achieved was the best move-in volume that we achieved throughout 2018. And so it's really a combination of both of those factors. But certainly, the -- there is rental rate pressure in many of the markets that Joe highlighted having been impacted by new supply. We're going to see some new markets enter that list, and I'm sure that we'll see some rental rate impact in those markets as we get through 2019. So I think the environment there remains a challenging one. But as I said earlier, the flip side of that is our existing tenant base continues to perform very well and move-outs were down on a volume basis. And those sticky customers afford us the ability to send rental rate increases as we get through the busy months here, and so we've been encouraged by those trends. And I think those customers are supported by the macro environment, right? Wage growth, the employment market, things like that are all contributing to the performance and behavior of our existing tenant base."

So full year 2018, we had Web Champ 2, which, again, is our customer interface system, throughout the entire organization. There's no question, based on its design, we were able to optimize labor hours, along with training. It's a much more intuitive system. So new employees were able to come into the company on a much more efficient training program. So we saw some good traction there. And I'd say we've got a lot of that work through the system. So there may not be, going into 2019, the same level of additional benefit. But the great news is the system itself continues to evolve from a functionality standpoint and efficiency standpoint. It's all built around making the customer experience that much more efficient and timely, coupled with, again, easier to learn, use and adopt by new employees. So a lot of that traction, I think, went through the system in 2018. The thing that we'll see, which is something Tom has already talked about, is the price pressure we're seeing in labor overall is the toughest employment arena that we've seen in well over a decade. So we're looking at many ways to optimize our labor force, the size of it. But at the end of the day, many of our properties fundamentally need that key single person each and every day to run a property. And we really can't cut beyond that until we are at a point where we can do something as forward-thinking as what you're asking, is we can actually run properties without people. So we're not at that point yet. It's an interesting concept. But that's something clearly downstream that we'll have to take a fair amount of time to figure out how to put any of those kinds of opportunities into the system."

So what has taken place with our entree into the business, which I think is similar maybe to others over time, is it does take a number of quarters to kind of get a pipeline built because many of the properties that typically come into these programs are being built.

And so the period-end trend, particularly for the fourth quarter, given the fact that we increased occupancy on a year-over-year basis throughout the quarter, period-end is a better metric to look at than average.

So it's primarily driven by an initiative that we did a lot of testing on through 2018 that includes a number of enhancements that we're going to be delivering to our existing products. So through our development program over the last few years, we've come up with what we've labeled our generation 5 product that has a number of components and elements that we think are really well-suited to go back to our existing assets and basically use it as an opportunity to do a refresh of the physical part of the assets as well as looking at some opportunities to improve from a cost and efficiency standpoint, things like utilities, et cetera. So it includes simple things like paint, which, again, we've learned over time and done a lot of testing, that using a dominant amount of orange plays well not only for curb appeal, but lines up with a lot of things that we do on our online efforts, simple signage, some of the office environments, retooling them to make them much more customer-oriented. We have now a paperless environment with Web Champ 2. So we need fewer filing cabinets and with that, can use office space in a very different and more efficient way. And then to the efficiency side of the equation, we're doing things like internal and external LED, upgrading landscaping, so we have less water usage. We are looking at solar, so we're doing some testing on solar as we speak. So there's a number of, I think, meaningful investments that you're going to see as we use really the enhanced capabilities that we've seen and good reaction to our generation 5 product as we've delivered that new product in many markets across the United States, now into our existing portfolio. So this year, we're likely to spend, plus or minus, about $100 million on that effort. It's going to launch in many parts of the West Coast. So when you're out here towards the end of the year, for instance, at Nareit, we may have an opportunity to actually display and show some of that while a number of you are in town. So we're excited about what kind of traction that we're getting from this. We're getting very good reaction from customers and employees. And we're really excited about the overall benefits that we're going to see in the existing portfolio."

And when we'll make that determination, it will be based on both their occupancy as well as the rental rate and revenue growth associated with those properties as well as cost of operation. So our philosophy is to ensure that those properties that are added are stabilized versus the other properties within the market and within the market where that -- those properties are. I would expect that many of our 2016 acquisitions as well as some of our 2013 to 2015 developments will roll into the same-store pool. They will be stabilized when we roll them in, and so we won't be talking about any sort of revenue benefit associated with rolling those properties in, given the fact that they're stabilized when they're going in. And there's probably some expansions as well in the 2013 to 2015 period that are in the other category that will be rolled in as well as in the other category, there are properties impacted by natural disasters, damage, et cetera, that we'll evaluate. So I don't have a number for you at this point, but certainly, we'll be prepared to talk about that for the first quarter call."

No question, for the last 2 to 3 years, we've seen a heavy amount of supply entering many markets across the United States. Statistically, and in particular, if you look at the amount of deliveries that took place since",544,"Okay. Sure. Good morning, Shirley. No question, for the last 2 to 3 years, we've seen a heavy amount of supply entering many markets across the United States. Statistically, and in particular, if you look at the amount of deliveries that took place since 2017, which was roughly over $4 billion, last year, just over $5 billion, our view for 2019 is it's likely to be similar to 2018 deliveries. So if you just look at those 3 years, there's no question there's been a lot of new product that's entered the market. The totality of that is -- and its full view is pretty commanding. It's about 90 million square feet, plus or minus 1,200 to 1,500 properties. So as we've talked over the last few quarters, we've been very transparent around the markets that we've seen the most impact from all the supply entering. Another part of the delivery and the complexion of these properties is something I talked about last quarter, which not only is it a heavy level of deliveries, but on average, the size of many of these properties are much bigger than they've been historically. So you've got a number of owners out in some of these markets that frankly don't have the tools or capabilities to operate them in a traditional way. So I think there's an element of both disappointment and potentially -- and ultimately some level of distress that could come from that as they learn and see the challenges of running these larger properties. So you also asked about, okay, how are we thinking about the shift. So there's a couple of good things here. One is, first of all, the markets that have seen these delivery levels, many of the markets have actually absorbed the product well, and we've been encouraged by that. It points to the resiliency of the product type itself and the depth of many of those markets, consumer behavior, all those kinds of things. But there's still a number of markets that continue to be impacted. Those include Denver, Dallas, Chicago, Charlotte, where, again, we have seen this overhang from the amount of new supply entering, and we don't see that really changing here in the near term. The good news, however, is there is a lower level of deliveries anticipated going into many of those markets going into 2019. Some of our better markets, again going into 2019, include Boston, Philadelphia, L.A., New York, Atlanta, San Francisco, Orlando. So we do see some additional product coming into Boston, for instance, New York. And again, we're going to keep our eyes wide open around the potential impact from that additional supply. The good news is the West Coast, outside of Portland, has been pretty resilient to supply additions. And again, we see very good metrics and just overall consumer and customer activity coming to those markets because we have far less new competition. So with all that said, we still feel like we're not out of, again, a heavy supply environment, but on the flip side, we continue to be encouraged by some of the things that we've seen through 2018, particularly in the fourth quarter, and how we're feeling activities kind of playing through as we begin 2019."

We generally like to talk about move-in rates more, just given their -- they have the real impact to our revenue as it's what customers actually rent from us.

We generally like to talk about move-in rates more, just given their -- they have the real impact to our revenue as it's what customers actually rent from us. Street rates were down about 1.4% in the quarter. Overall, move-in rates were down about 3.5%, but I think that talking about move-in rates really masked what happened in the fourth quarter, so as we talk about the customer behavior and trends that we saw through the quarter, you really need to talk about move-in and move-out volumes as well. So as we started the fourth quarter, we were down about 110 basis points in occupancy. We closed the quarter positive 20 basis points in occupancy. And so what happened through the fourth quarter, what we saw were pretty encouraging customer trends throughout the quarter, flat move-in volumes year-over-year, which is the best quarter for move-in volumes all year. And so how did we achieve that? A combination of increased advertising spend, where we saw good customer response there as well as attracting customers with that lower move-in rate that I just highlighted. In addition to that, we benefited from what is a continued trend throughout 2018, and that is consistent sticky existing customers. So lower move-ins, again, in the fourth quarter, which drove the occupancy pickup. So overall, as we sit here today, we were encouraged by customer trends through the fourth quarter that are largely holding through the beginning part of the first quarter, and obviously, we're at the seasonally slow part of the year. So we'll need to watch how that progresses as we get into the busy season here in the next several months."

Ronald, to start with the -- your final question, yes, I mean, that's been historically, and we would look upon that as the absolute right time to start getting much more aggressive and going out and acquiring properties in an environment where there is an elevated level of stress. What comes with that is the opportunity to buy at much better valuations that we think would potentially be the right time to again start accumulating on a much more aggressive basis. If you look at our acquisition volume, not only for 2018, but the last 2 or 3 years, we've been very disciplined around the price point at which we've decided to go ahead and acquire assets. We found some good values out in the markets, but have also shied away from the frothiness that has played through and is, in fact, still part of the market today, where, again, there's a lot of capital that still wants to come into the sector. There are pro formas out there that we think are not reasonable. I think there's a population of owners that I talked to a moment ago that are starting to see the reality very different than the expected, either returns or time lines, tied to potential lease-up and revenue stabilization on these assets. So for all those reasons, we're prepared and we've got the balance sheet ready, obviously, to go out and be very aggressive when more of that stress starts entering the market. Anecdotally, I would say, there are a few more reverse inquiries coming to us that would include some owners out there that may be now not needing pro forma and are seeing some stress points from either their lenders or maybe some of their partners or frankly are just saying, wow, this is very different than I thought it was going to be and it may be the right time to exit. So we're going to continue to track and look for those kinds of opportunities. What you saw in our quarterly numbers, which is consistent really through, obviously, 2018, is we've got a very strong and healthy development pipeline. We think that to a property, where we're out putting all of our, not only internal metrics and everything that we do from studying submarket to submarket, we've got a very good opportunity to continue to deliver brand-new generation-type product into our own ownership structure, where we can build this kind of product for, say, $120 a square foot, which, in today's environment, could trade almost on a multiple higher than that. So we are very focused and we pivoted into a vibrant development program, plus or minus 5 years ago. We see a lot of good opportunity there. We have shifted more of our efforts into our own redevelopment as well, where, again, we've got great locations, iconic opportunities to take very well-performing assets and potentially make them even bigger or again, more profitable, ultimately, by doing some kind of either redevelopment or expansion. So many of the tools and capabilities that we've learned through ground-up development are being applied to our redevelopment portfolio, which is again shifting from awaiting even more on that spectrum right now. Part of what's driving that, land costs are, in many markets, getting more expensive. There is a little bit more cost pressure relative to components of construction, whether it's steel, labor, concrete. So we're keeping a very close eye on that. But overall, we think that we'll continue to deliver very good returns with the development pipeline that we have ahead of us. And then the properties that we've put in, in the market over the last 3 or 4 years continue to do very well. They're meeting, if not exceeding expectations, and we continue to think that's a very appropriate use of our own capital and we're getting very good returns from that strategy."

But sitting here today compared to where we were a year ago, I would say that, yes, we have an outlook that's shifted to be more encouraged around many of the things that we're seeing, which include, again, the resiliency and the sector at large, the product type and the way it, as we know, behaves from a lease-up, fill-up standpoint. We're seeing good resiliency, and again, with many of the things that we continue to use that are unique to us for 2018, we saw some good traction, particularly in the second half of the year. So sitting here today, we feel like we're in a better place. Now going into moving and busy season, we'll see how that plays through. We're just a few weeks from that. But all things considered, we feel like we're in a better place going into that than we were a year ago. And we'll continue to see and figure out how to maneuver around the supply that continues to come onto the markets as well. So it's a little bit of a 2-edged sword, but all things considered, we're on balance, feeling more encouraged."

And I think the only thing -- I'd add a couple of things to that. One is that you have to look back several years to think about where we were at the beginning of the development cycle with occupancies north of 95%. Certainly watched in the last several years some of that occupancy be given up in some of the supply-impacted markets. And as we look at those markets today, we have been impacted in some areas. We expect to be impacted in others. And so there's more of a put and take around markets where we're seeing some improvement and markets where we're seeing deterioration based on that new supply. I think your question around the period-end math, you did the math right. The 1.3% and the 0.2% gives you 1.5% aggregate contract rent as we go into 2019. As we look at trends, since January 1, as I highlighted earlier on the call, pretty consistent. So occupancy trends have been consistent with that time period. We're up about 30 basis points in occupancy today. And contract rent continues to be impacted by rent roll-down and existing tenant rate increases, but I think that period-end math you did is right."

And then can you talk about how much that spread contributes to revenue growth and how we should sort of think about that spread?"

That move-in, move-out spread that you highlighted of, call it, 16%, did deteriorate. That was a strategy to drive the move-in volume that we achieved during the quarter. So it's hard to talk about rate without volume. So I talked about the move-in volume that we achieved was the best move-in volume that we achieved throughout 2018. And so it's really a combination of both of those factors. But certainly, the -- there is rental rate pressure in many of the markets that Joe highlighted having been impacted by new supply. We're going to see some new markets enter that list, and I'm sure that we'll see some rental rate impact in those markets as we get through 2019. So I think the environment there remains a challenging one. But as I said earlier, the flip side of that is our existing tenant base continues to perform very well and move-outs were down on a volume basis. And those sticky customers afford us the ability to send rental rate increases as we get through the busy months here, and so we've been encouraged by those trends. And I think those customers are supported by the macro environment, right? Wage growth, the employment market, things like that are all contributing to the performance and behavior of our existing tenant base."

So full year 2018, we had Web Champ 2, which, again, is our customer interface system, throughout the entire organization. There's no question, based on its design, we were able to optimize labor hours, along with training. It's a much more intuitive system. So new employees were able to come into the company on a much more efficient training program. So we saw some good traction there. And I'd say we've got a lot of that work through the system. So there may not be, going into 2019, the same level of additional benefit. But the great news is the system itself continues to evolve from a functionality standpoint and efficiency standpoint. It's all built around making the customer experience that much more efficient and timely, coupled with, again, easier to learn, use and adopt by new employees. So a lot of that traction, I think, went through the system in 2018. The thing that we'll see, which is something Tom has already talked about, is the price pressure we're seeing in labor overall is the toughest employment arena that we've seen in well over a decade. So we're looking at many ways to optimize our labor force, the size of it. But at the end of the day, many of our properties fundamentally need that key single person each and every day to run a property. And we really can't cut beyond that until we are at a point where we can do something as forward-thinking as what you're asking, is we can actually run properties without people. So we're not at that point yet. It's an interesting concept. But that's something clearly downstream that we'll have to take a fair amount of time to figure out how to put any of those kinds of opportunities into the system."

So for the most part, more share is better. One of the things that we continually look for are opportunities through our own ownership and now through our third-party management platform to grow that scale. And the scale comes through and can be very advantageous in a number of ways, not only physical presence, but obviously, all the tools that we're using in today's world relative to our marketing tactics, so the Internet, et cetera. So we constantly look for ways to optimize our share. Let's put it that way. But we do enjoy the fact that as the largest operator by a meaningful factor and across the United States and literally almost every metropolitan market, we see a lot of inherent benefits to that."

So the -- if you look at our program, we literally announced our entree into the third-party management business exactly a year ago. And we literally started from 0. So when we announced that a year ago, we did not have a team in place, we had designated senior leader, being Pete Panos, to basically build the business from the ground-up. And he and now his team that's fully in place have been working on that diligently over the last 12 months. So we're very pleased with the traction that we're seeing from the -- our entree into the business. We're seeing good receptivity to the components of our offering, which include, obviously, the brand itself, our operational capabilities, the ability to be part of all of our initiatives tied to our marketing prowess, et cetera and again, a very competitive fee, which also includes sharing of insurance revenues. So the offering is very compelling. We've got a backlog that continues to build. Pete and his team are now out doing much more outbound efforts. So what has taken place with our entree into the business, which I think is similar maybe to others over time, is it does take a number of quarters to kind of get a pipeline built because many of the properties that typically come into these programs are being built. So we have a healthy backlog that includes a number of those properties. And as well, we have a number of properties that have been in place that have decided to come into our platform versus either running the facilities themselves or coming off another third-party platform. So we see a lot of good traction there, and we'll continue to, I think, see good opportunities going into this year."

So it's primarily driven by an initiative that we did a lot of testing on through 2018 that includes a number of enhancements that we're going to be delivering to our existing products. So through our development program over the last few years, we've come up with what we've labeled our generation 5 product that has a number of components and elements that we think are really well-suited to go back to our existing assets and basically use it as an opportunity to do a refresh of the physical part of the assets as well as looking at some opportunities to improve from a cost and efficiency standpoint, things like utilities, et cetera. So it includes simple things like paint, which, again, we've learned over time and done a lot of testing, that using a dominant amount of orange plays well not only for curb appeal, but lines up with a lot of things that we do on our online efforts, simple signage, some of the office environments, retooling them to make them much more customer-oriented. We have now a paperless environment with Web Champ 2. So we need fewer filing cabinets and with that, can use office space in a very different and more efficient way. And then to the efficiency side of the equation, we're doing things like internal and external LED, upgrading landscaping, so we have less water usage. We are looking at solar, so we're doing some testing on solar as we speak. So there's a number of, I think, meaningful investments that you're going to see as we use really the enhanced capabilities that we've seen and good reaction to our generation 5 product as we've delivered that new product in many markets across the United States, now into our existing portfolio. So this year, we're likely to spend, plus or minus, about $100 million on that effort. It's going to launch in many parts of the West Coast. So when you're out here towards the end of the year, for instance, at Nareit, we may have an opportunity to actually display and show some of that while a number of you are in town. So we're excited about what kind of traction that we're getting from this. We're getting very good reaction from customers and employees. And we're really excited about the overall benefits that we're going to see in the existing portfolio."

I would expect that many of our 2016 acquisitions as well as some of our 2013 to 2015 developments will roll into the same-store pool. They will be stabilized when we roll them in, and so we won't be talking about any sort of revenue benefit associated with rolling those properties in, given the fact that they're stabilized when they're going in. And there's probably some expansions as well in the 2013 to 2015 period that are in the other category that will be rolled in as well as in the other category, there are properties impacted by natural disasters, damage, et cetera, that we'll evaluate.

I think, you gave a pretty good summary of what our historical revenue growth has been over the previous quarters. And you do point to the period end occupancy and contract rent growth, which do suggest we ended the quarter in a place where contract rents would be growing at the start of April at a similar level. So I think, we've been encouraged by customer trends like we spoke about on our last call, really a combination of a tougher move-in environment, balanced really by continued good performance by existing tenant base and our existing tenants. We see move outs down and length of stay moderately increasing and they're all being supported by a strong labor market out there in the broader macro economy. 
So we've seen good operating trends consistent with what we discussed on our last call, reasonably steady contract rent growth and occupancy through the quarter. In terms of where we go from here, we're obviously at the end of the first quarter, we're about to enter into our seasonally busy move-in time as we get into May and June that'll be a big determinant of overall 2019 revenue trend and we'll certainly update you on those trends on our next quarterly call."

And we did see move-in volume down modestly in the quarter, but again, offset by move-out volumes being down as well. In terms of rent rolldown, this is a seasonally one of the bigger rent rolldown quarters, given the slower move-in season and the fact that folks have moved in at higher rates through the summer. And so we did continue to see it rent rolldown of the quarter, which deteriorated modestly. But again, one of the better performances in rent rolldown deceleration."

I would say there's really no change on what, again, our outlook is from even 60 days ago, from our last call. So everything we're tracking points to 2019 to be again get another pretty commanding year of deliveries plus or minus in that $5 billion range, say 400 to 500 properties plus or minus 30 million square feet. So the one thing as I noted a few minutes ago, it is shifting somewhat. So if it's encouraging that all, which we like to see, fewer deliveries are taking place in Denver, Charlotte, Houston, often in Tampa, for instance. So there's been a pull back there. That's good news. But some developers are starting to get more active in Portland, Boston, Seattle, Miami and New York. 
So we're keeping a close eye on any residual impact that the supply is likely to have this year and going into next year. The same drivers out there that has fueled this level of supply over the last 2 to 3 years, in particular,, which is a lot of new entrants are still coming into the sector. You've got developers that like the potential yields are likely to derive from the new development, and fundings out there. So we're keeping a close eye on it. We're looking at 2020 as potentially a year that things could start shifting down, but again, we've got to track it and see what's at hand. I'll tell you and maybe even to shift a little bit into how that's affecting the acquisition environment. There are a number of conversations that are becoming more pronounced, which are laced around the theme of I want out. Now again, not out because it's a stressful situation or it's one that necessarily is commanding that decision at a level that I've got to get out, but it's a realization that maybe returns not going to be met. They may have some lender pressure, maybe expectations from a revenue or performance standpoint aren't there. 
So that is a residual effect and potentially a good thing that we're going to continue to see. So if you even look at as you saw through the first quarter and what we reported relative to what we have under contract, we've now even through the earlier part of this year exceeded the acquisition volume we did in all 2018. And there are some interesting things as a part of that collection of acquisitions. One, for instance, is for the first time in several years, we have a property that we're acquiring out of bankruptcy. So I've talked about that a little bit over the last few quarters, meaning that we think some of that kind of acquisition opportunity can surface and we've got one, again, under contract. 
We bought a portfolio in the first quarter, 9 properties, great assets, long-term ownership and the deal came to us on an off market basis, but again, the owners decided it was for them the right time to exit the sector entirely. And it was a good negotiation, meaning, it was a deal that was fair priced. It wasn't one that they looked at was one that had to meet or get a top level of evaluation, but it was a deal they wanted to do on a very efficient and clean basis and we were an ideal candidate to do that. So there's more of that in the mix as we speak and we're encouraged by that. And we'll see how the rest of the year plays out."

Again, with the same theme that owners are coming to us and saying, okay, we may not need or exceed the type of returns we expected 2 or 3 years ago when we put these properties into development. They're not, by any means, failed assets, but again, actual expectations are not being met. So we've got to peel those in our pipeline right now under contracted are extremely well located, great assets, handful of them might be a little bit higher on average than you've seen us do in some of the other markets that we bought assets in, but we still feel great replacement cost, deals, we're going to get very good returns.

So whether they're coming to us through either private or another public third-party platform, we're seeing some of that, but I wouldn't tell you that's the dominant part of the activity in our backlog. It's still highly correlated to deals that are in various forms of development. But we like what we would see relative to the type of assets that are coming to us. We've actually, at the end of the day, passed as many properties as we've decided to pull in to the platforms for a number of reasons. So I think, we've got the ability to continue to be particularly cautious about what markets that some of these assets come to us and whether or not we choose to go into those or other factors, but again, we feel like overtime, we'll be able to grow the scale of business and keep good momentum around it itself.

So the marketing spend that we saw in the quarter was pretty consistent rate of increase from the fourth quarter. And as we discussed last time, we did that in the fourth quarter really throughout 2018 and increased our spend as we saw good demand response online and great reaction to our brand in online paid search. That's combined with more competitive environment on paid search, as you'd expect in any markets impacted by new supply, the cost of acquiring customers is increasing as that supply is getting absorbed. And so there is some market costs-per-click increases in there as well. Ultimately, our decision-making around that is very dynamic, based on key words and local market dynamics and traffic. So I'm not going to call a rate of increase for the rest of the year, but it's a tool that we're seeing good returns on today and we're continuing as we get in through the second quarter to use that tool. 
That -- the second part of the question was, is that benefiting the overall level of movement activity. And certainly, the answer to that is yes. We do like the demand response we're seeing from that channel, but we're using a combination of advertising rates, which, again, the rates were down about 1% for move-in for the quarter and promotions to drive traffic to our stores. In terms of the third component of your question, which is around, is it contributing to stabilization of the portfolio in aggregate. I guess, I would say, we're seeing good trends in advertising, helping move ins, but move ins remain challenging in many markets, and so that's where our increased spend is concentrated and in other markets where move-in trends are quite good and healthy. In terms of the stabilization point, we have seen some good trends in some of the early markets that were hit by new supply. So we you'll see markets like Washington, D.C. or Chicago improving. D.C. is up 180 basis points in occupancy for us year-over-year. Chicago is up 160 basis points. So we are seeing some improved trends there."

So a lot of the pipeline delivered in the quarter, we have about [ 137 million ] of deliveries for new builds, but really drove the volume was a number of redevelopments heavily tied to the remaining scrape and rebuilds in Houston specifically. So we hadn't elevated the level of first quarter volume. So to a degree, some of that impacted the pipeline. The pipeline did shift down close to $100 million or so, but that can ebb and flow. I wouldn't take that as indication that overall we've intentionally tapered that down on just 1 or 2 quarter basis. We're seeing a lot of good continued potential activity out there. It has shifted intentionally more than our redevelopment activity where we're taking existing properties and putting a lot of the attributes from what we call our Gen 5 new product into properties that are extremely well located, where we can expand and increase, not only performance but scale in certain markets where otherwise you'd never be able to get to those freight land sites. 
So we see continued very active activity on that front today about 60-plus percent of our development pipelines tied to that. And the teams are out looking for land sites in a variety of different markets. In some markets, lands becoming more expensive, so we're keeping a close eye on the impact to that. The other thing that is happening is the time to entitle, it seems to be certainly a number of markets getting more commanding. Now the reverse of that, which kind of ties to some of the impact with either developers or entrance that have come into the markets over the last 2 or 3 years. We are getting reverse increase more than we've seen recently for close to our fully entitled land sites. So again, we've got a healthy collection of different opportunities there. And the teams every bit as focused on how driving that kind of opportunity and we continue to see very good returns from our investments into the developed pipeline."

And frankly, it can range from anywhere from 2 to 3 years on an average basis. So not really seeing any different time frames tied to that. In certain markets, where supply may be more pronounced, you may have elongated lease up or some impact from that then alternatively. Some markets that do have fair amount of suppliers still doing quite well because there's an inherent need and the market itself may be underserved and that frankly, is the reason why we chose to develop those specific asset that are in the first place. 
And then, another part of the the mix that we have out there is that we've got other assets that are clearly well ahead of our expectations. And we're seeing very good traction in a number of properties that are, again, ahead from that standpoint as well. The thing that is a natural part of our business as a whole is it not only is it is a factor of lease up, but it's a majority of the lease property property itself. And what do I mean that the inventory leases are hand take a fair amount of time to mature and stabilize because you're going to see good growth and you're going to see good factors tied to that but that time needs to mature so that, again, you've got a highly stabilize asset and you're able to evaluate it to ultimate success."

So it's a long winded saying, we like both markets and the balance sheets in great shape here today with, if you deduct the $120 million-ish of acquisitions under contract from the $220 million of cash we had at year-end and you pro forma for the $500 million bond issuance we're sitting on about $600 million of cash today, which gives us good liquidity to fund external growth as we get through the rest of the year."

So through 2018, we began to test in a number of different markets what we call our property tomorrow for platform, which is taking number of key elements from our fifth-generation product and overlaying it into the existing assets. Some of its somewhat straightforward, meaning it's enhanced, signage, updated, [ paining schemes ]. We're also optimizing things like water usage through landscaping improvements, utilities around LEDs, changing the office environment because today's world environment with our new Web Champ 2 platform we've gone completely paperless. We don't need filing cabinets anymore. We've got more space to create a better customer environment. 
So all those things have played through quite well in the properties that we've tested. Thus far, which totals, say less than 75 or so assets that we tested in a number of different markets through 2018. So this year, we're moonlighting the rollout with all the feedback and the reaction that we've gotten from the customers, employees, et cetera. And it's starting here on the West Coast. We're likely to touch anywhere from say 100 to 150 properties in the next 2 to 3 quarters here in California specifically, and then, we'll be rolling it into a number of different markets literally for the next few years as we touch the entire portfolio. 
In 2019, the cost tied to this is plus or minus about $100 million. And it wouldn't be surprising over the next few years, we spent $0.5 billion or more as we roll this entire plan out. And we like what we're seeing so far. So the properties that have been retooled to this new standard are seeing some residual benefit in a number of ways. It's still early in that regard, but we like what we're seeing. And we think it's really another way to amplify and enhance not only the curb appeal and the brand itself that resonates incredibly well to consumers, but it matches all the things that we doing on an online basis as well. So again, it's a program we've got a lot of focus on and we're likely to see fair amount of capital in subsequent years  that's going to be dedicated to this effort."

And I think, some of that is tactics that we and others in the industry are using to attract good customers that will stay with us. I think, part of that probably relates to the mix of customers that we've seen. If you look at things like housing sales in many of our markets across the country, a deceleration in house in transaction activity, which is meant fewer movers as a percentage of our customer base on the margin, all those types of things. And the reason I highlighted this is movers tends to be shorter length of stay customers. All of those things have resulted in more tenants staying longer and the lower move-out volumes that we've been reporting. That is certainly helpful to our existing tenant rate increase program as they stay longer, they are eligible for rate increases. 
I do think the other thing that's happening in some markets as you're seeing real resilience in demand for the sector, and I highlighted earlier on the call, markets like Washington, D.C. or Chicago, which were hit by new facilities earlier in the development cycle as we're seeing real occupancy games that which is certainly supporting revenue growth as we get through 2019.

I think, you gave a pretty good summary of what our historical revenue growth has been over the previous quarters. And you do point to the period end occupancy and contract rent growth, which do suggest we ended the quarter in a place where contract rents would be growing at the start of April at a similar level. So I think we've been encouraged by customer trends like we spoke about on our last call, really a combination of a tougher move-in environment, balanced really by continued good performance by existing tenant base and our existing tenants. We see move outs down and length of stay modestly increasing and they're all being supported by a strong labor market out there in the broader macro economy.
So we've seen good operating trends consistent with what we discussed on our last call, reasonably steady contract rent growth and occupancy through the quarter. In terms of where we go from here, we're obviously at the end of the first quarter, we're about to enter into our seasonally busy move-in time as we get into May and June, that'll be a big determinant of overall 2019 revenue trends and we'll certainly update you on those trends on our next quarterly call."

Move-in rates, as we disclosed in our 10-Q last night, were down for the quarter, down 1%, that's the best move-in rate performance we've seen in some time. And we did see move-in volume down modestly in the quarter, but again, offset by move-out volumes being down as well. In terms of rent roll down, this is, seasonally, one of the bigger rent roll down quarters, given the slower move-in season and the fact that folks have moved in at higher rates through the summer. And so we did continue to see rent roll down of the quarter, which deteriorated modestly. But again, one of the better performances in rent roll down deceleration."

I would say there's really no change on what, again, our outlook is from even 60 days ago, from our last call. So everything we're tracking points to 2019 to be yet again get another pretty commanding year of deliveries, plus or minus in that $5 billion range, say, 400 to 500 properties plus or minus 30 million square feet. So the one thing, as I noted a few minutes ago, it is shifting somewhat. So if it's encouraging that all, which we like to see, fewer deliveries are taking place in Denver, Charlotte, Houston, Austin and Tampa, for instance. So there's been a pull back there. That's good news. But some developers are starting to get more active in Portland, Boston, Seattle, Miami and New York. So we're keeping a close eye on any residual impact that the supply is likely to have this year and going into next year. The same drivers out there that has fueled this level of supply over the last 2 to 3 years, in particular, which is a lot of new entrants are still coming into the sector. You've got developers that like -- the potential yields are likely to derive from new development, and fundings out there. So we're keeping a close eye on it. 
We're looking at 2020 as potentially a year that things could start shifting down, but again, we've got to track it and see what's at hand. I'll tell you and maybe even to shift a little bit into how that's affecting the acquisition environment. There are a number of conversations that are becoming more pronounced, which are laced around the theme of I want out. Now again, not out because it's a stressful situation or it's one that necessarily is commanding that decision at a level that I've got to get out, but it's a realization that maybe returns aren't going to be met. They may have some lender pressure, maybe expectations from a revenue or performance standpoint aren't there.
So that is a residual effect and potentially a good thing that we're going to continue to see. So if you even look at -- as you saw through the first quarter and what we reported relative to what we have under contract, we've now, through the early part of this year, exceeded the acquisition volume we did in all of 2018. And there's some interesting things as a part of that collection of acquisitions. One, for instance, is for the first time in several years, we have a property that we're acquiring out of bankruptcy. So I've talked about that a little bit over the last few quarters, meaning that we think some of that kind of acquisition opportunity could surface and we've got one, again, under contract.
We bought a portfolio in the first quarter, 9 properties, great assets, long-term ownership and the deal came to us on an off market basis, but again, the owners decided it was, for them, the right time to exit the sector entirely. And it was a good negotiation, meaning, it was a deal that was fair priced. It wasn't one that they looked at was one that had to meet or get a top level of valuation, but it was a deal they wanted to do on a very efficient and clean basis, and we were an ideal candidate to do that. So there's more of that in the mix as we speak and we're encouraged by that. And we'll see how the rest of the year plays out."

Again, with the same theme that owners are coming to us and saying, ""Okay, we may not need or exceed the type of returns we expected 2 or 3 years ago when we put these properties into development."" They're not, by any means, failed assets, but again, actual expectations are not being met. So we've got to peel those in our pipeline right now. Under contracted are extremely well located, great assets, a handful of them might be a little bit higher on average than you've seen us do in some of the other markets that we've bought assets in, but we still feel great. Replacement cost, deals, we're going to get very good returns. And again, we hope to see more of that kind of activity throughout this year."

It's heavily weighted by development deals that will take a number of quarters to actually come to completion and be pulled directly into the program itself. We're seeing and learning a lot of interesting things through the platform. And yes, I would tell you some of that includes -- which I don't think at the end of the day is maybe new to the business but there are certain owners that do change flags. So whether they're coming to us through either a private or another public third-party platform, we're seeing some of that, but I wouldn't tell you that's the dominant part of the activity in our backlog. It's still highly correlated to deals that are in various forms of development. But we like what we see relative to the type of assets that are coming to us. We've actually, at the end of the day, passed as many properties as we've decided to pull in to the platforms for a number of reasons. So I think, we've got the ability to continue to be particularly cautious about what markets that some of these assets come to us and whether or not we choose to go into those or other factors, but again, we feel like overtime, we'll be able to grow the scale of business and keep good momentum around it itself.

So the marketing spend that we saw in the quarter was pretty consistent rate of increase from the fourth quarter. And as we've discussed last time, we did that in the fourth quarter really throughout",359,"Sure. So let me take that in some different components. So the marketing spend that we saw in the quarter was pretty consistent rate of increase from the fourth quarter. And as we've discussed last time, we did that in the fourth quarter really throughout 2018 and increased our spend as we saw good demand response online and great reaction to our brand in online paid search. That's combined with more competitive environment on paid search. As you'd expect in many markets impacted by new supply, the cost of acquiring customers is increasing as that supply is getting absorbed. And so there is some market costs-per-click increases in there as well. Ultimately, our decision-making around that is very dynamic, based on key words and local market dynamics and traffic. So I'm not going to call a rate of increase for the rest of the year, but it's a tool that we're seeing good returns on today and we're continuing as we get in through the second quarter to use that tool.
That -- the second part of your question was, is that benefiting the overall level of movement activity. And certainly, the answer to that is yes. We do like the demand response we're seeing from that channel, but we're using a combination of advertising rates, which, again, our rates were down about 1% for move-ins for the quarter and promotions to drive traffic to our stores. 
In terms of the third component of your question, which is around, is it contributing to stabilization of the portfolio in aggregate, I guess I would say we're seeing good trends in advertising helping move-ins, but move-ins remain challenging in many markets, and so that's where our increased spend is concentrated, in other markets where move-in trends are quite good and healthy. In terms of the stabilization point, we have seen some good trends in some of the early markets that were hit by new supply. So we you'll see markets like Washington, D.C. or Chicago improving. D.C. is up 180 basis points in occupancy for us year-over-year. Chicago is up 160 basis points. So we are seeing some improved trends there."

So a lot of the pipeline delivered in the quarter -- we have about 137 million of deliveries for new builds, but what really drove the volume was a number of redevelopments heavily tied to the remaining scrape and rebuilds we did in Houston specifically. So we had an elevated level of first quarter volume. So to a degree, some of that impacted the pipeline. The pipeline did shift down close to $100 million or so, but that can ebb and flow. I wouldn't take that as an indication that overall, we've intentionally tapered that down on a just 1 or 2 quarter basis. We're seeing a lot of good continued potential activity out there. It has shifted intentionally more to our redevelopment activity where we're taking existing properties and putting a lot of the attributes from what we call our gen 5 new product into properties that are extremely well located, where we can expand and increase, not only performance, but scale in certain markets where otherwise you'd never be able to get to those freight land sites.
So we see continued very active activity on that front. Today, about 60-plus percent of our development pipeline's tied to that. And the teams are out looking for land sites in a variety of different markets. In some markets, land's becoming more expensive, so we're keeping a close eye on the impact to that. The other thing that is happening is the time to entitle seems to be -- certainly, a number of markets getting more commanding. Now the reverse of that, which kind of ties to some of the impact with either developers or entrants that have come into the markets over the last 2 or 3 years. We are getting reverse inquiries more than we've seen recently for close to our fully entitled land sites. So again, we've got a healthy collection of different opportunities there. And the team's every bit as focused on how driving that kind of opportunity and we continue to see very good returns from our investments into the development pipeline."

And frankly, it can range from anywhere from 2 to 3 years on an average basis. So not really seeing any different time frames tied to that. In certain markets where supply may be more pronounced, you may have elongated lease up or some impact from that then alternatively. Some markets that do have a fair amount of suppliers' still doing quite well because there's an inherent need and the market itself may be underserved and that frankly, is the reason why we chose to develop a specific asset there in the first place.
And then another part of the mix that we have out there is -- then we've got other assets that are clearly well ahead of our expectations. And we're seeing very good traction in a number of properties that are, again, ahead from that standpoint as well. The thing that is a natural part of our business as a whole is it -- not only is it is a factor of lease up, but then it's the maturity of the lease property, property itself. And what do I mean by that? The inventory leases that are at hand take a fair amount of time to mature and stabilize because you're going to see good growth and you're going to see good factors tied to that but that time needs to mature so that again, you've got a highly stabilized asset and you're able to evaluate it's ultimate success."

We continue to remain committed to both markets as good financing tools. We've talked about in the past, the preferred market is a great, long-term permanent source of capital with lots of great features. Including the call feature and the permanent life. With our balance sheet, we also have the ability to add incremental long-term debt to finance our external growth pipelines, both the acquisition activity as well as the development pipeline. 
So we'll look to use both sources of capital going forward. You highlighted that we do have some callable preferreds outstanding. We also have some new callable preferreds later in the year that we'll evaluate. In the month of March, we did execute a preferred financing as well as a redemption that lowered our aggregate preferred cost of 5.3%, which is a continued improvement. So it's a long winded saying, we like both markets and the balance sheets in great shape here today with -- if you deduct the $120 million-ish of acquisitions under contract from the $220 million of cash we had at year-end and you pro forma for the $500 million bond issuance, we're sitting on about $600 million of cash today, which gives us good liquidity to fund external growth as we get through the rest of the year."

So through 2018, we began to test in a number of different markets what we call our Property of Tomorrow platform, which is taking a number of key elements from our fifth generation product and overlaying it into the existing assets. Some of its somewhat straightforward, meaning it's enhanced signage, updated painting schemes. We're also optimizing things like water usage through landscaping improvements, utilities around LEDs, changing the office environment because today's world environment with our new Web Champ 2 platform. We've gone completely paperless. We don't need filing cabinets anymore. We've got more space to create a better customer environment.
So all those things have played through quite well in the properties that we've tested thus far, which totals, say, less than 75 or so assets that we tested in a number of different markets through 2018. So this year, we're mainlining the rollout with all the feedback and the reaction that we've gotten from customers, employees, et cetera. And it's starting here on the West Coast. We're likely to touch anywhere from, say, 100 to 150 properties in the next 2 to 3 quarters here in California specifically, and then we'll be rolling it into a number of different markets literally for the next few years as we touch the entire portfolio.
In 2019, the cost tied to this is plus or minus about $100 million. And it wouldn't be surprising over the next few years, we spent $0.5 billion or more as we roll this entire plan out. And we like what we're seeing so far. So the properties that have been retooled to this new standard are seeing some residual benefit in a number of ways. It's still early in that regard, but we like what we're seeing. And we think it's really another way to amplify and enhance not only the curb appeal and the brand itself that resonates incredibly well to consumers, but it matches all the things that we doing on an online basis as well. So again, it's a program we've got a lot of focus on and we're likely to see fair amount of capital in subsequent years that it's going to be dedicated to this effort."

I think some of that is tactics that we and others in the industry are using to attract good customers that will stay with us. I think part of that probably relates to the mix of customers that we've seen. If you look at things like housing sales in many of our markets across the country, a deceleration in house in transaction activity, which has meant fewer movers as a percentage of our customer base on the margin, all those types of things. And the reason I highlight that is movers tend to be shorter length of stay customers. All of those things have resulted in more tenants staying longer and lower move-out volumes that we've been reporting. That is certainly helpful to our existing tenant rate increase program. As they stay longer, they are eligible for rate increases.
I do think the other thing that's happening in some markets, as you're seeing real resilience in demand for the sector, and I highlighted earlier on the call, markets like Washington, D.C. or Chicago, which were hit by new facilities earlier in the development cycle as we're seeing real occupancy gains there which is certainly supporting revenue growth as we get through 2019.

We did roll in a new same-store portfolio this quarter and those properties were all stabilized as we disclosed at the beginning of 2017 when they were rolled in. So all that operating metrics, the rates of growth, the revenue, NOI were not impacted by the rolling of those new properties in the first quarter."

I think, you gave a pretty good summary of what our historical revenue growth has been over the previous quarters. And you do point to the period end occupancy and contract rent growth, which do suggest we ended the quarter in a place where contract rents would be growing at the start of April at a similar level. So I think we've been encouraged by customer trends like we spoke about on our last call, really a combination of a tougher move-in environment, balanced really by continued good performance by existing tenant base and our existing tenants. We see move outs down and length of stay modestly increasing and they're all being supported by a strong labor market out there in the broader macro economy.
So we've seen good operating trends consistent with what we discussed on our last call, reasonably steady contract rent growth and occupancy through the quarter. In terms of where we go from here, we're obviously at the end of the first quarter, we're about to enter into our seasonally busy move-in time as we get into May and June, that'll be a big determinant of overall 2019 revenue trends and we'll certainly update you on those trends on our next quarterly call."

Move-in rates, as we disclosed in our 10-Q last night, were down for the quarter, down 1%, that's the best move-in rate performance we've seen in some time. And we did see move-in volume down modestly in the quarter, but again, offset by move-out volumes being down as well. In terms of rent roll down, this is, seasonally, one of the bigger rent roll down quarters, given the slower move-in season and the fact that folks have moved in at higher rates through the summer. And so we did continue to see rent roll down of the quarter, which deteriorated modestly. But again, one of the better performances in rent roll down deceleration."

I would say there's really no change on what, again, our outlook is from even 60 days ago, from our last call. So everything we're tracking points to 2019 to be yet again get another pretty commanding year of deliveries, plus or minus in that $5 billion range, say, 400 to 500 properties plus or minus 30 million square feet. So the one thing, as I noted a few minutes ago, it is shifting somewhat. So if it's encouraging at all, which we like to see, fewer deliveries are taking place in Denver, Charlotte, Houston, Austin and Tampa, for instance. So there's been a pull back there. That's good news. But some developers are starting to get more active in Portland, Boston, Seattle, Miami and New York. So we're keeping a close eye on any residual impact that the supply is likely to have this year and going into next year. The same drivers are out there that has fueled this level of supply over the last 2 to 3 years, in particular, which is a lot of new entrants are still coming into the sector. You've got developers that like -- the potential yields are likely to derive from new development, and fundings out there. So we're keeping a close eye on it. 
We're looking at 2020 as potentially a year that things could start shifting down, but again, we've got to track it and see what's at hand. I'll tell you and maybe even to shift a little bit into how that's affecting the acquisition environment. There are a number of conversations that are becoming more pronounced, which are laced around the theme of I want out. Now again, not out because it's a stressful situation or it's one that necessarily is commanding that decision at a level that I've got to get out, but it's a realization that maybe returns aren't going to be met. They may have some lender pressure, maybe expectations from a revenue or performance standpoint aren't there.
So that is a residual effect and potentially a good thing that we're going to continue to see. So if you even look at -- as you saw through the first quarter and what we reported relative to what we have under contract, we've now, through the early part of this year, exceeded the acquisition volume we did in all of 2018. And there's some interesting things as a part of that collection of acquisitions. One, for instance, is for the first time in several years, we have a property that we're acquiring out of bankruptcy. So I've talked about that a little bit over the last few quarters, meaning that we think some of that kind of acquisition opportunity could surface and we've got one, again, under contract.
We bought a portfolio in the first quarter, 9 properties, great assets, long-term ownership and the deal came to us on an off market basis, but again, the owners decided it was, for them, the right time to exit the sector entirely. And it was a good negotiation, meaning, it was a deal that was fair priced. It wasn't one that they looked at was one that had to meet or get a top level of valuation, but it was a deal they wanted to do on a very efficient and clean basis, and we were an ideal candidate to do that. So there's more of that in the mix as we speak and we're encouraged by that. And we'll see how the rest of the year plays out."

Again, with the same theme that owners are coming to us and saying, ""Okay, we may not need or exceed the type of returns we expected 2 or 3 years ago when we put these properties into development."" They're not, by any means, failed assets, but again, actual expectations are not being met. So we've got a few of those in our pipeline right now under contract that are extremely well located, great assets, a handful of them might be a little bit higher on average than you've seen us do in some of the other markets that we've bought assets in, but we still feel great.

We're seeing and learning a lot of interesting things through the platform. And yes, I would tell you some of that includes -- which I don't think at the end of the day is maybe new to the business but there are certain owners that do change flags. So whether they're coming to us through either a private or another public third-party platform, we're seeing some of that, but I wouldn't tell you that's the dominant part of the activity in our backlog. It's still highly correlated to deals that are in various forms of development. But we like what we see relative to the type of assets that are coming to us. We've actually, at the end of the day, passed as many properties as we've decided to pull in to the platforms for a number of reasons. So I think, we've got the ability to continue to be particularly cautious about what markets that some of these assets come to us are in and whether or not we choose to go into those or other factors, but again, we feel like over time, we'll be able to grow the scale of business and keep good momentum around itself.

And as we've discussed last time, we did that in the fourth quarter really throughout 2018 and increased our spend as we saw good demand response online and great reaction to our brand in online paid search. That's combined with more competitive environment on paid search. As you'd expect in many markets impacted by new supply, the cost of acquiring customers is increasing as that supply is getting absorbed. And so there is some market costs-per-click increases in there as well. Ultimately, our decision-making around that is very dynamic, based on key words and local market dynamics and traffic. So I'm not going to call a rate of increase for the rest of the year, but it's a tool that we're seeing good returns on today and we're continuing as we get in through the second quarter to use that tool.
That -- the second part of your question was, is that benefiting the overall level of movement activity. And certainly, the answer to that is yes. We do like the demand response we're seeing from that channel, but we're using a combination of advertising rates, which, again, our rates were down about 1% for move-ins for the quarter and promotions to drive traffic to our stores. 
In terms of the third component of your question, which is around, is it contributing to stabilization of the portfolio in aggregate, I guess I would say we're seeing good trends in advertising helping move-ins, but move-ins remain challenging in many markets, and so that's where our increased spend is concentrated, in other markets where move-in trends are quite good and healthy. In terms of the stabilization point, we have seen some good trends in some of the early markets that were hit by new supply. So we you'll see markets like Washington, D.C. or Chicago improving. D.C. is up 180 basis points in occupancy for us year-over-year. Chicago is up 160 basis points. So we are seeing some improved trends there."

So a lot of the pipeline delivered in the quarter -- we have about 137 million of deliveries for new builds, but what really drove the volume was a number of redevelopments heavily tied to the remaining scrape and rebuilds we did in Houston specifically. So we had an elevated level of first quarter volume. So to a degree, some of that impacted the pipeline. The pipeline did shift down close to $100 million or so, but that can ebb and flow. I wouldn't take that as an indication that overall, we've intentionally tapered that down on a just 1 or 2 quarter basis. We're seeing a lot of good continued potential activity out there. It has shifted intentionally more to our redevelopment activity where we're taking existing properties and putting a lot of the attributes from what we call our gen 5 new product into properties that are extremely well located, where we can expand and increase, not only performance, but scale in certain markets where otherwise you'd never be able to get to those great land sites.
So we see continued very active activity on that front. Today, about 60-plus percent of our development pipeline's tied to that. And the teams are out looking for land sites in a variety of different markets. In some markets, land's becoming more expensive, so we're keeping a close eye on the impact to that. The other thing that is happening is the time to entitle seems to be -- certainly, in a number of markets getting more commanding. Now the reverse of that, which kind of ties to some of the impact with either developers or entrants that have come into the markets over the last 2 or 3 years. We are getting reverse inquiries more than we've seen recently for close to or fully entitled land sites. So again, we've got a healthy collection of different opportunities there. And the team's every bit as focused on how driving that kind of opportunity and we continue to see very good returns from our investments into the development pipeline."

And frankly, it can range from anywhere from 2 to 3 years on an average basis. So not really seeing any different time frames tied to that. In certain markets where supply may be more pronounced, you may have elongated lease up or some impact from that then alternatively. Some markets that do have a fair amount of suppliers still doing quite well because there's an inherent need and the market itself may be underserved and that frankly, is the reason why we chose to develop a specific asset there in the first place.
And then another part of the mix that we have out there is -- then we've got other assets that are clearly well ahead of our expectations. And we're seeing very good traction in a number of properties that are, again, ahead from that standpoint as well. The thing that is a natural part of our business as a whole is it -- not only is it is a factor of lease up, but then it's the maturity of the lease property, property itself. And what do I mean by that? The inventory leases that are at hand take a fair amount of time to mature and stabilize because you're going to see good growth and you're going to see good factors tied to that but that time needs to mature so that again, you've got a highly stabilized asset and you're able to evaluate its ultimate success."

So we'll look to use both sources of capital going forward. You highlighted that we do have some callable preferreds outstanding. We also have some new callable preferreds later in the year that we'll evaluate. In the month of March, we did execute a preferred financing as well as a redemption that lowered our aggregate preferred cost of 5.3%, which is a continued improvement. So it's a long winded way of saying, we like both markets and the balance sheets in great shape here today with -- if you deduct the $120 million-ish of acquisitions under contract from the $220 million of cash we had at year-end and you pro forma for the $500 million bond issuance, we're sitting on about $600 million of cash today, which gives us good liquidity to fund external growth as we get through the rest of the year."

So through 2018, we began to test in a number of different markets what we call our Property of Tomorrow platform, which is taking a number of key elements from our fifth generation product and overlaying it into the existing assets.

We're also optimizing things like water usage through landscaping improvements, utilities around LEDs, changing the office environment because today's world environment with our new Web Champ 2 platform. We've gone completely paperless. We don't need filing cabinets anymore. We've got more space to create a better customer environment.
So all those things have played through quite well in the properties that we've tested thus far, which totals, say, less than 75 or so assets that we tested in a number of different markets through 2018. So this year, we're mainlining the rollout with all the feedback and the reaction that we've gotten from customers, employees, et cetera. And it's starting here on the West Coast. We're likely to touch anywhere from, say, 100 to 150 properties in the next 2 to 3 quarters here in California specifically, and then we'll be rolling it into a number of different markets literally for the next few years as we touch the entire portfolio.
In 2019, the cost tied to this is plus or minus about $100 million. And it wouldn't be surprising over the next few years, we spent $0.5 billion or more as we roll this entire plan out. And we like what we're seeing so far. So the properties that have been retooled to this new standard are seeing some residual benefit in a number of ways. It's still early in that regard, but we like what we're seeing.

There's no question we're in the most commanding employment arena that we've seen over the last decade. So we're assessing that on a market-by-market basis. We've got a number of very vibrant strategies around that. We're looking for, not only cost efficiencies, but ways to make our full team as productive as possible.

I think some of that is tactics that we and others in the industry are using to attract good customers that will stay with us. I think part of that probably relates to the mix of customers that we've seen. If you look at things like housing sales in many of our markets across the country, a deceleration in housing transaction activity, which has meant fewer movers as a percentage of our customer base on the margin, all those types of things. And the reason I highlight that is movers tend to be shorter length of stay customers. All of those things have resulted in more tenants staying longer and lower move-out volumes [ than ] we've been reporting. That is certainly helpful to our existing tenant rate increase program. As they stay longer, they are eligible for rate increases.
I do think the other thing that's happening in some markets, as you're seeing real resilience in demand for the sector, and I highlighted earlier on the call, markets like Washington, D.C. or Chicago, which were hit by new facilities earlier in the development cycle as we're seeing real occupancy gains there which is certainly supporting revenue growth as we get through 2019. So a mix of factors, but you're right that the existing tenant piece has been helpful, both in terms of move outs as well as rate increases."

I think, you gave a pretty good summary of what our historical revenue growth has been over the previous quarters. And you do point to the period end occupancy and contract rent growth, which do suggest we ended the quarter in a place where contract rents would be growing at the start of April at a similar level. So I think we've been encouraged by customer trends like we spoke about on our last call, really a combination of a tougher move-in environment, balanced really by continued good performance by existing tenant base and our existing tenants. We see move outs down and length of stay modestly increasing and they're all being supported by a strong labor market out there in the broader macroeconomy.
So we've seen good operating trends consistent with what we discussed on our last call, reasonably steady contract rent growth and occupancy through the quarter. In terms of where we go from here, we're obviously at the end of the first quarter, we're about to enter into our seasonally busy move-in time as we get into May and June, that'll be a big determinant of overall 2019 revenue trends and we'll certainly update you on those trends on our next quarterly call."

And we did see move-in volume down modestly in the quarter, but again, offset by move-out volumes being down as well. In terms of rent roll down, this is, seasonally, one of the bigger rent roll down quarters, given the slower move-in season and the fact that folks have moved in at higher rates through the summer.

So everything we're tracking points to 2019 to be yet again get another pretty commanding year of deliveries, plus or minus i",594,"Yes. Sure, Jeremy. I would say there's really no change on what, again, our outlook is from even 60 days ago, from our last call. So everything we're tracking points to 2019 to be yet again get another pretty commanding year of deliveries, plus or minus in that $5 billion range, say, 400 to 500 properties plus or minus 30 million square feet. So the one thing, as I noted a few minutes ago, it is shifting somewhat. So if it's encouraging at all, which we like to see, fewer deliveries are taking place in Denver, Charlotte, Houston, Austin and Tampa, for instance. So there's been a pull back there. That's good news. But some developers are starting to get more active in Portland, Boston, Seattle, Miami and New York. So we're keeping a close eye on any residual impact that the supply is likely to have this year and going into next year. The same drivers are out there that has fueled this level of supply over the last 2 to 3 years, in particular, which is a lot of new entrants are still coming into the sector. You've got developers that like -- the potential yields are likely to derive from new development, and fundings out there. So we're keeping a close eye on it. 
We're looking at 2020 as potentially a year that things could start shifting down, but again, we've got to track it and see what's at hand. I'll tell you and maybe even to shift a little bit into how that's affecting the acquisition environment. There are a number of conversations that are becoming more pronounced, which are laced around the theme of I want out. Now again, not out because it's a stressful situation or it's one that necessarily is commanding that decision at a level that I've got to get out, but it's a realization that maybe returns aren't going to be met. They may have some lender pressure, maybe expectations from a revenue or performance standpoint aren't there.
So that is a residual effect and potentially a good thing that we're going to continue to see. So if you even look at -- as you saw through the first quarter and what we reported relative to what we have under contract, we've now, through the early part of this year, exceeded the acquisition volume we did in all of 2018. And there's some interesting things as a part of that collection of acquisitions. One, for instance, is for the first time in several years, we have a property that we're acquiring out of bankruptcy. So I've talked about that a little bit over the last few quarters, meaning that we think some of that kind of acquisition opportunity could surface and we've got one, again, under contract.
We bought a portfolio in the first quarter, 9 properties, great assets, long-term ownership and the deal came to us on an off-market basis, but again, the owners decided it was, for them, the right time to exit the sector entirely. And it was a good negotiation, meaning, it was a deal that was fair priced. It wasn't one that they looked at was one that had to meet or get a top level of valuation, but it was a deal they wanted to do on a very efficient and clean basis, and we were an ideal candidate to do that. So there's more of that in the mix as we speak and we're encouraged by that. And we'll see how the rest of the year plays out."

Again, with the same theme that owners are coming to us and saying, ""Okay, we may not need or exceed the type of returns we expected 2 or 3 years ago when we put these properties into development."" They're not, by any means, failed assets, but again, actual expectations are not being met. So we've got a few of those in our pipeline right now under contract that are extremely well located, great assets, a handful of them might be a little bit higher on average than you've seen us do in some of the other markets that we've bought assets in, but we still feel great. Replacement cost, deals, we're going to get very good returns. And again, we hope to see more of that kind of activity throughout this year."

And yes, I would tell you some of that includes -- which I don't think at the end of the day is maybe new to the business but there are certain owners that do change flags. So whether they're coming to us through either a private or another public third-party platform, we're seeing some of that, but I wouldn't tell you that's the dominant part of the activity in our backlog. It's still highly correlated to deals that are in various forms of development. But we like what we see relative to the type of assets that are coming to us. We've actually, at the end of the day, passed as many properties as we've decided to pull in to the platforms for a number of reasons. So I think, we've got the ability to continue to be particularly cautious about what markets that some of these assets come to us are in and whether or not we choose to go into those or other factors, but again, we feel like over time, we'll be able to grow the scale of business and keep good momentum around itself.

So the marketing spend that we saw in the quarter was pretty consistent rate of increase from the fourth quarter. And as we've discussed last time, we did that in the fourth quarter really throughout",358,"Sure. So let me take that in some different components. So the marketing spend that we saw in the quarter was pretty consistent rate of increase from the fourth quarter. And as we've discussed last time, we did that in the fourth quarter really throughout 2018 and increased our spend as we saw good demand response online and great reaction to our brand in online paid search. That's combined with more competitive environment on paid search. As you'd expect in many markets impacted by new supply, the cost of acquiring customers is increasing as that supply is getting absorbed. And so there is some market costs-per-click increases in there as well. Ultimately, our decision-making around that is very dynamic, based on keywords and local market dynamics and traffic. So I'm not going to call a rate of increase for the rest of the year, but it's a tool that we're seeing good returns on today and we're continuing as we get in through the second quarter to use that tool.
That -- the second part of your question was, is that benefiting the overall level of movement activity. And certainly, the answer to that is yes. We do like the demand response we're seeing from that channel, but we're using a combination of advertising rates, which, again, our rates were down about 1% for move-ins for the quarter and promotions to drive traffic to our stores. 
In terms of the third component of your question, which is around, is it contributing to stabilization of the portfolio in aggregate, I guess I would say we're seeing good trends in advertising helping move-ins, but move-ins remain challenging in many markets, and so that's where our increased spend is concentrated, in other markets where move-in trends are quite good and healthy. In terms of the stabilization point, we have seen some good trends in some of the early markets that were hit by new supply. So we you'll see markets like Washington, D.C. or Chicago improving. D.C. is up 180 basis points in occupancy for us year-over-year. Chicago is up 160 basis points. So we are seeing some improved trends there."

So a lot of the pipeline delivered in the quarter -- we have about 137 million of deliveries for new builds, but what really drove the volume was a number of redevelopments heavily tied to the remaining scrape and rebuilds we did in Houston specifically. So we had an elevated level of first quarter volume. So to a degree, some of that impacted the pipeline. The pipeline did shift down close to $100 million or so, but that can ebb and flow. I wouldn't take that as an indication that overall, we've intentionally tapered that down on a just 1 or 2 quarter basis. We're seeing a lot of good continued potential activity out there. It has shifted intentionally more to our redevelopment activity where we're taking existing properties and putting a lot of the attributes from what we call our gen 5 new product into properties that are extremely well located, where we can expand and increase, not only performance, but scale in certain markets where otherwise you'd never be able to get to those great land sites.
So we see continued very active activity on that front. Today, about 60-plus percent of our development pipeline's tied to that. And the teams are out looking for land sites in a variety of different markets. In some markets, land's becoming more expensive, so we're keeping a close eye on the impact to that. The other thing that is happening is the time to entitle seems to be -- certainly, in a number of markets getting more commanding. Now the reverse of that, which kind of ties to some of the impact with either developers or entrants that have come into the markets over the last 2 or 3 years. We are getting reverse inquiries more than we've seen recently for close to or fully entitled land sites. So again, we've got a healthy collection of different opportunities there. And the team's every bit as focused on how driving that kind of opportunity and we continue to see very good returns from our investments into the development pipeline."

In certain markets where supply may be more pronounced, you may have elongated lease up or some impact from that then alternatively. Some markets that do have a fair amount of suppliers still doing quite well because there's an inherent need and the market itself may be underserved and that frankly, is the reason why we chose to develop a specific asset there in the first place.
And then another part of the mix that we have out there is -- then we've got other assets that are clearly well ahead of our expectations. And we're seeing very good traction in a number of properties that are, again, ahead from that standpoint as well. The thing that is a natural part of our business as a whole is it -- not only is it is a factor of lease up, but then it's the maturity of the lease property, property itself. And what do I mean by that? The inventory leases that are at hand take a fair amount of time to mature and stabilize because you're going to see good growth and you're going to see good factors tied to that but that time needs to mature so that again, you've got a highly stabilized asset and you're able to evaluate its ultimate success."

So through 2018, we began to test in a number of different markets what we call our Property of Tomorrow platform, which is taking a number of key elements from our fifth generation product and overlaying it into the existing assets. Some of it's somewhat straightforward, meaning it's enhanced signage, updated [ painting ] schemes. We're also optimizing things like water usage through landscaping improvements, utilities around LEDs, changing the office environment because today's world environment with our new Web Champ 2 platform. We've gone completely paperless. We don't need filing cabinets anymore. We've got more space to create a better customer environment.
So all those things have played through quite well in the properties that we've tested thus far, which totals, say, less than 75 or so assets that we tested in a number of different markets through 2018. So this year, we're mainlining the rollout with all the feedback and the reaction that we've gotten from customers, employees, et cetera. And it's starting here on the West Coast. We're likely to touch anywhere from, say, 100 to 150 properties in the next 2 to 3 quarters here in California specifically, and then we'll be rolling it into a number of different markets literally for the next few years as we touch the entire portfolio.
In 2019, the cost tied to this is plus or minus about $100 million. And it wouldn't be surprising over the next few years, we spent $0.5 billion or more as we roll this entire plan out. And we like what we're seeing so far. So the properties that have been retooled to this new standard are seeing some residual benefit in a number of ways. It's still early in that regard, but we like what we're seeing. And we think it's really another way to amplify and enhance not only the curb appeal and the brand itself that resonates incredibly well to consumers, but it matches all the things that we are doing on an online basis as well. So again, it's a program we've got a lot of focus on and we're likely to see fair amount of capital in subsequent years that is going to be dedicated to this effort."

We've got a number of very vibrant strategies around that. We're looking for, not only cost efficiencies, but ways to make our full team as productive as possible.

I think some of that is tactics that we and others in the industry are using to attract good customers that will stay with us. I think part of that probably relates to the mix of customers that we've seen. If you look at things like housing sales in many of our markets across the country, a deceleration in housing transaction activity, which has meant fewer movers as a percentage of our customer base on the margin, all those types of things. And the reason I highlight that is movers tend to be shorter length of stay customers. All of those things have resulted in more tenants staying longer and lower move-out volumes [ than ] we've been reporting. That is certainly helpful to our existing tenant rate increase program. As they stay longer, they are eligible for rate increases.
I do think the other thing that's happening in some markets, as you're seeing real resilience in demand for the sector, and I highlighted earlier on the call, markets like Washington, D.C. or Chicago, which were hit by new facilities earlier in the development cycle as we're seeing real occupancy gains there which is certainly supporting revenue growth as we get through 2019.

But as we talked about in the past, we focused more on move-in rates as those are the rates that customers will ultimately pay us once they become a customer. Our move-in rates were down 4% for the quarter and this was the lever that we use to drive move-in volumes. Our move-in volumes were flat year-over-year, which is one of the better quarters we've seen on move-in trends over the past couple of years. In terms of other levers that we utilized in order to drive that performance, advertising being one of them, and a little bit less in promotional discounts, but flat on street rates and down 4% on movie grades."

The power of the Public Storage platform online. Advertising was up 49% in the quarter. That follows up 28% quarter in the first quarter. And as I've said in prior calls, we are going to continue to push on that level as we see good returns there. So we expect to continue to utilize that leverage the second half of '19 as well. In terms of other levers we talked about using movie grades and promotional discounts, well promotional discounts were down in the quarter, that is a method that we continue to use primarily our dollars special for the first month rent and we will continue to use that to the second half of '19 as well."

T",420,"Yes, Jeremy, I think first of all, certainly we were encouraged by the fact that we saw another step up in our revenue growth so we have been seeing acceleration, if you look at the quarter-to-quarter performance sequentially over the last few quarters. Tom just reviewed,one of the important ingredients and unique capabilities that we've got relative to leveraging the power of our brand, the initiatives we've got around customer search efforts and the things that we do operationally that continue to navigate what clearly continues to be market to market, in some cases a heavy level of competition that is and could be with us for some period of time. 
We've been now in this band, say the 1% to 2% of revenue range, you can look at our predicted metrics going into Q3 kind of puts us in that same range more or less. The things that we continue to use and drive relative to the capabilities, however, are encouraging because again, quarter-to-quarter, we're unlocking and using different tools and different levers to continue to drive the level of activity, customer acquisition and things that we can do to operate, again, in some cases, a very competitive market. 
Supply, as I mentioned, is going to be with us. This year, our tracking points to again another of about $5 billion worth of deliveries. We think, in 2020, it's going to taper down a bit, maybe 10% to 15%, but you can't ignore the fact that it's still heavy. It is shifting and we've talked about that for the last few quarters from some of the more heavily impacted markets that got hit early in the cycle to markets now that we got even more focus on knowing that we're going to have to, again, ramp up our efforts to compete with new supply, whether it's in a market like Miami, Boston, Portland, Oregon. So we're keeping it a very close eye, and again, getting geared up to make sure we are as effective there as we've been over the last few quarters, dealing with these other markets that have been hit hard. But the good news is, the resiliency of the business overall is strong. Our customer base and encourages us because we are seeing really no different behavior. Customer continues to be quite sticky, and again, it talks to the overall resiliency, coupled with the fact that our own capabilities of scale, the brand and the technological tools that we are continuing to develop our working well."

And again, there's -- without question, kind of points to on the flip side, what we've been seeing on the acquisition front, there is a growing old is out there that are taking product to market, they've got more sensible expectations relative to exit values. So we're seeing some good opportunities evolve on that end of the spectrum, but at the same time, many developers still look at this product as a very attractive product to be built, whether it is to own shorter-term -- short-term or long-term and or just flip because in some cases, they can make a return see where an environment where we are seeing markets oversupply. So again, we're dealing with these levels of deliveries as an industry, we haven't seen before. And as we all know, it can take anywhere from 2, 3 or 4 years in many cases for these deliveries to be stabilized until they are. you, which is a competitive factor you have to deal with."

And second from me and you just touch on a little, but if I look at where you are buying in terms of price per pound and as I look at where you are able to do the expansions and the developments and even the yields you've talked about in the past, it seems like a pretty good trade-off here. So just wondering what if anything is holding you back from doing more development and the expansions just given that obviously capital is an issue. Is it just human capital, is that their availability of sides are expansion potential that as you look at it?"

So one of the things that we've talked about is the fact that we've got a pool of assets that in some cases we've owned for 3 and 4 decades that continually become candidates for potential expansion. Now you can look at that and say, okay, just go do it all at once or tackle it at 1 time, but property to the property, city to city, you have to work through a variety of different entitlements, processes. In some cases, you can't make any changes and others, you have to go into negotiations or processes that could take months, years in some cases so you've got that factor at hand. And then the other thing that we are very cognizant of is the impact that any expansion create an existing revenue stream on a particular asset. So you've got to calibrate around all those factors. The things that we've been able to do is identify and leverage the skills that we've got in our development team into that effort. So you've seen on a proportionate basis, as we stand today, about 64% of our overall development pipeline is tied into redevelopment. Now the thing that has been trending down over the last few quarters, we haven't seen as many land opportunities that have been attractive, but there is some level of similarity with what's going on with land as it relates to what we're seeing on just pure acquisitions, meaning, there are a broader pool of owners out there that we're seeing that are coming to us and saying, hey, I've got a piece of property. I thought I was going to take it through full entitlements or maybe it's already entitled, but I'm not going to take that next step to develop. So we're encouraged by that and the development teams are working hard to pull even more of those opportunities one by one particularly if they not only makes sense in the near term, but long-term as well. So we've got, I think, some good opportunities in that realm going into the cycle that we're seeing ahead of us. So thanks, Jimmy. I think we're going to take the next question."

So 1381 square foot in the quarter, higher by about $0.22 a square foot. Historically, the seasonal uptick is a little bit greater from 1Q to 2Q and then, rents tend to decline are the seasonally adjusted basis throughout the off peak season. Is the more muted increase this quarter indicative of the pressure we're seeing across the system and would you expect the same seasonal patterns to hold throughout the balance of the year or have you made some changes to pricing our or otherwise that may cause seasonal trends to change a little bit. I was wondering if you could speak to that."

I did comment earlier around move-in rates being down 4% year-over-year, which certainly takes into consideration seasonality of our rental rate as we go through. I think generally speaking, you're going to continue to see the seasonality as occupancy and our move-in traffic is higher in the summer months than it is as we get into the fall and into the winter months. So seasonality is not going to change. But we did use lower move-in rates in the second quarter as one of the levers to drive volumes. So to give you an example, Miami, which is a tougher market, that Joe highlighted where we're seeing new supply impact operations there. We were successful in driving move-in traffic there. Move-ins were up year-over-year despite the incremental new supply, but we did utilize rate on an advertising. So rates were down, call it 7%, 8% on move-ins in Miami in the second quarter. So there's no question that there is a rate pressure where there is new supply and we're also utilizing rates to drive volumes in some of those markets."

The first around just performance of existing tenants and their willingness to continue to remain customers post a rate increase to the rental rates and that's very consistent. In fact, trending positively as we've gone through the quarter. So we disclosed in the 10-Q move, out volumes were down, which is what drove the increase in occupancy throughout the quarter, average up 20 basis points actually finished up 50 basis points in the quarter. So while move-ins were flat, move-outs were down and that's because that existing tenant base is performing quite well. The existing tenants are exhibiting great dynamics. If you look at delinquency numbers, that are supported by wage growth, the great labor market, so lots of good things happening there for existing tenants and we continue to see that throughout the portfolio. In terms of rate strategies in different markets, certainly, what's going on with the move-in dynamics and move-out dynamics within a local market will impact of our strategies for existing kind of rate increases, I'm not going to go into details their, but certainly those are some of the factors considered. In terms of how things are trending into July, are down again in July. So again, very consistent trends."

So from a customers' standpoint, I wouldn't point you at anything that shifted material -- materially whether you link into becoming a different type of customer. The good news is they are becoming good customers. And there is no both statistical and/or trend that we could point to that says that that's any different than what we've seen with other generations as they age into the kinds of things that drives them to take down and storage unit. So many of the very similar and same drivers that have affected by our generation so to now affecting million dollars years if you could even argue, there is an end of the day, as we speak today, maybe fewer homeowners out there that are much more sensitized to the cost of owning a home that they are looking at smaller apartments. They are making trade-offs of keeping there is a turnoff in lower alternatives in storage. We are seeing good traction. We're doing a lot of surveys relative to the types of customers that are coming into us, and again, no change there.

There's a variety of different reasons we've seen the uptick in acquisition volume. It's included some owners that have come to us directly. They haven't taken their properties out to market, whether it is because, again, they are under some level of duress and/or they've just made a decision that time to exit either a specific property or whatever size platform they may have. And with that, we've seen a variety of different occupancy levels. We continue to look at properties that range anywhere from either newly developed and/or fully stabilized. I can point you to we did a 4 building acquisition in the Miami area. Each of the buildings had different levels of occupancy, 1  or 2 or more stabilized than the other 2 that have been more recently delivered to the market. So there's a range there. And we are seeing and hearing that there are -- there's a lot of activity out there relative to particularly within the brokerage community, brokers are being asked to come and do valuations for orders in the last quarter, we saw a lot of inquiries coming into us with a gain a full range of different times situations, all of which we consider. We are in the we take a look at. So we really haven't changed on our end the way that we continue to analyze and look at returns that we can get from these investments. But we're seeing our sellers that are far more agreeable and more anxious to make a decision to exit. And some, again, have gone to maybe clear and more evident levels of stress. Others, again, have just made a more rational decision and said it's time and a good point in the cycle to consider an exit as maybe a level or a price that 1  or 2 years ago was much more elevated and we wouldn't have engaged from a conversation and today we are.

There's a number of different conflicting drivers that are still in the mix. So there are still a lot of investors, private equity and otherwise that are coming into the sector that haven't been in self-storage before. So there is some fuel that comes from that. As I mentioned, there is still development returns some individual developers say it is still a good reward risk balance. So they may launch and still may get the funding to do with. On the flip side, I don't disagree with your comments that I think more and more renters are becoming more stringent and the way that they are in and basically putting lending packages out to developers. So hopefully, that creates some level of added discipline we haven't seen, but again, there's still fuel out there. And like I said, we're sensing that there is likely to be in that 10% to 15% stage or shift down going from this year to next year, but that is still puts you north of $4 billion of deliveries. That is a lot of product. So we are keeping a very close eye and we are not confused about how it impacts certain markets as I mentioned earlier, and the good news is we feel more and more encouraged that we've got the playbook to continue to navigate around it."

It can range from a percentage standpoint, property to property, anywhere from easily say, 10%, 15%, 20% to sometimes much higher, again, depending on the location of a particular property.

We opened that just a little",462,"Well, we certainly have done more than We've got now several facilities that are closed and in fact, Jersey City is now larger than Jersey City, our largest current system, our current property in our system, about 4200 units. We opened that just a little over 2 years ago. Today, it's nearly 90% occupied. So what leads us to and how we basically place design and configure something of that magnitude in A market is, we use a lot of analytics. We look at the level of competitive activity and then we take a lot of day-to-day metrics we see in like properties that we may own and particularly decide how big to go. But there's no question, the bigger facilities like this create another level of complexity that again, we have to tune our operational teams again, handle. So Jersey City, it wouldn't be unusual, for instance, as we fill that property up to have 40 to 50 move-ins literally on a weekend. And if you bench that against kind of a traditional size storage facility, that might be a volume we see in a month. So you've got to have a team of people running the asset, you've got a different level, you've got different complexity relative to the design of the facility itself, number of elevators, the way the floor to floor configuration works on unit sizes. And with the amenities though however, with these bigger facilities, customers love them. And again, they are very efficient, very customer service-oriented because we are running, again, larger teams that are clearly accessible and at the counter and are open all day long, and again, we are looking and expanding their plan from where it makes sense in many different parts of the country. So that too, if a character that some of the activity that we're seeing on the acquisition side, naïvely, a number of orders or developers have come into the business thinking okay, it's a good idea to just go as big as we can. We'll go into the city, if we were thinking about building a 50,000 or 75,000 square-foot product, we'll go to 100,000 or 125,000 or even in some cases, larger than that without the skill, knowledge and capability to actually run a facility of that size and it's not unusual and we see it time and again, where a facility like that can get to 50% or 60% occupied and it just stalls. Because if you don't have the ability to drive volume, understand how to cater to existing customers, if you haven't got the right technology capabilities of our day-to-day customer, you are going to flatline. Now that creates in many cases, a good opportunity for us and we are seeing more and more."

Without getting into too much detail as to how returns are calculated, it's a pretty simple concept about what the customer worth to us and what are the acquisition costs all in, which it takes to acquire that customer, and ultimately get them to move-in. And so, we have the ability in today's world online to track and understand much more about our customers and to be able to do that, those bids much more dynamically than done in the past. So we can monitor those returns on a customer by customer bases and a keyword by keyword basis. 
In terms of the overall cost and the competitiveness online, there's no question that we're not only one pushing on this lever. Some of our traditional operating competitors are pushing on that lever as well and probably seeing similar good returns. So we'd expect that to continue. In addition, we have other folks, both regional operators as well as storage operators and other types of folks that are bidding on keywords and driving the cost per click higher. On the last call, I noted that cost per click for similar positioning was probably up double digits, maybe call it teens, it's north of that today."

But as we've talked about in the past, we focus more on move-in rates, as those are the rates that customers will ultimately pay us once they become a customer. Our move-in rates were down 4% for the quarter, and this was the lever that we used to drive move-in volumes. Our move-in volumes were flat year-over-year, which is one of the better quarters we've seen on move-in trends over the past couple of years. In terms of other levers that we utilized in order to drive that move-in performance, advertising clearly being one of them and a little bit less in promotional discounts, but flat on street rates and down 4% on move-in rates."

And we like what we're seeing there. Public Storage has real advantages online with our brand name and our scale in local markets with which we can drive move-ins into the local inventory, the power of the Public Storage platform online. Advertising was up 49% in the quarter. That follows up 28% quarter in the first quarter. And as I've said in prior calls, we're going to continue to push on that lever as we see good returns there. So we'd expect that we continue to utilize that lever in the second half of '19 as well. In terms of other levers we talked about using move-in rates and promotional discounts, while promotional discounts were down in the quarter, that is a method that we continue to use, primarily our $1 special for the first month rent, and we'll continue to use that through the second half of '19 as well."

Tom just reviewed one of the important ingredients and unique capabilities that we've got relative to leveraging the power of our brand, the initiatives we've got around customer search efforts and the things that we do operationally that continue to give us tools to navigate what clearly continues to be market-to-market, in some cases, a heavy level of competition that is with us and could be with us for some period of time. 
We've been now in this band, say, the 1% to 2% revenue range. You can look at our predicted metrics going into Q3 kind of puts us in that same range more or less. The things that we continue to use and drive relative to the capabilities, however, are encouraging, because again, quarter-to-quarter, we're unlocking and using different tools and different levers to continue to drive the level of activity, customer acquisition and things that we can do to operate, again in some cases, a very competitive market. 
Supply, as I mentioned, is going to be with us. This year, our tracking points to again another year of about $5 billion worth of deliveries. We think, in 2020, it's going to taper down a bit, maybe 10% to 15%, but you can't ignore the fact that's still heavy. It is shifting and we've talked about that for the last few quarters from some of the more heavily impacted markets that got hit early in the cycle to markets now that we've got even more focus on, knowing that we're going to have to, again, ramp up our efforts to compete with new supply, whether it's in a market like Miami, Boston, Portland, Oregon. So we're keeping a very close eye, and again, getting geared up to make sure that we're as effective there as we've been over the last few quarters dealing with these other markets that have been hit hard. But the good news is the resiliency of the business overall is strong. Our customer base encourages us, because we're seeing really no different behavior. Customer continue to be quite sticky. And again, it talks to the overall resiliency, coupled with the fact that our own capabilities of scale, the brand and the technological tools that we're continuing to develop are working well."

And again, there's -- without question, that kind of points to, on the flip side, what we've been seeing on the acquisition front. There is a growing pool of owners out there that are taking product to market, they've got more sensible expectations relative to exit values. So we're seeing some good opportunities evolve on that end of the spectrum. But at the same time, many developers still look at this product as a very attractive product to be built, whether it's to own shorter term -- short term or long term and or just flip, because in some cases, they can make good returns even in an environment where we're seeing many markets oversupplied. So again, we're dealing with these levels of deliveries as an industry we haven't seen before. And as we all know, it can take anywhere from 2, 3 or 4 years in many cases for these deliveries to get stabilized. And until they are, it's a competitive factor you've got to deal with."

And second from me and you just touched on it a little, but if I look at where you're buying in terms of price per pound and I look at where you're able to do the expansions and the developments and even the yields you've talked about in the past, it seems like a pretty good trade-off here. So just wondering what if anything is holding you back from doing more development and the expansions, just given that obviously capital is an issue? Is it just human capital? Is it the availability of sites or expansion potential that -- as you look at it?"

So one of the things that we've talked about is the fact that we've got a pool of assets that in some cases we've owned for 3 and 4 decades that continually become good candidates for potential expansions. Now you can look at that and say, okay, just go do it all at once or tackle it at one time, but property to property, city to city, you have to work through a variety of different entitlement processes. In some cases, you can't make any changes, and others, you have to go into negotiations or processes that could take months, years in some cases. So you've got that factor at hand. And then the other thing that we're very cognizant of is the impact that any expansion creates to an existing revenue stream on a particular asset. So you've got to calibrate around all those factors. The things that we've been able to do is identify and leverage the skills that we've got in our development team into that effort. So you've seen on a proportionate basis, as we stand today, about 64% of our overall development pipeline is tied into redevelopment. Now the thing that has been trending down over the last few quarters, we haven't seen as many land opportunities that have been attractive, but there is some level of similarity with what's going on with land as it relates to what we're seeing on just pure acquisitions, meaning there are a broader pool of owners out there that we're seeing that are coming to us and saying, ""Hey, I've got a piece of property. I thought I was going to take it through full entitlements or maybe it's already entitled, but I'm not going to take that next step to develop."" So we're encouraged by that, and the development teams are working hard to pull even more of those opportunities in one-by-one, particularly if they not only make sense in the near term, but long term as well. So we've got, I think, some good opportunities in that realm going into the cycle that we're seeing ahead of us too. So thanks, Jeremy. I think we're going to take the next question."

So 1,381 square foot in the quarter, higher by about $0.22 a square foot. Historically, the seasonal uptick is a little bit greater from 1Q to 2Q, and then rents tend to decline on a seasonally adjusted basis throughout the off-peak season. Is the more muted increase this quarter indicative of the pressure you're seeing across the system, and would you expect the same seasonal patterns to hold throughout the balance of the year? Or have you made some changes to pricing or otherwise that might cause those seasonal trends to change a little bit? I was just wondering if you could speak to that."

I did comment earlier around move-in rates being down 4% year-over-year, which certainly takes into consideration some of the seasonality of our rental rates as we go through. I think generally speaking, you're going to continue to see the seasonality as our occupancy and our move-in traffic is higher in the summer months than it is as we get into the fall and into the winter months. So the seasonality is not going to change. But we did use lower move-in rates in the second quarter as one of the levers to drive volumes. So to give you an example, Miami, which is a tougher market that Joe highlighted where we're seeing new supply impact operations there, we were successful in driving move-in traffic there. Move-ins were up year-over-year despite the incremental new supply, but we did utilize rate and advertising. So rates were down, call it, 7%, 8% on move-ins in Miami in the second quarter. So there's no question that there is that rate pressure where there's new supply and we're also utilizing rates to drive volume in some of those markets."

And then as you push through rate increases to existing customers during the quarter and usually, May, June and July are bigger months for that, any pushback or change from customers or change in the rent increase program throughout the peak season as results started to come in?

So the first component around just performance on existing tenants and their willingness to continue to remain customers post a rate increase to the rental rates, that's very consistent, in fact, trending positively as we've gone through the quarter. So we disclosed in the 10-Q, move-out volumes were down, which is what drove the increase in occupancy throughout the quarter, average up 20 basis points and actually finished up 50 basis points in the quarter. So while move-ins were flat, move-outs were down, and that's because that existing tenant base is performing quite well. The existing tenants are exhibiting great dynamics. You look at delinquency numbers, they're supported by wage growth, the great labor market, so lots of good things happening there for our existing tenants and we continue to see that throughout the portfolio. In terms of rate strategies in different markets, certainly what's going on with the move-in and move-out dynamics within a local market will impact our strategies for existing tenant rate increases, I'm not going to go into detail there, but certainly those are some of the factors considered. In terms of how things have trended into July, move-outs are down again in July, so again, very consistent trends."

So from a customer's standpoint, I wouldn't point you at anything that's shifted material -- materially whether you link it to millennials are becoming a different type of customer. The good news is they're becoming good customers. And there's no both statistical and/or trend that we could point to that says that that's any different than what we've seen with other generations as they age into the kinds of things that drive them to side to take down a self-storage unit. So many of the very similar and same drivers that have affected prior generations are too now affecting millennials. You could even argue, there is, at the end of the day, as we speak today, maybe fewer homeowners out there that are much more sensitized to the cost of owning a home they're looking at smaller apartments. They're making trade-offs of keeping their stuff in lower-cost alternatives and storage that's quite well with that. We are seeing good traction. We're doing a lot of surveys relative to the types of customers that are coming in to us, and again, no change there. In fact, we're continually encouraged that, that too is evolving into a very powerful type of consumer that we see driving our business just as other generations have.

Smedes, there's a variety of different reasons we've seen the uptick in acquisition volume. It's included some owners that have come to us directly. They haven't taken their properties out to market, whether it's because, again, they're under some level of duress and/or they've just made a decision that it's time to exit either a specific property or whatever the size platform they may have. And with that, we've seen a variety of different occupancy levels. We continue to look at properties that range anywhere from either newly developed and/or fully stabilized. I can point you to -- we did a 4 building acquisition in the Miami area. Each of the buildings had different levels of occupancy, 1  or 2 or more stabilized and the other 2 that have been more recently delivered to the market. So there's a range there. And we are seeing and hearing that there are -- there's a lot of activity out there relative to, particularly within the brokerage community, brokers are being asked to come in and do valuations for owners. In the last quarter, we saw a lot of inquiries coming in to us with, again, a full range of different types of situations, let's just call it that, all of which we consider. We underwrite, we take a look at. So we really haven't changed on our end the way that we continue to analyze and look at returns that we can get from these investments. But we're seeing our sellers that are far more agreeable and more anxious to make a decision to exit. And some, again, have gone to maybe clear and more evident levels of stress. Others, again, have just made a more rational decision and said it's time and a good point in the cycle to consider an exit at maybe a level or a price that 1  or 2 years ago was much more elevated and we wouldn't have engaged from a conversation and today we are. So as we reported, we've done more transaction volume this year than we did all of last year. We've got about $87 million under contract and we're seeing, again, beyond that good activity [indiscernible] some of the situations that are playing through."

There's a number of different conflicting drivers that are still in the mix. So there are still a lot of investors, private equity and otherwise, that are coming into the sector that haven't been in self-storage before. So there's some fuel that comes from that. As I mentioned, there are still development returns that some individual developers are going to look at and say it's still a good reward-risk balance. So they may launch and still may get the funding to do it. On the flip side, I don't disagree with your comment that I think more and more lenders are becoming more stringent and the way that they are underwriting and basically putting lending packages out to developers. So hopefully, that creates some level of added discipline we haven't seen. But again, there's still fuel out there. And like I said, we're sensing that there's likely to be in that 10% to 15% stage or shift down going from this year to next year, but that still puts you north of $4 billion of deliveries. That's a lot of product. So we're keeping a very close eye. We're not confused about how it impacts certain markets, as I mentioned earlier, and the good news is we feel more and more encouraged that we've got the playbook to continue to navigate around it."

It can range, from a percentage standpoint, property to property, anywhere from easily, say, 10%, 15%, 20% to sometimes much higher, again, depending on the location of a particular property.

We opened",465,"Well, we certainly have done more than Gerard. We've got now several facilities that are close, and in fact, Jersey City is now larger than Gerard. Jersey City is our largest current system, our current property in our system, about 4,200 units. We opened that just a little over 2 years ago. Today, it's nearly 90% occupied. So what leads us to and how we basically place design and configure something of that magnitude in a market is we use a lot of analytics, we look at the level of competitive activity and then we take a lot of day-to-day metrics we see in like properties that we may own and particularly decide how big to go. But there's no question, the bigger facilities like this create another level of complexity that, again, we have to tune our operational teams to, again, handle. So Jersey City, it wouldn't be unusual, for instance, as we fill that property up to have 40 to 50 move-ins literally on a weekend. And if you bench that against kind of a traditional size storage facility, that might be a volume we see in a month. So you've got to have a team of people running the asset, you've got -- at a different level, you've got different complexity relative to the design of the facility itself, number of elevators, the way the floor-to-floor configuration works on unit sizes. And with the amenities, though, however, with these bigger facilities, customers love them. And again, they are very efficient, very customer service-oriented, because we're running, again, larger teams that are clearly accessible and out the counter, opened all day long. And again, we're looking and expanding that platform where it makes sense in many different parts of the country. 
So that's too, though, if I connect that to some of the activity that we're seeing on the acquisition side, naïvely, a number of owners or developers have come into the business thinking, okay, it's a good idea to just go as big as we can. We'll go into the city. We'll -- if we were thinking about building a 50,000 or 75,000 square-foot product, we'll go to 100,000 or 125,000, or even in some cases, larger than that without the skill, knowledge and capability to actually run a facility of that size. And it's not unusual and we see it time and again where a facility like that can get to 50% or 60% occupied and it just stalls. Because if you don't have the ability to drive volume, understand how to cater to existing customers, if you haven't got the right technology capabilities or day-to-day customer service, you're going to flatline. Now that creates, in many cases, a good opportunity for us and we're seeing more and more of them."

So without getting into too much detail as to how returns are calculated, it's a pretty simple concept what's a customer worth to us and what are the acquisition costs all in, which it takes to acquire that customer and ultimately get them to move in.

So we can monitor those returns on a customer-by-customer basis and on a keyword-by-keyword basis. 
In terms of the overall cost and the competitiveness online, there's no question that we're not the only one pushing on this lever. Some of our traditional operating competitors are pushing on that lever as well and probably seeing similar good returns. So we'd expect that to continue. In addition, we have other folks, both regional operators as well as what's called valet storage operators and other types of folks that are bidding on keywords and driving the cost per click higher.

Public Storage has real advantages online with our brand name and our scale in local markets with which we can drive move-ins into the local inventory, the power of the Public Storage platform online. Advertising was up 49% in the quarter. That follows up 28% quarter in the first quarter. And as I've said in prior calls, we're going to continue to push on that lever as we see good returns there.

Tom just reviewed one of the important ingredients and unique capabilities that we've got relative to leveraging the power of our brand, the initiatives we've got around customer search efforts and the things that we do operationally that continue to give us tools to navigate what clearly continues to be market-to-market, in some cases, a heavy level of competition that is with us and could be with us for some period of time. 
We've been now in this band, say, the 1% to 2% revenue range. You can look at our predicted metrics going into Q3, kind of puts us in that same range more or less. The things that we continue to use and drive relative to the capabilities, however, are encouraging, because again, quarter-to-quarter, we're unlocking and using different tools and different levers to continue to drive the level of activity, customer acquisition and things that we can do to operate, again in some cases, a very competitive market. 
Supply, as I mentioned, is going to be with us. This year, our tracking points to again another year of about $5 billion worth of deliveries. We think, in 2020, it's going to taper down a bit, maybe 10% to 15%, but you can't ignore the fact that's still heavy. It is shifting and we've talked about that for the last few quarters from some of the more heavily impacted markets that got hit early in the cycle to markets now that we've got even more focus on, knowing that we're going to have to, again, ramp up our efforts to compete with new supply, whether it's in a market like Miami, Boston, Portland, Oregon. So we're keeping a very close eye, and again, getting geared up to make sure that we're as effective there as we've been over the last few quarters dealing with these other markets that have been hit hard. But the good news is the resiliency of the business overall is strong. Our customer base encourages us, because we're seeing really no different behavior. Customers continue to be quite sticky. And again, it talks to the overall resiliency, coupled with the fact that our own capabilities, so scale, the brand and the technological tools that we're continuing to develop are working well."

And again, there's -- without question, that kind of points to, on the flip side, what we've been seeing on the acquisition front. There is a growing pool of owners out there that are taking product to market, they've got more sensible expectations relative to exit values. So we're seeing some good opportunities evolve on that end of the spectrum. But at the same time, many developers still look at this product, as a very attractive product to be built, whether it's to own shorter term -- short term or long term and/or just flip, because in some cases, they can make good returns even in an environment where we're seeing many markets oversupplied. So again, we're dealing with these levels of deliveries as an industry we haven't seen before. And as we all know, it can take anywhere from 2, 3 or 4 years in many cases for these deliveries to get stabilized. And until they are, it's a competitive factor you've got to deal with."

And second from me and you just touched on it a little, but if I look at where you're buying in terms of price per pound and I look at where you're able to do the expansions and the developments and even the yields you've talked about in the past, it seems like a pretty good trade-off here. So just wondering what if anything is holding you back from doing more development and the expansions, just given that obviously capital isn't an issue? Is it just human capital? Is it the availability of sites or expansion potential that -- as you look at it?"

So one of the things that we've talked about is the fact that we've got a pool of assets that in some cases we've owned for 3 and 4 decades that continually become good candidates for potential expansions. Now you can look at that and say, okay, just go do it all at once or tackle it at one time, but property to property, city to city, you have to work through a variety of different entitlement processes. In some cases, you can't make any changes, and others, you have to go into negotiations or processes that could take months, years in some cases. So you've got that factor at hand. And then the other thing that we're very cognizant of is the impact that any expansion creates to an existing revenue stream on a particular asset. So you've got to calibrate around all those factors. The things that we've been able to do is identify and leverage the skills that we've got in our development team into that effort. So you've seen on a proportionate basis, as we stand today, about 64% of our overall development pipeline is tied into redevelopment. Now the thing that has been trending down over the last few quarters, we haven't seen as many land opportunities that have been attractive, but there is some level of similarity with what's going on with land as it relates to what we're seeing on just pure acquisitions, meaning there are a broader pool of owners out there that we're seeing, that are coming to us and saying, ""Hey, I've got a piece of property. Thought I was going to take it through full entitlements or maybe it's already entitled, but I'm not going to take that next step to develop."" So we're encouraged by that, and the development team's out working hard to pull even more of those opportunities in one-by-one, particularly if they not only make sense in the near term, but long term as well. So we've got, I think, some good opportunities in that realm going into the cycle that we're seeing ahead of us too. So thanks, Jeremy. I think we're going to take the next question."

So $13.81 square foot in the quarter, higher by about $0.22 a square foot. Historically, the seasonal uptick is a little bit greater from 1Q to 2Q, and then rents tend to decline on a seasonally adjusted basis throughout the off-peak season. Is the more muted increase this quarter indicative of the pressure you're seeing across the system, and would you expect the same seasonal patterns to hold throughout the balance of the year? Or have you made some changes to pricing or otherwise that might cause those seasonal trends to change a little bit? I was just wondering if you could speak to that."

I did comment earlier around move-in rates being down 4% year-over-year, which certainly takes into consideration some of the seasonality of our rental rates as we go through. I think generally speaking, you're going to continue to see the seasonality as our occupancy and our move-in traffic is higher in the summer months than it is as we get into the fall and into the winter months. So the seasonality's not going to change. But we did use lower move-in rates in the second quarter as one of the levers to drive volumes. So to give you an example, Miami, which is a tougher market that Joe highlighted where we're seeing new supply impact operations there, we were successful in driving move-in traffic there. Move-ins were up year-over-year despite the incremental new supply, but we did utilize rate and advertising. So rates were down, call it, 7%, 8% on move-ins in Miami in the second quarter. So there's no question that there is rate pressure where there's new supply and we're also utilizing rates to drive volume in some of those markets."

So the first component around just performance of the existing tenants and their willingness to continue to remain customers post a rate increase to the rental rates, so that's very consistent, in fact, trending positively as we've gone through the quarter. So as we disclosed in the 10-Q, move-out volumes were down, which is what drove the increase in occupancy throughout the quarter, average up 20 basis points and actually finished up 50 basis points in the quarter. So while move-ins were flat, move-outs were down, and that's because that existing tenant base is performing quite well. The existing tenants are exhibiting great dynamics. You look at delinquency numbers, they're supported by wage growth, the great labor market, so lots of good things happening there for our existing tenants and we continue to see that throughout the portfolio. In terms of rate strategies in different markets, certainly what's going on with the move-in and move-out dynamics within a local market will impact our strategies for existing tenant rate increases, I'm not going to go into detail there, but certainly those are some of the factors considered. In terms of how things have trended into July, move-outs are down again in July, so again, very consistent trends."

The good news is they're becoming good customers period. And there's no both statistical and/or trend that we could point to that says that that's any different than what we've seen with other generations as they age into the kinds of things that drive them to decide to take down a self-storage unit. So many of the very similar and same drivers that have affected prior generations are too now affecting millennials. You could even argue, there is, at the end of the day, as we speak today, maybe fewer homeowners out there that are much more sensitized to the cost of owning a home they're looking at smaller apartments. They're making trade-offs of keeping their stuff in lower-cost alternatives and storage fits quite well with that. We are seeing good traction. We're doing a lot of surveys relative to the types of customers that are coming in to us, and again, no change there. In fact, we're continually encouraged that, that too is evolving into a very powerful type of consumer that we see driving our business just as other generations have.

They haven't taken their properties out to market, whether it's because, again, they're under some level of duress and/or they've just made a decision that it's time to exit either a specific property or [ whatever ] size platform they may have. And with that, we've seen a variety of different occupancy levels. We continue to look at properties that range anywhere from either newly developed and/or fully stabilized. I can point you to -- we did a 4 building acquisition in the Miami area. Each of the buildings had different levels of occupancy, 1  or 2 are more stabilized than the other 2 that have been more recently delivered to the market. So there's a range there. And we are seeing and hearing that there are -- there's a lot of activity out there relative to, particularly within the brokerage community, brokers are being asked to come in and do valuations for owners. In the last quarter, we saw a lot of inquiries coming in to us with, again, a full range of different types of situations, let's just call it that, all of which we consider. We underwrite, we take a look at. So we really haven't changed on our end the way that we continue to analyze and look at returns that we can get from these investments. What we are seeing are sellers that are far more agreeable and more anxious to make a decision to exit. And some, again, have gone to maybe clear and more evident levels of stress. Others, again, have just made a more rational decision and said it's time and a good point in the cycle to consider an exit at maybe a level or a price that 1  or 2 years ago was much more elevated and we wouldn't have engaged from a conversation and today we are. So as we reported, we've done more transaction volume this year than we did all of last year. We've got about $87 million under contract and we're seeing, again, beyond that good activity and are encouraged by some of the situations that are playing through."

There's a number of different conflicting drivers that are still in the mix. So there are still a lot of investors, private equity and otherwise, that are coming into the sector that haven't been in self-storage before. So there's some fuel that comes from that. As I mentioned, there are still development returns that some individual developers are going to look at and say it's still a good reward-risk balance. So they may launch and still may get the funding to do it. On the flip side, I don't disagree with your comment that I think more and more lenders are becoming more stringent in the way that they are underwriting and basically putting lending packages out to developers. So hopefully, that creates some level of added discipline we haven't seen. But again, there's still fuel out there. And like I said, we're sensing that there's likely to be in that 10% to 15% stage or shift down going from this year to next year, but that still puts you north of $4 billion of deliveries. That's a lot of product. So we're keeping a very close eye out. We're not confused about how it impacts certain markets, as I mentioned earlier, and the good news is we feel more and more encouraged that we've got the playbook to continue to navigate around it."

It can range, from a percentage standpoint, property to property, anywhere from easily, say, 10%, 15%, 20% to sometimes much higher, again, depending on the location of a particular property.

We opened",470,"Well, we certainly have done more than Gerard. We've got now several facilities that are close, and in fact, Jersey City is now larger than Gerard. Jersey City is our largest current system, or current property in our system, about 4,200 units. We opened that just a little over 2 years ago. Today, it's nearly 90% occupied. So what leads us to and how we basically place, design and configure something of that magnitude in a market is we use a lot of analytics, we look at the level of competitive activity and then we take a lot of the day-to-day metrics we see in like properties that we may own [ in a particular area ] decide how big to go. But there's no question, the bigger facilities like this create another level of complexity that, again, we have to tune our operational teams to, again, handle. So Jersey City, it wouldn't be unusual, for instance, as we fill that property up to have 40 to 50 move-ins literally on a weekend. And if you bench that against kind of a traditional size storage facility, that might be a volume you'd see in a month. So you've got to have a team of people running the asset, you've got -- at a different level, you've got different complexity relative to the design of the facility itself, number of elevators, the way the floor-to-floor configuration works on unit sizes. And with the amenities, though, however, with these bigger facilities, customers love them. And again, they are very efficient, very customer service-oriented, because we're running, again, larger teams that are clearly accessible and at the counter, opened all day long. And again, we're looking and expanding that platform where it makes sense in many different parts of the country. 
So that's too, though, if I connect that to some of the activity that we're seeing on the acquisition side, naïvely, a number of owners or developers have come into the business thinking, okay, it's a good idea to just go as big as we can. We'll go into the city. We'll -- if we were thinking about building a 50,000 or 75,000 square-foot product, we'll go to 100,000 or 125,000, or even in some cases, larger than that without the skill, knowledge and capability to actually run a facility of that size. And it's not unusual and we see it time and again where a facility like that can get to 50% or 60% occupied and it just stalls. Because if you don't have the ability to drive volume, understand how to cater to existing customers, if you haven't got the right technology capabilities or day-to-day customer service, you're going to flatline. Now that creates, in many cases, a good opportunity for us and we're seeing more and more of them."

So without getting into too much detail as to how returns are calculated, it's a pretty simple concept around what's a customer worth to us and what are the acquisition costs all-in, with which it takes to acquire that customer and ultimately get them to move in.

So we can monitor those returns on a customer-by-customer basis and with a keyword-by-keyword basis. 
In terms of the overall cost and the competitiveness online, there's no question that we're not the only one pushing on this lever. Some of our traditional operating competitors are pushing on that lever as well and probably seeing similar good returns. So we'd expect that to continue. In addition, we have other folks, both regional operators as well as what's called valet storage operators and other types of folks that are bidding on keywords and driving the cost per click higher.

Tom just reviewed one of the important ingredients and unique capabilities that we've got relative to leveraging the power of our brand, the initiatives we've got around customer search efforts and the things that we do operationally that continue to give us tools to navigate what clearly continues to be market-to-market, in some cases, a heavy level of competition that is with us and could be with us for some period of time. 
We've been now in this band, say, the 1% to 2% revenue range. You can look at our predicted metrics going into Q3, kind of puts us in that same range more or less. The things that we continue to use and drive relative to the capabilities, however, are encouraging, because again, quarter-to-quarter, we're unlocking and using different tools and different levers to continue to drive the level of activity, customer acquisition and things that we can do to operate, again in some cases, a very competitive market. 
Supply, as I mentioned, is going to be with us. This year, our tracking points to again another year of about $5 billion worth of deliveries. We think, in 2020, it's going to taper down a bit, maybe 10% to 15%, but you can't ignore the fact that's still heavy. It is shifting and we've talked about that for the last few quarters from some of the more heavily impacted markets that got hit early in the cycle to markets now that we've got even more focus on, knowing that we're going to have to, again, ramp up our efforts to compete with new supply, whether it's in a market like Miami, Boston, Portland, Oregon. So we're keeping a very close eye, and again, getting geared up to make sure that we're as effective there as we've been over the last few quarters dealing with these other markets that have been hit hard. But the good news is the resiliency of the business overall is strong. Our customer base encourages us because we're seeing really no different behavior. Customers continue to be quite sticky. And again, it talks to the overall resiliency, coupled with the fact that our own capabilities, so scale, the brand and the technological tools that we're continuing to develop are working well."

There is a growing pool of owners out there that are taking product to market, they've got more sensible expectations relative to exit values. So we're seeing some good opportunities evolve on that end of the spectrum. But at the same time, many developers still look at this product as a very attractive product to be built, whether it's to own shorter term -- short term or long term and/or just flip, because in some cases, they can make good returns even in an environment where we're seeing many markets oversupplied. So again, we're dealing with these levels of deliveries as an industry we haven't seen before. And as we all know, it can take anywhere from 2, 3 or 4 years in many cases for these deliveries to get stabilized. And until they are, it's a competitive factor you've got to deal with."

Is it the availability of sites or expansion potential that -- as you look at it?"

So one of the things that we've talked about is the fact that we've got a pool of assets that in some cases we've owned for 3 and 4 decades that continually become good candidates for potential expansions. Now you can look at that and say, okay, just go do it all at once or tackle it at one time, but property to property, city to city, you have to work through a variety of different entitlement processes. In some cases, you can't make any changes, and others, you have to go into negotiations or processes that could take months, years in some cases. So you've got that factor at hand. And then the other thing that we're very cognizant of is the impact that any expansion creates to an existing revenue stream on a particular asset. So you've got to calibrate around all those factors. The things that we've been able to do is identify and leverage the skills that we've got in our development team into that effort. So you've seen on a proportionate basis, as we stand today, about 64% of our overall development pipeline is tied into redevelopment. Now the thing that has been trending down over the last few quarters, we haven't seen as many land opportunities that have been attractive, but there is some level of similarity with what's going on with land as it relates to what we're seeing on just pure acquisitions, meaning there are a broader pool of owners out there that we're seeing, that are coming to us and saying, ""Hey, I've got a piece of property. Thought I was going to take it through full entitlements or maybe it's already entitled, but I'm not going to take that next step to develop."" So we're encouraged by that, and the development team's out working hard to pull even more of those opportunities in one-by-one, particularly if they not only make sense in the near term, but long term as well. So we've got, I think, some good opportunities in that realm going into the cycle that we're seeing ahead of us too. So thanks, Jeremy. I think we're going to take the next question."

So $13.81 square foot in the quarter, higher by about $0.22 a square foot. Historically, the seasonal uptick is a little bit greater from 1Q to 2Q, and then rents tend to decline on a seasonally adjusted basis throughout the off-peak season. Is the more muted increase this quarter indicative of the pressure you're seeing across the system, and would you expect the same seasonal patterns to hold throughout the balance of the year? Or have you made some changes to pricing or otherwise that might cause those seasonal trends to change a little bit? I was just wondering if you could speak to that."

I did comment earlier around move-in rates being down 4% year-over-year, which certainly takes into consideration some of the seasonality of our rental rates as we go through. I think generally speaking, you're going to continue to see the seasonality as our occupancy and our move-in traffic is higher in the summer months than it is as we get into the fall and into the winter months. So the seasonality's not going to change. But we did use lower move-in rates in the second quarter as one of the levers to drive volumes. So to give you an example, Miami, which is a tougher market that Joe highlighted where we're seeing new supply impact operations there, we were successful in driving move-in traffic there. Move-ins were up year-over-year despite the incremental new supply, but we did utilize rate and advertising. So rates were down, call it, 7%, 8% on move-ins in Miami in the second quarter. So there's no question that there is rate pressure where there's new supply and we're also utilizing rates to drive volume in some of those markets."

So the first component around just performance of the existing tenants and their willingness to continue to remain customers post a rate increase to the rental rates, so that's very consistent, in fact, trending positively as we've gone through the quarter. So as we disclosed in the 10-Q, move-out volumes were down, which is what drove the increase in occupancy throughout the quarter, average up 20 basis points and actually finished up 50 basis points in the quarter. So while move-ins were flat, move-outs were down, and that's because that existing tenant base is performing quite well. The existing tenants are exhibiting great dynamics. You look at delinquency numbers, they're supported by wage growth, the great labor market, so lots of good things happening there for our existing tenants and we continue to see that throughout the portfolio. In terms of rate strategies in different markets, certainly what's going on with the move-in and move-out dynamics within a local market will impact our strategies for existing tenant rate increases, I'm not going to go into detail there, but certainly those are some of the factors considered. In terms of how things have trended into July, move-outs are down again in July, so again, very consistent trends."

The good news is they're becoming good customers period. And there's no both statistical and/or trend that we could point to that says that that's any different than what we've seen with other generations as they age into the kinds of things that drive them to decide to take down a self-storage unit. So many of the very similar and same drivers that have affected prior generations are too now affecting millennials. You could even argue, there is, at the end of the day, as we speak today, maybe fewer homeowners out there that are much more sensitized to the cost of owning a home they're looking at smaller apartments. They're making trade-offs of keeping their stuff in lower-cost alternatives and storage fits quite well with that. We are seeing good traction. We're doing a lot of surveys relative to the types of customers that are coming in to us, and again, no change there.

Smedes, there's a variety of different reasons we've seen the uptick in acquisition volume. It's included some owners that have come to us directly. They haven't taken their properties out to market, whether it's because, again, they're under some level of duress and/or they've just made a decision that it's time to exit either a specific property or [ whatever ] size platform they may have. And with that, we've seen a variety of different occupancy levels. We continue to look at properties that range anywhere from either newly developed and/or fully stabilized. I can point you to -- we did a 4 building acquisition in the Miami area. Each of the buildings had different levels of occupancy, 1 or 2 are more stabilized than the other 2 that have been more recently delivered to the market. So there's a range there. And we are seeing and hearing that there are -- there's a lot of activity out there relative to, particularly within the brokerage community, brokers are being asked to come in and do valuations for owners. In the last quarter, we saw a lot of inquiries coming in to us with, again, a full range of different types of situations, let's just call it that, all of which we consider. We underwrite, we take a look at. So we really haven't changed on our end the way that we continue to analyze and look at returns that we can get from these investments. What we are seeing are sellers that are far more agreeable and more anxious to make a decision to exit. And some, again, have gone to maybe clear and more evident levels of stress. Others, again, have just made a more rational decision and said it's time and a good point in the cycle to consider an exit at maybe a level or a price that 1 or 2 years ago was much more elevated and we wouldn't have engaged from a conversation and today we are. So as we reported, we've done more transaction volume this year than we did all of last year. We've got about $87 million under contract and we're seeing, again, beyond that good activity and are encouraged by some of the situations that are playing through."

There's a number of different conflicting drivers that are still in the mix. So there are still a lot of investors, private equity and otherwise, that are coming into the sector that haven't been in self-storage before. So there's some fuel that comes from that. As I mentioned, there are still development returns that some individual developers are going to look at and say it's still a good reward-risk balance. So they may launch and still may get the funding to do it. On the flip side, I don't disagree with your comment that I think more and more lenders are becoming more stringent in the way that they are underwriting and basically putting lending packages out to developers. So hopefully, that creates some level of added discipline we haven't seen. But again, there's still fuel out there. And like I said, we're sensing that there's likely to be in that 10% to 15% stage or shift down going from this year to next year, but that still puts you north of $4 billion of deliveries. That's a lot of product. So we're keeping a very close eye out. We're not confused about how it impacts certain markets, as I mentioned earlier, and the good news is we feel more and more encouraged that we've got the playbook to continue to navigate around it."

It can range, from a percentage standpoint, property to property, anywhere from easily, say, 10%, 15%, 20% to sometimes much higher, again, depending on the location of a particular property.

We opened",470,"Well, we certainly have done more than Gerard. We've got now several facilities that are close, and in fact, Jersey City is now larger than Gerard. Jersey City is our largest current system, or current property in our system, about 4,200 units. We opened that just a little over 2 years ago. Today, it's nearly 90% occupied. So what leads us to and how we basically place, design and configure something of that magnitude in a market is we use a lot of analytics, we look at the level of competitive activity and then we take a lot of the day-to-day metrics we see in like properties that we may own [ in a particular area ] decide how big to go. But there's no question, the bigger facilities like this create another level of complexity that, again, we have to tune our operational teams to, again, handle. So Jersey City, it wouldn't be unusual, for instance as we fill that property up to have 40 to 50 move-ins literally on a weekend. And if you bench that against kind of a traditional size storage facility, that might be a volume you'd see in a month. So you've got to have a team of people running the asset, you've got -- at a different level, you've got different complexity relative to the design of the facility itself, number of elevators, the way the floor-to-floor configuration works on unit sizes. And with the amenities, though, however, with these bigger facilities, customers love them. And again, they are very efficient, very customer service-oriented because we're running, again, larger teams that are clearly accessible and at the counter, opened all day long. And again, we're looking and expanding that platform where it makes sense in many different parts of the country. 
So that's too, though, if I connect that to some of the activity that we're seeing on the acquisition side, naïvely, a number of owners or developers have come into the business thinking, okay, it's a good idea to just go as big as we can. We'll go into the city. We'll -- if we were thinking about building a 50,000 or 75,000 square-foot product, we'll go to 100,000 or 125,000, or even in some cases, larger than that without the skill, knowledge and capability to actually run a facility of that size. And it's not unusual and we see it time and again where a facility like that can get to 50% or 60% occupied and it just stalls. Because if you don't have the ability to drive volume, understand how to cater to existing customers, if you haven't got the right technology capabilities or day-to-day customer service, you're going to flatline. Now that creates, in many cases, a good opportunity for us and we're seeing more and more of them."

So without getting into too much detail as to how returns are calculated, it's a pretty simple concept around what's a customer worth to us and what are the acquisition costs all-in, with which it takes to acquire that customer and ultimately get them to move in.

So we can monitor those returns on a customer-by-customer basis and with a keyword-by-keyword basis. 
In terms of the overall cost and the competitiveness online, there's no question that we're not the only one pushing on this lever. Some of our traditional operating competitors are pushing on that lever as well and probably seeing similar good returns. So we'd expect that to continue. In addition, we have other folks, both regional operators as well as what's called valet storage operators and other types of folks that are bidding on keywords and driving the cost per click higher.

We used similar mix of tools in the third quarter that we have throughout the year. So I won't go into the details on those, in particular, but lower movement -- lower move-in rates and less promotional discounts year-over-year. But speaking directly to advertising as we've discussed on previous calls, we've been increasing our spend through 2018 and 2019 as we've grown incrementally more confident in the demand response we were seen through that channel. So advertising was up 70% in the quarter. We pulled pretty hard on this lever this quarter in order to get move-in during this seasonally busy move-in period in July, August and September. We like from advertising third quarter included. The incremental move-ins we're achieving were the incremental cost. As marginal returns are attractive that advertising expense is upfront, while the customer value will be earned overtime. And kind of stepping back, Public Storage has real advantages online and we're taking advantage of those. First of which is our brand name. Anonymous with our product, the top search term within the sector, almost half of our paid search volume comes in on brand searches, which drive efficiencies as well as conversion. And away from paid channels, a meaningfully portion of our move-ins come directly to us unpaid, 2/3. The second component is scale. We have top market shares in the top metropolitan markets in the United States, which allows for a better, richer shopping experience for our customers and good conversion at the local level. So this lever continues to work with occupancy ending up the quarter at 70 basis points, we'll continue to plan to use this lever in coming quarters."

And we're pleased by the amount of activity that we were able to drive through this marketing spend. Occupancy at quarter end was up 70 basis points, but that's up very well to go into Q4 and Q1 where we're not likely to see as much leasing activity because, again, those are traditionally are lowest volume quarters, but we continue to like as Tom said the value and the traction that we get by putting that level of spending into our marketing efforts."

Again, what we've been talking to now obviously for some time as the elevated level of supply that's been coming into many markets now for a number of years, starting in 2016, went about $2 billion nationally came in to the markets and then th",741,"Okay. Sure. Again, what we've been talking to now obviously for some time as the elevated level of supply that's been coming into many markets now for a number of years, starting in 2016, went about $2 billion nationally came in to the markets and then the doubled in 2017 to $4 billion, 2018 $5 billion by all accounts, 2019 is going to equal 2018. And our view of 2020 is we will likely see some decrease in, again, deliveries and it may be anywhere from say 10% to 20%. We're hoping clearly as many others are that it's 20% or even better, but we continue to track markets and statistics that are guiding us to about that, again, 15% to 20% down. So you take that into consideration holistically, again, over this time period you've seen anywhere from 1,600 to 2,000 new properties in the markets, that's about 120 million square feet. And again, market-to-market, particularly where this elevated supply as we seen the most commanding headwinds. 
So maybe more specifically to your question Jeremy, so where we today. On the good news front, delivery pattern in elevated markets like Denver, Charlotte, Houston, Austin and Chicago, those have all been poster child markets for these elevated level of deliveries and tougher operating markets but we're now starting to see that supply volume decrease in some cases, pretty dramatically. But we're still dealing with the lingering effects of the amount of supply. So you take Denver, for instance, in 2018, little over 2 million square feet went into that market. The good news is, it was less than half of that this year, and again, it's going to notch down likely in 2020. But holistically, that markets seen about 35% increase of supply in that time period compared to existing base of assets. 
So you've got to continue the maneuver around that elevated level of activity. Again, using markets like Charlotte, Austin, Chicago and Houston is examples where anyone of those markets hit a $1 million plus level of deliveries, Houston up more extreme, it's a big market, no question, but it hit about 2.5 million square feet of completion since 2018. It's ratcheted down and we like the impact of that, but again, we're going to have to continue to maneuver around, again, how we're dealing with customer acquisition, pricing et cetera. The flip side is we're still on other words because if you go back, again, to our prediction of what's going to happen in 2020 with plus or minus about $4 billion of assets coming in the market and we're going to see that impact as we're tracking and again, these are statistics tied towards under construction and in development. So this isn't -- these aren't deals that are planned or potentially contemplated. They're in motion, okay? So you're going to see more impact in Portland, Boston, Seattle, many parts of Florida, D.C., Minneapolis and New York. So we're clearheaded about the things that we're likely to need to do there. We've got a good playback. We're going to continue to drive a lot of the things that we can to maximize revenue opportunity, maximize opportunity and customer acquisition. The third element I'll talk to as well is the fact that we do have and we like what we're seeing in our own development pipeline. So we've got of about $540 million in today's pipeline. We shifted out of markets like Texas as a whole for the most part where the last 2 or 3 years we put a lot of development activity into both Houston and Dallas to a lesser degree in the Austin, but now we are going into a broader number of markets where we're seeing, again, opportunities to get good traction of these new developments. And then if you even look at our legacy, if you want to call that out, the development pipeline that we delivered since 2013, it continues to lease up quite well. 
I mentioned in my opening comment that this quarter, we saw about 21% NOI growth in that portfolio, collectively it's about $1.4 billion investment and today it's roughly at about 80%. So we like and will see very good traction other that in coming quarters because again, we've got more occupancy and we've got the impact of matured revenue opportunities, which, again, is clearly part of our successful strategy as we, again, both develop and mature these assets."

So, okay, so for the most part California is in very good shape. Now going south to north, there's parts of San Diego County, we're keeping a close eye on to because of some elevated deliveries in some of outer markets within San Diego County. Orange County and L.A. County for the most part are pretty, I would say, inactive from a new development standpoint, primarily because there's very little land available and it's very expensive if, in fact, we're able to find anything if you're regular on the L.A. metro market, may be a little more activity out in the Inland Empire. Then you open into the Bay Area again, San Francisco -- South San Francisco, again, no worries there. A little bit of heavy activity in the San Jose market that we're keeping a close eye on, but again, not a big amount of inventory on a percentage of existing base. So we continue to see in our own development pipeline in these markets where we've really had the opportunity to take existing assets from the most part and do some pretty meaningful expansions. And again, repeating what I just said around the traction we're getting from that activity, the expansions that we're doing are leasing up really well. So we're very pleased by that, seeing very good traction, and again, for the most part, I would say California is in pretty good shape."

So is variable obsolescence that we're seeing anywhere in the portfolio. What we're doing though to actually continue to enhance even some of those revenue streams and again, amplify performance property to property with some of our older assets is a program we've talked a little bit about, which is a Property of Tomorrow program where we're going through and putting to your point what we would call fifth-generation attributes into many of these assets where we can, again, enhance the curb appeal of the asset through more modern paint schemes, signage or improving the office and customer areas that align with some of the technology issue or technology strategies that we've had or at this point going through California from a first-wave standpoint where we've taken about 125 of our generation 1 through 3 or 4 properties, some of which might be say 30 or 40 years old, they're in phenomenal locations. They drive very good occupancy and rent levels, but we're going to hopefully even see that much more opportunity once we've basically, taken them through the various stage of the elements that we would include in our generation brand-new properties. 
So that's working quite well. We're getting good reception from both customers and our employees as well. And then we're also now rolling that program into a number of markets nationally, which will include in the first quarter parts of Florida. We've touched many parts of the boroughs, if not all of those properties, we're going to go into other parts of New York. We've already gone into markets like Chicago, for instance, and the Carolina so anyway, we're pretty excited about what we're doing. Now from a cost standpoint, we've talked about this program in the context of ultimately being about $1.5 billion or more once we get through the entire portfolio. 2019, we will have spent about $110 million on a program and in 2020, we'll likely spend even a little bit more. Again, as we touched the market I talked to. So, so far we're very pleased. 
Now as we're doing this, we're also making some technological updates to the properties, where as we speak relighting interior LEDs on assets for both energy efficiency and again, better customer environments. We have begun changing out our assets control system, which is now based on a centralized system, which we never had before. It's just going to give us a lot of good data that we haven't had around customer activity. We're adding solar to a number of properties.

I do think if you go back several years at a consistent trend of using move-in rate or to drive volume, it really is a market-by-market dynamic. So as we think about where it's going in future years, a lot of it will be dependent on what happens in those markets. So just looking at move-in rates for the third quarter for example, you have markets like Los Angeles or Phoenix where [ Europe ] going low to mid-single digits on move-in rates given what's going on there. The flip side is you've got Florida markets like Miami and Tampa, which are being impacted by new supply and those move-in rates are down call it 5% to 10%, I through Houston into that bucket as well. And so the move-in rates were using non-across the board it's really a tactic to drive volume in areas where we're competing for new customers in a more competitive environment. As we move into 2020, we're likely to see the mix of those markets continue to shift. So as we've spoken about in the past, looking back at the markets that were more challenged in prior year, we've seen some of those markets actually improve meaningfully. So market like Chicago or Washington, D.C. there was many more impacted early on in the cycle. We've seen better traction this year than they were last year. So as we had a into 2020, it's going to be a different mix of markets. But I'll let Joe speak to new supply in aggregate by market, but it's a pretty dynamic management on our end as we seek to maximize revenue within those local submarkets."

So strategy wise we plan on using consistent plans through the fourth and next year's first quarter in the slow season. So we do send rental rate increases throughout the year and we'll do so in the coming quarters. In terms of the magnitude in the quantity, we're looking to optimize that at the tenant level. We think we do better on that year-end and year out. So ultimately what we're seeking to do is maximize revenue. So we take into consideration the probabilities of vacates as well as the cost of that vacates replacing that tenant et cetera. So I think it varies throughout the year, but consistent strategies and no change or more conservatism or more aggressiveness as we get into the next few quarters. 
In terms of a governor, there are things in place that we use in order to make sure that we are maximizing the revenue overtime. And so there's different governors in place and different strategies we use and different types of environment, but certainly, street rate and the rate in which a new customer would move-in is a key component of the strategy. So it's time to get high or about street rates the cost of that tenant leaving is higher."

But I think stepping back, it's managed very much dynamically at the local keyword level. And so as we monitor what the returns are, we're going to our strategies there thereafter. So we can't predict exactly what's going to happen going forward. I would kind of step back in terms of advertising spend and think about where we are and what we're backing from a customer acquisition standpoint just provide a little historical context. So if you go back in time advertising as a percentage of revenue for Public Storage at the end of the last cycle beginning of the cycle, however, between call it 2% and 3% of revenue. As the customer acquisition environment got very healthy end certainly fundamentals were very solid in the beginning in the middle part of the cycle, we decreased our advertising spend. In 2016 for example, advertising spend was just a touch over 1% of revenue in the same store pool. 
We're looking now year-to-date, it's hovering just under 2%. So it gives you some context that we have always been increasing in marketing spend, we've been doing so from a low base in what was a very attractive customer acquisition environment in 2014, '15, '16 and now we're at a certainly more challenging and competitive environment.

So again, statistically obviously you can see, again, through what we've done in the third quarter and then what we've got in a pipeline whether we've already closed on contract for the fourth quarter. We're likely to acquire plus or minus about $375 million of assets this year, and that's 2 assets of what we did from our acquisition volume in 2018, for instance. And as I talked to last couple of quarters, we do see more and more owners coming to us in a variety of different stages, whether they've already built assets, they may be in the first year or 2 lease up, they're not making either pro formas or revenue projections and they've got some level of, I would call it, anxiety. I wouldn't call it pronounced flat-out stress at this point, but there's definitely more anxiety related conversations that we're having. By virtue of that, we're seeing sellers being far more reasonable around valuations. That's clearly what has led to some of the acquisition volume that we've already done this year and continue to see come our way. We've been able to capture some really nice assets on a number of markets that we wanted to build scale into. And we're anticipating that there is more of that to come. 
And the other factor that I would tell you that is starting to percolator bit more that what we've seen recently is what I would call it entitled land where there an owner, again, may have acquire his property 1, 2 or 3 years ago, again, anticipating pro formas that they felt confident about 1, 2, 3 years ago, clearly things have shifted.

It's a combination of your traditional operators being willing to spend more, to acquire more customers. As we've increased our spend, we've seen incremental volume and I suspect others have as well. And so there's a component of your existing folks being more competitive. Certainly, the Google platform is a great 1 in the fact that its action based. So they let us compete within their stand box. And so, the environment is more competitive and you see folks being more aggressive in the cost-per-click. There also not only your big public REITs, but also your regional operators that have been more aggressive as well as some of your nontraditional storage folks like ballet, for instance, with some of those operators have been more aggressive in cost-per-click as well. 
So that all adds to a higher cost-per-click environment, which as we look at our spend, that's a component of it.

So the one thing that UPS obviously has that others prior have not is more of a logistical network. The platform right now is based on kind of a bin concept. So not clearly understanding what way it might evolve overtime. They're testing it out in 1 market. So we're going to continue to watch and understand as we have with other platforms. But overall the whole ballet model we continue to see as 1 that might be more akin to a traditional moving and storage type customer versus a traditional self-storage customer. A big difference to a self-storage model is you literally pay for access each and every time you want to goods, and then at the end of the day you don't even know where they are. So those are 2 pretty big hurdles relative to what, again, a core self-storage customer traditionally wants, which is access and basically, again, knowing that they can, again, get to their goods without having to pay fees to do so.

As you move through the second quarter and into the third quarter, the busy season with lower move-in rates that is a big drag through those quarters on contract rent growth. And you've seen that this year, you've seen in previous years as well. So there's nothing really new there. Maybe pointing to 1 factor that may be made in the second quarter little bit better in the third quarter maybe a little bit worse, if you look at discount trends for example, which are component of revenue, discounts are down almost 7% in the second quarter were down about 4% in the third quarter. So there's lots of moving pieces there, but generally if you look back, while we've been battling this new supply between second quarter and third quarter, we've seen contract rent growth decelerate over that time period pretty simply because we've been using lower rates in many of our markets only to drive that volume as those folks moving during the summer that contract rent growth declines."

We used similar mix of tools in the third quarter that we have throughout the year. So I won't go into the details on those, in particular, but lower move-ins or lower move-in rates and less promotional discounts year-over-year. But speaking directly to advertising, as we've discussed on previous calls, we've been increasing our spend through 2018 and 2019 as we've grown incrementally more confident in the demand response we've received through that channel. So advertising was up 70% in the quarter. We pulled pretty hard on this lever this quarter in order to get move-ins during the seasonally busy move-in period in July, August and September. 
We like the returns we've been getting from advertising third quarter included. The incremental move-ins we're achieving for the incremental cost. As marginal returns are attractive that advertising expense is upfront, while the customer value will be earned over time. And kind of stepping back, Public Storage has real advantages online and we're taking advantage of those, first of which is our brand name, synonymous with our product, a top search term within the sector, almost half of our paid search volume comes in on brand searches, which drive efficiencies as well as conversion. And away from paid channels, a meaningfully portion of our move-ins come directly to us unpaid, about 2/3. The second component is scale. We have top market shares in the top metropolitan markets in the United States, which allows for a better, richer shopping experience for our customers and good conversion at the local level. So this lever continues to work with occupancy ending up the quarter 70 basis points. We'll continue to plan to use this lever in coming quarters."

And we're pleased by the amount of activity that we were able to drive through this marketing spend. Occupancy at quarter end was up 70 basis points That sets us up very well to go into Q4 and Q1 where we're not likely to see as much leasing activity because, again, those are traditionally are lowest volume quarters, but we continue to like as Tom said the value and the traction that we get by putting that level of spend into our marketing efforts."

Again, what we've been talking to now obviously for some time is the elevated level of supply that's been coming into many markets now for a number of years, starting in 2016, when about $2 billion nationally came in to the markets and then th",747,"Okay. Sure. Again, what we've been talking to now obviously for some time is the elevated level of supply that's been coming into many markets now for a number of years, starting in 2016, when about $2 billion nationally came in to the markets and then that doubled in 2017 to $4 billion; 2018, $5 billion; by all accounts, 2019 is going to equal 2018.  In our view of 2020 is we will likely see some decrease in, again, deliveries and it may be anywhere from say 10% to 20%. We're hoping clearly as many others are that it's 20% or even better, but we continue to track markets and statistics that are guiding us to about that, again, 15% to 20% down. So you take that into consideration holistically, again, over this time period you've seen anywhere from 1,600 to 2,000 new properties in our markets. That's about 120 million square feet. And again, market-to-market, particularly where this elevated supplies have, we see the most commanding headwinds. 
So maybe more specifically to your question Jeremy, so where are we today? On the good news front, deliveries have been elevated in markets like Denver, Charlotte, Houston, Austin and Chicago. Those have all been poster child markets for these elevated level of deliveries and tougher operating markets but we're now starting to see that supply volume decrease, in some cases, pretty dramatically. But we're still dealing with the lingering effects of the amount of supply. So you take Denver, for instance, in 2018, a little over 2 million square feet went into that market. The good news is, it was less than half of that this year, and again, it's going to notch down likely in 2020. But holistically, that markets has seen about a 35% increase of supply in that time period compared to existing base of assets. 
So you've got to continue to maneuver around that elevated level of activity. Again, using markets like Charlotte, Austin, Chicago and Houston, as examples, where any one of those markets hit $1 million plus level of deliveries, Houston more extreme. It's a big market, no question, but it hit about 2.5 million square feet of completions in 2018. It's ratcheted down, and we like the impact of that. But again, we're going to have to continue to maneuver around, again, how we're dealing with customer acquisition, pricing, et cetera. The flip side is we're still not out of the woods because you go back, again, to our prediction about what's going to happen in 2020, with plus or minus about $4 billion of assets coming into the markets. And we're going to see that impact as we're tracking and again, these are statistics tied to what's under construction and in development, Okay? So this isn't -- these aren't deals that are planned or potentially contemplated. They're in motion, okay? So you're going to see more impact in Portland, Boston, Seattle, many parts of Florida, D.C., Minneapolis and New York. So we're clearheaded about the things that we're likely to need to do there. We've got a good playbook. We're going to continue to drive a lot of the things that we can to maximize revenue opportunity, maximize opportunity in customer acquisition. The third element I'll talk to as well is the fact that we do have and we like what we're seeing in our own development pipeline. So we've got about $540 million in today's pipeline. We've shifted out of markets like Texas as a whole, for the most part, where the last 2 or 3 years we put a lot of development activity into both Houston and Dallas to a lesser degree, into Austin. But now we are going into a broader number of markets where we're seeing, again, opportunities to get good traction of these new developments. And then if you even look at our legacy, if you want to call that, or the development pipeline that we've delivered since 2013. It continues to lease-up quite well. 
I mentioned in my opening comment that this quarter, we saw about 21% NOI growth in that portfolio. Collectively, it's about a $1.4 billion investment, and today it's roughly at about 80%.

So -- okay. So for the most part, California is in very good shape. Now going south to north, there's parts of San Diego County, we're keeping a close eye on to because there's some elevated deliveries in some of the outer markets within San Diego County. Orange County and L.A. County for the most part are pretty, I would say, inactive from a new development standpoint, primarily because there's very little land available and it's very expensive if, in fact, you're able to find anything here, right here in the L.A. metro market, may be a little bit more activity out in the Inland Empire. When you go into the Bay Area, again, San Francisco -- South San Francisco, again, no worries there. A little bit of heavy activity in the San Jose market that we're keeping a close eye on, but again, not a big amount of inventory on a percentage of existing base. So we continue to see in our own development pipeline in these markets where we've really had the opportunity to take existing assets for the most part and do some pretty meaningful expansions. And again, repeating what I just said around the traction we're getting from that activity, the expansions that we're doing are leasing up really well.

So first of all, I think it's well known that one of the benefits of the product type itself is you can go through decades of use on our assets, and they can be every bit as vibrant in today's world and even more so in many cases, than they were originally developed. So there's very little obsolescence that we're seeing anywhere in the portfolio. What we're doing though to actually continue to enhance even some of those revenue streams and again, amplify performance property to property with some of our older assets is a program we've talked a little bit about, which is our Property of Tomorrow program, where we're going through and putting to your point what we would call fifth-generation attributes into many of these assets where we can, again, enhance the curve appeal of the asset through more modern paint scheme, signage, we're improving the office and customer areas that align with some of the technology issue or technology strategies that we've had. We're at this point going through California from a first-wave standpoint where we've taken about 125 of our generation 1 through 3 or 4 properties, some of which might be, say, 30 or 40 years old. They're in phenomenal locations. They drive very good occupancy and rent levels, but we're going to, hopefully, even see that much more opportunity once we've basically taking them -- taken them through the various stages of the elements that we would include in our generation brand-new properties. 
So that's working quite well. We're getting good reception from both customers and our employees as well. And then we're also now rolling that program into a number of markets nationally, which will include in the first quarter, parts of Florida. We've touched many parts of the boroughs, if not all of those properties, we're going to go into other parts of New York. We've already gone into markets like Chicago, for instance, and the Carolina. So anyway, we're pretty excited about what we're doing. Now from a cost standpoint, we've talked about this program in the context of ultimately being about $0.5 billion or more once we get through the entire portfolio. 2019, we will have spent about $110 million on the program. And in 2020, we'll likely spend even a little bit more. Again, as we touch the markets I talked to. So, so far we're very pleased. 
Now as we're doing this, we're also making some technological updates to the properties, where as we speak relighting interior LEDs on assets for both energy efficiency and again, better customer environments. We have begun changing out our access control systems, which is now based on a centralized system, which we've never had before. It's going to give us a lot of good data that we haven't had around customer activity. We're adding solar to a number of properties. So we've got a number of different elements of the overall program in motion. And like I mentioned, we're getting very good feedback from it and like the results."

So as we think about where it's going in future years, a lot of it will be dependent on what happens in those markets. So just looking at move-in rates for the third quarter, for example, you have markets like Los Angeles or Phoenix where you're up, call it, low to mid-single digits on move-in rates given what's going on there. The flip side is you've got Florida markets like Miami and Tampa, which are being impacted by new supply and those move-in rates are down, call it, 5% to 10%. I throw Houston into that bucket as well. And so the move-in rates we're using are not across the board, it's really a tactic to drive volume in areas where we're competing for new customers in a more competitive environment. As we move into -- to 2020, we're likely to see the mix of those markets continue to shift. So as we've spoken about in the past, looking back at the markets that were more challenged in prior year, we've seen some of those markets actually improve meaningfully to a market like Chicago or Washington, D.C. that was maybe more impacted earlier on in the cycle. Is seeing better traction this year than they were last year. As we head into 2020, it's going to be a different mix of markets. But I think I'll let Joe speak to new supply in aggregate by market, but it's a pretty dynamic management on our end as we seek to maximize revenue within those local submarkets."

We think we do better on that year in and year out. So ultimately, what we're seeking to do is maximize revenue. So we take into consideration the probabilities of vacates as well as the cost of that vacate and replacing that tenant, et cetera. So things vary throughout the year, but consistent strategies and no change or more conservatism or more aggressiveness as we get into the next few quarters. 
In terms of a governor, there are things in place that we use in order to make sure that we are maximizing that revenue over time. And so there's different governors in place and different strategies we use in different types of environments. But certainly, Street rate and the rate with which a new customer would move-in is a -- the key component of the strategy.

So we can't predict exactly what's going to happen going forward. I would kind of step back in terms of advertising spend, and you think about where we are and what we're battling from a customer acquisition standpoint and just provide a little historical context. So if you go back in time, advertising as a percentage of revenue for Public Storage, at the end of the last cycle beginning of the cycle hover between, call it, 2% and 3% of revenue. As the customer acquisition environment got very healthy and certainly fundamentals were very solid in the beginning and middle part of this cycle, we decreased our advertising spend. In 2016, for example, advertising spend was just a touch over 1% of revenue in the same-store pool. 
We're looking now year-to-date, it's hovering just under 2%. So it gives you some context that, yes, while we've been increasing marketing spend, we've been doing so from a low base in what was a very attractive customer acquisition environment in 2014, '15, '16. And now we're in a certainly a more challenging and competitive environment and we're using that tool like we have in the past to drive new move-ins and occupancy."

Because maybe your -- the customers you've drawn into your company are paying that 50% off rate. Some will move-out, some will stay and they'll get the higher rent. Maybe the occupancy isn't cash flowing day 1. So maybe there's some built-in gains to recapture in the fourth quarter.

Just out of curiosity, do you have a sense of -- when I think about private equity and private capital investors, has the appetite for the product from their standpoint, changed at all?

More often than not, they're looking for scale, which can be challenging from time to time. Cap rates really haven't adjusted for the most part, but yes, there's definitely a fair amount of capital that still wants to come into the market. And some of those buyers maybe thinking in terms that I would say could be somewhat risky because they may be basing it off of pro formas that may or may not make sense. May be based on levels of traction that were seeing 1 or 2 years ago, that have certainly continued to change. So it's a new and different dynamic that's come into the sector. And by all accounts, we don't see that shifting anytime soon."

So again, statistically, obviously, you can see, again, through what we've done in the third quarter and then what we've got in our pipeline whether we've already closed or under contract for the fourth quarter. We're likely to acquire plus or minus about $375 million of assets this year. And that's 2x of what we did from our acquisition volume in 2018, for instance. And as I've talked to in the last couple of quarters, we do see more and more owners coming to us in a variety of different stages, whether they've already built assets. They may be in the first year or 2 of lease-up. They're not making either pro formas or revenue projections, and they've got some level of, I would call it, anxiety. I wouldn't call it pronounced, flat-out stress at this point, but there's definitely more anxiety-related conversations that we're having. By virtue of that, we're seeing sellers being far more reasonable around valuations. That's clearly what has led to some of the acquisition volume that we've already done this year and continue to see come our way. We've been able to capture some really nice assets in a number of markets that we wanted to build scale into. And we're anticipating that there is more of that to come. 
And the other factor that I would tell you that is starting to percolate a bit more than we've seen recently is even what I would call entitled land, whether an owner, again, may have acquired a piece of property 1, 2 or 3 years ago, again, anticipating pro formas that they felt confident about 1, 2, 3 years ago. Clearly, things have shifted. They're reassessing their own development returns, and we're seeing more opportunities to actually engage and particularly and potentially find some interesting opportunities there."

It's a combination of your traditional operators being willing to spend more, to acquire more customers. As we've increased our spend, we've seen incremental volume and I suspect others have as well. And so there's a component of your existing folks being more competitive. Certainly, the Google platform is a great one and the fact that its action based. So they let us compete within their sandbox. And so, the environment is more competitive, and you see folks being more aggressive in their cost per click. There are also not only your big public REITs, but also your regional operators that have been more aggressive as well as some of your nontraditional storage folks like Vale, for instance, with some of those operators have been more aggressive in cost per click as well. 
So that all adds to a higher cost per click environment, which as we look at our spend, that's a component of it. But then we need to, again, at the local level do we like the bids and the volumes that we're seeing? What do we get if we increase? What do we get if we decrease? And that's what we're managing. And ultimately, as I spoke earlier, we like the returns. We'll see whether the rest of the environment and the rest of our competitors like the returns as cost per click continue to go higher, but we like what we're seeing."

We've done a variety of different customer surveys around this whole concept of Vale on-demand type platform. And thus far, we continue to receive very little disruption and/or change in our own customer behavior because we continue to see pretty distinct differences between what that product offering is compared to what traditional self-storage is. So the one thing that UPS obviously has that others prior have not is more of a logistical network. The platform right now is based on kind of a bin concept. So not clearly understanding what way it might evolve over time. They're testing it out in 1 market. So we're going to continue to watch and understand as we have with the other platforms. But overall, the whole Vale model we continue to see as 1 that might be more akin to a traditional moving and storage type customer versus a traditional self-storage customer. A big difference to a self-storage model is you literally pay for access each and every time you want your goods. And then, at the end of the day, you don't even know where they are. So those are 2 pretty big hurdles relative to what, again, a core self-storage customer traditionally wants, which is access and basically, again, knowing that they can, again, get to their goods without having to pay fees to do so. So we'll continue to track it and see what evolves."

Maybe pointing to 1 factor that may be made in the second quarter a little bit better in the third quarter, maybe a little bit worse, if you look at discount trends, for example, which are a component of revenue, discounts were down almost 7% in the second quarter were down about 4% in the third quarter. So there's lots of moving pieces there, but generally if you look back, while we've been battling this new supply between second quarter and third quarter, we've seen contract rent growth decelerate over that time period pretty simply because we've been using lower rates in many of our markets in order to drive that volume as those folks move in during the summer, that contract rent growth declined."

We used a similar mix of tools in the third quarter that we have throughout the year. So I won't go into the details on those, in particular, but lower move-ins or lower move-in rates and less promotional discounts year-over-year. But speaking directly to advertising, as we've discussed on previous calls, we've been increasing our spend through 2018 and 2019 as we've grown incrementally more confident in the demand response we've received through that channel. So advertising was up 70% in the quarter. We pulled pretty hard on this lever this quarter in order to get move-ins during the seasonally busy move-in period in July, August and September. 
We like the returns we've been getting from advertising, third quarter included. The incremental move-ins we're achieving -- or the incremental cost. Those marginal returns are attractive, that advertising expense is upfront, while the customer value will be earned over time. And kind of stepping back, Public Storage has real advantages online and we're taking advantage of those. First of which is our brand name, synonymous with our product, the top search term within the sector, almost half of our paid search volume comes in on brand searches, which drive efficiencies as well as conversion. And away from paid channels, a meaningful portion of our move-ins come directly to us unpaid, about 2/3. The second component is scale. We have top market shares in the top metropolitan markets in the United States, which allows for a better, richer shopping experience for our customers and good conversion at the local level. So this lever continues to work with occupancy ending up the quarter 70 basis points. We'll continue to plan to use this lever in coming quarters."

And we're pleased by the amount of activity that we were able to drive through this marketing spend. Occupancy at quarter end was up 70 basis points. That sets us up very well to go into Q4 and Q1 where we're not likely to see as much leasing activity because, again, those are traditionally our lowest volume quarters, but we continue to like, as Tom said, the value and the traction that we get by putting that level of spend into our marketing efforts."

Sure. Again, what we've been talking to now obviously for some time is the elevated level of supply that's been coming into many markets now for a number of years, starting in 2016, when about $2 billion nationally came in to the markets and then that doubled in 2017 to $4 billion; 2018, $5 billion; by all accounts, 2019 is going to equal 2018. And our view of 2020 is we will likely see some decrease in, again, deliveries and it may be anywhere from say 10% to 20%. We're hoping, clearly, as many others are, that it's 20% or even better, but we continue to track markets and statistics that are guiding us to about that, again, 15% to 20% down. So you take that into consideration holistically, again, over this time period you've seen anywhere from 1,600 to 2,000 new properties in our markets. That's about 120 million square feet. And again, market-to-market, particularly where this elevated supplies hit, we see the most commanding headwinds. 
So maybe more specifically to your question Jeremy, so where are we today? On the good news front, deliveries have been elevated in markets like Denver, Charlotte, Houston, Austin and Chicago. Those have all been poster child markets for these elevated level of deliveries and tougher operating markets but we're now starting to see that supply volume decrease, in some cases, pretty dramatically. But we're still dealing with the lingering effects of the amount of supply. So you take Denver, for instance, in 2018, a little over 2 million square feet went into that market. The good news is, it was less than half of that this year, and again, it's going to notch down likely in 2020. But holistically, that markets has seen about a 35% increase of supply in that time period compared to existing base of assets. 
So you've got to continue to maneuver around that elevated level of activity. Again, using markets like Charlotte, Austin, Chicago and Houston, as examples, where any one of those markets hit $1 million plus level of deliveries, Houston up more extreme. It's a big market, no question, but it hit about 2.5 million square feet of completions in 2018. It's ratcheted down, and we like the impact of that. But again, we're going to have to continue to maneuver around, again, how we're dealing with customer acquisition, pricing, et cetera. The flip side is we're still not out of the woods because you go back, again, to our prediction about what's going to happen in 2020, with plus or minus about $4 billion of assets coming into the markets. And we're going to see that impact as we're tracking and again, these are statistics tied to what's under construction and in development, okay? So this isn't -- these aren't deals that are planned or potentially contemplated. They're in motion, okay? So you're going to see more impact in Portland, Boston, Seattle, many parts of Florida, D.C., Minneapolis and New York. So we're clearheaded about the things that we're likely to need to do there. We've got a good playbook. We're going to continue to drive a lot of the things that we can to maximize revenue opportunity, maximize opportunity in customer acquisition. The third element I'll talk to as well is the fact that we do have and we like what we're seeing in our own development pipeline. So we've got about $540 million in today's pipeline. We've shifted out of markets like Texas as a whole for the most part where the last 2 or 3 years we've put a lot of development activity into both Houston and Dallas, and to a lesser degree, into Austin. But now we are going into a broader number of markets where we're seeing, again, opportunities to get good traction of these new developments. And then if you even look at our legacy, if you want to call that, or the development pipeline that we've delivered since 2013, it continues to lease-up quite well. 
I mentioned in my opening comment that this quarter, we saw about 21% NOI growth in that portfolio. Collectively, it's about a $1.4 billion investment, and today it's roughly at about 80%. So we like and we'll see very good traction out of that in coming quarters because, again, we've got more occupancy and we've got the impact of matured revenue opportunities, which, again, is clearly part of our successful strategy as we, again, both develop and mature these assets."

So -- okay. So for the most part, California is in very good shape. Now going south to north, there's parts of San Diego County, we're keeping a close eye on to because there's some elevated deliveries in some of the outer markets within San Diego County. Orange County and L.A. County for the most part are pretty, I would say, inactive from a new development standpoint, primarily because there's very little land available and it's very expensive, if, in fact, you're able to find anything here, right here in the L.A. metro market, maybe a little bit more activity out in the Inland Empire. When you go into the Bay Area, again, San Francisco -- South San Francisco, again, no worries there. A little bit of heavy activity in the San Jose market that we're keeping a close eye on, but again, not a big amount of inventory on a percentage of existing base. So we continue to see in our own development pipeline in these markets where we've really had the opportunity to take existing assets for the most part and do some pretty meaningful expansions. And again, repeating what I just said around the traction we're getting from that activity, the expansions that we're doing are leasing up really well. So we're very pleased by that, seeing very good traction, and again, for the most part, I would say California is in pretty good shape."

So first of all, I think it's well known that one of the benefits of the product type itself is you can go through decades of use on our assets, and they can be every bit as vibrant in today's world and even more so in many cases, than they were originally developed. So there's very little obsolescence that we're seeing anywhere in the portfolio. What we're doing though to actually continue to enhance even some of those revenue streams, and again, amplify performance property to property with some of our older assets is a program we've talked a little bit about, which is our Property of Tomorrow program, where we're going through and putting, to your point, what we would call fifth generation attributes into many of these assets where we can, again, enhance the curve appeal of the asset through more modern paint scheme, signage, we're improving the office and customer areas that align with some of the technology issue or technology strategies that we've had. We're at this point going through California from a first-wave standpoint where we've taken about 125 of our generation 1 through 3 or 4 properties, some of which might be, say, 30 or 40 years old. They're in phenomenal locations. They drive very good occupancy and rent levels, but we're going to, hopefully, even see that much more opportunity once we've basically taking them -- taken them through the various stages of the elements that we would include in our generation brand-new properties. 
So that's working quite well. We're getting good reception from both customers and our employees as well. And then we're also now rolling that program into a number of markets nationally, which will include in the first quarter, parts of Florida. We've touched many parts of the boroughs, if not all of those properties, we're going to go into other parts of New York. We've already gone into markets like Chicago, for instance, and the Carolinas. So anyway, we're pretty excited about what we're doing. Now from a cost standpoint, we've talked about this program in the context of ultimately being about $0.5 billion or more once we get through the entire portfolio. 2019, we will have spent about $110 million on the program. And in 2020, we'll likely spend even a little bit more,  again, as we touch the markets I talked to. So, so far we're very pleased. 
Now as we're doing this, we're also making some technological updates to the properties, we're, as we speak, relighting interior LEDs on assets for both energy efficiency and again, better customer environments. We have begun changing out our access control systems, which is now based on a centralized system, which we've never had before. It's going to give us a lot of good data that we haven't had around customer activity. We're adding solar to a number of properties. So we've got a number of different elements of the overall program in motion. And like I mentioned, we're getting very good feedback from it and like the results."

So as we think about where it's going in future years, a lot of it will be dependent on what happened in those markets. So just looking at move-in rates for the third quarter, for example, you have markets like Los Angeles or Phoenix where you're up, call it, low to mid-single digits on move-in rates given what's going on there. The flip side is you've got Florida markets like Miami and Tampa, which are being impacted by new supply and those move-in rates are down, call it, 5% to 10%. I throw Houston into that bucket as well. And so the move-in rates we're using are not across the board, it's really a tactic to drive volume in areas where we're competing for new customers in a more competitive environment. As we move into -- to 2020, we're likely to see the mix of those markets continue to shift. So as we've spoken about in the past, looking back at the markets that were more challenged in prior year, we've seen some of those markets actually improve meaningfully. So a market like Chicago or Washington, D.C. that was maybe more impacted earlier on in the cycle is seeing better traction this year than they were last year. As we head into 2020, it's going to be a different mix of markets. But I think I'll let Joe speak to new supply in aggregate and by market, but it's a pretty dynamic management on our end as we seek to maximize revenue within those local submarkets."

We think we do better on that year in and year out. So ultimately, what we're seeking to do is maximize revenue. So we take into consideration the probabilities of vacates as well as the cost of that vacate and replacing that tenant, et cetera. So things vary throughout the year, but consistent strategies and no change or more conservatism or more aggressiveness as we get into the next few quarters. 
In terms of a governor, there are things in place that we use in order to make sure that we are maximizing that revenue over time. And so there's different governors in place and different strategies we use in different types of environments. But certainly, street rate and the rate with which a new customer would move-in is a -- the key component of the strategy.

One is, clearly, we pulled on this lever pretty hard in the third quarter and just spoke to some of the strategy thinking behind it from a revenue standpoint. But I think stepping back, it's managed very much dynamically at the local keyword level. And so as we monitor what the returns are, we're going to oscillate our strategies thereafter. So we can't predict exactly what's going to happen going forward. I would kind of step back in terms of advertising spend, and you think about where we are and what we're battling from a customer acquisition standpoint and just provide a little historical context. So if you go back in time, advertising as a percentage of revenue for Public Storage, at the end of the last cycle, beginning of this cycle, hover between, call it, 2% and 3% of revenue. As the customer acquisition environment got very healthy and certainly fundamentals were very solid in the beginning and middle part of this cycle, we decreased our advertising spend. In 2016, for example, advertising spend was just a touch over 1% of revenue in the same-store pool. 
We're looking now year-to-date, it's hovering just under 2%. So it gives you some context that, yes, while we've been increasing marketing spend, we've been doing so from a low base in what was a very attractive customer acquisition environment in 2014, '15, '16. And now we're in a certainly a more challenging and competitive environment and we're using that tool like we have in the past to drive new move-ins and occupancy."

So I'm just curious if you're setting yourself up for same-store revenue growth to potentially reaccelerate in the fourth quarter? Because maybe your -- the customers you've drawn into your company are paying that 50% off rate. Some will move-out, some will stay and they'll get the higher rent. Maybe the occupancy isn't cash flowing day 1. So maybe there's some built-in gains to recapture in the fourth quarter.

So again, statistically, obviously, you can see, again, through what we've done in the third quarter and then what we've got in our pipeline whether we've already closed or under contract for the fourth quarter. We're likely to acquire plus or minus about $375 million of assets this year. And that's 2x of what we did from our acquisition volume in 2018, for instance. And as I've talked to in the last couple of quarters, we do see more and more owners coming to us in a variety of different stages, whether they've already built assets, they may be in the first year or 2 of lease-up. They're not making either pro formas or revenue projections, and they've got some level of, I would call it, anxiety. I wouldn't call it pronounced, flat-out stress at this point, but there's definitely more anxiety-related conversations that we're having. By virtue of that, we're seeing sellers being far more reasonable around valuations. That's clearly what has led to some of the acquisition volume that we've already done this year and continue to see come our way. We've been able to capture some really nice assets in a number of markets that we wanted to build scale into. And we're anticipating that there is more of that to come. 
And the other factor that I would tell you that is starting to percolate a bit more than we've seen recently is even what I would call entitled land, whether an owner, again, may have acquired a piece of property 1, 2 or 3 years ago, again, anticipating pro formas that they felt confident about 1, 2, 3 years ago. Clearly, things have shifted. They're reassessing their own development returns, and we're seeing more opportunities to actually engage and particularly and potentially find some interesting opportunities there."

It's a combination of your traditional operators being willing to spend more, to acquire more customers. As we've increased our spend, we've seen incremental volume and I suspect others have as well. And so there's a component of your existing folks being more competitive. Certainly, the Google platform is a great one in the fact that its auction based. So they let us compete within their sandbox. And so, the environment is more competitive, and you see folks being more aggressive in their cost per click. There are also not only your big public REITs, but also your regional operators that have been more aggressive as well as some of your nontraditional storage folks like Vale, for instance, some of those operators have been more aggressive in cost per click as well. 
So that all adds to a higher cost per click environment, which as we look at our spend, that's a component of it. But then we need to, again, at the local level do we like the bids and the volumes that we're seeing? What do we get if we increase? What do we get if we decrease? And that's what we're managing.

So the one thing that UPS obviously has that others prior have not is more of a logistical network. The platform right now is based on kind of a bin concept. So not clearly understanding what way it might evolve over time. They're testing it out in 1 market. So we're going to continue to watch and understand as we have with the other platforms. But overall, the whole Vale model we continue to see as 1 that might be more akin to a traditional moving and storage type customer versus a traditional self-storage customer. A big difference to a self-storage model is you literally pay for access each and every time you want your goods. And then, at the end of the day, you don't even know where they are. So those are 2 pretty big hurdles relative to what, again, a core self-storage customer traditionally wants, which is access and basically, again, knowing that they can, again, get to their goods without having to pay fees to do so.

So there's lots of moving pieces there, but generally if you look back, while we've been battling this new supply between second quarter and third quarter, we've seen contract rent growth decelerate over that time period pretty simply because we've been using lower rates in many of our markets in order to drive that volume.

So, so far this year, we've issued over $1 billion of capital. As you've highlighted, our preferred activity is largely been to refinance existing preferreds and we're hopeful we have the opportunity to continue to do that. As we move through the fourth quarter, there's a series that becomes callable in the fourth quarter. But stepping back from a strategy standpoint, we plan on using both unsecured debt, which we can get attractive rates to your point, as well as preferred stock, which is a higher cost, but historically speaking, right now, is offering very historically attractive coupons, sub-5% is what we achieved in September. So we like both markets and we plan on using both going forward."

We used a similar mix of tools in the third quarter that we have throughout the year. So I won't go into the details on those, in particular, but lower move-ins or lower move-in rates and less promotional discounts year-over-year. But speaking directly to advertising, as we've discussed on previous calls, we've been increasing our spend through 2018 and 2019 as we've grown incrementally more confident in the demand response we've received through that channel. So advertising was up 70% in the quarter. We pulled pretty hard on this lever this quarter in order to get move-ins during the seasonally busy move-in period in July, August and September. 
We like the returns we've been getting from advertising, third quarter included. The incremental move-ins we're achieving -- or the incremental cost. Those marginal returns are attractive, that advertising expense is upfront, while the customer value will be earned over time. And kind of stepping back, Public Storage has real advantages online and we're taking advantage of those. First of which is our brand name, synonymous with our product, the top search term within the sector, almost half of our paid search volume comes in on brand searches, which drive efficiencies as well as conversion. And away from paid channels, a meaningful portion of our move-ins come directly to us unpaid, about 2/3. The second component is scale. We have top market shares in the top metropolitan markets in the United States, which allows for a better, richer shopping experience for our customers and good conversion at the local level. So this lever continues to work with occupancy ending up the quarter 70 basis points. We'll continue to plan to use this lever in coming quarters."

And we're pleased by the amount of activity that we were able to drive through this marketing spend. Occupancy at quarter end was up 70 basis points. That sets us up very well to go into Q4 and Q1 where we're not likely to see as much leasing activity because, again, those are traditionally our lowest volume quarters, but we continue to like, as Tom said, the value and the traction that we get by putting that level of spend into our marketing efforts."

Again, what we've been talking to now obviously for some time is the elevated level of supply that's been coming into many markets now for a number of years, starting in 2016, when about $2 billion nationally came in to the markets and then th",749,"Okay. Sure. Again, what we've been talking to now obviously for some time is the elevated level of supply that's been coming into many markets now for a number of years, starting in 2016, when about $2 billion nationally came in to the markets and then that doubled in 2017 to $4 billion; 2018, $5 billion; by all accounts, 2019 is going to equal 2018. And our view of 2020 is we will likely see some decrease in, again, deliveries and it may be anywhere from say 10% to 20%. We're hoping, clearly, as many others are, that it's 20% or even better, but we continue to track markets and statistics that are guiding us to about that, again, 15% to 20% down. So you take that into consideration holistically, again, over this time period you've seen anywhere from 1,600 to 2,000 new properties in our markets. That's about 120 million square feet. And again, market-to-market, particularly where this elevated supplies hit, we see the most commanding headwinds. 
So maybe more specifically to your question Jeremy, so where are we today? On the good news front, deliveries have been elevated in markets like Denver, Charlotte, Houston, Austin and Chicago. Those have all been poster child markets for these elevated level of deliveries and tougher operating markets but we're now starting to see that supply volume decrease, in some cases, pretty dramatically. But we're still dealing with the lingering effects of the amount of supply. So you take Denver, for instance, in 2018, a little over 2 million square feet went into that market. The good news is, it was less than half of that this year, and again, it's going to notch down likely in 2020. But holistically, that markets has seen about a 35% increase of supply in that time period compared to existing base of assets. 
So you've got to continue to maneuver around that elevated level of activity. Again, using markets like Charlotte, Austin, Chicago and Houston, as examples, where any one of those markets hit $1 million plus level of deliveries, Houston up more extreme. It's a big market, no question, but it hit about 2.5 million square feet of completions in 2018. It's ratcheted down, and we like the impact of that. But again, we're going to have to continue to maneuver around, again, how we're dealing with customer acquisition, pricing, et cetera. The flip side is we're still not out of the woods because you go back, again, to our prediction about what's going to happen in 2020, with plus or minus about $4 billion of assets coming into the markets. And we're going to see that impact as we're tracking and again, these are statistics tied to what's under construction and in development, okay? So this isn't -- these aren't deals that are planned or potentially contemplated. They're in motion, okay? So you're going to see more impact in Portland, Boston, Seattle, many parts of Florida, D.C., Minneapolis and New York. So we're clearheaded about the things that we're likely to need to do there. We've got a good playbook. We're going to continue to drive a lot of the things that we can to maximize revenue opportunity, maximize opportunity in customer acquisition. The third element I'll talk to as well is the fact that we do have and we like what we're seeing in our own development pipeline. So we've got about $540 million in today's pipeline. We've shifted out of markets like Texas as a whole for the most part where the last 2 or 3 years we've put a lot of development activity into both Houston and Dallas, and to a lesser degree, into Austin. But now we are going into a broader number of markets where we're seeing, again, opportunities to get good traction of these new developments. And then if you even look at our legacy, if you want to call that, or the development pipeline that we've delivered since 2013, it continues to lease-up quite well. 
I mentioned in my opening comment that this quarter, we saw about 21% NOI growth in that portfolio. Collectively, it's about a $1.4 billion investment, and today it's roughly at about 80%. So we like and we'll see very good traction out of that in coming quarters because, again, we've got more occupancy and we've got the impact of matured revenue opportunities, which, again, is clearly part of our successful strategy as we, again, both develop and mature these assets."

So -- okay. So for the most part, California is in very good shape. Now going south to north, there's parts of San Diego County, we're keeping a close eye on to because there's some elevated deliveries in some of the outer markets within San Diego County. Orange County and L.A. County for the most part are pretty, I would say, inactive from a new development standpoint, primarily because there's very little land available and it's very expensive, if, in fact, you're able to find anything here, right here in the L.A. metro market, maybe a little bit more activity out in the Inland Empire. When you go into the Bay Area, again, San Francisco -- South San Francisco, again, no worries there. A little bit of heavy activity in the San Jose market that we're keeping a close eye on, but again, not a big amount of inventory on a percentage of existing base. So we continue to see in our own development pipeline in these markets where we've really had the opportunity to take existing assets for the most part and do some pretty meaningful expansions. And again, repeating what I just said around the traction we're getting from that activity, the expansions that we're doing are leasing up really well. So we're very pleased by that, seeing very good traction, and again, for the most part, I would say California is in pretty good shape."

So a couple of different areas to talk to there. So first of all, I think it's well known that one of the benefits of the product type itself is you can go through decades of use on our assets, and they can be every bit as vibrant in today's world and even more so in many cases, than they were originally developed. So there's very little obsolescence that we're seeing anywhere in the portfolio. What we're doing though to actually continue to enhance even some of those revenue streams, and again, amplify performance property to property with some of our older assets is a program we've talked a little bit about, which is our Property of Tomorrow program, where we're going through and putting, to your point, what we would call fifth-generation attributes into many of these assets where we can, again, enhance the curve appeal of the asset through more modern paint scheme, signage, we're improving the office and customer areas that align with some of the technology issue or technology strategies that we've had. We're at this point going through California from a first-wave standpoint where we've taken about 125 of our generation 1 through 3 or 4 properties, some of which might be, say, 30 or 40 years old. They're in phenomenal locations. They drive very good occupancy and rent levels, but we're going to, hopefully, even see that much more opportunity once we've basically taking them -- taken them through the various stages of the elements that we would include in our generation brand-new properties. 
So that's working quite well. We're getting good reception from both customers and our employees as well. And then we're also now rolling that program into a number of markets nationally, which will include in the first quarter, parts of Florida. We've touched many parts of the boroughs, if not all of those properties, we're going to go into other parts of New York. We've already gone into markets like Chicago, for instance, and the Carolinas. So anyway, we're pretty excited about what we're doing. Now from a cost standpoint, we've talked about this program in the context of ultimately being about $0.5 billion or more once we get through the entire portfolio. 2019, we will have spent about $110 million on the program. And in 2020, we'll likely spend even a little bit more,  again, as we touch the markets I talked to. So, so far we're very pleased. 
Now as we're doing this, we're also making some technological updates to the properties, we're, as we speak, relighting interior LEDs on assets for both energy efficiency and again, better customer environments. We have begun changing out our access control systems, which is now based on a centralized system, which we've never had before. It's going to give us a lot of good data that we haven't had around customer activity. We're adding solar to a number of properties. So we've got a number of different elements of the overall program in motion. And like I mentioned, we're getting very good feedback from it and like the results."

So as we think about where it's going in future years, a lot of it will be dependent on what happened in those markets. So just looking at move-in rates for the third quarter, for example, you have markets like Los Angeles or Phoenix where you're up, call it, low to mid-single digits on move-in rates given what's going on there. The flip side is you've got Florida markets like Miami and Tampa, which are being impacted by new supply and those move-in rates are down, call it, 5% to 10%. I throw Houston into that bucket as well. And so the move-in rates we're using are not across the board, it's really a tactic to drive volume in areas where we're competing for new customers in a more competitive environment. As we move into -- to 2020, we're likely to see the mix of those markets continue to shift. So as we've spoken about in the past, looking back at the markets that were more challenged in prior year, we've seen some of those markets actually improve meaningfully. So a market like Chicago or Washington, D.C. that was maybe more impacted earlier on in the cycle is seeing better traction this year than they were last year. As we head into 2020, it's going to be a different mix of markets. But I think I'll let Joe speak to new supply in aggregate and by market, but it's a pretty dynamic management on our end as we seek to maximize revenue within those local submarkets."

We think we do better on that year in and year out. So ultimately, what we're seeking to do is maximize revenue. So we take into consideration the probabilities of vacates as well as the cost of that vacate and replacing that tenant, et cetera. So things vary throughout the year, but consistent strategies and no change or more conservatism or more aggressiveness as we get into the next few quarters. 
In terms of a governor, there are things in place that we use in order to make sure that we are maximizing that revenue over time. And so there's different governors in place and different strategies we use in different types of environments. But certainly, street rate and the rate with which a new customer would move-in is a -- the key component of the strategy. So as tenants get higher above street rate, the cost of that tenant leaving is higher."

So we can't predict exactly what's going to happen going forward. I would kind of step back in terms of advertising spend, and you think about where we are and what we're battling from a customer acquisition standpoint and just provide a little historical context. So if you go back in time, advertising as a percentage of revenue for Public Storage, at the end of the last cycle, beginning of this cycle, hover between, call it, 2% and 3% of revenue. As the customer acquisition environment got very healthy and certainly fundamentals were very solid in the beginning and middle part of this cycle, we decreased our advertising spend. In 2016, for example, advertising spend was just a touch over 1% of revenue in the same-store pool. 
We're looking now year-to-date, it's hovering just under 2%. So it gives you some context that, yes, while we've been increasing marketing spend, we've been doing so from a low base in what was a very attractive customer acquisition environment in 2014, '15, '16. And now we're in a certainly a more challenging and competitive environment and we're using that tool like we have in the past to drive new move-ins and occupancy."

Because maybe your -- the customers you've drawn into your company are paying that 50% off rate. Some will move-out, some will stay and they'll get the higher rent. Maybe the occupancy isn't cash flowing day 1. So maybe there's some built-in gains to recapture in the fourth quarter.

So again, statistically, obviously, you can see, again, through what we've done in the third quarter and then what we've got in our pipeline whether we've already closed or under contract for the fourth quarter. We're likely to acquire plus or minus about $375 million of assets this year. And that's 2x of what we did from our acquisition volume in 2018, for instance. And as I've talked to in the last couple of quarters, we do see more and more owners coming to us in a variety of different stages, whether they've already built assets, they may be in the first year or 2 of lease-up. They're not making either pro formas or revenue projections, and they've got some level of, I would call it, anxiety. I wouldn't call it pronounced, flat-out stress at this point, but there's definitely more anxiety-related conversations that we're having. By virtue of that, we're seeing sellers being far more reasonable around valuations. That's clearly what has led to some of the acquisition volume that we've already done this year and continue to see come our way. We've been able to capture some really nice assets in a number of markets that we wanted to build scale into. And we're anticipating that there is more of that to come. 
And the other factor that I would tell you that is starting to percolate a bit more than we've seen recently is even what I would call entitled land, whether an owner, again, may have acquired a piece of property 1, 2 or 3 years ago, again, anticipating pro formas that they felt confident about 1, 2, 3 years ago. Clearly, things have shifted. They're reassessing their own development returns, and we're seeing more opportunities to actually engage and particularly and potentially find some interesting opportunities there."

Is that just related to just larger more overall supply and some more competitive units on the market that's causing people to be in more aggressive marketing space? Is it Vale Storage? Is it something else? What do you think is the issue? Or is it something -- or is it just a monopoly practice of search?"

It's a combination of your traditional operators being willing to spend more, to acquire more customers. As we've increased our spend, we've seen incremental volume and I suspect others",250,"No. I think it's a good mix of a lot of the factors you highlighted. It's a combination of your traditional operators being willing to spend more, to acquire more customers. As we've increased our spend, we've seen incremental volume and I suspect others have as well. And so there's a component of your existing folks being more competitive. Certainly, the Google platform is a great one in the fact that it’s auction-based. So they let us compete within their sandbox. And so, the environment is more competitive, and you see folks being more aggressive in their cost per click. There are also not only your big public REITs, but also your regional operators that have been more aggressive as well as some of your nontraditional storage folks like Vale, for instance, some of those operators have been more aggressive in cost per click as well. 
So that all adds to a higher cost per click environment, which as we look at our spend, that's a component of it. But then we need to, again, at the local level do we like the bids and the volumes that we're seeing? What do we get if we increase? What do we get if we decrease? And that's what we're managing. And ultimately, as I spoke earlier, we like the returns. We'll see whether the rest of the environment and the rest of our competitors like the returns as cost per click continue to go higher, but we like what we're seeing."

We've done a variety of different customer surveys around this whole concept of Vale on-demand type platform. And thus far, we continue to see very little disruption and/or change in our own customer behavior because we continue to see pretty distinct differences between what that product offering is compared to what traditional self-storage is. So the one thing that UPS obviously has that others prior have not is more of a logistical network. The platform right now is based on kind of a bin concept. So not clearly understanding what way it might evolve over time. They're testing it out in 1 market. So we're going to continue to watch and understand as we have with the other platforms. But overall, the whole Vale model we continue to see as 1 that might be more akin to a traditional moving and storage type customer versus a traditional self-storage customer. A big difference to a self-storage model is you literally pay for access each and every time you want your goods. And then, at the end of the day, you don't even know where they are. So those are 2 pretty big hurdles relative to what, again, a core self-storage customer traditionally wants, which is access and basically, again, knowing that they can, again, get to their goods without having to pay fees to do so. So we'll continue to track it and see what evolves."

I won't go through it in detail because obviously, the folks on the phone can go through and read it. But I think the expense pressures generally continue to mount be it property taxes, property level payroll and the like. So even away from marketing expenses, there's no question that operating expenses have been more under pressure this year, and we think that's likely to continue for many of those line items.

As you move through the second quarter and into the third quarter, the busy season with lower move-in rates that is a big drag through those quarters on contract rent growth. And you've seen that this year, you've seen it in previous years as well. So there's nothing really new there. Maybe pointing to one factor that maybe made the second quarter a little bit better and the third quarter maybe a little bit worse, if you look at discount trends, for example, which are a component of revenue, discounts were down almost 7% in the second quarter, were down about 4% in the third quarter. So there's lots of moving pieces there, but generally if you look back, while we've been battling this new supply between second quarter and third quarter, we've seen contract rent growth decelerate over that time period pretty simply because we've been using lower rates in many of our markets in order to drive that volume. As those folks move in during the summer, that contract rent growth declined."
