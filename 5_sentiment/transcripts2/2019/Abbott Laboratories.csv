Today, I'll discuss our 2018 results as well as our outlook for 2019. For the full year 2018, we achieved ongoing earnings per share of $2.88, representing 15% growth versus the prior year. Strong performance across our bu",1400,"Thanks, Scott, and good morning. Today, I'll discuss our 2018 results as well as our outlook for 2019. For the full year 2018, we achieved ongoing earnings per share of $2.88, representing 15% growth versus the prior year. Strong performance across our businesses, along with underlying margin expansion and our synergy capture from recent acquisitions, enabled us to achieve EPS at the upper end of the initial guidance range we issued at the beginning of last year despite unfavorable currency shifts as we progress through the year. 
With our recent strategic shipping completed, our focus in 2018 was on running the company we built, and the result was an excellent year by every measure. All 4 of our major businesses performed well, contributing to overall organic sales growth of more than 7%, which is above the initial guidance range we set at the beginning of last year. At the same time, we generated operating cash flow of more than $6 billion, returning $2 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and announced the 14% increase in our dividend beginning this year.
We also increased our investments and capabilities for the future, including expanding manufacturing capacity in 2 important areas that will drive significant long-term growth, FreeStyle Libre, our revolutionary continuous glucose monitoring system; and Alinity, our family of highly differentiated diagnostic systems. 
And lastly, following 2 major acquisitions in 2017, we repaid more than $8 billion of debt, which significantly enhances our strategic flexibility going forward.
Our performance this past year demonstrates the strength of our strategy and execution. And for 2019, we're forecasting another year of strong financial performance. As we announced this morning, we forecast organic sales growth of 6.5% to 7.5%, and adjusted earnings per share of $3.15 to $3.25, reflecting double-digit growth. I'll now provide a brief overview of our 2018 results and 2019 outlook for each business.
I'll start with nutrition, where sales increased mid-single digits in 2018, reflecting a notable improvement in our growth rate versus the prior year. Sales growth this past year was well balanced across our Pediatric and Adult Nutrition businesses. 
Internationally, our focus on enhancing competitiveness with our well-known and trusted brands led to strong growth in both Asia and Latin America. In China, we saw improvement in both the market and our performance after the government transition to new food safety regulations in that country at the beginning of last year. 
And in the U.S., growth was driven by our Pediatric Nutrition business, led by above-market growth of Similac, our market-leading infant formula brand; and Pedialyte, our market-leading rehydration brand. Overall, the fundamental demographic and socioeconomic trends in the global nutrition market remained favorable and our position in the market remains very competitive.
In Established Pharmaceuticals, or EPD, sales grew 7% in 2018, led by double-digit growth in both India and China. Our strategy in EPD is unique and quite simple: To build significant presence, scale in leadership positions in the most attractive emerging markets where long-term growth in medicines will be driven by aging populations and the related rise in chronic diseases, increasing incomes and expanding access to care. 
We built our business over time through a series of strategic steps to be powered globally but driven locally. Our global scale sets us apart and provides a new competitive advantage versus local players, particularly when it comes to manufacturing and innovation. And our local decision-making allows us to be nimble and navigate the complexities of each country.
Health care spending in most emerging markets is less than half that of developed markets, which means there's lots of room for future growth. And our focus continues to be on strong execution across all elements of our business model to capitalize on the growth opportunities ahead.
Moving to diagnostics, where we consistently achieve above-market growth with our leading platforms. 2018 was no different with global organic sales growth of 7%. This past year was particularly important as we accelerated the launch of Alinity, our family of highly differentiated instruments in Europe and other international markets. Customer feedback has been outstanding, which quite frankly isn't a surprise to us given that Alinity was designed based on in countless hours on listening to and observing the needs of our customers. These systems are designed to be more efficient, running more tests in less space, generating results faster, minimizing human errors while continuing to provide quality routes. 
In 2019, while the international launch continues to gain momentum, we anticipate obtaining U.S. regulatory approvals for a critical mass of our test menu over the coming months, which will allow us to accelerate the launch of Alinity in the U.S. later this year. 
2018 was also an important year for our newly formed Rapid Diagnostics business. We achieved our sales of synergy targets for the year and are very pleased with the pace and progress of the integration of this business. We also made important advancements in our pipeline with new product launches in the areas of diabetes and cardiac care as well as molecular rapid tests for infectious diseased.  These new products, along with continued focus on strong execution across our portfolio, will drive accelerated growth for this business going forward. 
And lastly, I'll cover Medical Devices were sales grew 9% in 2018, exceeding the initial guidance range we set at the beginning of the year. Strong growth this past year was led by several areas, including Electrophysiology, Structural Heart and Diabetes Care as well as stabilization in our Rhythm Management and vascular businesses. 
In Electrophysiology, growth of 20% was led by our heart mapping and ablation portfolio. During the year, we advanced our product portfolio in this area with the launch of our adviser HD catheter, which creates highly detailed maps of the heart. And earlier this week, we announced U.S. FDA approval of our innovative tactic cap sensor enabled catheter, which will further strengthen our competitiveness in this highly underpenetrated market.
In Structural Heart, 2018 was a landmark year for our business. We achieved double-digit growth, and perhaps, more importantly announced clinical trial results for MitraClip, our market-leading device for the minimally invasive repair of the mitral valve, which demonstrated improved survival in clinical outcomes in patients with the most prevalent form of this heart disease. We submitted the study data in the U.S. FDA during the fourth quarter to support consideration of an expanded indication for MitraClip. If approved, this advancements with further enhance our leadership position in this large and highly underpenetrated disease area and offer the potential to create a new multi-billion dollar cardiac device market over time.
And lastly, in Diabetes Care, we achieved growth of 35% in 2018. Growth was led by FreeStyle Libre, which achieved global sales of more than $1 billion, an increase of 100% versus the prior year. During the fourth quarter, we added 300,000 new users. As of the end of 2018, there are now approximately 1.3 million active users worldwide, of which approximately 2/3 are type 1 diabetics and 1/3 are type 2. 
In the U.S., we saw an accelerating trend of new users as we ramped up our awareness efforts during the second half of the year and pharmacy insurance coverage continued to increase, including an emerging trend of same Libre granted preferred co-pay status versus competitive systems due to its compelling overall value proposition. 
In Europe, during the fourth quarter, we initiated the launch of Libre 2.0, which includes optional alarms that 1 patients of glucose levels fall out of range. Due to our unique product design and highly automated manufacturing process, we're able to offer this feature to Libre users without increasing the cash pay price. This affordable and simple to use device is fundamentally changing the way people with diabetes manage their disease. And given the fact that more than 400 million people are living with diabetes around the world, Libre promises to be a significant growth driver for years to come. 
So in summary, 2018 was another outstanding year for us. We achieved our strategic and financial objectives despite challenging currency shifts during the year. Our top-tier performance demonstrates the strength of our strategy, our portfolio and our execution. And for 2019, we're forecasting continued strong organic sales growth and double-digit EPS growth. 
I'll now turn the call over to Brian to discuss our 2018 results and our 2019 outlook in a bit more detail. Brian?"

Sales for the fourth quarter increa",729,"Thanks, Miles. As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis, which is consistent with our previous guidance.
Turning to our results. Sales for the fourth quarter increased 6.4% on an organic basis, in line with our guidance of mid- to high single-digit growth. Rapid Diagnostics, which was acquired in late 2017 and is therefore not included in our 2018 organic sales growth results, achieved sales of $548 million. Exchange had an unfavorable year-over-year impact of 3.7% on fourth quarter sales. During the quarter, we saw the U.S. dollar continue to strengthen modestly, resulting in a somewhat larger unfavorable impact on our results in the fourth quarter compared to expectations had exchange rates held steady since the time of our earnings call in October. Regarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 59.3% of sales, adjusted R&D investment was 7.2% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense was 29.2% of sales.
Overall, as we look back at 2018, we delivered strong organic sales growth of more than 7%, adjusted earnings per share growth of 15% and exceed our cash flow and debt repayment objectives. 
Turning to our outlook for the full year 2019. Today, we issued guidance for adjusted earnings per share of $3.15 to $3.25. For the full year, we forecast organic sales growth of 6.5% to 7.5%. Based on current rates, we would expect exchange to have an unfavorable impact of approximately 3% on our full year reported sales with the vast majority of the impact expected to occur in the first half of the year. We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of somewhat above 59.5% of sales for the full year, which reflects underlying gross margin improvement across our businesses, partially offset by the impact of currency. We forecast adjusted R&D investment of around 7.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of approximately 29.5% of sales. We forecast net interest expense of around $600 million and nonoperating income of around $200 million. 
Lastly, we forecast an adjusted tax rate of around 15% for the full year 2019, which contemplates the anticipated impact from U.S. tax reform. 
Turning to our outlook for the first quarter. We forecast adjusted EPS of $0.60 to $0.62, which reflects strong double-digit underlying growth, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange in our results. We forecast organic sales growth of a little less than 7%, which contemplates a difficult comparison versus the first quarter of last year, when we saw abnormally strong sales in our Rapid Diagnostics business due to a record flu season. 
At current rates, we would expect exchange to have a negative impact of around 5.5% on our first quarter reported sales. We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of around 58.5% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of around 7.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of somewhat above 32% of sales.
Before we open the call for questions, I'll now provide a quick overview of our first quarter and full year organic sales growth outlook by business.
For Established Pharmaceuticals, we forecast mid-single-digit growth in the first quarter, which is comprised of mid- to high single-digit growth in our priority Key Emerging Markets, along with the  modest decline in other EPD sales, which reflects of the recent discontinuation of a noncore low margin in third-party supply agreement. For the full year, we forecast Established Pharmaceuticals growth of mid- to high-single digits.
In Nutrition, we forecast low- to mid-single-digit growth for both the first quarter and the full year. In Diagnostics, we forecast Abbott's legacy Diagnostics businesses, which is comprised of core laboratory, Molecular and Point of Care, to grow mid- to high-single digits for both the first quarter and full year, driven by the continued strong sales momentum across our portfolio of instruments.
Rapid Diagnostics, which will now be included in our organic sales growth results in 2019, is expected to be relatively flat in the first quarter, reflecting the difficulty flu season comparison I mentioned earlier. For the full year, we forecast Rapid Diagnostics growth of low- to mid-single digits.
And in Medical Devices, we forecast high single-digit sales growth for both the first quarter and the full year, which reflects continued double-digit growth in several areas of the business.
With that, we will now open the call for questions."

First of all, it's going extremely well. We do that in 300,000 patients last quarter. That's almost equivalent to the entire user base of the #2 competitor in the space. So I'd say that's going very well. We've got over 1.3 million patients now, 2/3 of those are type 1. Our intent with this device has been to serve the entire diabetic community and not niche it because we think it has mass-market potential worldwide. So we target both segments, both type 1 and type 2, and we're doing very well in type 1 segment -- of the type 1 segment, actually. As our capacity expense, we'll put even more effort behind the expansion with type 2 patients. The -- there's a constant, I would say, cadence of enhancements, et cetera, to the product. We've recently launched 2.0 in Europe. That should come to the U.S. shortly. We're -- we've obviously invested a fair bit in capacity expansion. And at the rate we're adding patients, obviously, that's something we started paying attention to a couple of years ago. And I'd say, a significant quantum of capacity will come online in the second half of this year. And from my perspective, that allows us to open the floodgate much wider. At this point, we're having a tremendous amount of success with Libre without putting much push behind it. And at that point, we're going to have an ability to turn on a lot of push. So -- and then we've got steady cadence of capacity additions after that. And because of the magnitude and the size of the diabetic market, both for type 1 diabetics and type 2 diabetics, our view was this had to have a value proposition for the patients and for the health care system that was accessible and affordable by everybody and not just driven by a rebate system and so forth. So we've got a very low cost position. We've got a good value access price points. And I think all of that is playing through our markets and our patient groups and influence groups and so forth very well. The product, obviously, is getting all the emphasis in development, et cetera, that anybody would like to see. I think this is a very big, long-term, sustainable growth product for the company, and I don't have any other way to say it. This is a [indiscernible] topic."

I think that the current growth rates speaks for itself. The current submissions and features of the product that we're adding speak for themselves. We're pretty highly focused on bring in that capacity online, not because we're constrained yet, but right now, we're adding as, I said, 300,000 patients a quarter and growing. And so you have to pay attention to keeping that momentum increasing. And at this point, would that make patients and the magnitude of the opportunity, our intent is to make this very much a mass-market product. But with 40 million type 1 diabetics out there, mass-market means every one of those type 1 diabetics are to be able to access this product economically, and that's worldwide. And then, of course, there's an enormous type 2 market beyond that. So this is not a product that's targeted solely at type 1 or solely at type 2. It's accuracy and performance. Obviously, has meaning and efficacy in all segments. Our cost position is as low as anything in the industry. We have probably #1 cost position, #1 volume of patients position. I think we can pretty easily declare ourselves the leader in continuous glucose monitoring and growing faster than anybody else. So I'd just say that all of the things that you would expect us to be -- to be doing, including working with other third-party partners who would benefit from this technology all underway, have been for some time."

What you should read in that guidance is we've had an outstanding '18 and we just gave you guidance that's even better in '18. And the underlying growth rates are strong. The pipelines are strong. It's all organic growth. It's not dependent on lapping an acquisition. It's not driven in lapping an acquisition. It's not dependent on acquiring something and all the things that are driving our growth are coming around our own pipeline and watching globally. So if I take that a piece at time, Libre as a storage, it gets better and better and better. So obviously, that's a pretty big and high growth driver. That's a good thing. The Alinity program has had an outstanding year rolling out in the core lab, which is primarily driven by Europe. And we haven't really unleashed it yet fully in the U.S. or even fully in Asian markets. And as that menu reaches what I'll call, critical mass, that will tip up as well. And so far, everything we've seen with the rollout in Europe has been exceptional. Our share capture, our retention of rolling over a lot of our own customers and our own installed base, our price point and value point were, I'd say, extremely competitive, but it's better than that. And so that's going well and that momentum only gets better as we expands geography. And frankly, there's a couple aspects program that haven't really gone to market yet fully, our hematology piece, et cetera. So I think those are strong drivers. When we acquired Alere in the diagnostic space, it was a declining to slightly best -- at best, flat business. And that's been a nice story for us in terms of integrating it. We're going to be looking for now improving the growth of product pipeline and momentum going forward in that business, which is incrementally positive for the business. As I already mentioned, nutrition, compared to the prior 4, 5 years, has a nice, steady, sustainable forward-looking growth in the, let's call it, 3% to 5% range, somewhere in there. And that's a plus, that's an upside. The pipeline in devices is strong. It's good. I mean, we spoke earlier in the year about the COAPT trial driving MitraClip and Structural Heart. And there's a nice pipeline of products and enhancements coming behind of that. We just launched that approval for HeartMate 3 for destination therapy, some additional catheters in our Electrophysiology business that help us be even more competitive than the 20% growth rate we've got now. Just everything across the board gets better. Where do we see problems? Well, we've got a couple of places that we're not too happy about our own performance in. We know neuromod is a super good growth business. We expect to see sequentially improving growth out of that business over the course of the year. I've talked about that on previous calls. We believe we're in control of our destiny there. And if we -- if anything, I'd probably estimated the speed of which we can correct our destination there wrong. It's taking a little longer than I would have guessed. But that's going to get sequentially better, and I think that's a plus. The Point of Care business that's part of our Diagnostics business, not Alere, but our own Point of Care business, we had some corrections to make in our strategy, and we've done that. And so I'm quite optimistic that our management team there has a good path, good management team, et cetera. That will improve. So if I had a concern at all with some things I can't control, I think our fundamental underlying strategy in the pharmaceutical business is solid. I think the underlying growth rates in emerging markets are solid. I know the world worries about the volatility of those markets and the reliability of those markets, and in particular, currency. And we're all going to live with currency for a multinational company, and I don't think we're any different. And to be honest, we're not that different indexed now with the addition of the Medical Devices and diagnostics and so forth in the company. So while we may have, let's call it, individuals circumstances in any given emerging market, in any given year, which we kind of expect, I think the underlying growth of that business, driven by the development of those economy's health care systems, is solid. So I look at all aspect of the company, whenever we're not performing where we think we should in a given business, we do take corrective steps. And as I look across the portfolio, every single business, which had such a great year last year or actually have a little better one this year or a lot better one this year and on a sustainable business going forward. So as I look forward into '19, I note that there's a lot of caution in the world about economies and any number of other things. We base our growth rates and our growth projections on our products, on the market dynamics we see in each of our product areas in the segments we compete in, and we've got a rich portfolio of products right now and a rich portfolio of products coming out of our organic R&D. And a lot of longevity on the driving of those products in the market for years to come. So whatever the windiness of the currency markets or other things may be, we've demonstrated through '18 and will demonstrate into '19 that we can power through that and continue to deliver the kind of growth that shareholders reliably expect."

And even as you look at our quarters, I mentioned in my script that FX would be more front-end loaded. It's first half phenomena. But underlying growth that we're portraying here for the first quarter and the full year is pretty range bound in that underlying double-digit earnings per share growth of the midteens, plus or minus a couple of points. And there's a lot of underlying gross margin improvement still going on across our businesses. There's a lot of synergy still being captured in gross margins as well as SG&A as it pertains to our continued integration with St. Jude and also with Rapid Diagnostics. So you're seeing the margin expansion come through in our margin line in our guidance."

This is Miles. First of all, Brian mentioned, exchange, as we know it right now, is factored into our guidance and we're still at a double-digit EPS growth. The exchange that we're, I don't know, seeing in our guidan",464,"Yes, I'd reiterate a couple of things. This is Miles. First of all, Brian mentioned, exchange, as we know it right now, is factored into our guidance and we're still at a double-digit EPS growth. The exchange that we're, I don't know, seeing in our guidance is a factor of last year. Meaning, '18, we got a lap. And so it's that roll-through that is currently taking us from what otherwise would have been 15% to what the midpoint would be 11%. So we're still at healthy double-digits and it's in effect caused by lapping last year's guidance. None of us are currency traders, so there's no way to kind of predict what's going to happen with the year. And I hesitate to do so until the fate strike us down. But with regard to profits and performance and so forth, I'd say the company has always been fortunate that it's had strong profits and strong cash flow. And with regard to forecasting and so forth, you know we start every year with a double-digit target and a high bar, and that's our aspiration every single year and gosh, more often than not, that's where we start with our guidance. Now having said that, out of the last 11 years and why I not go back further than 11 years? I don't have the data, but I could get it. But in out of the last 44 quarters that we reported, we have beat 39 of them, exceeded the investor's expectations, beat 39 of them and met on 5. And so I think the company has demonstrated that if it exceeds its expectations, if it exceeds Wall Street's expectations, if it exceeds in performance, we do share that back to our investors in increased profitability or increased return to the investor. And there's no reason to see a change to that. We've got strong cash flow. We're able to cover all of our cash and investment needs from a capital standpoint, from a dividend standpoint. We have the capacity to buy back shares, to offset dilution and frankly, buy back shares if it's the best investment that we can make. We have the capacity to do M&A. We've obviously been able to pay down a lot of debt and very, very rapidly so that we would have the balance sheet flexibility that we want. So we had a very strong performance, strong profitability, strong cash flow. And so if we exceed our expectations and our performance, then obviously, we have the decision, and that's a nice place to be. We have the decision to share that with our investors, which is exactly what our investors would expect. And you can tell that 90% of the quarters for the last 11 years, investors are benefited."

And I think the regulatory bodies will give that all the right consideration.

I mean, you went from 2 years ago an over levered company to now frankly, relative to peers, an under levered company. I think debt pay-down and free cash generation were sort of unsung heroes of last year. So many other companies have picked up the relative pace of M&A. You're still growing at a pretty robust 7% plus rate without significant M&A in the last couple of years. So where do you stand now as you think about reinvestment for growth?

I mean, as you know, a lot of M&A deals struggle to return a good return to shareholders. We've had, let's say, an excellent track record going back deep in our history with know and Humera so forth. We had a really good track record with the M&A we've done over time. And we've managed those companies and their products well over time. So I'd say, first of all, you make a much higher return on your organic growth. The growth we're getting from all of our businesses and even St. Jude is coming out of pipeline, and it's coming out of our own organic development, et cetera. And right now, those are the highest returns, those are the highest, biggest opportunities, and we certainly don't see gaps right now that we have fulfilled with M&A. So we're able to return a pretty good sales and profit growth rates across the business. We've also been careful over time. There's times to being the M&A markets and there's times not to be. And when multiples are really a high, bad time to buy. And -- but to be honest, I don't see anything right now that is so appealing that we feel like that's necessarily good direction for us. And the kinds of things we might look at, well, I would never tell you anyway and you know that. But right now, our opportunities are so good with our own organic products and execution that we don't need it. And there's not something that's so attractive. All of the various investment banking houses that you can imagine have put many things in front of us as opportunities as they do every company, et cetera. So it's not like we're not aware of what opportunities may be out there. It's just they wouldn't meet our criteria. I don't see something compelling. I don't see something that we need. And right now, we're in a fortunate position where we've got very strong products and pipelines and strategies across all of our businesses. I will say we can execute better in some places, but you can't buy that. So we fix our own execution with our talent and strategies and so forth. But it's just not necessary for us to put our money into M&A right now because I don't think we turn a better return for our shareholders now or at least in the foreseeable future doing that. We're going to make a lot more money for our shareholders, investing in our growth, investing in the products we have, investing in our expansion, investing in our own capital. And as you know, we have plenty of cash flow to do that, and we have plenty of cash flow that we can still return increasing dividends. And at some point here, we'll have a choice. We're going to keep paying down debt because I think it's a good idea. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio now is below 2  and as you know, it was more like 4 to 4.3 when we completed the Alere and the St. Jude deals. That wasn't that long ago. So to have brought our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio down that far and that fast and particularly, as we look forward in a rising interest rate environment or potentially so, depending on what you believe, I think we're doing the right things in the management of our balance sheet. I wanted to get that debt down fast, we have. I wanted to have strategic flexibility, we have it. What I really want is capital allocation, flexibility to earn the right returns and the optimal returns for our shareholders, and I think we're in that position. So I just don't see M&A right now as a high priority."

And you can transact, you can try to make money for your shareholders with transactions, but I would say this, as you know, Joanne, I've been in this job for a long time. And earlier in my tenure, there was a role for nutrition in our portfolio. And I've got the same question then. And one of the roles was it's kind of global presence, global infrastructure, it's highly profitable, generates a lot of cash, and a lot of the M&A activities and other things that we didn't back in my earlier years benefited from the cash flows and position of nutrition. And even today, there are great benefits to our Nutrition business to the company. And that's not to say that any given part of the company has to be part of it. It's clearly a different business, as is our pharmaceutical business, et cetera. But today, I'd say, look, it make sense as part of our company. I don't think we need to be considering a transaction just to do it. We're well valued. We're performing well. I don't honestly think I would create more value for our investors by separating it. If everybody ask you about or often enough you go look at it, okay, I looked at it. I don't think we can create differential improved value for our shareholders than what is already being executed by us. I think that's a plus. I think that, in general, although a lot of people might ask me about it, it's also performing well. I'm happy that it's performing a lot better than it did for a couple of years there. So it's just not in my radar screen. I don't think we're going to improve Abbott. I don't think we're going to create value by considering it. And I think we'll distract ourselves with that at a time we don't need even to be distracted. So it's not on my radar screen as a way to create value for shareholders because I don't think it will. And I think it's being well valued as part of Abbott as just the rest of Abbott. So it's not on my radar screen nor do I think it's necessarily beneficial to us. I guess, that's the simplest thing to say."

There's -- for any particular capital use, there's a timing and there's -- or there's a need. If you've got to the invest in capacity internally and manufactured and so forth, obviously, that's a good thing. And as I've said, we can afford all of that and more. We're keeping our dividend healthy. We target our dividend generally in a range 40% or higher of our EPS as a payout ratio at a nice, healthy range. And a number of our peer group don't do that at all. So I think we've got a good healthy dividend. And that matters to us because we have a large segment of investors that care about that. With regard to M&A, M&A is necessarily opportunistic. It depends on the product, the company, the business, the timing, market values, multiple, all sorts of things. But right now, I don't see any of that lining up to say, wow, there's something we're dying to go look at. And then with regard to share buybacks, Rick, it's sort of depends on valuations in the market. There's times when share buybacks aren't that economical and other times when they're higher return. And on our case, right now, we've got the flexibility if we want to do any a kind of share back, just offset dilution and so forth, we can do that. And -- but I think you've kind of look at it and say that's my best use of cash. I still want to pay down debt. I don't want to assume we're just going to carry this forward. We paid down a lot of debt fast. It would actually be in our interest to keep doing that, to keep paying it down. I think we're well into a reasonable range now of debt, but we still want to keep paying that debt down. And our cash flow is strong enough that we do have a choice. We do -- we have the ability to pay the dividend. We have the ability to do all these things. We can satisfy our capital needs internally. So I think -- I guess, the best thing about it is we don't think about it in any mechanistic or formula way dividing it in half or whatever. We kind of look at where the best -- where the need is and where the best return is. And I think it [indiscernible] us to leave ourselves also in a very strong position and lower debt level. So we've got places to use it and places to use it economically. When -- before tax reform, when so much cash was trapped overseas, we were fortunate that we had M&A opportunities to invest that cash for good return. We're not stuck like that now. We can manage cash, manage the cash flows of the company and so forth far more efficiently in terms of the best returns or the best needs, and that's kind of how we look at it. If we find at our best use of the cash or a strong use of the cash is share buybacks, we certainly consider that. But right now, I wouldn't say that's our highest priority, either. It's still high priority to just keep paying down the debt. And a couple of years down the road here, depending on what happens with interest rates and so forth, we'll probably glad we did and we'll have tremendous strategic flexibility and still have very strong cash flow. So I think it just depends on circumstances at a given point in time."

For the full year 2018, we achieved ongoing earnings per share of $2.88, representing 15% growth versus the prior year. Strong performance across our businesses, along with underlying margin expansion and our synergy capture from recent acquisitions, enabled us to achieve EPS at the upper end of the initial guidance range we issued at the beginning of last year despite unfavorable currency shifts as we progress through the year. 
With our recent strategic shaping completed, our focus in 2018 was on running the company we've built, and the result was an excellent year by every measure. All 4 of our major businesses performed well, contributing to overall organic sales growth of more than 7%, which is above the initial guidance range we set at the beginning of last year. At the same time, we generated operating cash flow of more than $6 billion, returning $2 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends, and announced a 14% increase in our dividend beginning this year.
We also increased our investments in capabilities for the future, including expanding manufacturing capacity in 2 important areas that will drive significant long-term growth: FreeStyle Libre, our revolutionary continuous glucose monitoring system; and Alinity, our family of highly differentiated diagnostic systems. 
And lastly, following 2 major acquisitions in 2017, we repaid more than $8 billion of debt, which significantly enhances our strategic flexibility going forward.
Our performance this past year demonstrates the strength of our strategy and execution. And for 2019, we're forecasting another year of strong financial performance. As we announced this morning, we forecast organic sales growth of 6.5% to 7.5% and adjusted earnings per share of $3.15 to $3.25, reflecting double-digit growth. 
I'll now provide a brief overview of our 2018 results and 2019 outlook for each business. I'll start with Nutrition, where sales increased mid-single digits in 2018, reflecting a notable improvement in our growth rate versus the prior year. Sales growth this past year was well balanced across our Pediatric and Adult Nutrition businesses. 
Internationally, our focus on enhancing competitiveness with our well-known and trusted brands led to strong growth in both Asia and Latin America. In China, we saw improvement in both the market and our performance after the government transitioned to new food safety regulations in that country at the beginning of last year. 
And in the U.S., growth was driven by our Pediatric Nutrition business, led by above-market growth of Similac, our market-leading infant formula brand; and Pedialyte, our market-leading rehydration brand. Overall, the fundamental demographic and socioeconomic trends in the global nutrition market remain favorable, and our position in the market remains very competitive.
In Established Pharmaceuticals, or EPD, sales grew 7% in 2018, led by double-digit growth in both India and China. Our strategy in EPD is unique and quite simple: to build significant presence, scale and leadership positions in the most attractive emerging markets where long-term growth in medicines will be driven by aging populations and the related rise in chronic diseases, increasing incomes and expanding access to care. 
We've built our business over time through a series of strategic steps to be powered globally but driven locally. Our global scale sets us apart and provides a unique competitive advantage versus local players, particularly when it comes to manufacturing and innovation. And our local decision-making allows us to be nimble and navigate the complexities of each country. Health care spending in most emerging markets is less than half that of developed markets, which means there's lots of room for future growth. And our focus continues to be on strong execution across all elements of our business model to capitalize on the growth opportunities ahead.
Moving to Diagnostics, where we've consistently achieved above-market growth with our leading platforms. 2018 was no different with global organic sales growth of 7%. This past year was particularly important as we accelerated the launch of Alinity, our family of highly differentiated instruments in Europe and other international markets. Customer feedback has been outstanding, which, quite frankly, isn't a surprise to us given that Alinity was designed based on countless hours of listening to and observing the needs of our customers. These systems are designed to be more efficient, running more tests in less space, generating results faster, minimizing human errors while continuing to provide quality results. In 2019, while the international launch continues to gain momentum, we anticipate obtaining U.S. regulatory approvals for a critical mass of our test menu over the coming months, which will allow us to accelerate the launch of Alinity in the U.S. later this year. 
2018 was also an important year for our newly formed Rapid Diagnostics business. We achieved our sales and synergy targets for the year and are very pleased with the pace and progress of the integration of this business. We also made important advancements in our pipeline with new product launches in the areas of diabetes and cardiac care as well as molecular rapid tests for infectious diseases. These new products, along with continued focus on strong execution across our portfolio, will drive accelerated growth for this business going forward. 
And lastly, I'll cover Medical Devices, where sales grew 9% in 2018, exceeding the initial guidance range we set at the beginning of the year. Strong growth this past year was led by several areas, including Electrophysiology, Structural Heart and Diabetes Care, as well as stabilization in our Rhythm Management and Vascular businesses. 
In Electrophysiology, growth of 20% was led by our heart mapping and ablation portfolio. During the year, we advanced our product portfolio in this area with the launch of our Advisor HD Catheter, which creates highly detailed maps of the heart. And earlier this week, we announced U.S. FDA approval of our innovative TactiCath Sensor Enabled Catheter, which will further strengthen our competitiveness in this highly underpenetrated market.
In Structural Heart, 2018 was a landmark year for our business. We achieved double-digit growth and, perhaps more importantly, announced clinical trial results for MitraClip, our market-leading device for the minimally invasive repair of the mitral valve, which demonstrated improved survival and clinical outcomes in patients with the most prevalent form of this heart disease. We submitted this study data to the U.S. FDA during the fourth quarter to support consideration of an expanded indication for MitraClip. If approved, this advancement would further enhance our leadership position in this large and highly underpenetrated disease area and offer the potential to create a new multibillion-dollar cardiac device market over time. 
And lastly, in Diabetes Care, we achieved growth of 35% in 2018. Growth was led by FreeStyle Libre, which achieved global sales of more than $1 billion, an increase of 100% versus the prior year. During the fourth quarter, we added 300,000 new users. As of the end of 2018, there are now approximately 1.3 million active users worldwide, of which approximately 2/3 are type 1 diabetics and 1/3 are type 2. 
In the U.S., we saw an accelerating trend of new users as we ramped up our awareness efforts during the second half of the year, and pharmacy insurance coverage continued to increase, including an emerging trend of seeing Libre granted preferred copay status versus competitive systems due to its compelling overall value proposition. 
In Europe, during the fourth quarter, we initiated the launch of Libre 2.0, which includes optional alarms that warn patients of glucose levels fallout range. Due to our unique product design and a highly automated manufacturing process, we're able to offer this feature to Libre users without increasing the cash pay price. This affordable and simple-to-use device is fundamentally changing the way people with diabetes manage their disease. And given the fact that more than 400 million people are living with diabetes around the world, Libre promises to be a significant growth driver for years to come. 
So in summary, 2018 was another outstanding year for us. We achieved our strategic and financial objectives despite challenging currency shifts during the year. Our top-tier performance demonstrates the strength of our strategy, our portfolio and our execution. And for 2019, we're forecasting continued strong organic sales growth and double-digit EPS growth. 
I'll now turn the call over to Brian to discuss our 2018 results and our 2019 outlook in a bit more detail. Brian?"

Sales for the fourth quarter increa",726,"Thanks, Miles. As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis, which is consistent with our previous guidance.
Turning to our results. Sales for the fourth quarter increased 6.4% on an organic basis, in line with our guidance of mid- to high single-digit growth. Rapid Diagnostics, which was acquired in late 2017 and is therefore not included in our 2018 organic sales growth results, achieved sales of $548 million. Exchange had an unfavorable year-over-year impact of 3.7% on fourth quarter sales. During the quarter, we saw the U.S. dollar continue to strengthen modestly, resulting in a somewhat larger unfavorable impact on our results in the fourth quarter compared to expectations had exchange rates held steady since the time of our earnings call in October. 
Regarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 59.3% of sales, adjusted R&D investment was 7.2% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense was 29.2% of sales.
Overall, as we look back at 2018, we delivered strong organic sales growth of more than 7%, adjusted earnings per share growth of 15% and exceeded our cash flow and debt repayment objectives. 
Turning to our outlook for the full year 2019. Today, we issued guidance for adjusted earnings per share of $3.15 to $3.25. For the full year, we forecast organic sales growth of 6.5% to 7.5%. Based on current rates, we would expect exchange to have an unfavorable impact of approximately 3% on our full year reported sales, with the vast majority of the impact expected to occur in the first half of the year. 
We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of somewhat above 59.5% of sales for the full year, which reflects underlying gross margin improvement across our businesses, partially offset by the impact of currency. We forecast adjusted R&D investment of around 7.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of approximately 29.5% of sales. We forecast net interest expense of around $600 million and nonoperating income of around $200 million. 
Lastly, we forecast an adjusted tax rate of around 15% for the full year 2019, which contemplates the anticipated impact from U.S. tax reform. 
Turning to our outlook for the first quarter. We forecast adjusted EPS of $0.60 to $0.62, which reflects strong double-digit underlying growth, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange on our results. We forecast organic sales growth of a little less than 7%, which contemplates a difficult comparison versus the first quarter of last year, when we saw abnormally strong sales in our Rapid Diagnostics business due to a record flu season. At current rates, we would expect exchange to have a negative impact of around 5.5% on our first quarter reported sales. 
We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of around 58.5% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of around 7.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of somewhat above 32% of sales.
Before we open the call for questions, I'll now provide a quick overview of our first quarter and full year organic sales growth outlook by business.
For Established Pharmaceuticals, we forecast mid-single-digit growth in the first quarter, which is comprised of mid- to high single-digit growth in our priority key emerging markets, along with a modest decline in other EPD sales, which reflects the recent discontinuation of a noncore low-margin third-party supply agreement. For the full year, we forecast Established Pharmaceuticals growth of mid- to high-single digits.
In Nutrition, we forecast low- to mid-single-digit growth for both the first quarter and the full year. In Diagnostics, we forecast Abbott's legacy Diagnostics businesses, which is comprised of Core Laboratory, Molecular and Point of Care, to grow mid- to high-single digits for both the first quarter and full year, driven by the continued strong sales momentum across our portfolio of instruments.
Rapid Diagnostics, which will now be included in our organic sales growth results in 2019, is expected to be relatively flat in the first quarter, reflecting the difficult flu season comparison I mentioned earlier. For the full year, we forecast Rapid Diagnostics growth of low- to mid-single digits.
And in Medical Devices, we forecast high single-digit sales growth for both the first quarter and the full year, which reflects continued double-digit growth in several areas of the business.
With that, we will now open the call for questions."

First of all, it's going extremely well. We did add 300,000 patients last quarter. That's almost equivalent to the entire user base of the #2 competitor in the space. So I'd say that's going very well. We got over 1.3 million patients now. 2/3 of those are type 1. Our intent with this device has been to serve the entire diabetic community and not niche it because we think it has mass-market potential worldwide. So we target both segments, both type 1 and type 2. And we're doing very well in type 1 segment -- the type 1 segment actually. And as our capacity expands, we'll put even more effort behind the expansion with type 2 patients. There's a constant, I would say, cadence of enhancements, et cetera, to the product. We've recently launched 2.0 in Europe. That should come to the U.S. shortly. We're -- we've obviously invested a fair bit in capacity expansion. And at the rate we're adding patients, obviously, that's something we started paying attention to a couple of years ago. And I'd say, a significant quantum of capacity will come online in the second half of this year. And from my perspective, that allows us to open the floodgate much wider. At this point, we're having a tremendous amount of success with Libre without putting much push behind it. And at that point, we're going to have an ability to turn on a lot of push. So -- and then we've got steady cadence of capacity additions after that. And because of the magnitude and the size of the diabetic market, both for type 1 diabetics and type 2 diabetics, our view was this had to have a value proposition for patients and for the health care system that was accessible and affordable by everybody and not just driven by a rebate system and so forth. So we've got a very low cost position. We've got a good value access price point. And I think all of that is playing through our markets and our patient groups and influence groups and so forth very well. The product obviously is getting all the emphasis in development, et cetera, that anybody would like to see. I think this is a very big, long-term, sustainable growth product for the company. I don't have any other way to say it. This is a hell of a good topic."

I think that the current growth rate speaks for itself. The current submissions and features of the product that we're adding speak for themselves. We're pretty highly focused on bringing that capacity online, and not because we're constrained yet, but right now, we're adding as, I said, 300,000 patients a quarter and growing. And so you have to pay attention to keeping that momentum increasing. And at this point, with that many patients and the magnitude of the opportunity, our intent is to make this very much a mass-market product. But with 40 million type 1 diabetics out there, mass market means every one of those type 1 diabetics ought to be able to access this product economically, and that's worldwide. And then of course, there's an enormous type 2 market beyond that. So this is not a product that's targeted solely at type 1 or solely at type 2. Its accuracy and performance obviously has meaning and efficacy in all segments. Our low -- our cost position is as low as anything in the industry. We have probably #1 cost position, #1 volume of patients position. I think we can pretty easily declare ourselves the leader in continuous glucose monitoring and growing faster than everybody else. So I'd just say that all of the things that you would expect us to be doing, including working with other third-party partners who would benefit from this technology, all underway, have been for some time."

Well, I think you've touched base there on several of them already. What you should read into that guidance is we had an outstanding '18 and we just gave you guidance that's even better than '18. And the underlying growth rates are strong. The pipeli",969,"Yes. Well, I think you've touched base there on several of them already. What you should read into that guidance is we had an outstanding '18 and we just gave you guidance that's even better than '18. And the underlying growth rates are strong. The pipelines are strong. It's all organic growth. It's not dependent on lapping an acquisition. It's not driven by lapping an acquisition. It's not dependent on acquiring something. And all the things that are driving our growth are coming right out of our own pipeline and launching globally. So if I take that a piece at a time, Libre as a story just gets better and better and better. So obviously, that's a pretty big and high-growth driver. That's a good thing. The Alinity program has had an outstanding year rolling out in the Core Lab, which is primarily driven by Europe. And we haven't really unleashed it yet fully in the U.S. or even fully in Asian markets. And as that menu reaches what I'll call critical mass, that will tip up as well. And so far, everything we've seen with the rollout in Europe has been exceptional. Our share capture, our retention of rolling over a lot of our own customers and our own installed base, our price point and value point were, I'd say, extremely competitive, but it's better than that. And so that's going well, and that momentum only gets better as we expand geographies. And frankly, there's a couple of aspects to that program that haven't really gone to market yet fully, our hematology piece, et cetera. So I think those are strong drivers. When we acquired Alere in the diagnostic space, it was a declining to slightly best -- at best, flat business. And that's been a nice story for us in terms of integrating it. We're going to be looking for now improving the growth of the new product pipeline and momentum going forward in that business, which is incrementally positive for the business. As I already mentioned, Nutrition, compared to the prior 4, 5 years, has a nice, steady, sustainable forward-looking growth in the, let's call it, 3% to 5% range, somewhere in there. And that's a plus, that's an upside. The pipeline in devices is strong. It's good. I mean, we spoke earlier in the year about the COAPT trial driving MitraClip in Structural Heart. And there's a nice pipeline of products and enhancements coming behind that. We just launched or got approval for HeartMate 3 for destination therapy, some additional catheters in our Electrophysiology business that help us be even more competitive than the 20% growth rate we've got now. Just everything across the board gets better. Where do we see problems? Well, we got a couple of places that we're not too happy about our own performance in. We know neuromod is a super good growth business. We expect to see sequentially improving growth out of that business over the course of the year. I've talked about that on previous calls. We believe we're in control of our destiny there. And if we -- if anything, I had probably estimated the speed at which we could correct our direction there wrong. It's taken a little longer than I would have guessed. But that's going to get sequentially better, and I think that's a plus. The Point of Care business that's part of our Diagnostic business, not Alere but the -- our own Point of Care business, we had some corrections to make in our strategy, and we've done that. And so I'm quite optimistic that our management team there has a good path, a good management team, et cetera. That'll improve. So if I had a concern at all, it's the things I can't control. I think our fundamental underlying strategy in the pharmaceutical business is solid. I think the underlying growth rates in emerging markets are solid. I know the world worries about the volatility of those markets and the reliability of those markets and, in particular, currency. And we're all going to live with currency if we're a multinational company, and I don't think we're any different. And to be honest, we're not that differently indexed now with the addition of the Medical Devices and Diagnostics and so forth in the company. So while we may have, let's call it, individual spotty circumstances in any given emerging market in any given year, which we kind of expect, I think the underlying growth of that business, driven by the development of those economies, the health care systems, is solid. So I look at all aspects of the company. Whenever we're not performing where we think we should in a given business, we do take corrective steps. And as I look across the portfolio, every single business which had such a great year last year actually had a little better one this year or a lot better one this year and on a sustainable basis going forward. So as I look forward into '19, I note that there's a lot of caution in the world about economies and any number of other things. We base our growth rates and our growth projections on our products, on the market dynamics we see in each of our product areas in the segments we compete in. And we've got a rich portfolio of products right now and a rich portfolio of products coming out of our organic R&D and a lot of longevity on the driving of those products in the market for years to come. So whatever the windiness of the currency markets or other things may be, we've demonstrated through '18 and will demonstrate into '19 that we can power through that and continue to deliver the kind of growth that our shareholders reliably expect."

But I think we've shown a good propensity to be balanced in that. We showed that demonstration even last year as we gave some pennies back to The Street when we had a variable tax rate but invested heavily in the growth opportunities that Miles talked about that creates the kind of sustainable growth that we're looking for. Your math is right. I said back on the October call that exchange would be around 4% to the bottom line impact. It's just a little touch above 4%. You could imply that, that would mean about mid-teens EPS growth. And even as you look at our quarters, I mentioned in my script that FX would be more front-end loaded. It's a first half phenomenon. But underlying growth that we're portraying here for the first quarter and the full year is pretty rangebound in that underlying double-digit earnings per share growth of the mid-teens, plus or minus a couple of points. And there's a lot of underlying gross margin improvement still going on across our businesses. There's a lot of synergy still being captured in gross margins as well as in SG&A as it pertains to our continued integration with St. Jude and also with Rapid Diagnostics. So you're seeing the margin expansion come through in our op margin line in our guidance."

First of all, Brian mentioned, exchange, as we know it right now is factored into our guidance, and we're still at a double-digit EPS growth. The exchange that we're, I don't know, seeing in our guidance is a factor of last year, meaning '18, that we've got to lap. And so it's that roll-through that is currently taking us from what otherwise would have been 15% to what at the midpoint would be 11%. So we're still at healthy double digits, and it's in effect caused by lapping last year's guidance. None of us are currency traders, so there's no way to kind of predict what's going to happen with the year, and I hesitate to do so for fear that fate strike us down. But with regard to profits and performance and so forth, I'd say the company has always been fortunate that it's had strong profits and strong cash flow. And with regard to forecasting and so forth, we start every year with a double-digit target and a high bar, and that's our aspiration every single year. And gosh, more often than not, that's where we start with our guidance. Now having said that, out of the last 11 years -- and why do I not go back further than 11 years? I don't have the data, but I could get it. But in out of the last 44 quarters that we have reported, we have beat 39 of them, exceeded the investors' expectations, beat 39 of them and met on 5. And so I think the company has demonstrated that if it exceeds its expectations, if it exceeds Wall Street's expectations, if it exceeds in performance, we do share that back to our investors in increased profitability or increased return to the investor. And there's no reason to see a change to that. We've got strong cash flow. We are able to cover all of our cash and investment needs from a capital standpoint, from a dividend standpoint. We have the capacity to buy back shares to offset dilution and, frankly, buy back shares if it's the best investment that we can make. We have the capacity to do M&A. We've obviously been able to pay down a lot of debt and very, very rapidly so that we would have the balance sheet flexibility that we want. So we had very strong performance, strong profitability, strong cash flow. And so if we exceed our expectations and our performance, then obviously, we have the decision -- and that's a nice place to be. We have the decision to share that with our investors, which is exactly what our investors would expect. And you can tell that 90% of the quarters for the last 11 years, investors have benefited."

It's obviously -- the COAPT study was very powerful, and I think the regulatory bodies will give that all the right consideration.

And then I mean, as you know, a lot of M&A deals struggle to return a good return to shareholders. We've had, let's say, an excellent track record -- going back deep in our history with Knoll and Humira and so forth, we've had a really good track record with the M&A we've done over time. And we've managed those companies and their products well over time. So I'd say, first of all, you make much higher return on your organic growth. The growth we're getting from all of our businesses and even St. Jude is coming out of pipeline, and it's coming out of our own organic development, et cetera. And right now, those are the highest returns, those are the highest, biggest opportunities, and we certainly don't see gaps right now that we have to fill with M&A. So we're able to return a pretty good sales and profit growth rate across the business. We've also been careful over time, there's times to be in the M&A markets and there's times not to be. And when multiples are really high, bad time to buy. And -- but to be honest, I don't see anything right now that is so appealing that we feel like that's necessarily good direction for us. And the kinds of things we might look at, well, I would never tell you anyway, and you know that. But right now, our opportunities are so good with our own organic products and execution that we don't need it. And there's not something that's so attractive. All of the various investment banking houses that you can imagine have put many things in front of us as opportunities as they do every company, et cetera. So it's not like we're not aware of what opportunities may be out there. It's just they wouldn't meet our criteria. I don't see something compelling. I don't see something that we need. And right now, we're in a fortunate position where we've got very strong products and pipelines and strategies across all of our businesses. I will say we can execute better in some places, but you can't buy that. So we fix our own execution with our talent and strategies and so forth. But it's just not necessary for us to put our money into M&A right now because I don't think we'd turn a better return for our shareholders now or at least in the foreseeable future doing that. We're going to make a lot more money for our shareholders, investing in our growth, investing in the products we have, investing in our expansion, investing in our own capital. And as you know, we have plenty of cash flow to do that, and we have plenty of cash flow that we can still return increasing dividends. And at some point here, we'll have a choice. We're going to keep paying down debt because I think it's a good idea. Our debt -- net debt-to-EBITDA ratio now is below 2, and as you know, it was more like 4 to 4.3 when we completed the Alere and St. Jude deals. That wasn't that long ago. So to have brought our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio down that far and that fast, and particularly, as we look forward in a rising interest rate environment or potentially so, depending on what you believe, I think we're doing the right things in the management of our balance sheet. I wanted to get that debt down fast; we have. I wanted to have strategic flexibility; we have it. What I really want is capital allocation flexibility to earn the right returns and the optimal returns for our shareholders, and I think we're in that position. So I just don't see M&A right now as a high priority."

It's highly profitable, generates a lot of cash. And a lot of the M&A activities and other things that we did back in my earlier years benefited from the cash flows and position of Nutrition. And even today, there are great benefits to our Nutrition business to the company. And that's not to say that any given part of the company has to be part of it. It's clearly a different business as is our pharmaceutical business, et cetera. But today, I'd say, look, it makes sense as part of our company. I don't think we need to be considering a transaction just to do it. We're well valued. We're performing well. I don't honestly think I would create more value for our investors by separating it. If everybody asks you about it often enough, you go look at it. Okay, I've looked at it. I don't think we can create differential improved value for our shareholders than what is already being executed by us. I think that's a plus. I think that in general, while a lot of people might ask me about it, it's also performing well. I'm happy that it's performing a lot better than it did for a couple of years there. So it's just not on my radar screen. I don't think we're going to improve Abbott. I don't think we're going to create value by considering it. And I think we'll distract ourselves with that at a time we don't even need to be distracted. So it's just not on my radar screen as a way to create value for shareholders because I don't think it will. And I think it's being well valued as part of Abbott as is the rest of Abbott. So it's just not on my radar screen and -- nor do I think it's necessarily beneficial to us. I guess that's the simplest thing to say."

There's -- for any particular capital use, there's a timing, and there's -- or there's a need. If we got to invest in capacity internally and manufacturing and so forth, obviously, that's a good thing. And as I've said, we can afford all of that and more. We're keeping our dividend healthy. We target our dividend generally in a range 40% or higher of our EPS as a payout ratio, a nice healthy range. And a number of our peer group don't do that at all. So I think we've got a good healthy dividend. And that matters to us because we have a large segment of investors that care about that. With regard to M&A, M&A is necessarily opportunistic. It depends on the product, the company, the business, the timing, market values, multiple, all sorts of things. And right now, I don't see any of that lining up to say, ""Wow, there's something we're dying to go look at."" And then with regard to share buybacks, Rick, it sort of depends on valuations in the market. There's times when share buybacks aren't that economical and other times when they're high return. And on our case, right now, we've got the flexibility. If we want to do any kind of share buyback just to offset dilution and so forth, we can do that. And -- but I think you kind of -- you got to look at it and say, ""Is that my best use of cash?"" I still want to pay down debt. I don't want to assume we're just going to carry this forward. We paid down a lot of debt fast. It would actually be in our interest to keep doing that, to keep paying it down. I think we're well into a reasonable range now of debt, but we still want to keep paying that debt down. And our cash flow is strong enough that we do have choice. We do -- we have the ability to pay the dividend. We have the ability to do all these things. We can satisfy our capital needs internally. So I think -- I guess the best thing about it is we don't think about it in any mechanistic or formula way, dividing it in half or whatever. We kind of look at where the best -- where the need is and where the best return is. And I think it behooves us to leave ourselves also in a very strong position and a lower debt level. So we got places to use it and places to use it economically. When -- before tax reform, when so much cash was trapped overseas, we were fortunate that we had M&A opportunities to invest that cash for good return. We're not stuck like that now. We can manage cash, manage the cash flows of the company and so forth far more efficiently in terms of the best returns or the best needs. And that's kind of how we look at it. If we find that our best use of the cash or a strong use of the cash is share buybacks, we'd certainly consider that. But right now, I wouldn't say that's our highest priority either. It's still a high priority to just keep paying down the debt. And a couple of years down the road here, depending on what happens with interest rates and so forth, we'd probably be glad we did, and we'll have tremendous strategic flexibility and still have very strong cash flow. So I think it just depends on circumstances at a given point in time."

For the full year 2018, we achieved ongoing earnings per share of $2.88, representing 15% growth versus the prior year. Strong performance across our businesses, along with underlying margin expansion and our synergy capture from recent acquisitions, enabled us to achieve EPS at the upper end of the initial guidance range we issued at the beginning of last year despite unfavorable currency shifts as we progressed through the year. 
With our recent strategic shaping completed, our focus in 2018 was on running the company we've built, and the result was an excellent year by every measure. All 4 of our major businesses performed well, contributing to overall organic sales growth of more than 7%, which is above the initial guidance range we set at the beginning of last year. At the same time, we generated operating cash flow of more than $6 billion, returning $2 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends, and announced a 14% increase in our dividend beginning this year.
We also increased our investments in capabilities for the future, including expanding manufacturing capacity in 2 important areas that will drive significant long-term growth: FreeStyle Libre, our revolutionary continuous glucose monitoring system; and Alinity, our family of highly differentiated diagnostic systems. 
And lastly, following 2 major acquisitions in 2017, we repaid more than $8 billion of debt, which significantly enhances our strategic flexibility going forward.
Our performance this past year demonstrates the strength of our strategy and execution. And for 2019, we're forecasting another year of strong financial performance. As we announced this morning, we forecast organic sales growth of 6.5% to 7.5% and adjusted earnings per share of $3.15 to $3.25, reflecting double-digit growth. 
I'll now provide a brief overview of our 2018 results and 2019 outlook for each business. I'll start with Nutrition, where sales increased mid-single digits in 2018, reflecting a notable improvement in our growth rate versus the prior year. Sales growth this past year was well balanced across our Pediatric and Adult Nutrition businesses. 
Internationally, our focus on enhancing competitiveness with our well-known and trusted brands led to strong growth in both Asia and Latin America. In China, we saw improvement in both the market and our performance after the government transitioned to new food safety regulations in that country at the beginning of last year. 
And in the U.S., growth was driven by our Pediatric Nutrition business, led by above-market growth of Similac, our market-leading infant formula brand; and Pedialyte, our market-leading rehydration brand. Overall, the fundamental demographic and socioeconomic trends in the global nutrition market remain favorable, and our position in the market remains very competitive.
In Established Pharmaceuticals, or EPD, sales grew 7% in 2018, led by double-digit growth in both India and China. Our strategy in EPD is unique and quite simple: to build significant presence, scale and leadership positions in the most attractive emerging markets where long-term growth in medicines will be driven by aging populations and the related rise in chronic diseases, increasing incomes and expanding access to care. 
We've built our business over time through a series of strategic steps to be powered globally but driven locally. Our global scale sets us apart and provides a unique competitive advantage versus local players, particularly when it comes to manufacturing and innovation. And our local decision-making allows us to be nimble and navigate the complexities of each country. Health care spending in most emerging markets is less than half that of developed markets, which means there's lots of room for future growth. And our focus continues to be on strong execution across all elements of our business model to capitalize on the growth opportunities ahead.
Moving to Diagnostics, where we've consistently achieved above-market growth with our leading platforms. 2018 was no different with global organic sales growth of 7%. This past year was particularly important as we accelerated the launch of Alinity, our family of highly differentiated instruments in Europe and other international markets. Customer feedback has been outstanding, which, quite frankly, isn't a surprise to us given that Alinity was designed based on countless hours of listening to and observing the needs of our customers. These systems are designed to be more efficient, running more tests in less space, generating results faster, minimizing human errors while continuing to provide quality results. In 2019, while the international launch continues to gain momentum, we anticipate obtaining U.S. regulatory approvals for a critical mass of our test menu over the coming months, which will allow us to accelerate the launch of Alinity in the U.S. later this year. 
2018 was also an important year for our newly formed Rapid Diagnostics business. We achieved our sales and synergy targets for the year and are very pleased with the pace and progress of the integration of this business. We also made important advancements in our pipeline with new product launches in the areas of diabetes and cardiac care as well as molecular rapid tests for infectious diseases. These new products, along with continued focus on strong execution across our portfolio, will drive accelerated growth for this business going forward. 
And lastly, I'll cover Medical Devices, where sales grew 9% in 2018, exceeding the initial guidance range we set at the beginning of the year. Strong growth this past year was led by several areas, including Electrophysiology, Structural Heart and Diabetes Care, as well as stabilization in our Rhythm Management and Vascular businesses. 
In Electrophysiology, growth of 20% was led by our heart mapping and ablation portfolio. During the year, we advanced our product portfolio in this area with the launch of our Advisor HD Catheter, which creates highly detailed maps of the heart. And earlier this week, we announced U.S. FDA approval of our innovative TactiCath Sensor Enabled Catheter, which will further strengthen our competitiveness in this highly underpenetrated market.
In Structural Heart, 2018 was a landmark year for our business. We achieved double-digit growth and, perhaps more importantly, announced clinical trial results for MitraClip, our market-leading device for the minimally invasive repair of the mitral valve, which demonstrated improved survival and clinical outcomes in patients with the most prevalent form of this heart disease. We submitted this study data to the U.S. FDA during the fourth quarter to support consideration of an expanded indication for MitraClip. If approved, this advancement would further enhance our leadership position in this large and highly underpenetrated disease area and offer the potential to create a new multibillion-dollar cardiac device market over time. 
And lastly, in Diabetes Care, we achieved growth of 35% in 2018. Growth was led by FreeStyle Libre, which achieved global sales of more than $1 billion, an increase of 100% versus the prior year. During the fourth quarter, we added 300,000 new users. As of the end of 2018, there are now approximately 1.3 million active users worldwide, of which approximately 2/3 are type 1 diabetics and 1/3 are type 2. 
In the U.S., we saw an accelerating trend of new users as we ramped up our awareness efforts during the second half of the year, and pharmacy insurance coverage continued to increase, including an emerging trend of seeing Libre granted preferred copay status versus competitive systems due to its compelling overall value proposition. 
In Europe, during the fourth quarter, we initiated the launch of Libre 2.0, which includes optional alarms that warn patients if glucose levels fallout range. Due to our unique product design and a highly automated manufacturing process, we're able to offer this feature to Libre users without increasing the cash pay price. This affordable and simple-to-use device is fundamentally changing the way people with diabetes manage their disease. And given the fact that more than 400 million people are living with diabetes around the world, Libre promises to be a significant growth driver for years to come. 
So in summary, 2018 was another outstanding year for us. We achieved our strategic and financial objectives despite challenging currency shifts during the year. Our top-tier performance demonstrates the strength of our strategy, our portfolio and our execution. And for 2019, we're forecasting continued strong organic sales growth and double-digit EPS growth. 
I'll now turn the call over to Brian to discuss our 2018 results and our 2019 outlook in a bit more detail. Brian?"

Sales for the fourth quarter increa",726,"Thanks, Miles. As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis, which is consistent with our previous guidance.
Turning to our results. Sales for the fourth quarter increased 6.4% on an organic basis, in line with our guidance of mid- to high single-digit growth. Rapid Diagnostics, which was acquired in late 2017 and is therefore not included in our 2018 organic sales growth results, achieved sales of $548 million. Exchange had an unfavorable year-over-year impact of 3.7% on fourth quarter sales. During the quarter, we saw the U.S. dollar continue to strengthen modestly, resulting in a somewhat larger unfavorable impact on our results in the fourth quarter compared to expectations had exchange rates held steady since the time of our earnings call in October. 
Regarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 59.3% of sales, adjusted R&D investment was 7.2% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense was 29.2% of sales.
Overall, as we look back at 2018, we delivered strong organic sales growth of more than 7%, adjusted earnings per share growth of 15% and exceeded our cash flow and debt repayment objectives. 
Turning to our outlook for the full year 2019. Today, we issued guidance for adjusted earnings per share of $3.15 to $3.25. For the full year, we forecast organic sales growth of 6.5% to 7.5%. Based on current rates, we would expect exchange to have an unfavorable impact of approximately 3% on our full year reported sales, with the vast majority of the impact expected to occur in the first half of the year. 
We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of somewhat above 59.5% of sales for the full year, which reflects underlying gross margin improvement across our businesses, partially offset by the impact of currency. We forecast adjusted R&D investment of around 7.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of approximately 29.5% of sales. We forecast net interest expense of around $600 million and nonoperating income of around $200 million. 
Lastly, we forecast an adjusted tax rate of around 15% for the full year 2019, which contemplates the anticipated impact from U.S. tax reform. 
Turning to our outlook for the first quarter. We forecast adjusted EPS of $0.60 to $0.62, which reflects strong double-digit underlying growth, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange on our results. We forecast organic sales growth of a little less than 7%, which contemplates a difficult comparison versus the first quarter of last year, when we saw abnormally strong sales in our Rapid Diagnostics business due to a record flu season. At current rates, we would expect exchange to have a negative impact of around 5.5% on our first quarter reported sales. 
We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of around 58.5% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of around 7.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of somewhat above 32% of sales.
Before we open the call for questions, I'll now provide a quick overview of our first quarter and full year organic sales growth outlook by business.
For Established Pharmaceuticals, we forecast mid-single-digit growth in the first quarter, which is comprised of mid- to high single-digit growth in our priority key emerging markets, along with a modest decline in other EPD sales, which reflects the recent discontinuation of a noncore low-margin third-party supply agreement. For the full year, we forecast Established Pharmaceuticals growth of mid- to high-single digits.
In Nutrition, we forecast low- to mid-single-digit growth for both the first quarter and the full year. In Diagnostics, we forecast Abbott's legacy Diagnostics businesses, which is comprised of Core Laboratory, Molecular and Point of Care, to grow mid- to high-single digits for both the first quarter and full year, driven by the continued strong sales momentum across our portfolio of instruments.
Rapid Diagnostics, which will now be included in our organic sales growth results in 2019, is expected to be relatively flat in the first quarter, reflecting the difficult flu season comparison I mentioned earlier. For the full year, we forecast Rapid Diagnostics growth of low- to mid-single digits.
And in Medical Devices, we forecast high single-digit sales growth for both the first quarter and the full year, which reflects continued double-digit growth in several areas of the business.
With that, we will now open the call for questions."

First of all, it's going extremely well. We did add 300,000 patients last quarter. That's almost equivalent to the entire user base of the #2 competitor in the space. So I'd say that's going very well. We got over 1.3 million patients now. 2/3 of those are type 1. Our intent with this device has been to serve the entire diabetic community and not niche it because we think it has mass-market potential worldwide. So we target both segments, both type 1 and type 2. And we're doing very well in type 1 segment -- the type 1 segment actually. And as our capacity expands, we'll put even more effort behind the expansion with type 2 patients. There's a constant, I'll say, cadence of enhancements, et cetera, to the product. We've recently launched 2.0 in Europe. That should come to the U.S. shortly. We're -- we've obviously invested a fair bit in capacity expansion. And at the rate we're adding patients, obviously, that's something we started paying attention to a couple of years ago. And I'd say, a significant quantum of capacity will come online in the second half of this year. And from my perspective, that allows us to open the floodgate much wider. At this point, we're having a tremendous amount of success with Libre without putting much push behind it. And at that point, we're going to have an ability to turn on a lot of push. So -- and then we've got steady cadence of capacity additions after that. And because of the magnitude and the size of the diabetic market, both for type 1 diabetics and type 2 diabetics, our view was this had to have a value proposition for patients and for the health care system that was accessible and affordable by everybody and not just driven by a rebate system and so forth. So we've got a very low cost position. We've got a good value access price point. And I think all of that is playing through our markets and our patient groups and influence groups and so forth very well. The product obviously is getting all the emphasis in development, et cetera, that anybody would like to see. I think this is a very big, long-term, sustainable growth product for the company. I don't have any other way to say it. This is a happy, happy topic."

I think you can assume that we're obviously developing every aspect of this product that you can imagine. And that's all going very well. I wouldn't communicate what I would forecast as time lines. I think that the current growth rate speaks for itself. The current submissions and features of the product that we're adding speak for themselves. We're pretty highly focused on bringing that capacity online, and not because we're constrained yet, but right now, we're adding as, I said, 300,000 patients a quarter and growing. And so you have to pay attention to keeping that momentum increasing. And at this point, with that many patients and the magnitude of the opportunity, our intent is to make this very much a mass-market product. But with 40 million type 1 diabetics out there, mass market means every one of those type 1 diabetics ought to be able to access this product economically, and that's worldwide. And then of course, there's an enormous type 2 market beyond that. So this is not a product that's targeted solely at type 1 or solely at type 2. Its accuracy and performance obviously has meaning and efficacy in all segments. Our low -- our cost position is as low as anything in the industry. We have probably #1 cost position, #1 volume of patients position. I think we can pretty easily declare ourselves the leader in continuous glucose monitoring and growing faster than everybody else. So I'd just say that all of the things that you would expect us to be doing, including working with other third-party partners who would benefit from this technology, all underway, have been for some time."

What you should read into that guidance is we had an outstanding '18 and we just gave you guidance that's even better than '18. And the underlying growth rates are strong. The pipelines are strong. It's all organic growth. It's not dependent on lapping an acquisition. It's not driven by lapping an acquisition. It's not dependent on acquiring something. And all the things that are driving our growth are coming right out of our own pipeline and launching globally. So if I take that a piece at a time, Libre as a story just gets better and better and better. So obviously, that's a pretty big and high-growth driver. That's a good thing. The Alinity program has had an outstanding year rolling out in the Core Lab, which is primarily driven by Europe. And we haven't really unleashed it yet fully in the U.S. or even fully in Asian markets. And as that menu reaches what I'll call critical mass, that will tip up as well. And so far, everything we've seen with the rollout in Europe has been exceptional. Our share capture, our retention of rolling over a lot of our own customers and our own installed base, our price point and value point were, I'd say, extremely competitive, but it's better than that. And so that's going well, and that momentum only gets better as we expand geographies. And frankly, there's a couple of aspects to that program that haven't really gone to market yet fully, our hematology piece, et cetera. So I think those are strong drivers. When we acquired Alere in the diagnostic space, it was a declining to slightly best -- at best, flat business. And that's been a nice story for us in terms of integrating it. We're going to be looking for now improving the growth of the new product pipeline and momentum going forward in that business, which is incrementally positive for the business. As I already mentioned, Nutrition, compared to the prior 4, 5 years, has a nice, steady, sustainable forward-looking growth in the, let's call it, 3% to 5% range, somewhere in there. And that's a plus, that's an upside. The pipeline in devices is strong. It's good. I mean, we spoke earlier in the year about the COAPT trial driving MitraClip in Structural Heart. And there's a nice pipeline of products and enhancements coming behind that. We just launched or got approval for HeartMate 3 for destination therapy, some additional catheters in our Electrophysiology business that help us be even more competitive than the 20% growth rate we've got now. Just everything across the board gets better. Where do we see problems? Well, we got a couple of places that we're not too happy about our own performance in. We know neuromod is a super good growth business. We expect to see sequentially improving growth out of that business over the course of the year. I've talked about that on previous calls. We believe we're in control of our destiny there. And if we -- if anything, I probably estimated the speed at which we could correct our direction there wrong. It's taken a little longer than I would have guessed. But that's going to get sequentially better, and I think that's a plus. The Point of Care business that's part of our Diagnostic business, not Alere but the -- our own Point of Care business, we had some corrections to make in our strategy, and we've done that. And so I'm quite optimistic that our management team there has a good path, a good management team, et cetera. That'll improve. 
So if I had a concern at all, it's the things I can't control. I think our fundamental underlying strategy in the pharmaceutical business is solid. I think the underlying growth rates in emerging markets are solid. I know the world worries about the volatility of those markets and the reliability of those markets and, in particular, currency. And we're all going to live with currency if we're a multinational company, and I don't think we're any different. And to be honest, we're not that differently indexed now with the addition of the Medical Devices and Diagnostics and so forth in the company. So while we may have, let's call it, individual spotty circumstances in any given emerging market in any given year, which we kind of expect, I think the underlying growth of that business, driven by the development of those economies, the health care systems, is solid. So I look at all aspects of the company. Whenever we're not performing where we think we should in a given business, we do take corrective steps. And as I look across the portfolio, every single business which had such a great year last year actually had a little better one this year or a lot better one this year and on a sustainable basis going forward. So as I look forward into '19, I note that there's a lot of caution in the world about economies and any number of other things. We base our growth rates and our growth projections on our products, on the market dynamics we see in each of our product areas in the segments we compete in. And we've got a rich portfolio of products right now and a rich portfolio of products coming out of our organic R&D and a lot of longevity on the driving of those products in the market for years to come. So whatever the windiness of the currency markets or other things may be, we've demonstrated through '18 and will demonstrate into '19 that we can power through that and continue to deliver the kind of growth that our shareholders reliably expect."

We showed that demonstration even last year as we gave some pennies back to The Street when we had a variable tax rate but invested heavily in the growth opportunities that Miles talked about that creates the kind of sustainable growth that we're looking for. 
Your math is right. I said back on the October call that exchange would be around 4% to the bottom line impact. It's just a little touch above 4%. You could imply that, that would mean about mid-teens EPS growth. And even as you look at our quarters, I mentioned in my script that FX would be more front-end loaded. It's a first half phenomenon. But underlying growth that we're portraying here for the first quarter and the full year is pretty range-bound in that underlying double-digit earnings per share growth of the mid-teens, plus or minus a couple of points. And there's a lot of underlying gross margin improvement still going on across our businesses. There's a lot of synergy still being captured in gross margins as well as in SG&A as it pertains to our continued integration with St. Jude and also with Rapid Diagnostics. So you're seeing the margin expansion come through in our op margin line in our guidance."

First of all, Brian mentioned, exchange, as we know it right now, is factored into our guidance, and we're still at a double-digit EPS growth. The exchange that we're, I don't know, seeing in our guidance is a factor of last year, meaning '18, that we've got to lap. And so it's that roll-through that is currently taking us from what otherwise would have been 15% to what at the midpoint would be 11%. So we're still at healthy double digits and it's, in effect, caused by lapping last year's guidance. None of us are currency traders, so there's no way to kind of predict what's going to happen with the year, and I hesitate to do so for fear that fates strike us down. But with regard to profits and performance and so forth, I'd say the company has always been fortunate that it's had strong profits and strong cash flow. And with regard to forecasting and so forth, we start every year with a double-digit target and a high bar, and that's our aspiration every single year. And gosh, more often than not, that's where we start with our guidance. Now having said that, out of the last 11 years -- and why do I not go back further than 11 years? I don't have the data, but I could get it. But in -- out of the last 44 quarters that we have reported, we have beat 39 of them, exceeded the investors' expectations, beat 39 of them and met on 5. And so I think the company has demonstrated that if it exceeds its expectations, if it exceeds Wall Street's expectations, if it exceeds in performance, we do share that back to our investors in increased profitability or increased return to the investor. And there's no reason to see a change to that. We've got strong cash flow. We are able to cover all of our cash and investment needs from a capital standpoint, from a dividend standpoint. We have the capacity to buy back shares to offset dilution and, frankly, buy back shares if it's the best investment that we can make. We have the capacity to do M&A. We've obviously been able to pay down a lot of debt and very, very rapidly so that we would have the balance sheet flexibility that we want. So we had very strong performance, strong profitability, strong cash flow. And so if we exceed our expectations and our performance, then obviously, we have the decision -- and that's a nice place to be. We have the decision to share that with our investors, which is exactly what our investors would expect. And you can tell that 90% of the quarters for the last 11 years, investors have benefited."

It's obviously -- the COAPT study was very powerful, and I think the regulatory bodies will give that all the right consideration.

And then I mean, as you know, a lot of M&A deals struggle to return a good return to shareholders. We've had, let's say, an excellent track record -- going back deep in our history with Knoll and Humira and so forth, we've had a really good track record with the M&A we've done over time. And we've managed those companies and their products well over time. So I'd say, first of all, you make much higher return on your organic growth. The growth we're getting from all of our businesses and even St. Jude is coming out of pipeline, and it's coming out of our own organic development, et cetera. And right now, those are the highest returns, those are the highest, biggest opportunities, and we certainly don't see gaps right now that we have to fill with M&A. So we're able to return a pretty good sales and profit growth rate across the business. We've also been careful over time. There's times to be in the M&A markets and there's times not to be. And when multiples are really high, bad time to buy. And -- but to be honest, I don't see anything right now that is so appealing that we feel like that's necessarily a good direction for us. And the kinds of things we might look at, well, I would never tell you anyway, and you know that. But right now, our opportunities are so good with our own organic products and execution that we don't need it. And there's not something that's so attractive -- all of the various investment banking houses that you can imagine have put many things in front of us as opportunities as they do every company, et cetera. So it's not like we're not aware of what opportunities may be out there. It's just they wouldn't meet our criteria. I don't see something compelling. I don't see something that we need. And right now, we're in a fortunate position where we've got very strong products and pipelines and strategies across all of our businesses. 
I will say we can execute better in some places, but you can't buy that. So we fix our own execution with our talent and strategies and so forth. But it's just not necessary for us to put our money into M&A right now because I don't think we'd turn a better return for our shareholders now or at least in the foreseeable future doing that. We're going to make a lot more money for our shareholders, investing in our growth, investing in the products we have, investing in our expansion, investing in our own capital. And as you know, we have plenty of cash flow to do that, and we have plenty of cash flow that we can still return increasing dividends. And at some point here, we'll have a choice. We're going to keep paying down debt because I think it's a good idea. Our debt -- net debt-to-EBITDA ratio now is below 2, and as you know, it was more like 4 to 4.3 when we completed the Alere and St. Jude deals. That wasn't that long ago. So to have brought our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio down that far and that fast, and particularly, as we look forward in a rising interest rate environment or potentially so, depending on what you believe, I think we're doing the right things in the management of our balance sheet. I wanted to get that debt down fast; we have. I wanted to have strategic flexibility; we have it. What I really want is capital allocation flexibility to earn the right returns and the optimal returns for our shareholders, and I think we're in that position.

We like our mix right now. There's a role to everything in our portfolio. And the one I'm asked more frequently about than anything is Nutrition. And you can transact, you can try to make money for your shareholders with transactions, but I would say this: as you know, Joanne, I've been in this job a long time. And earlier in my tenure, there was a role for Nutrition in our portfolio. And I got the same question then. And one of the roles was it's got a global presence, global infrastructure. It's highly profitable, generates a lot of cash. And a lot of the M&A activities and other things that we did back in my earlier years benefited from the cash flows and position of Nutrition. And even today, there are great benefits to our Nutrition business to the company. And that's not to say that any given part of the company has to be part of it. It's clearly a different business as is our pharmaceutical business, et cetera. But today, I'd say, look, it makes sense as part of our company. I don't think we need to be considering a transaction just to do it. We're well valued. We're performing well. I don't honestly think I would create more value for our investors by separating it. If everybody asks you about it often enough, you go look at it. Okay, I've looked at it. I don't think we can create differential improved value for our shareholders than what is already being executed by us. I think that's a plus. I think that in general, while a lot of people might ask me about it, it's also performing well. I'm happy that it's performing a lot better than it did for a couple of years there. So it's just not on my radar screen. I don't think we're going to improve Abbott. I don't think we're going to create value by considering it. And I think we'll distract ourselves with that at a time we don't even need to be distracted. So it's just not on my radar screen as a way to create value for shareholders because I don't think it will. And I think it's being well valued as part of Abbott as is the rest of Abbott. So it's just not on my radar screen and -- nor do I think it's necessarily beneficial to us. I guess that's the simplest thing to say."

The Afinion 2 cardiometabolic platform, another opportunity that we're putting emphasis behind. But I think there's -- generally speaking, there's a lot more possibility for us in incrementally updating and renewing a number of these platforms, and then there's newer stuff than that. And so when we took over the company, which we've now had in our possession a little over a year, one of our targets was to get our hands around the R&D of each of these segments and make sure we had an R&D plan in place, so there was a steady cadence of improvements and new products in each of these businesses. That does take a little time. In our first year, a lot of our focus was stabilizing the organization, its structure, the management, people, execution of what we've got, synergies, et cetera, which we've talked about.

You highlighted some thoughts about the -- your comfort in not doing M&A in today's portfolio. Obviously, that suggests share buyback and dividend. You've touched on it a little bit. But just wondering, are you feeling strongly about taking your excess cash and dividing it equally depending on stock price? I mean, do you have a priority? Is there some -- how are you thinking about it?"

There's -- for any particular capital use, there's a timing, and there's -- or there's a need. If we got to invest in capacity internally and manufacturing and so forth, obviously, that's a good thing. And as I've said, we can afford all of that and more. We're keeping our dividend healthy. We target our dividend generally in a range 40% or higher of our EPS as a payout ratio, a nice healthy range. And a number of our peer group don't do that at all. So I think we've got a good healthy dividend. And that matters to us because we have a large segment of investors that care about that. With regard to M&A, M&A is necessarily opportunistic. It depends on the product, the company, the business, the timing, market values, multiple, all sorts of things. And right now, I don't see any of that lining up to say, ""Wow, there's something we're dying to go look at."" And then with regard to share buybacks, Rick, it sort of depends on valuations in the market. There's times when share buybacks aren't that economical and other times when they're high return. And on our case, right now, we've got the flexibility. If we want to do any kind of share buyback just to offset dilution and so forth, we can do that. And -- but I think you kind of -- you got to look at it and say, ""Is that my best use of cash?"" I still want to pay down debt. I don't want to assume we're just going to carry this forward. We paid down a lot of debt fast. It would actually be in our interest to keep doing that, to keep paying it down. I think we're well into a reasonable range now of debt, but we still want to keep paying that debt down. And our cash flow is strong enough that we do have choice. We do -- we have the ability to pay the dividend. We have the ability to do all these things. We can satisfy our capital needs internally. So I think -- I guess the best thing about it is we don't think about it in any mechanistic or formula way, dividing it in half or whatever. We kind of look at where the best -- where the need is and where the best return is. And I think it behooves us to leave ourselves also in a very strong position at a lower debt level. So we got places to use it and places to use it economically. When -- before tax reform, when so much cash was trapped overseas, we were fortunate that we had M&A opportunities to invest that cash for good return. We're not stuck like that now. We can manage cash, manage the cash flows of the company and so forth far more efficiently in terms of the best returns or the best needs. And that's kind of how we look at it. If we find that our best use of the cash or a strong use of the cash is share buybacks, we'd certainly consider that. But right now, I wouldn't say that's our highest priority either. It's still a high priority to just keep paying down the debt. And a couple of years down the road here, depending on what happens with interest rates and so forth, we'd probably be glad we did, and we'll have tremendous strategic flexibility and still have very strong cash flow. So I think it just depends on circumstances at a given point in time."

Strong performance across our businesses, along with underlying margin expansion and our synergy capture from recent acquisitions, enabled us to achieve EPS at the upper end of the initial guidance range we issued at the beginning of last year despite unfavorable currency shifts as we progressed through the year. 
With our recent strategic shaping completed, our focus in 2018 was on running the company we've built, and the result was an excellent year by every measure. All 4 of our major businesses performed well, contributing to overall organic sales growth of more than 7%, which is above the initial guidance range we set at the beginning of last year. At the same time, we generated operating cash flow of more than $6 billion, returning $2 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends, and announced a 14% increase in our dividend beginning this year.
We also increased our investments in capabilities for the future, including expanding manufacturing capacity in 2 important areas that will drive significant long-term growth: FreeStyle Libre, our revolutionary continuous glucose monitoring system; and Alinity, our family of highly differentiated diagnostic systems. 
And lastly, following 2 major acquisitions in 2017, we repaid more than $8 billion of debt, which significantly enhances our strategic flexibility going forward.
Our performance this past year demonstrates the strength of our strategy and execution. And for 2019, we're forecasting another year of strong financial performance. As we announced this morning, we forecast organic sales growth of 6.5% to 7.5% and adjusted earnings per share of $3.15 to $3.25, reflecting double-digit growth. 
I'll now provide a brief overview of our 2018 results and 2019 outlook for each business. I'll start with Nutrition, where sales increased mid-single digits in 2018, reflecting a notable improvement in our growth rate versus the prior year. Sales growth this past year was well balanced across our Pediatric and Adult Nutrition businesses. 
Internationally, our focus on enhancing competitiveness with our well-known and trusted brands led to strong growth in both Asia and Latin America. In China, we saw improvement in both the market and our performance after the government transitioned to new food safety regulations in that country at the beginning of last year. 
And in the U.S., growth was driven by our Pediatric Nutrition business, led by above-market growth of Similac, our market-leading infant formula brand; and Pedialyte, our market-leading rehydration brand. Overall, the fundamental demographic and socioeconomic trends in the global nutrition market remain favorable, and our position in the market remains very competitive.
In Established Pharmaceuticals, or EPD, sales grew 7% in 2018, led by double-digit growth in both India and China. Our strategy in EPD is unique and quite simple: to build significant presence, scale and leadership positions in the most attractive emerging markets where long-term growth in medicines will be driven by aging populations and the related rise in chronic diseases, increasing incomes and expanding access to care. 
We've built our business over time through a series of strategic steps to be powered globally but driven locally. Our global scale sets us apart and provides a unique competitive advantage versus local players, particularly when it comes to manufacturing and innovation. And our local decision-making allows us to be nimble and navigate the complexities of each country. Health care spending in most emerging markets is less than half that of developed markets, which means there's lots of room for future growth. And our focus continues to be on strong execution across all elements of our business model to capitalize on the growth opportunities ahead.
Moving to Diagnostics, where we've consistently achieved above-market growth with our leading platforms. 2018 was no different with global organic sales growth of 7%. This past year was particularly important as we accelerated the launch of Alinity, our family of highly differentiated instruments in Europe and other international markets. Customer feedback has been outstanding, which, quite frankly, isn't a surprise to us given that Alinity was designed based on countless hours of listening to and observing the needs of our customers. These systems are designed to be more efficient, running more tests in less space, generating results faster, minimizing human errors while continuing to provide quality results. In 2019, while the international launch continues to gain momentum, we anticipate obtaining U.S. regulatory approvals for a critical mass of our test menu over the coming months, which will allow us to accelerate the launch of Alinity in the U.S. later this year. 
2018 was also an important year for our newly formed Rapid Diagnostics business. We achieved our sales and synergy targets for the year and are very pleased with the pace and progress of the integration of this business. We also made important advancements in our pipeline with new product launches in the areas of diabetes and cardiac care as well as molecular rapid tests for infectious diseases. These new products, along with continued focus on strong execution across our portfolio, will drive accelerated growth for this business going forward. 
And lastly, I'll cover Medical Devices, where sales grew 9% in 2018, exceeding the initial guidance range we set at the beginning of the year. Strong growth this past year was led by several areas, including Electrophysiology, Structural Heart and Diabetes Care, as well as stabilization in our Rhythm Management and Vascular businesses. 
In Electrophysiology, growth of 20% was led by our heart mapping and ablation portfolio. During the year, we advanced our product portfolio in this area with the launch of our Advisor HD Catheter, which creates highly detailed maps of the heart. And earlier this week, we announced U.S. FDA approval of our innovative TactiCath Sensor Enabled Catheter, which will further strengthen our competitiveness in this highly underpenetrated market.
In Structural Heart, 2018 was a landmark year for our business. We achieved double-digit growth and, perhaps more importantly, announced clinical trial results for MitraClip, our market-leading device for the minimally invasive repair of the mitral valve, which demonstrated improved survival and clinical outcomes in patients with the most prevalent form of this heart disease. We submitted this study data to the U.S. FDA during the fourth quarter to support consideration of an expanded indication for MitraClip. If approved, this advancement would further enhance our leadership position in this large and highly underpenetrated disease area and offer the potential to create a new multibillion-dollar cardiac device market over time. 
And lastly, in Diabetes Care, we achieved growth of 35% in 2018. Growth was led by FreeStyle Libre, which achieved global sales of more than $1 billion, an increase of 100% versus the prior year. During the fourth quarter, we added 300,000 new users. As of the end of 2018, there are now approximately 1.3 million active users worldwide, of which approximately 2/3 are type 1 diabetics and 1/3 are type 2. 
In the U.S., we saw an accelerating trend of new users as we ramped up our awareness efforts during the second half of the year, and pharmacy insurance coverage continued to increase, including an emerging trend of seeing Libre granted preferred copay status versus competitive systems due to its compelling overall value proposition. 
In Europe, during the fourth quarter, we initiated the launch of Libre 2.0, which includes optional alarms that warn patients if glucose levels fallout range. Due to our unique product design and a highly automated manufacturing process, we're able to offer this feature to Libre users without increasing the cash pay price. This affordable and simple-to-use device is fundamentally changing the way people with diabetes manage their disease. And given the fact that more than 400 million people are living with diabetes around the world, Libre promises to be a significant growth driver for years to come. 
So in summary, 2018 was another outstanding year for us. We achieved our strategic and financial objectives despite challenging currency shifts during the year. Our top-tier performance demonstrates the strength of our strategy, our portfolio and our execution. And for 2019, we're forecasting continued strong organic sales growth and double-digit EPS growth. 
I'll now turn the call over to Brian to discuss our 2018 results and our 2019 outlook in a bit more detail. Brian?"

As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis, which is consistent with our previous guidance.Turning to our results. Sales for the fourth quarter increa",726,"Thanks, Miles. As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis, which is consistent with our previous guidance.
Turning to our results. Sales for the fourth quarter increased 6.4% on an organic basis, in line with our guidance of mid- to high single-digit growth. Rapid Diagnostics, which was acquired in late 2017 and is therefore not included in our 2018 organic sales growth results, achieved sales of $548 million. Exchange had an unfavorable year-over-year impact of 3.7% on fourth quarter sales. During the quarter, we saw the U.S. dollar continue to strengthen modestly, resulting in a somewhat larger unfavorable impact on our results in the fourth quarter compared to expectations had exchange rates held steady since the time of our earnings call in October. 
Regarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 59.3% of sales, adjusted R&D investment was 7.2% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense was 29.2% of sales.
Overall, as we look back at 2018, we delivered strong organic sales growth of more than 7%, adjusted earnings per share growth of 15% and exceeded our cash flow and debt repayment objectives. 
Turning to our outlook for the full year 2019. Today, we issued guidance for adjusted earnings per share of $3.15 to $3.25. For the full year, we forecast organic sales growth of 6.5% to 7.5%. Based on current rates, we would expect exchange to have an unfavorable impact of approximately 3% on our full year reported sales, with the vast majority of the impact expected to occur in the first half of the year. 
We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of somewhat above 59.5% of sales for the full year, which reflects underlying gross margin improvement across our businesses, partially offset by the impact of currency. We forecast adjusted R&D investment of around 7.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of approximately 29.5% of sales. We forecast net interest expense of around $600 million and nonoperating income of around $200 million. 
Lastly, we forecast an adjusted tax rate of around 15% for the full year 2019, which contemplates the anticipated impact from U.S. tax reform. 
Turning to our outlook for the first quarter. We forecast adjusted EPS of $0.60 to $0.62, which reflects strong double-digit underlying growth, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange on our results. We forecast organic sales growth of a little less than 7%, which contemplates a difficult comparison versus the first quarter of last year, when we saw abnormally strong sales in our Rapid Diagnostics business due to a record flu season. At current rates, we would expect exchange to have a negative impact of around 5.5% on our first quarter reported sales. 
We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of around 58.5% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of around 7.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of somewhat above 32% of sales.
Before we open the call for questions, I'll now provide a quick overview of our first quarter and full year organic sales growth outlook by business.
For Established Pharmaceuticals, we forecast mid-single-digit growth in the first quarter, which is comprised of mid- to high single-digit growth in our priority key emerging markets, along with a modest decline in other EPD sales, which reflects the recent discontinuation of a noncore low-margin third-party supply agreement. For the full year, we forecast Established Pharmaceuticals growth of mid- to high-single digits.
In Nutrition, we forecast low- to mid-single-digit growth for both the first quarter and the full year. In Diagnostics, we forecast Abbott's legacy Diagnostics businesses, which is comprised of Core Laboratory, Molecular and Point of Care, to grow mid- to high-single digits for both the first quarter and full year, driven by the continued strong sales momentum across our portfolio of instruments.
Rapid Diagnostics, which will now be included in our organic sales growth results in 2019, is expected to be relatively flat in the first quarter, reflecting the difficult flu season comparison I mentioned earlier. For the full year, we forecast Rapid Diagnostics growth of low- to mid-single digits.
And in Medical Devices, we forecast high single-digit sales growth for both the first quarter and the full year, which reflects continued double-digit growth in several areas of the business.
With that, we will now open the call for questions."

First of all, it's going extremely well. We did add 300,000 patients last quarter. That's almost equivalent to the entire user base of the #2 competitor in the space. So I'd say that's going very well. We got over 1.3 million patients now. 2/3 of those are type 1. Our intent with this device has been to serve the entire diabetic community and not niche it because we think it has mass-market potential worldwide. So we target both segments, both type 1 and type 2. And we're doing very well in type 1 segment -- the type 1 segment actually. And as our capacity expands, we'll put even more effort behind the expansion with type 2 patients. There's a constant, I'll say, cadence of enhancements, et cetera, to the product. We've recently launched 2.0 in Europe. That should come to the U.S. shortly. We're -- we've obviously invested a fair bit in capacity expansion. And at the rate we're adding patients, obviously, that's something we started paying attention to a couple of years ago. And I'd say, a significant quantum of capacity will come online in the second half of this year. And from my perspective, that allows us to open the floodgate much wider. At this point, we're having a tremendous amount of success with Libre without putting much push behind it. And at that point, we're going to have an ability to turn on a lot of push. So -- and then we've got steady cadence of capacity additions after that. And because of the magnitude and the size of the diabetic market, both for type 1 diabetics and type 2 diabetics, our view was this had to have a value proposition for patients and for the health care system that was accessible and affordable by everybody and not just driven by a rebate system and so forth. So we've got a very low cost position. We've got a good value access price point. And I think all of that is playing through our markets and our patient groups and influence groups and so forth very well. The product obviously is getting all the emphasis in development, et cetera, that anybody would like to see. I think this is a very big, long-term, sustainable growth product for the company. I don't have any other way to say it. This is a happy, happy topic."

I think you can assume that we're obviously developing every aspect of this product that you can imagine. And that's all going very well. I wouldn't communicate what I would forecast as time lines. I think that the current growth rate speaks for itself. The current submissions and features of the product that we're adding speak for themselves. We're pretty highly focused on bringing that capacity online, and not because we're constrained yet, but right now, we're adding as, I said, 300,000 patients a quarter and growing. And so you have to pay attention to keeping that momentum increasing. And at this point, with that many patients and the magnitude of the opportunity, our intent is to make this very much a mass-market product. But with 40 million type 1 diabetics out there, mass market means every one of those type 1 diabetics ought to be able to access this product economically, and that's worldwide. And then of course, there's an enormous type 2 market beyond that. So this is not a product that's targeted solely at type 1 or solely at type 2. Its accuracy and performance obviously has meaning and efficacy in all segments. Our low -- our cost position is as low as anything in the industry. We have probably #1 cost position, #1 volume of patients position. I think we can pretty easily declare ourselves the leader in continuous glucose monitoring and growing faster than everybody else. So I'd just say that all of the things that you would expect us to be doing, including working with other third-party partners who would benefit from this technology, all underway, have been for some time."

What you should read into that guidance is we had an outstanding '18 and we just gave you guidance that's even better than '18. And the underlying growth rates are strong. The pipelines are strong. It's all organic growth. It's not dependent on lapping an acquisition. It's not driven by lapping an acquisition. It's not dependent on acquiring something. And all the things that are driving our growth are coming right out of our own pipeline and launching globally. So if I take that a piece at a time, Libre as a story just gets better and better and better. So obviously, that's a pretty big and high-growth driver. That's a good thing. The Alinity program has had an outstanding year rolling out in the Core Lab, which is primarily driven by Europe. And we haven't really unleashed it yet fully in the U.S. or even fully in Asian markets. And as that menu reaches what I'll call critical mass, that will tip up as well. And so far, everything we've seen with the rollout in Europe has been exceptional. Our share capture, our retention of rolling over a lot of our own customers and our own installed base, our price point and value point were, I'd say, extremely competitive, but it's better than that. And so that's going well, and that momentum only gets better as we expand geographies. And frankly, there's a couple of aspects to that program that haven't really gone to market yet fully, our hematology piece, et cetera. So I think those are strong drivers. When we acquired Alere in the diagnostic space, it was a declining to slightly best -- at best, flat business. And that's been a nice story for us in terms of integrating it. We're going to be looking for now improving the growth of the new product pipeline and momentum going forward in that business, which is incrementally positive for the business. As I already mentioned, Nutrition, compared to the prior 4, 5 years, has a nice, steady, sustainable forward-looking growth in the, let's call it, 3% to 5% range, somewhere in there. And that's a plus, that's an upside. The pipeline in devices is strong. It's good. I mean, we spoke earlier in the year about the COAPT trial driving MitraClip in Structural Heart. And there's a nice pipeline of products and enhancements coming behind that. We just launched or got approval for HeartMate 3 for destination therapy, some additional catheters in our Electrophysiology business that help us be even more competitive than the 20% growth rate we've got now. Just everything across the board gets better. Where do we see problems? Well, we got a couple of places that we're not too happy about our own performance in. We know neuromod is a super good growth business. We expect to see sequentially improving growth out of that business over the course of the year. I've talked about that on previous calls. We believe we're in control of our destiny there. And if we -- if anything, I probably estimated the speed at which we could correct our direction there wrong. It's taken a little longer than I would have guessed. But that's going to get sequentially better, and I think that's a plus. The Point of Care business that's part of our Diagnostic business, not Alere but the -- our own Point of Care business, we had some corrections to make in our strategy, and we've done that. And so I'm quite optimistic that our management team there has a good path, a good management team, et cetera. That'll improve. 
So if I had a concern at all, it's the things I can't control. I think our fundamental underlying strategy in the pharmaceutical business is solid. I think the underlying growth rates in emerging markets are solid. I know the world worries about the volatility of those markets and the reliability of those markets and, in particular, currency. And we're all going to live with currency if we're a multinational company, and I don't think we're any different. And to be honest, we're not that differently indexed now with the addition of the Medical Devices and Diagnostics and so forth in the company. So while we may have, let's call it, individual spotty circumstances in any given emerging market in any given year, which we kind of expect, I think the underlying growth of that business, driven by the development of those economies, the health care systems, is solid. So I look at all aspects of the company. Whenever we're not performing where we think we should in a given business, we do take corrective steps. And as I look across the portfolio, every single business which had such a great year last year actually had a little better one this year or a lot better one this year and on a sustainable basis going forward. So as I look forward into '19, I note that there's a lot of caution in the world about economies and any number of other things. We base our growth rates and our growth projections on our products, on the market dynamics we see in each of our product areas in the segments we compete in. And we've got a rich portfolio of products right now and a rich portfolio of products coming out of our organic R&D and a lot of longevity on the driving of those products in the market for years to come. So whatever the windiness of the currency markets or other things may be, we've demonstrated through '18 and will demonstrate into '19 that we can power through that and continue to deliver the kind of growth that our shareholders reliably expect."

We showed that demonstration even last year as we gave some pennies back to The Street when we had a variable tax rate but invested heavily in the growth opportunities that Miles talked about that creates the kind of sustainable growth that we're looking for. 
Your math is right. I said back on the October call that exchange would be around 4% to the bottom line impact. It's just a little touch above 4%. You could imply that, that would mean about mid-teens EPS growth. And even as you look at our quarters, I mentioned in my script that FX would be more front-end loaded. It's a first half phenomenon. But underlying growth that we're portraying here for the first quarter and the full year is pretty range-bound in that underlying double-digit earnings per share growth of the mid-teens, plus or minus a couple of points. And there's a lot of underlying gross margin improvement still going on across our businesses. There's a lot of synergy still being captured in gross margins as well as in SG&A as it pertains to our continued integration with St. Jude and also with Rapid Diagnostics. So you're seeing the margin expansion come through in our op margin line in our guidance."

This is Miles. First of all, Brian mentioned, exchange, as we know it right now, is factored into our guidance, and we're still at a double-digit EPS growth.

First of all, Brian mentioned, exchange, as we know it right now, is factored into our guidance, and we're still at a double-digit EPS growth. The exchange that we're, I don't know, seeing in our guidance is a factor of last year, meaning '18, that we've got to lap. And so it's that roll-through that is currently taking us from what otherwise would have been 15% to what at the midpoint would be 11%. So we're still at healthy double digits and it's, in effect, caused by lapping last year's guidance. None of us are currency traders, so there's no way to kind of predict what's going to happen with the year, and I hesitate to do so for fear that fates strike us down. But with regard to profits and performance and so forth, I'd say the company has always been fortunate that it's had strong profits and strong cash flow. And with regard to forecasting and so forth, we start every year with a double-digit target and a high bar, and that's our aspiration every single year. And gosh, more often than not, that's where we start with our guidance. Now having said that, out of the last 11 years -- and why do I not go back further than 11 years? I don't have the data, but I could get it. But in -- out of the last 44 quarters that we have reported, we have beat 39 of them, exceeded the investors' expectations, beat 39 of them and met on 5. And so I think the company has demonstrated that if it exceeds its expectations, if it exceeds Wall Street's expectations, if it exceeds in performance, we do share that back to our investors in increased profitability or increased return to the investor. And there's no reason to see a change to that. We've got strong cash flow. We are able to cover all of our cash and investment needs from a capital standpoint, from a dividend standpoint. We have the capacity to buy back shares to offset dilution and, frankly, buy back shares if it's the best investment that we can make. We have the capacity to do M&A. We've obviously been able to pay down a lot of debt and very, very rapidly so that we would have the balance sheet flexibility that we want. So we had very strong performance, strong profitability, strong cash flow. And so if we exceed our expectations and our performance, then obviously, we have the decision -- and that's a nice place to be. We have the decision to share that with our investors, which is exactly what our investors would expect. And you can tell that 90% of the quarters for the last 11 years, investors have benefited."

And then just following up on another point you made in this morning. Thinking about the balance sheet, I mean, you went from 2 years ago an overlevered company to now, frankly, relative to peers an underlevered company. I think debt paydown and free cash generation were sort of unsung heroes of last year. So many of other companies have picked up the relative pace of M&A. You're still growing at a pretty robust 7-plus percent rate without significant M&A the last couple of years. So where do you stand now as you think about reinvestment for growth? How active are you likely to be in '19 relative to '18 on the M&A front?"
247483,595353008,1640280,"Abbott Laboratories, Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Jan 23, 2019",2019-01-23,"Earnings Calls","Abbott Laboratories","Executives","Well, I'd say a couple of things.

And then I mean, as you know, a lot of M&A deals struggle to return a good return to shareholders. We've had, let's say, an excellent track record -- going back deep in our history with Knoll and Humira and so forth, we've had a really good track record with the M&A we've done over time. And we've managed those companies and their products well over time. So I'd say, first of all, you make much higher return on your organic growth. The growth we're getting from all of our businesses and even St. Jude is coming out of pipeline, and it's coming out of our own organic development, et cetera. And right now, those are the highest returns, those are the highest, biggest opportunities, and we certainly don't see gaps right now that we have to fill with M&A. So we're able to return a pretty good sales and profit growth rate across the business. We've also been careful over time. There's times to be in the M&A markets and there's times not to be. And when multiples are really high, bad time to buy. And -- but to be honest, I don't see anything right now that is so appealing that we feel like that's necessarily a good direction for us. And the kinds of things we might look at, well, I would never tell you anyway, and you know that. But right now, our opportunities are so good with our own organic products and execution that we don't need it. And there's not something that's so attractive -- all of the various investment banking houses that you can imagine have put many things in front of us as opportunities as they do every company, et cetera. So it's not like we're not aware of what opportunities may be out there. It's just they wouldn't meet our criteria. I don't see something compelling. I don't see something that we need. And right now, we're in a fortunate position where we've got very strong products and pipelines and strategies across all of our businesses. 
I will say we can execute better in some places, but you can't buy that. So we fix our own execution with our talent and strategies and so forth. But it's just not necessary for us to put our money into M&A right now because I don't think we'd turn a better return for our shareholders now or at least in the foreseeable future doing that. We're going to make a lot more money for our shareholders, investing in our growth, investing in the products we have, investing in our expansion, investing in our own capital. And as you know, we have plenty of cash flow to do that, and we have plenty of cash flow that we can still return increasing dividends. And at some point here, we'll have a choice. We're going to keep paying down debt because I think it's a good idea. Our debt -- net debt-to-EBITDA ratio now is below 2, and as you know, it was more like 4 to 4.3 when we completed the Alere and St. Jude deals. That wasn't that long ago. So to have brought our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio down that far and that fast, and particularly, as we look forward in a rising interest rate environment or potentially so, depending on what you believe, I think we're doing the right things in the management of our balance sheet. I wanted to get that debt down fast; we have. I wanted to have strategic flexibility; we have it. What I really want is capital allocation flexibility to earn the right returns and the optimal returns for our shareholders, and I think we're in that position. So I just don't see M&A right now as a high priority."

And you can transact, you can try to make money for your shareholders with transactions, but I would say this: as you know, Joanne, I've been in this job a long time. And earlier in my tenure, there was a role for Nutrition in our portfolio. And I got the same question then. And one of the roles was it's got a global presence, global infrastructure. It's highly profitable, generates a lot of cash. And a lot of the M&A activities and other things that we did back in my earlier years benefited from the cash flows and position of Nutrition. And even today, there are great benefits to our Nutrition business to the company. And that's not to say that any given part of the company has to be part of it. It's clearly a different business as is our pharmaceutical business, et cetera. But today, I'd say, look, it makes sense as part of our company. I don't think we need to be considering a transaction just to do it. We're well valued. We're performing well. I don't honestly think I would create more value for our investors by separating it. If everybody asks you about it often enough, you go look at it. Okay, I've looked at it. I don't think we can create differential improved value for our shareholders than what is already being executed by us. I think that's a plus. I think that in general, while a lot of people might ask me about it, it's also performing well. I'm happy that it's performing a lot better than it did for a couple of years there. So it's just not on my radar screen. I don't think we're going to improve Abbott. I don't think we're going to create value by considering it. And I think we'll distract ourselves with that at a time we don't even need to be distracted. So it's just not on my radar screen as a way to create value for shareholders because I don't think it will. And I think it's being well valued as part of Abbott as is the rest of Abbott. So it's just not on my radar screen and -- nor do I think it's necessarily beneficial to us. I guess that's the simplest thing to say."

I think we're well into a reasonable range now of debt, but we still want to keep paying that debt down. And our cash flow is strong enough that we do have choice. We do -- we have the ability to pay the dividend. We have the ability to do all these things. We can satisfy our capital needs internally. So I think -- I guess the best thing about it is we don't think about it in any mechanistic or formula way, dividing it in half or whatever. We kind of look at where the best -- where the need is and where the best return is. And I think it behooves us to leave ourselves also in a very strong position at a lower debt level. So we got places to use it and places to use it economically. When -- before tax reform, when so much cash was trapped overseas, we were fortunate that we had M&A opportunities to invest that cash for good return. We're not stuck like that now. We can manage cash, manage the cash flows of the company and so forth far more efficiently in terms of the best returns or the best needs. And that's kind of how we look at it. If we find that our best use of the cash or a strong use of the cash is share buybacks, we'd certainly consider that. But right now, I wouldn't say that's our highest priority either. It's still a high priority to just keep paying down the debt. And a couple of years down the road here, depending on what happens with interest rates and so forth, we'd probably be glad we did, and we'll have tremendous strategic flexibility and still have very strong cash flow. So I think it just depends on circumstances at a given point in time."

Today, we announced results for the first quarter and we're off to another good start. Our sales growth were strong and right on target, coming in at 7% on an organic basis in the quarter, and ongoing earnings per share of $0.63 exceeded our previous guidance range. 
Our full year 2019 adjusted earnings per share guidance of $3.15 to $3.25 remains unchanged and reflects midteens growth at the midpoint on a constant currency basis. 
As we've discussed previously, our emphasis today is on organic execution in the company. Today, all of our businesses have positive long-term outlooks and are well positioned with excellent products and attractive markets. At the start of the year, we issued guidance that reflected another year of strong performance. And for the first quarter, we're right on track with those expectations. We're particularly pleased with the exceptional performance of several long-term growth drivers that are leading the way, including FreeStyle Libre, MitraClip and the Alinity systems. These life-changing technologies are positively impacting lives and achieving impressive results. I'll now summarize our first quarter results before turning the call over to Bryan, and I'll start with diagnostics, where sales were led by core laboratory growth of 10%. 
Alinity, our family of next generation diagnostic systems, is driving strong growth internationally, and we continue to achieve significant above-market growth in the United States. 
In Europe, we are both converting existing customers to Alinity and winning competitive bids for new business at a very high rate. We also recently increased our launch efforts for Alinity H, our hematology system, and obtained CE Mark for Alinity M, our highly automated Molecular Diagnostics system along with several infectious disease tests. And we're expanding our menu of tests in key markets such as China and the United States. 
With a steady menu expansion on multiple different instruments across geographies, Alinity will be a significant growth driver for years to come. In Nutrition, sales increased more than 6.5% in the quarter, reflecting strong execution and new product introductions. We continue to see good underlying market demand and growth, and we're achieving above-market growth in several geographies, particularly Asia and Latin America. Sales growth this quarter was balanced across our Pediatric and Adult Nutrition businesses with our core leading brands of Similac, PediaSure, Ensure, all contributing to strong growth overall.
In Established Pharmaceuticals, sales growth of 5.5% was right in line with our expectations and was a sequential improvement quarter-to-quarter. Performance in the quarter was led by 7.5% growth in our Key Emerging Markets, which represent the most attractive long-term growth countries for our branded generics portfolio and include India, Brazil, Russia and China, along with several other emerging countries.
Underlying growth dynamics in these countries continue to remain strong and intact. And lastly, I'll cover Medical Devices, where sales grew nearly 10% led by strong double-digit growth in Heart Failure, Structural Heart, Electrophysiology and Diabetes Care. In Heart Failure, growth of 23% was led by rapid U.S. market adoption of our HeartMate 3 left ventricular assist device following FDA approval of a long-term use indication late last year.
The superior patient outcomes demonstrated in the clinical trial that supported disapproval have been a critical component of the growth and the share capture that we're achieving. 
In Structural Heart, several products across our broad portfolio contributed to strong double-digit growth in the quarter, including MitraClip, our market-leading device for the treatment of mitral regurgitation, a condition caused by a leaky heart valve.
During the quarter, we announced U.S. FDA approval for a new expanded indication for MitraClip, which significantly expand the number of people that can be treated. The formal process of seeking Medicare reimbursement for this new indication has been initiated. 
During the quarter, we also filed for CE Mark for our new triclip device, a first of its kind minimally invasive device for repairing a leaky tricuspid heart valve. We plan to initiate our U.S. pivotal trial for triclip in the coming months. I'll wrap up with Diabetes Care, where sales grew over 40% in the quarter led by FreeStyle Libre, our market-leading continuous glucose monitoring system or CGM. Libre continues to perform exceptionally well with worldwide sales of $380 million in the quarter, reflecting growth of 80%. Its global leadership among CGM systems for both type 1 and type 2 users. In order to meet the tremendous demand that we're seeing for Libre, we're having a significant amount of new manufacturing capacity, which will come online starting in the second half of this year.
So in summary, we're right on track with our high expectations to start the year. All of our long-term growth drivers are intact and achieving significant growth, including FreeStyle Libre, MitraClip and Alinity. And we're well positioned to achieve the top tier sales and EPS growth targets that we set at the beginning of the year.
I'll now turn the call over to Brian to discuss our results and outlook for the year in more detail. Brian?"

As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references, sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are all on an organic basis, which is consistent with our previous guidance.
Turning to our results. Sales for the first quarter increased 7.1% and exchange had a negative impact of 4.8% on sales versus the prior year. Reported sales increased 2% in the quarter. 
Regarding other aspects of the P&L. The adjusted gross margin ratio was 58.6% of sales, adjusted R&D investment was 7.4% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense was 32.3% of sales. All of these ratios were in line with previous guidance.
Turning to our outlook for the full year. We continue to forecast organic sales growth of 6.5% to 7.5%. Based on current exchange rates, we would expect exchange to have a negative impact of around 2.5% on our full year reported sales with the vast majority of the impact expected to occur in the first half of the year. 
We continue to forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of somewhat above 59.5% of sales for the full year, which reflects underlying gross margin improvement across our businesses. We continue to forecast adjusted R&D investment of around 7.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of around 29.5% of sales for the full year. 
Turning to our outlook for the second quarter. We forecast adjusted EPS of $0.79 to $0.81, which reflects strong double-digit underlying growth partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange on our results. We forecast organic sales growth of around 7%. And at current rates, we would expect exchange to have a negative impact of around 4% on our second quarter reported sales.
We forecasted adjusted gross margin ratio of somewhat above 59% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of a little less than 7.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of around 29.5% of sales.
Lastly, we forecast net interest expense of around $150 million in the second quarter. Before we open the call for questions, I'll now provide a quick overview of our second quarter sales growth outlook by business.
For Established Pharmaceuticals, we forecast mid-single-digit growth, which is comprised of mid- to high single-digit growth in our priority Key Emerging Markets along with a modest decline in other EPD sales, which reflects the recent continuation of a noncore, low-margin supply agreements. 
In Nutrition, we forecast mid-single-digit sales growth. In Diagnostics, we forecast Abbott's legacy Diagnostics business, which is comprised of core laboratory, Molecular Point of Care to grow mid- to high-single digits. 
In Rapid Diagnostics, we forecast low- to mid-single-digit sales growth. And in Medical Devices, we forecast high single-digit sales growth, which reflects continued double-digit growth in several areas of this business. 
With that, we will now open the call for questions."

We're seeing strength across the board in a lot of device in diagnostic areas. There is a geography here and there, a product line here and there that we might not be completely satisfied with. But I think if you look at us, our product areas, even competitors in various spaces in Medical Devices, this whole sector is doing pretty well and the growth rates have improved in a number of cases. I know that there was a lot preearnings noise out there about the continuity of the med device sector. I have to say from my perspective, I see nothing but a strong sector going forward. While we've got great pipelines and great products, I think the entire sector has a bright future ahead of us here and the markets are all pretty attractive for us. So first of all, I think we're in a much healthier environment than in might be reflected right now. And I think a lot of companies are actually doing really well in that environment. There's a lot of good new products and pipelines out there. I think the whole thing is pretty healthy. And then specifically to us, we've got in our case, I think great pipeline, great new products and launches in many of the segments and sectors we're in to focus on Diabetes Care as a start. That's been a particular bright spot where, clearly, new technology and affordable technology has made a very big difference in like for diabetes, both type 1 and type 2 worldwide. Libre has been a pretty powerful leader in that segment on all accounts and all points. We've been pretty enthused about its success, its uptake, its reception by patients all over the world. In a fairly short amount of time. We've achieved global leadership in terms of continuous glucose monitoring in both type 1 and type 2. I think part of the attraction to patients is obviously not having the finger stick, the information, the continuous nature of it, the way it allows diabetics to manage their health and manage diabetes has been life-changing, and that's been reflective. And I think very importantly, it's been affordable to a degree that it's really, it's become a very broadly accessible technology, which was our intent with it. It's got a unique ease-of-use and it's got appeal for any kind of patients. So I think that's pretty important and it's reflected in the reimbursements worldwide. 80% of sales are now reimbursed internationally over 30 countries. Well over half of U.S. lives commercially -- commercial lives are covered. So we're seeing a lot of support for the product in all ways. We've mentioned a number of times that we've invested heavily in capacity expansion. That is correct. We put significant investment into that. And as we've noted a couple of times, the first waves of that come online in the second half of this year and then there's a steady cadence of capacity expansions underway that will come online sequentially after that. There won't be any constraints to the growth that's possible there. I think it's going to be a very different kind of device or diagnostic product than we've seen in the past. Because there's so many of millions of diabetics worldwide, this is not a niche product, not the type 1s or type 2s. There's not a niche here. There's a massive population around the world that needs to manage diabetes, and this product will be broadly accessible to all of them. So it calls for quite a lot of capacity in the second half of this year that will be initiated. 
We have a number of things we're expecting and waiting for. You asked about Libre 2. That is under review at the FDA. We filed Libre 2 with alarms in the U.S. as an ICGM. We're not going to forecast FDA review timelines, but we clearly have expectations to achieve that milestone. I'm trying to think what else to tell you about that. It's already on the market in Europe."

So we look at what we filed and we look at the standards, and we look at what we filed and we know that we meet those standards. So to Miles' point, we're not going to forecast here as to when that approval will come through. But I think it's clear in terms of what we filed and why we filed. Regarding payers, specifically in the U.S., I think that what we've always intended for this product is to remove some of the hurdles, and affordability was one of those. And you can look a lot of the evolution of the reimbursement here in the U.S. that's slowly moving from something that was -- with a lot of prior authorizations, only going through mail order to now looking very much like the blood glucose monitoring market where we start to see less prior authorizations, formulary positions that allowing patients to go to pharmacy and pick that up. So a lot of our managed care strategy was focused on driving that shift, and a key part of that is the access and affordability. So we're seeing that in our managed care coverage. As Miles said, we're over 50% now of managed care life coverage in this patient population. And you see the shift into pharmacy if you look at the Script data, total RX is you can see that shift. You can see that occurring with Libre. And that was a very intentional strategy to accelerate adoption specifically in the U.S. by going to pharmacy, which is something that hadn't been done before with CGM systems. And we did that, and we're starting to kind of move that category into the pharmacy."

We're trying to drive the volume and the acquisition of patients. And obviously, that's going pretty strongly. So there's nothing but happiness about this product. I can tell you, we're pretty happy with it. It's doing really well. I actually think we're kind of in its early stages. And at this point, there's over 1 million type 1 users of Libre around the world and mostly make up 2/3 of our user base. So with this kind of a growth rate, that kind of a user base with the capacity expansion coming online, we're obviously expecting this to be a continuing lead big and bigger product for us."

I think in the fourth quarter, the messaging was core growth drivers very much intact, some one-off dynamics were suppressing growth and you expect that, that growth to improve in the first quarter. And sure enough, that's sort of what happened here, back in sort of the 7% range. As you think about the balance of the year, you had these core growth drivers doing relatively well. A couple of businesses probably not performing where you'd like to perform.

Every year, we're going to the year and the gating of earnings per share for any given quarter tends to start out lower at those front of the year and it always looks back-end loaded for the third and fourth quarters. I'd say, increasingly, that's leveling a little bit in that it's still a climb as the year goes on. But in our cases, it's reflecting growth and penetration of new products. And there's a couple of seasonalities in there, but they're not big enough to really affect the overall earnings profile. We increasingly seen stronger and stronger first quarters. But to be honest, third and fourth is always strong, but it's driven right now by the incredible growth of Alinity, Libre, HeartMate, MitraClip. There's so much real growth in the new products that are launching that it just gets better and better as the year rolls on. So I think it's always hard to gate to the penny. We try to get our estimates to a point like that. Then we're always subject a couple of lumpy comparisons to whatever happened last year and so on, I guess, because it looks optically we're doing it's bumpy. But the fact is the growth is steady progress, as you said, it's not only intact, it's strong. There are a couple of places you could poke and say, okay, you must not be satisfied with that. And I'd say, yes, you're right about that. But while we've got some places we're putting a lot of more focus on and we obviously miscall the pace of improvements, I'd say, in general, I'm glad that what we have to work on for improvement is where it is and not in these major growth drivers. So Alinity is performing strongly. We are winning over 95% of accounts where we already have the business and we're winning almost 2/3 of the accounts where we're head-to-head with an entrenched competitor. That's pretty powerful data when you consider that customers have to switch on mainframe systems, it's a big commitment. It takes months. There are long-term contracts. So by winning almost 2/3 of those new business, new accounts, that's pretty significant. That's a pretty powerful endorsement by the market of the Alinity systems and the laboratory solutions we're offering. We're seeing improvement in growth just about every place. I'm really pleased with nutrition. I had to sit here on this call a number of times and explain, well, we're expecting it to get a little bit better. But it's performing really well and I think consistently so across all geographies and across both major product lines there. That's been a nice story. And we've estimated to you that the growth rate of that business going forward, we will look for in the 4% to 6% range. And obviously, we're a little beyond that. I don't know that we're going to constantly be beyond that. But that 4% to 6% range is all good. So anywhere there is pretty good for us. There's does tend to be some up and down with it in some countries depend on holidays and seasons and so forth. But overall, if we're not watching it week to week, that's a pretty strong business right now and we like what we see. The management has done a great job worldwide. So as far as quarter is coming, I'm hard-pressed to find a lot of things to point at as watch out other than, as you pointed out, we got all couple places where we think we've got work to do and to improve the performance of the business. I'm pleased that we can show that we know how to correct the performance of an underperforming business. But as you would probably rightly point out to me right now, there's a couple that are taking longer than I might have guessed."

So yes, we had a very good quarter in Structural Heart, and it showed growth across many of our different franchises and geographies. Obviously, MitraClip was a big driver. And we're right where we wanted to be with MitraClip. The FDA approval was a few months ahead. But I think that speaks to the data and the evidence that was generated through coapt. Label is very much in line with our expectations and reflects the coapt patient enrollment criteria. So we're now obviously working on CMS. Process is underway. These usually take between 6 to 9 months. If you look at our experience when we achieved the primary MR reimbursement indication a few years back, that's service about 7.5 months from when we started to when we got it approved. So we know how to do this. We're currently in the process. And it'll be just be a little bit difficult to forecast here, but we're very optimistic. But I'd say reimbursement is only one of the building blocks. It's definitely an important building block, but it's not the only one to really think about this business as a multiyear, double-digit kind of growth driver for us. There are other building blocks here that are very important that we're currently already underway. Opening of new centers is a key aspect here, and the timing and the framework and the cycle of how we do that is important. We have currently about 350 implanting centers in the U.S. and I think over the next few years, we'll see that number gets about 550. There's a lot of training that's involved here also, sales force training, center training, implanter training. And if you look at the sales rep, it'll usually take them between 6 to 9 months until they get fully proficient on MitraClip. So -- and then there's obviously the development, support and sustaining of a patient referral network as we build awareness of the therapy and the technology amongst the physician groups and short of those got funneled into our implant centers. So those are some of the key blocks. But I'd say we know how to do this. We've been doing it in the U.S. for the last 4 years and we're not going to wait for final CMS approval before we start hiring. We're already hiring more reps. We're expanding our sales force. We're expanding our clinical specialist so that we're going to be ready to go. So we're definitely taking an invest ahead approach here. So I like our position. The mitral is a tremendous opportunity, unmet need and an opportunity for Abbott. And quite frankly, we've been -- this positioning didn't happen just because of coapt. We've been building this position for over a decade. So whether it's mitra repair or mitra repayment, we're in pretty unique position. So I do see kind of sequential growth as we go through the year. Your question on mitra FR, yes, we did see that impact some of our European markets. And we know that was a French study, so we did have a little bit of an impact on some of the kind of implanting rates in some key European markets. But I think that's more of a transition. I don't think that's a fundamental change in the market in Europe. And we had expanded International lead to other large opportunities. Japan is another market where we see a very large opportunity for us. So that is also going to help kind of drive the growth. I think the mitra FR study will take another quarter of sort to play out, but we do expect the international business to kind of continue its growth."

I'm confident in the management. I'm confident in the direction we're headed. I clearly wasn't right about the timing. So I'm not worrying about it from the standpoint of, boy, this business is really broken or hurt. It's not. And so I have a lot of confidence about that. As far as growth goes, I don't think that it's a high double-digit grower, but it's a double-digit grower. And I think in net devices and in some of these markets as it becomes established to be maintaining a double-digit growth rate as a market segment, I think, is pretty healthy. So I haven't -- we're not losing any confidence in the segments or the potential in the segments or the growth in the segments. I put the growth sort of in that double-digit range. That's what we would expect. And it's not 50%, but it's not 5%, either. So our performance in this particular segment is clearly underperforming what it should be. So I'd say if you want the market slowly, well, it's not 50%. But slow is a relative thing. I think any double-digit market, and I think this is a healthy market."

And that was -- that's -- it's not a market thing. That's more of an Abbott as we get ready to launch -- as we're launching our new ablation catheter [indiscernible] in the U.S., which we have relaunched OUS. We obviously saw some kind of inventory depletion of the older product and getting ready for the new product. So we expect that to get back to the double-digit growth rate in U.S. on the EP side. On CRM, that is definitely another area of disappointment and obviously focus for us. We showed some recovery in the international markets. And I think the team there has done a good job at execution. But we've obviously not satisfied with our U.S. performance. It's an important business for us and we got to do better. But what we've seen internationally is where we've deployed dedicated EP and CRM teams, the business does better. It does better in CRM and quite frankly, it does better in EP. So we -- as you saw, we recently made some organizational changes here that sharpen our focus and create a more, I'd say, standalone vertical business units in CRM. We think that's going to get the accountability and the focus that we need out in the commercial field, especially in the U.S. And we got several new product innovations that are progressing very nicely. Our next-gen ICD and our 2 lead less programs. Now this structure [indiscernible] that they get the focus that they need.
In Heart Failure, as you mentioned, our sales were up 23%. U.S. was up 26%, and that was the impact of, I'd say, the rapid share capture that we achieved in the U.S. in the destination therapy 3, I'd say, pretty strong execution, the commercial team with the product, achieving about 20 share points in that quarter. So we expect that share to kind of maintain. The product has done very well, not only on our, I'd say, nutritional Abbott accounts, but even in our competitor accounts, that's doing very nicely also. So we look -- we think Heart Failure has got strong potential also throughout the year with CardioMEMS. So a little bit smaller product year, but it also continues to do very well."

It's been a little unprecedented, I think, for as much debt as we had. I mean, when we were done with the St. Jude and Alere acquisitions, I think we were at about $28 billion, something like that. We've paid down more 10 of that. So -- and almost 8.5 of it just last year. Another $0.5 billion in the first quarter this year. So our debt, everybody watches net debt-to-EBITDA ratio, we're down to about 2x right now from what was, I think, about 4.3 when we completed the second of the 2 acquisitions. That's a pretty rapid paydown. We expect to be about 1.5x by year-end. So I think I could declare strategic flexibility achieved. Obviously, we want to keep paying down the debt. We've got nice, strong cash flow. We've got a number of choices. We increased in the dividend, as you know, back in December by 14%. And we tend to target that dividend at around 40% to 45% of EPS. And I think right now, we're at 40%, something like that. EPS is growing pretty rapidly, so probably be adjusting at some point. But the -- there's good times and bad times to purchase shares, as you know. And our share repurchases, we haven't done a lot of share repurchasing. We've done some primarily just to offset dilution, but that has not been a big consumer of capital. 
We have made significant investments internally in our growth with Alinity expansion and with Libre capacity expansion. And again, while those are important users of our capital with high return, we still have pretty strong cash flow. So back to the point of your question, we have strategic flexibility. We have strong cash flow. We have choice. The -- I think the question is whether or not at any point there's something out there that fits us or we're particularly interested in or that we're focused on, et cetera. And as you know, I've told you in the past, even if I have that, I wouldn't tell you, that would be true. I would say today, what is also true is we are very much focused on our internal organic execution, and that's getting sort of 95% of our attention. We're not paying attention to other opportunities. We always are tracking and monitoring other opportunities. But I have to tell you right now, I don't see a very robust target rich environment out there. It's not target rich. I don't think it is anyway. And I don't see a lot of meaningful adjunctive things that necessarily fit what we're trying to do. So obviously, as we move forward here, one of our challenges is going to be capital deployment because we're going to have a lot of it. And I think we're going to generate a lot of cash over the coming years. I think we're going to generate a lot of profit. And we obviously wanted to either invest at our return it to shareholders at the highest possible return. And if it means there's opportunities in M&A, as you know, historically, we've always been pretty attentive and diligent about that. I wouldn't forecast it when or what. We -- but we are out of the range where we're constrained about our choices. We are no longer constrained. And I think that's a positive. We've gotten there pretty quickly. And that means that we can consider whatever. We don't happen to be focused on M&A right now. But M&A isn't a steady every year thing. It's opportunistic when it fits the strategy and the intent of the company and when an opportunity fits and the return can be earned.
And so if something like that comes along, I'd say we're well positioned. We'd be ready to do something. But to be honest, we haven't seen something that attractive."

You kind of answered it at the end of your question there when you said it's not my style. I rarely, If ever, raise in the first quarter. I kind of feel like if I raised in the first quarter, why didn't I put it in the original plan 3 months ago or 6 months ago. But I have generally waited to consider such a thing in the mid-year because at various points in time, well, there's been a number of times we've all been burned by exchange around April, May, June or something for the remainder of the year. I don't actually expect that this year. I'm not forecaster of exchange and we're not currency traders, as you know. But just based on what we all see, we were all like all industries, all companies, all multinationals, so forth, we're all cautious about trying to trade and exchange and volatility, the price of oil, even Brexit. These were sort of the big factors everybody talked about. Oil is almost $70, and I don't think Brexit is weighing on a lot of mind, it's weighing on a lot of European minds, it's weighing on a lot of U.K. minds and it depends on how much business you got tied up in the U.K. But companies of that time to figure out how to mitigate a lot of these things and deal with them. So I'd say the reason that we didn't look at raising in the first quarter is because I just don't raise in the first quarter.
We're obviously off to a strong start. As I told you before, all of our growth story is solid and intact, not seeing any, gosh, I should feel like I should knock-on wood. I'm not seeing any threats to the growth vehicles in the business. And while someone have speculated that med tech or med devices is somewhat slowing. I'd tell you, I don't see that. And I don't think a lot of other CEOs in Medical Devices are seeing it, either. In fact, if anything, I see projected growth rates rising across competitors. I take that as a very healthy signal from the industry that people are seeing positive, robust opportunity. I think a lot of people have new products and robust pipelines. And I think that's healthy for the whole sector worldwide. There's a lot of things that haven't changed, but we've been navigating those kinds of things for a while and doing well as an industry and as a company.
So could we have raised in the first quarter? Well, a lot of you may think so. I'm a little more cautious than that. I always kind of wait until midyear so to kind of assess things. I like how the company is performing. I think the company is performing really well. I'm not sure we've ever had such healthy pipeline so broadly across the line of the company. So I don't have any negatives. I'm just thinking that one quarter into the year seems a little early to me. That's much I can tell. That's amount of answer."

We've already got almost 1.5 million users of Libre. And to be honest, we haven't exactly let the floodgates go. So I think you can kind of back into the math of that. This product is already great. Look, it's probably $1.5 billion or more in sales more and it's growing at 80%. So it doesn't take very long to figure out the math to what you just asked."

Today, we announced results for the first quarter and we're off to another good start. Our sales growth was strong and right on target, coming in at 7% on an organic basis in the quarter, and ongoing earnings per share of $0.63 exceeded our previous guidance range. 
Our full year 2019 adjusted earnings per share guidance of $3.15 to $3.25 remains unchanged and reflects midteens growth at the midpoint on a constant currency basis. 
As we've discussed previously, our emphasis today is on organic execution in the company. Today, all of our businesses have positive long-term outlooks and are well positioned with excellent products and attractive markets. At the start of the year, we issued guidance that reflected another year of strong performance. And for the first quarter, we're right on track with those expectations. We're particularly pleased with the exceptional performance of several long-term growth drivers that are leading the way, including FreeStyle Libre, MitraClip and the Alinity systems. These life-changing technologies are positively impacting lives and achieving impressive results. 
I'll now summarize our first quarter results before turning the call over to Brian, and I'll start with Diagnostics, where sales were led by Core Laboratory growth of 10%. 
Alinity, our family of next-generation diagnostic systems, is driving strong growth internationally, and we continue to achieve significant above-market growth in the United States. 
In Europe, we are both converting existing customers to Alinity and winning competitive bids for new business at a very high rate. We also recently increased our launch efforts for Alinity h, our hematology system, and obtained CE Mark for Alinity m, our highly automated Molecular Diagnostics system along with several infectious disease tests. And we're expanding our menu of tests in key markets such as China and the United States. With a steady menu expansion on multiple different instruments across geographies, Alinity will be a significant growth driver for years to come. 
In Nutrition, sales increased more than 6.5% in the quarter, reflecting strong execution and new product introductions. We continue to see good underlying market demand and growth, and we're achieving above-market growth in several geographies, particularly Asia and Latin America. Sales growth this quarter was balanced across our Pediatric and Adult Nutrition businesses with our core leading brands of Similac, PediaSure and Ensure all contributing to strong growth overall.
In Established Pharmaceuticals, sales growth of 5.5% was right in line with our expectations and was a sequential improvement quarter-to-quarter. Performance in the quarter was led by a 7.5% growth in our key emerging markets, which represent the most attractive long-term growth countries for our branded generics portfolio and include India, Brazil, Russia and China, along with several other emerging countries. Underlying growth dynamics in these countries continue to remain strong and intact. 
And lastly, I'll cover Medical Devices, where sales grew nearly 10%, led by strong double-digit growth in Heart Failure, Structural Heart, Electrophysiology and Diabetes Care. In Heart Failure, growth of 23% was led by rapid U.S. market adoption of our HeartMate 3 left ventricular assist device following FDA approval of a long-term use indication late last year. The superior patient outcomes demonstrated in the clinical trial that supported disapproval have been a critical component of the growth and the share capture that we're achieving. 
In Structural Heart, several products across our broad portfolio contributed to strong double-digit growth in the quarter, including MitraClip, our market-leading device for the treatment of mitral regurgitation, a condition caused by a leaky heart valve.
During the quarter, we announced U.S. FDA approval for a new expanded indication for MitraClip, which significantly expands the number of people that can be treated. The formal process of seeking Medicare reimbursement for this new indication has been initiated. 
During the quarter, we also filed for CE Mark for our new triclip device, a first of its kind minimally invasive device for repairing a leaky tricuspid heart valve. We plan to initiate our U.S. pivotal trial for triclip in the coming months. 
I'll wrap up with Diabetes Care, where sales grew over 40% in the quarter led by FreeStyle Libre, our market-leading continuous glucose monitoring system, or CGM. Libre continues to perform exceptionally well with worldwide sales of $380 million in the quarter, reflecting growth of 80% with global leadership among CGM systems for both type 1 and type 2 users. In order to meet the tremendous demand that we're seeing for Libre, we're having a significant amount of new manufacturing capacity, which will come online starting in the second half of this year.
So in summary, we're right on track with our high expectations to start the year. All of our long-term growth drivers are intact and achieving significant growth, including FreeStyle Libre, MitraClip and Alinity. And we're well positioned to achieve the top tier sales and EPS growth targets that we set at the beginning of the year.
I'll now turn the call over to Brian to discuss our results and outlook for the year in more detail. Brian?"

Sales for the first quarter increas",460,"Thanks, Miles. As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis, which is consistent with our previous guidance.
Turning to our results. Sales for the first quarter increased 7.1%, and exchange had a negative impact of 4.8% on sales versus the prior year. Reported sales increased 2% in the quarter. 
Regarding other aspects of the P&L. The adjusted gross margin ratio was 58.6% of sales, adjusted R&D investment was 7.4% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense was 32.3% of sales. All of these ratios were in line with previous guidance.
Turning to our outlook for the full year. We continue to forecast organic sales growth of 6.5% to 7.5%. Based on current exchange rates, we would expect exchange to have a negative impact of around 2.5% on our full year reported sales, with the vast majority of the impact expected to occur in the first half of the year. 
We continue to forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of somewhat above 59.5% of sales for the full year, which reflects underlying gross margin improvement across our businesses. We continue to forecast adjusted R&D investment of around 7.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of around 29.5% of sales for the full year. 
Turning to our outlook for the second quarter. We forecast adjusted EPS of $0.79 to $0.81, which reflects strong double-digit underlying growth partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange on our results. We forecast organic sales growth of around 7%. And at current rates, we would expect exchange to have a negative impact of around 4% on our second quarter reported sales.
We forecasted adjusted gross margin ratio of somewhat above 59% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of a little less than 7.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of around 29.5% of sales.
Lastly, we forecast net interest expense of around $150 million in the second quarter. Before we open the call for questions, I'll now provide a quick overview of our second quarter sales growth outlook by business.
For Established Pharmaceuticals, we forecast mid-single-digit growth, which is comprised of mid- to high single-digit growth in our priority key emerging markets along with a modest decline in other EPD sales, which reflects the recent continuation of a noncore, low-margin supply agreement. 
In Nutrition, we forecast mid-single-digit sales growth. In Diagnostics, we forecast Abbott's legacy Diagnostics business, which is comprised of Core Laboratory, Molecular Point of Care, to grow mid- to high single digits. 
In Rapid Diagnostics, we forecast low to mid-single-digit sales growth. And in Medical Devices, we forecast high single-digit sales growth, which reflects continued double-digit growth in several areas of this business. 
With that, we will now open the call for questions."

We're seeing strength across the board in a lot of device in diagnostic areas. There is a geography here and there, a product line here and there that we might not be completely satisfied with. But I think if you look at us, our product areas, even competitors in various spaces in medical devices, this whole sector is doing pretty well and the growth rates have improved in a number of cases. I know that there was a lot preearnings noise out there about the continuity of the med device sector. I have to say from my perspective, I see nothing but a strong sector going forward. While we've got great pipelines and great products, I think the entire sector has a bright future ahead of us here and the markets are all pretty attractive for us. So first of all, I think we're in a much healthier environment than might be reflected right now, and I think a lot of companies are actually doing really well in that environment. There's a lot of good new products and pipelines out there. I think the whole thing is pretty healthy. And then specifically to us, we've got, in our case, I think great pipeline, great new products and launches in many of the segments and sectors we're in. To focus on Diabetes Care as a start, that's been a particular bright spot where, clearly, new technology and affordable technology has made a very big difference in life for diabetics, both type 1 and type 2 worldwide. Libre has been a pretty powerful leader in that segment on all accounts and all points. We've been pretty enthused about its success, its uptake, its reception by patients all over the world. In a fairly short amount of time, we've achieved global leadership in terms of continuous glucose monitoring in both type 1 and type 2. I think part of the attraction to patients is obviously not having the finger stick. The information, the continuous nature of it, the way it allows diabetics to manage their health and manage diabetes has been life-changing, and that's been reflective. And I think very importantly, it's been affordable to a degree that it's really -- it's become a very broadly accessible technology, which was our intent with it. It's got a unique ease-of-use and it's got appeal for any kind of patient. So I think that's pretty important and it's reflected in the reimbursements worldwide. 80% of sales are now reimbursed internationally over 30 countries. Well over half of U.S. lives commercially -- commercial lives are covered. So we're seeing a lot of support for the product in all ways. We've mentioned a number of times that we've invested heavily in capacity expansion. That is correct. We put significant investment into that. And as we've noted a couple of times, the first waves of that come online in the second half of this year, and then there's a steady cadence of capacity expansions underway that will come online sequentially after that. There won't be any constraints to the growth that's possible there. I think it's going to be a very different kind of device or diagnostic product than we've seen in the past. Because there are so many of millions of diabetics worldwide, this is not a niche product, not the type 1s or type 2s. There's not a niche here. There's a massive population around the world that needs to manage diabetes, and this product will be broadly accessible to all of them. So it calls for quite a lot of capacity in the second half of this year that will be initiated. 
We have a number of things we're expecting and waiting for. You asked about Libre 2. That is under review at the FDA. We have filed Libre 2 with alarms in the U.S. as an iCGM. We're not going to forecast FDA review time lines, but we clearly have expectations to achieve that milestone. I'm trying to think of what else to tell you about that. It's already on the market in Europe."

So on Libre 2, specifically in the U.S., the filing of iCGM, I'll just say we know what the iCGM standards are. We know what needs to be achieved.

So on Libre 2, specifically in the U.S., the filing of iCGM, I'll just say we know what the iCGM standards are. We know what needs to be achieved. And we filed in the U.S. as an iCGM knowing what the standards need to be achieved. So we look at what we filed and we look at the standards, and we look at what we filed and we know that we meet those standards. So to Miles' point, we're not going to forecast here as to when that approval will come through. But I think it's clear in terms of what we filed and why we filed. 
Regarding payers, specifically in the U.S., I think that what we've always intended for this product is to remove some of the hurdles, and affordability was one of those. And if you look at a lot of the evolution of the reimbursement here in the U.S. that's slowly moving from something that was -- with a lot of prior authorizations, only going through mail order to now looking very much like the blood glucose monitoring market where we start to see less prior authorizations, formulary positions that are allowing patients to go to a pharmacy and pick that up. So a lot of our managed care strategy was focused on driving that shift, and a key part of that is the access and affordability. So we're seeing that in our managed care coverage. As Miles said, we're over 50% now of managed care life coverage in this patient population. And you see the shift into pharmacy. If you look at the script data, total Rxes, you can see that shift. You can see that occurring with Libre. And that was a very intentional strategy to accelerate adoption, specifically in the U.S., by going to pharmacy, which is something that hadn't been done before with CGM systems. And we did that, and we're starting to kind of move that category into the pharmacy."

And we've been pretty pleased with the performance going through pharmacy. The patient acquisition and so forth continues to be obviously strong, frankly, right in line with our growth rates around the world, as you'd expect, because we're not trying to drive price here. We're trying to drive the volume and acquisition of patients. And obviously, that's going pretty strongly. So there's nothing but happiness about this product. I can tell you, we're pretty happy with it. It's doing really well. I actually think we're kind of in its early stages. And at this point, there's over 1 million type 1 users of Libre around the world that mostly make up 2/3 of our user base. So with this kind of a growth rate, that kind of a user base with the capacity expansion coming online, we're obviously expecting this to be a continuingly big and bigger product for us."

Every year, we're going to the year and the gating of earnings per share for any given quarter tends to start out lower at the front end of the year and it always looks back-end loaded and -- for the third and fourth quarters. I'd say, increasingly, that's leveling a little bit in that it's still a climb as the year goes on. But in our case, it's reflecting growth and penetration of new products. And there's a couple of seasonalities in there, but they're not big enough to really affect the overall earnings profile. We've increasingly seen stronger and stronger first quarters. But to be honest, third and fourth is always strong, but it's driven right now by the incredible growth of Alinity, Libre, HeartMate, MitraClip. There's so much real growth in the new products that are launching that it just gets better and better as the year rolls on. So I think it's always hard to gate to the penny. We try to get our estimates to a point like that. Then we're always subject to a couple of lumpy comparisons to whatever happened last year and so on, I guess, because it looks optically weird when it's bumpy. But the fact is the growth is steady. As you said, it's not only intact, it's strong. But there are a couple of places you could poke and say, ""Okay, you must not be satisfied with that."" And I'd say, ""Yes, you're right about that."" 
But while we've got some places we're putting a lot of more focus on and we've obviously miscalled the pace of improvement, I'd say, in general, I'm glad that what we have to work on for improvement is where it is and not in these major growth drivers. So Alinity is performing strongly. We are winning over 95% of accounts where we already have the business, and we're winning almost 2/3 of the accounts where we're head-to-head with an entrenched competitor. That's pretty powerful data when you consider that customers have to switch out mainframe systems. It's a big commitment. It takes months. There are long-term contracts. So -- but winning almost 2/3 of those new business, new accounts, that's pretty significant. That's a pretty powerful endorsement by the market of the Alinity systems and the laboratory solutions we're offering. We're seeing improvement in growth just about every place. I'm really pleased with Nutrition. I had to sit here on this call a number of times and explain, well, we're expecting it to get a little better. But it's performing really well and I think consistently so across all geographies and across both major product lines there. That's been a nice story. And we've estimated to you that the growth rate of that business going forward we will look for in the 4% to 6% range. And obviously, we're a little beyond that. I don't know that we're going to constantly be beyond that. But that 4% to 6% range is all good. So anywhere in there is pretty good for us. There does tend to be some up and down with it in some countries depending on holidays and seasons and so forth. But overall, if we're not watching it week to week, that's a pretty strong business right now and we like what we see. The management has done a great job worldwide. 
So as far as quarters coming, I'm hard-pressed to find a lot of things to point at as watchouts other than, as you pointed out, we got a couple of places where we think we've got work to do and to improve the performance of the business. I'm pleased that we can show that we know how to correct the performance of an underperforming business. But as you would probably rightly point out to me right now, there's a couple that are taking longer than I might have guessed."

So yes, we had a very good quarter in Structural Heart, and we showed growth across many of our different franchises and geographies. Obviously, MitraClip was a big driver and we're right where we wanted to be with MitraClip. The FDA approval was a few months ahead. But I think that speaks to the data and the evidence that was generated through COAPT. Label is very much in line with our expectations and reflects the COAPT patient enrollment criteria. So we're now obviously working on CMS. Process is underway. These usually take between 6 to 9 months. If you look at our experience when we achieved the primary MR reimbursement indication a few years back, that took us about 7.5 months from when we started to when we got it approved. So we know how to do this. We're currently in the process. And it'll just be a little bit difficult to forecast here, but we're very optimistic. But I'd say reimbursement is only one of the building blocks. It's definitely an important building block, but it's not the only one to really think about this business as a multiyear, double-digit kind of growth driver for us. There are other building blocks here that are very important that we're currently already underway. Opening of new centers is a key aspect here, and the timing and the framework and the cycle of how we do that is important. We have currently about 350 implanting centers in the U.S. And I think over the next few years, we'll see that number get to about 550. There's a lot of training that's involved here also, sales force training, center training, implanter training. And if you look at a sales rep, it'll usually take them between 6 to 9 months until they get fully proficient on MitraClip. So -- and then there's obviously the development, support and sustaining of a patient referral network as we build awareness of the therapy and the technology amongst the physician groups and ensure that those got funneled into our implant centers. 
So those are some of the key blocks. But I'd say we know how to do this. We've been doing it in the U.S. for the last 4 years and we're not going to wait for final CMS approval before we start hiring. We're already hiring more reps. We're expanding our sales force. We're expanding our clinical specialists so that we're going to be ready to go. So we're definitely taking an invest ahead approach here. So I like our position. The mitral is a tremendous opportunity, unmet need and an opportunity for Abbott. And quite frankly, we've been -- this position didn't happen just because of COAPT. We've been building this position for over a decade. So whether it's mitral repair or mitral repayment, we're in a pretty unique position. So I do see kind of sequential growth as we go through the year. 
Your question on MITRA-FR, yes, we did see that impact some of our European markets. And we know it's a French study, so it did have a little bit of an impact on some of the kind of implanting rates in some key European markets. But I think that's more of a transition thing. I don't think that's a fundamental change in the market in Europe. And we had expanded internationally to other large opportunities. Japan is another market where we see a very large opportunity for us. So that is also going to help kind of drive the growth. I think the Mitra-FR study will take another quarter or so to play out, but I -- we do expect the international business to kind of continue its growth."

Okay, there's clearly an Abbott issue here, our own management, which I've said before. And I think we, in particular, have miscalled the pace at which we would turn our own performance. And where we underestimated that was we're expanding our sales force by 40% to 50%, and that's been a little more disruptive than I think we had expected. But I'm confident in the business. I'm confident in the management. I'm confident in the direction we're headed. I clearly wasn't right about the timing. So I'm not worrying about it from the standpoint of, boy, this business is really broken or hurt. It's not. And so I have a lot of confidence about that. As far as growth goes, I don't think that it's a high double-digit grower, but it's a double-digit grower. And I think in med devices and in some of these markets as it becomes established, to be maintaining a double-digit growth rate as a market segment, I think, is pretty healthy. So I haven't -- we're not losing any confidence in the segments or the potential in the segments or the growth in the segments. I put the growth sort of in that double-digit range. That's what we would expect. And it's not 50%, but it's not 5% either. So our performance in this particular segment is clearly underperforming what it should be. So I'd say if you want it off the market slowly, well, it's not 50%. But slow is a relative thing. I'd take any double-digit market, and I think this is a healthy market."

And that was -- that's -- it's not a market thing. That's more of an Abbott as we get ready to launch -- as we're launching our new ablation catheter, TactiCath SE, in the U.S., which we have relaunched OUS. We obviously saw some kind of inventory depletion of the older product and getting ready for the new product. So we expect that to get back to the double-digit growth rate in the U.S. on the EP side. On CRM, that is definitely another area of disappointment and obviously, focus for us. We showed some recovery in the international markets, and I think the team there has done a good job at execution. But we're obviously not satisfied with our U.S. performance. It's an important business for us and we got to do better. But what we've seen internationally is where we've deployed dedicated EP and CRM teams, the business does better. It does better in CRM. And quite frankly, it does better in EP. So we -- as you saw, we recently made some organizational changes here to sharpen our focus and create a more, I'd say, stand-alone vertical business unit in CRM. We think that's going to get the accountability and the focus that we need out in the commercial field, especially in the U.S. And we've got several new product innovations that are progressing very nicely. Our next-gen ICD and our 2 leadless programs. And now this structure will ensure that they get the focus that they need.
In Heart Failure, as you mentioned, our sales were up 23%. U.S. was up 26%, and that was the impact of, I'd say, the rapid share capture that we achieved in the U.S. in the destination therapy, I'd say, a pretty strong execution of the commercial team with the product, achieving about 20 share points in that quarter. So we expect that share to kind of maintain. The product has done very well, not only on our, I'd say, traditional Abbott accounts, but even in our competitor accounts, that's doing very nicely also. So we look -- we think Heart Failure has got strong potential also throughout the year with CardioMEMS. It's a little bit smaller product here, but it also continues to do very well."

It's been a little unprecedented, I think, for as much debt as we had. I mean, when we were done with the St. Jude and Alere acquisitions, I think we were at about $28 billion, something like that. We've paid down more $10 billion of that. So -- and almost $8.5 billion of it just last year. Another $0.5 billion in the first quarter this year. So our debt -- everybody watches net debt-to-EBITDA ratio. We're down to about 2x right now from what was, I think, about 4.3 when we completed the second of the 2 acquisitions. That's a pretty rapid paydown. We expect to be about 1.5x by year-end. So I think I could declare strategic flexibility achieved. Obviously, we want to keep paying down the debt. We've got nice, strong cash flow. We've got a number of choices. We increased the dividend, as you know, back in December by 14%. And we tend to target that dividend at around 40% to 45% of EPS. And I think right now, we're at 40%, something like that. EPS is growing pretty rapidly, so probably be adjusting at some point. But the -- there's good times and bad times to purchase shares, as you know. And our share repurchases, we haven't done a lot of share repurchasing. We've done some primarily just to offset dilution, but that has not been a big consumer of capital. 
We have made significant investments internally in our growth with Alinity expansion and with the Libre capacity expansion. And again, while those are important users of our capital with high return, we still have pretty strong cash flow. So back to the point of your question, we have strategic flexibility. We have strong cash flow. We have choice. The -- I think the question is whether or not at any point there's something out there that fits us or we're particularly interested in or that we're focused on, et cetera. And as you know, I've told you in the past, even if I have that, I wouldn't tell you, that would be true. I would say today, what is also true is we are very much focused on our internal organic execution, and that's getting sort of 95% of our attention. We're not paying attention to other opportunities. We always are tracking and monitoring other opportunities. But I have to tell you right now, I don't see a very robust target-rich environment out there. It's not target-rich. I don't think it is anyway. And I don't see a lot of meaningful adjunctive things that necessarily fit what we're trying to do. So obviously, as we move forward here, one of our challenges is going to be capital deployment because we're going to have a lot of it. And I think we're going to generate a lot of cash over the coming years. I think we're going to generate a lot of profit. And we obviously want to either invest at or return it to shareholders at the highest possible return. And if it means there's opportunities in M&A, as you know, historically, we've always been pretty attentive and diligent about that. I wouldn't forecast it when or what. We -- but we are out of the range where we're constrained about our choices. We are no longer constrained. And I think that's a positive. We've gotten there pretty quickly. And that means that we can consider whatever. We don't happen to be focused on M&A right now, but M&A isn't a steady every year thing. It's opportunistic when it fits the strategy and the intent of the company and when an opportunity fits and a return can be earned.
And so if something like that comes along, I'd say we're well positioned. We'd be ready to do something. But to be honest, we haven't seen something that attractive."

You kind of answered it at the end of your question there when you said it's not my style. I rarely, If ever, raise in a first quarter. I kind of feel like if I raised in the first quarter, why didn't I put it in the original plan 3 months ago or 6 months ago? But I have generally waited to consider such a thing in the mid-year because at various points in time, well, there's been a number of times we've all been burned by exchange around April, May, June or something for the remainder of the year. I don't actually expect that this year. I'm no forecaster of exchange and we're not currency traders, as you know. But just based on what we all see, we were all -- like all industries, all companies, all multinational and so forth, we were all cautious about China trade and exchange and volatility, the price of oil, even Brexit. These were sort of the big factors everybody talked about. Oil is almost $70, and I don't think Brexit is weighing on a lot of mind. It's weighing on a lot of European minds, it's weighing on a lot of U.K. minds and it depends on how much business you got tied up in the U.K. But companies have had time to figure out how to mitigate a lot of these things and deal with them. So I'd say the reason that we didn't look at raising in the first quarter is because I just don't raise in the first quarter.
We're obviously off to a strong start. As I told you before, all of our growth story is solid and intact, not seeing any -- gosh, I feel like I should knock on wood. I'm not seeing any threats to the growth vehicles in the business. And while someone else have speculated that med tech or med devices is somewhat slowing, I'd tell you, I don't see that. And I don't think a lot of other CEOs in medical devices are seeing it either. In fact, if anything, I see projected growth rates rising across competitors. I take that as a very healthy signal from the industry that people are seeing positive, robust opportunity. I think a lot of people have new products and robust pipelines. And I think that's healthy for the whole sector worldwide. There's a lot of things that haven't changed, but we've been navigating those kinds of things for a while and doing well as an industry and as a company.
So could we have raised in the first quarter? Well, a lot of you may think so. I'm a little more cautious than that. I always kind of wait until the midyear so -- to kind of assess things. I like how the company is performing. I think the company is performing really well. I'm not sure we've ever had such healthy pipeline so broadly across the line in the company. So I don't have any negatives. I'm just thinking that one quarter into the year seems a little early to me. That's about as much as I can tell, that's a lot answer."

And there's a lot of potential for expansion of this product to other analytes besides glucose or additional analytes to glucose for the diabetic. There are other improvements that we can make in the product. All of that is in development. We know this platform well. It is a platform. It is not just a glucose test kit. And so there's, I guess, what I'll call an R&D development innovation strategy with it that is underway, has been underway. Our capacity expansion plans are well planned. We've already got almost 1.5 million users of Libre. And to be honest, we haven't exactly let the floodgates go. So I think you can kind of back into the math of that. This product is already great. Look, it's probably $1.5 billion or more in sales more and it's growing at 80%. So it doesn't take very long to figure out the math to what you just asked."

With me today are Miles White, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Robert Ford, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Brian Yoor, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer.
         
         Miles will provide opening remarks, and Brian will discuss our performance and outlook in more detail. Following their comments, we'll take your questions. 
         
         Before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2019. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements.
         
         Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors, to our annual report on Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.
         
         Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments except as required by law. Please note that first quarter financial results and guidance provided on the call today for sales, EPS and line items of the P&L will be for continuing operations only. 
         
         On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com. Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth, which is defined in our earnings news release issued earlier today. 
         
         With that, I will now turn the call over to Miles."
247483,606986650,1700322,"Abbott Laboratories, Q1 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 17, 2019",2019-04-17,"Earnings Calls","Abbott Laboratories","Executives","Okay. Thanks, Scott, and good morning. Today, we announced results for the first quarter and we're off to another good start. Our sales growth was strong and right on target, coming in at 7% on an organic basis in the quarter, and ongoing earnings per sha",838,"Okay. Thanks, Scott, and good morning. Today, we announced results for the first quarter and we're off to another good start. Our sales growth was strong and right on target, coming in at 7% on an organic basis in the quarter, and ongoing earnings per share of $0.63 exceeded our previous guidance range. 
         
         Our full year 2019 adjusted earnings per share guidance of $3.15 to $3.25 remains unchanged and reflects midteens growth at the midpoint on a constant currency basis. 
         
         As we've discussed previously, our emphasis today is on organic execution in the company. Today, all of our businesses have positive long-term outlooks and are well positioned with excellent products and attractive markets. At the start of the year, we issued guidance that reflected another year of strong performance. And for the first quarter, we're right on track with those expectations. We're particularly pleased with the exceptional performance of several long-term growth drivers that are leading the way, including FreeStyle Libre, MitraClip and the Alinity systems. These life-changing technologies are positively impacting lives and achieving impressive results. 
         
         I'll now summarize our first quarter results before turning the call over to Brian, and I'll start with Diagnostics, where sales were led by Core Laboratory growth of 10%. 
         
         Alinity, our family of next-generation diagnostic systems, is driving strong growth internationally, and we continue to achieve significant above-market growth in the United States. 
         
         In Europe, we are both converting existing customers to Alinity and winning competitive bids for new business at a very high rate. We also recently increased our launch efforts for Alinity h, our hematology system, and obtained CE Mark for Alinity m, our highly automated Molecular Diagnostics system along with several infectious disease tests. And we're expanding our menu of tests in key markets such as China and the United States. With a steady menu expansion on multiple different instruments across geographies, Alinity will be a significant growth driver for years to come. 
         
         In Nutrition, sales increased more than 6.5% in the quarter, reflecting strong execution and new product introductions. We continue to see good underlying market demand and growth, and we're achieving above-market growth in several geographies, particularly Asia and Latin America. Sales growth this quarter was balanced across our Pediatric and Adult Nutrition businesses with our core leading brands of Similac, PediaSure and Ensure all contributing to strong growth overall.
         
         In Established Pharmaceuticals, sales growth of 5.5% was right in line with our expectations and was a sequential improvement quarter-to-quarter. Performance in the quarter was led by a 7.5% growth in our key emerging markets, which represent the most attractive long-term growth countries for our branded generics portfolio and include India, Brazil, Russia and China, along with several other emerging countries. Underlying growth dynamics in these countries continue to remain strong and intact. 
         
         And lastly, I'll cover Medical Devices, where sales grew nearly 10%, led by strong double-digit growth in Heart Failure, Structural Heart, Electrophysiology and Diabetes Care. In Heart Failure, growth of 23% was led by rapid U.S. market adoption of our HeartMate 3 left ventricular assist device following FDA approval of a long-term use indication late last year. The superior patient outcomes demonstrated in the clinical trial that supported this approval have been a critical component of the growth and the share capture that we're achieving. 
         
         In Structural Heart, several products across our broad portfolio contributed to strong double-digit growth in the quarter, including MitraClip, our market-leading device for the treatment of mitral regurgitation, a condition caused by a leaky heart valve.
         
         During the quarter, we announced U.S. FDA approval for a new expanded indication for MitraClip, which significantly expands the number of people that can be treated. The formal process of seeking Medicare reimbursement for this new indication has been initiated. 
         
         During the quarter, we also filed for CE Mark for our new triclip device, a first of its kind minimally invasive device for repairing a leaky tricuspid heart valve. We plan to initiate our U.S. pivotal trial for triclip in the coming months. 
         
         I'll wrap up with Diabetes Care, where sales grew over 40% in the quarter led by FreeStyle Libre, our market-leading continuous glucose monitoring system, or CGM. Libre continues to perform exceptionally well with worldwide sales of $380 million in the quarter, reflecting growth of 80% with global leadership among CGM systems for both type 1 and type 2 users. In order to meet the tremendous demand that we're seeing for Libre, we're adding a significant amount of new manufacturing capacity, which will come online starting in the second half of this year.
         
         So in summary, we're right on track with our high expectations to start the year. All of our long-term growth drivers are intact and achieving significant growth, including FreeStyle Libre, MitraClip and Alinity. And we're well positioned to achieve the top tier sales and EPS growth targets that we set at the beginning of the year.
         
         I'll now turn the call over to Brian to discuss our results and outlook for the year in more detail. Brian?"

As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis, which is consistent with our previous guidance.
         
         Turning to our results. Sales for the first quarter increased 7.1%, and exchange had a negative impact of 4.8% on sales versus the prior year. Reported sales increased 2% in the quarter. 
         
         Regarding other aspects of the P&L. The adjusted gross margin ratio was 58.6% of sales, adjusted R&D investment was 7.4% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense was 32.3% of sales. All of these ratios were in line with previous guidance.
         
         Turning to our outlook for the full year. We continue to forecast organic sales growth of 6.5% to 7.5%. Based on current exchange rates, we would expect exchange to have a negative impact of around 2.5% on our full year reported sales, with the vast majority of the impact expected to occur in the first half of the year. 
         
         We continue to forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of somewhat above 59.5% of sales for the full year, which reflects underlying gross margin improvement across our businesses. We continue to forecast adjusted R&D investment of around 7.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of around 29.5% of sales for the full year. 
         
         Turning to our outlook for the second quarter. We forecast adjusted EPS of $0.79 to $0.81, which reflects strong double-digit underlying growth, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange on our results. We forecast organic sales growth of around 7%. And at current rates, we would expect exchange to have a negative impact of around 4% on our second quarter reported sales.
         
         We forecasted adjusted gross margin ratio of somewhat above 59% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of a little less than 7.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of around 29.5% of sales.
         
         Lastly, we forecast net interest expense of around $150 million in the second quarter. Before we open the call for questions, I'll now provide a quick overview of our second quarter sales growth outlook by business.
         
         For Established Pharmaceuticals, we forecast mid-single-digit growth, which is comprised of mid- to high single-digit growth in our priority key emerging markets along with a modest decline in other EPD sales, which reflects the recent continuation of a noncore, low-margin supply agreement. 
         
         In Nutrition, we forecast mid-single-digit sales growth. In Diagnostics, we forecast Abbott's legacy Diagnostics business, which is comprised of Core Laboratory, Molecular Point of Care, to grow mid- to high single digits. 
         
         In Rapid Diagnostics, we forecast low to mid-single-digit sales growth. And in Medical Devices, we forecast high single-digit sales growth, which reflects continued double-digit growth in several areas of this business. 
         
         With that, we will now open the call for questions."

We're seeing strength across the board in a lot of device and diagnostic areas. There is a geography here and there, a product line here and there that we might not be completely satisfied with. But I think if you look at us, our product areas, even competitors in various spaces in medical devices, this whole sector is doing pretty well and the growth rates have improved in a number of cases. I know that there was a lot preearnings noise out there about the continuity of the med device sector. I have to say from my perspective, I see nothing but a strong sector going forward. While we've got great pipelines and great products, I think the entire sector has a bright future ahead of us here and the markets are all pretty attractive for us. So first of all, I think we're in a much healthier environment than might be reflected right now, and I think a lot of companies are actually doing really well in that environment. There's a lot of good new products and pipelines out there. I think the whole thing is pretty healthy. And then specifically to us, we've got, in our case, I think great pipeline, great new products and launches in many of the segments and sectors we're in. To focus on Diabetes Care as a start, that's been a particular bright spot where, clearly, new technology and affordable technology has made a very big difference in life for diabetics, both type 1 and type 2 worldwide. Libre has been a pretty powerful leader in that segment on all accounts and all points. We've been pretty enthused about its success, its uptake, its reception by patients all over the world. In a fairly short amount of time, we've achieved global leadership in terms of continuous glucose monitoring in both type 1 and type 2. I think part of the attraction to patients is obviously not having the finger stick. The information, the continuous nature of it, the way it allows diabetics to manage their health and manage diabetes has been life-changing, and that's been reflective. And I think very importantly, it's been affordable to a degree that it's really -- it's become a very broadly accessible technology, which was our intent with it. It's got a unique ease-of-use and it's got appeal for any kind of patient. So I think that's pretty important and it's reflected in the reimbursements worldwide. 80% of sales are now reimbursed internationally over 30 countries. Well over half of U.S. lives commercially -- commercial lives are covered. So we're seeing a lot of support for the product in all ways. We've mentioned a number of times that we've invested heavily in capacity expansion. That is correct. We put significant investment into that. And as we've noted a couple of times, the first waves of that come online in the second half of this year, and then there's a steady cadence of capacity expansions underway that will come online sequentially after that. There won't be any constraints to the growth that's possible there. I think it's going to be a very different kind of device or diagnostic product than we've seen in the past. Because there are so many of millions of diabetics worldwide, this is not a niche product, not for type 1s or type 2s. There's not a niche here. There's a massive population around the world that needs to manage diabetes, and this product will be broadly accessible to all of them. So it calls for quite a lot of capacity and in the second half of this year that will be initiated. 
         
         We have a number of things we're expecting and waiting for. You asked about Libre 2. That is under review at the FDA. We have filed Libre 2 with alarms in the U.S. as an iCGM. We're not going to forecast FDA review time lines, but we clearly have expectations to achieve that milestone. I'm trying to think of what else to tell you about that. It's already on the market in Europe."

So on Libre 2, specifically in the U.S., the filing of iCGM, I'll just say we know what the iCGM standards are. We know what needs to be achieved. And we filed in the U.S. as an iCGM knowing what the standards need to be achieved. So we look at what we filed and we look at the standards, and we look at what we filed and we know that we meet those standards. So to Miles' point, we're not going to forecast here as to when that approval will come through. But I think it's clear in terms of what we filed and why we filed. 
         
         Regarding payers, specifically in the U.S., I think that what we've always intended for this product is to remove some of the hurdles, and affordability was one of those. And if you look at a lot of the evolution of the reimbursement here in the U.S. that's slowly moving from something that was -- with a lot of prior authorizations, only going through mail order to now looking very much like the blood glucose monitoring market where we start to see less prior authorizations, formulary positions that are allowing patients to go to a pharmacy and pick that up. So a lot of our managed care strategy was focused on driving that shift, and a key part of that is the access and affordability. So we're seeing that in our managed care coverage. As Miles said, we're over 50% now of managed care life coverage in this patient population. And you see the shift into pharmacy. If you look at the script data, total Rxes, you can see that shift. You can see that occurring with Libre. And that was a very intentional strategy to accelerate adoption, specifically in the U.S., by going to pharmacy, which is something that hadn't been done before with CGM systems. And we did that, and we're starting to kind of move that category into the pharmacy."

And we've been pretty pleased with the performance going through pharmacy. The patient acquisition and so forth continues to be obviously strong, frankly, right in line with our growth rates around the world, as you'd expect, because we're not trying to drive price here. We're trying to drive the volume and acquisition of patients. And obviously, that's going pretty strongly. So there's nothing but happiness about this product. I can tell you, we're pretty happy with it. It's doing really well. I actually think we're kind of in its early stages. And at this point, there's over 1 million type 1 users of Libre around the world and those only make up 2/3 of our user base. So with this kind of a growth rate, that kind of a user base with the capacity expansion coming online, we're obviously expecting this to be a continuingly big and bigger product for us."

Miles, I just wonder if you can kind of share with us how you see sort of the pacing of the year from here. I think in the fourth quarter, the messaging was core growth drivers very much intact, some one-off dynamics were suppressing growth and you expected that growth to improve in the first quarter. And sure enough, that's sort of what happened here, back in sort of the 7% range. As you think about the balance of the year, you had these core growth drivers doing relatively well, a couple of businesses probably not performing where you'd like to perform. So how do we think about the pacing of the business from the first quarter on given some of these very solid businesses and some of the businesses that are not performing as you'd like?"

Every year, we're going to the year and the gating of earnings per share for any given quarter tends to start out lower at the front end of the year and it always looks back-end loaded and -- toward the t",659,"Well, a couple of sort of baseline comments there. Every year, we're going to the year and the gating of earnings per share for any given quarter tends to start out lower at the front end of the year and it always looks back-end loaded and -- toward the third and fourth quarters. I'd say, increasingly, that's leveling a little bit in that it's still a climb as the year goes on. But in our case, it's reflecting growth and penetration of new products. And there's a couple of seasonalities in there, but they're not big enough to really affect the overall earnings profile. We've increasingly seen stronger and stronger first quarters. But to be honest, third and fourth is always strong, but it's driven right now by the incredible growth of Alinity, Libre, HeartMate, MitraClip. There's so much real growth in the new products that are launching that it just gets better and better as the year rolls on. So I think it's always hard to gate to the penny. We try to get our estimates to a point like that. Then we're always subject to a couple of lumpy comparisons to whatever happened last year and so on, I guess, because it looks optically weird when it's bumpy. But the fact is the growth is steady. As you said, it's not only intact, it's strong. But there are a couple of places you could poke and say, ""Okay, you must not be satisfied with that."" And I'd say, ""Yes, you're right about that."" 
         
         But while we've got some places we're putting a lot of more focus on and we've obviously miscalled the pace of improvement, I'd say, in general, I'm glad that what we have to work on for improvement is where it is and not in these major growth drivers. So Alinity is performing strongly. We are winning over 95% of accounts where we already have the business, and we're winning almost 2/3 of the accounts where we're head-to-head with an entrenched competitor. That's pretty powerful data when you consider that customers have to switch out mainframe systems. It's a big commitment. It takes months. There are long-term contracts. So -- but winning almost 2/3 of those new business, new accounts, that's pretty significant. That's a pretty powerful endorsement by the market of the Alinity systems and the laboratory solutions we're offering. We're seeing improvement in growth just about every place. I'm really pleased with Nutrition. I had to sit here on this call a number of times and explain, well, we're expecting it to get a little better. But it's performing really well and I think consistently so across all geographies and across both major product lines there. That's been a nice story. And we've estimated to you that the growth rate of that business going forward we will look for in the 4% to 6% range. And obviously, we're a little beyond that. I don't know that we're going to constantly be beyond that. But that 4% to 6% range is all good. So anywhere in there is pretty good for us. There does tend to be some up and down with it in some countries depending on holidays and seasons and so forth. But overall, if we're not watching it week to week, that's a pretty strong business right now and we like what we see. The management has done a great job worldwide. 
         
         So as far as quarters coming, I'm hard-pressed to find a lot of things to point at as watchouts other than, as you pointed out, we got a couple of places where we think we've got work to do and to improve the performance of the business. I'm pleased that we can show that we know how to correct the performance of an underperforming business. But as you would probably rightly point out to me right now, there's a couple that are taking longer than I might have guessed."

So yes, we had a very good quarter in Structural Heart, and we showed growth across many of our different franchises and geographies. Obviously, MitraClip was a big driver and we're right where we wanted to be with MitraClip. The FDA approval was a few months ahead. But I think that speaks to the data and the evidence that was generated through COAPT. Label is very much in line with our expectations and reflects the COAPT patient enrollment criteria. So we're now obviously working on CMS. Process is underway. These usually take between 6 to 9 months. If you look at our experience when we achieved the primary MR reimbursement indication a few years back, that took us about 7.5 months from when we started to when we got it approved. So we know how to do this. We're currently in the process. And it'll just be a little bit difficult to forecast here, but we're very optimistic. But I'd say reimbursement is only one of the building blocks. It's definitely an important building block, but it's not the only one to really think about this business as a multiyear, double-digit kind of growth driver for us. There are other building blocks here that are very important that we're currently already underway. Opening of new centers is a key aspect here, and the timing and the framework and the cycle of how we do that is important. We have currently about 350 implanting centers in the U.S. And I think over the next few years, we'll see that number get to about 550. There's a lot of training that's involved here also, sales force training, center training, implanter training. And if you look at a sales rep, it'll usually take them between 6 to 9 months until they get fully proficient on MitraClip. So -- and then there's obviously the development, support and sustaining of a patient referral network as we build awareness of the therapy and the technology amongst the physician groups and ensure that those got funneled into our implant centers. 
         
         So those are some of the key blocks. But I'd say we know how to do this. We've been doing it in the U.S. for the last 4 years and we're not going to wait for final CMS approval before we start hiring. We're already hiring more reps. We're expanding our sales force. We're expanding our clinical specialists so that we're going to be ready to go. So we're definitely taking an invest ahead approach here. So I like our position. The mitral is a tremendous opportunity, unmet need and an opportunity for Abbott. And quite frankly, we've been -- this position didn't happen just because of COAPT. We've been building this position for over a decade. So whether it's mitral repair or mitral repayment, we're in a pretty unique position. So I do see kind of sequential growth as we go through the year. 
         
         Your question on MITRA-FR, yes, we did see that impact some of our European markets. And we know it's a French study, so it did have a little bit of an impact on some of the kind of implanting rates in some key European markets. But I think that's more of a transition thing. I don't think that's a fundamental change in the market in Europe. And we had expanded internationally to other large opportunities. Japan is another market where we see a very large opportunity for us. So that is also going to help kind of drive the growth. I think the Mitra-FR study will take another quarter or so to play out, but I -- we do expect the international business to kind of continue its growth."

And where we underestimated that was we're expanding our sales force by 40% to 50%, and that's been a little more disruptive than I think we had expected. But I'm confident in the business. I'm confident in the management. I'm confident in the direction we're headed. I clearly wasn't right about the timing. So I'm not worrying about it from the standpoint of, boy, this business is really broken or hurt. It's not. And so I have a lot of confidence about that. As far as growth goes, I don't think that it's a high double-digit grower, but it's a double-digit grower. And I think in med devices and in some of these markets as it becomes established, to be maintaining a double-digit growth rate as a market segment, I think, is pretty healthy. So I haven't -- we're not losing any confidence in the segments or the potential in the segments or the growth in the segments. I put the growth sort of in that double-digit range. That's what we would expect. And it's not 50%, but it's not 5% either. So our performance in this particular segment is clearly underperforming what it should be. So I'd say if you want to know if the market is slowing, well, it's not 50%. But slow is a relative thing. I'd take any double-digit market, and I think this is a healthy market."

And that was -- that's -- it's not a market thing. That's more of an Abbott as we get ready to launch -- as we're launching our new ablation catheter, TactiCath SE, in the U.S., which we have already launched OUS. We obviously saw some kind of inventory depletion of the older product in getting ready for the new product. So we expect that to get back to the double-digit growth rate in the U.S. on the EP side. On CRM, that is definitely another area of disappointment and obviously, focus for us. We showed some recovery in the international markets, and I think the team there has done a good job at execution. But we're obviously not satisfied with our U.S. performance. It's an important business for us and we got to do better. But what we've seen internationally is where we've deployed dedicated EP and CRM teams, the business does better. It does better in CRM. And quite frankly, it does better in EP. So we -- as you saw, we recently made some organizational changes here to sharpen our focus and create a more, I'd say, stand-alone vertical business unit in CRM. We think that's going to get the accountability and the focus that we need out in the commercial field, especially in the U.S. And we've got several new product innovations that are progressing very nicely. Our next-gen ICD and our 2 leadless programs. And now this structure will ensure that they get the focus that they need.
         
         In Heart Failure, as you mentioned, our sales were up 23%. U.S. was up 26%, and that was the impact of, I'd say, the rapid share capture that we achieved in the U.S. in the destination therapy, I'd say, a pretty strong execution of the commercial team with the product, achieving about 20 share points in that quarter. So we expect that share to kind of maintain. The product has done very well, not only on our, I'd say, traditional Abbott accounts, but even in our competitor accounts, that's doing very nicely also. So we look -- we think Heart Failure has got strong potential also throughout the year with CardioMEMS. It's a little bit smaller product here, but it also continues to do very well."

It's been a little unprecedented, I think, for as much debt as we had. I mean, when we were done with the St. Jude and Alere acquisitions, I think we were at about $28 billion, something like that. We've paid down more $10 billion of that. So -- and almost $8.5 billion of it just last year. Another $0.5 billion in the first quarter this year. So our debt -- everybody watches net debt-to-EBITDA ratio. We're down to about 2x right now from what was, I think, about 4.3 when we completed the second of the 2 acquisitions. That's a pretty rapid paydown. We expect to be about 1.5x by year-end. So I think I could declare strategic flexibility achieved. Obviously, we want to keep paying down the debt. We've got nice, strong cash flow. We've got a number of choices. We increased the dividend, as you know, back in December by 14%. And we tend to target that dividend at around 40% to 45% of EPS. And I think right now, we're at 40%, something like that. EPS is growing pretty rapidly, so probably be adjusting at some point. But the -- there's good times and bad times to purchase shares, as you know. And our share repurchases, we haven't done a lot of share repurchasing. We've done some primarily just to offset dilution, but that has not been a big consumer of capital. 
         
         We have made significant investments internally in our growth with Alinity expansion and with the Libre capacity expansion. And again, while those are important users of our capital with high return, we still have pretty strong cash flow. So back to the point of your question, we have strategic flexibility. We have strong cash flow. We have choice. The -- I think the question is whether or not at any point there's something out there that fits us or we're particularly interested in or that we're focused on, et cetera. And as you know, I've told you in the past, even if I have that, I wouldn't tell you, that would be true. I would say today, what is also true is we are very much focused on our internal organic execution, and that's getting sort of 95% of our attention. We're not paying attention to other opportunities. We always are tracking and monitoring other opportunities. But I have to tell you right now, I don't see a very robust target-rich environment out there. It's not target-rich. I don't think it is anyway. And I don't see a lot of meaningful adjunctive things that necessarily fit what we're trying to do. So obviously, as we move forward here, one of our challenges is going to be capital deployment because we're going to have a lot of it. And I think we're going to generate a lot of cash over the coming years. I think we're going to generate a lot of profit. And we obviously want to either invest at or return it to shareholders at the highest possible return. And if it means there's opportunities in M&A, as you know, historically, we've always been pretty attentive and diligent about that. I wouldn't forecast it when or what. We -- but we are out of the range where we're constrained about our choices. We are no longer constrained. And I think that's a positive. We've gotten there pretty quickly. And that means that we can consider whatever. We don't happen to be focused on M&A right now, but M&A isn't a steady every year thing. It's opportunistic when it fits the strategy and the intent of the company and when an opportunity fits and a return can be earned.
         
         And so if something like that comes along, I'd say we're well positioned. We'd be ready to do something. But to be honest, we haven't seen something that attractive."

I know it's not your style, but I'm just curious on your guidance for the year."
247483,606986650,1700322,"Abbott Laboratories, Q1 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 17, 2019",2019-04-17,"Earnings Calls","Abbott Laboratories","Executives","Yes, Vijay, thanks for the question. You kind of answered it at the end of your question there when you said it's not my style. I rarely, if ever, raise in a first quarter. I kind of feel like if I raised in the first quarter, why didn't I put it in the o",535,"Yes, Vijay, thanks for the question. You kind of answered it at the end of your question there when you said it's not my style. I rarely, if ever, raise in a first quarter. I kind of feel like if I raised in the first quarter, why didn't I put it in the original plan 3 months ago or 6 months ago? But I have generally waited to consider such a thing in the mid-year because at various points in time, well, there's been a number of times we've all been burned by exchange around April, May, June or something for the remainder of the year. I don't actually expect that this year. I'm no forecaster of exchange and we're not currency traders, as you know. But just based on what we all see, we were all -- like all industries, all companies, all multinationals and so forth, we were all cautious about China trade and exchange and volatility, the price of oil, even Brexit. These were sort of the big factors everybody talked about. Oil is almost $70, and I don't think Brexit is weighing on a lot of minds. It's weighing on a lot of European minds, it's weighing on a lot of U.K. minds and it depends on how much business you got tied up in the U.K. But companies have had time to figure out how to mitigate a lot of these things and deal with them. So I'd say the reason that we didn't look at raising in the first quarter is because I just don't raise in the first quarter.
         
         We're obviously off to a strong start. As I told you before, all of our growth story is solid and intact, not seeing any -- gosh, I feel like I should knock on wood. I'm not seeing any threats to the growth vehicles in the business. And while some analysts have speculated that med tech or med devices is somewhat slowing, I'd tell you, I don't see that. And I don't think a lot of other CEOs in medical devices are seeing it either. In fact, if anything, I see projected growth rates rising across competitors. I take that as a very healthy signal from the industry that people are seeing positive, robust opportunity. I think a lot of people have new products and robust pipelines. And I think that's healthy for the whole sector worldwide. There's a lot of things that haven't changed, but we've been navigating those kinds of things for a while and doing well as an industry and as a company.
         
         So could we have raised in the first quarter? Well, a lot of you may think so. I'm a little more cautious than that. I always kind of wait until the midyear so -- to kind of assess things. I like how the company is performing. I think the company is performing really well. I'm not sure we've ever had such healthy pipeline so broadly across the line in the company. So I don't have any negatives. I'm just thinking that one quarter into the year seems a little early to me. That's about as much as I can tell, that's a honest answer."

There are other improvements that we can make in the product. All of that is in development. We know this platform well. It is a platform. It is not just a glucose test kit. And so there's, I guess, what I'll call an R&D development innovation strategy with it that is underway, has been underway. Our capacity expansion plans are well planned. We've already got almost 1.5 million users of Libre. And to be honest, we haven't exactly let the floodgates go. So I think you can kind of back into the math of that. This product is already great. Look, it's probably $1.5 billion or more in sales more and it's growing at 80%. So it doesn't take very long to figure out the math to what you just asked."

Today, we announced results for the first quarter and we're off to another good start. Our sales growth was strong and right on target, coming in at 7% on an organic basis in the quarter, and ongoing earnings per share of $0.63 exceeded our previous guidance range. Our full year 2019 adjusted earnings per share guidance of $3.15 to $3.25 remains unchanged and reflects midteens growth at the midpoint on a constant currency basis. As we've discussed previously, our emphasis today is on organic execution in the company. Today, all of our businesses have positive long-term outlooks and are well positioned with excellent products and attractive markets. At the start of the year, we issued guidance that reflected another year of strong performance. And for the first quarter, we're right on track with those expectations. We're particularly pleased with the exceptional performance of several long-term growth drivers that are leading the way, including FreeStyle Libre, MitraClip and the Alinity systems. These life-changing technologies are positively impacting lives and achieving impressive results. 
I'll now summarize our first quarter results before turning the call over to Brian, and I'll start with Diagnostics, where sales were led by Core Laboratory growth of 10%. Alinity, our family of next-generation diagnostic systems, is driving strong growth internationally, and we continue to achieve significant above-market growth in the United States. In Europe, we are both converting existing customers to Alinity and winning competitive bids for new business at a very high rate. We also recently increased our launch efforts for Alinity h, our hematology system, and obtained CE Mark for Alinity m, our highly automated Molecular Diagnostics system along with several infectious disease tests. And we're expanding our menu of tests in key markets such as China and the United States. With a steady menu expansion on multiple different instruments across geographies, Alinity will be a significant growth driver for years to come. 
In Nutrition, sales increased more than 6.5% in the quarter, reflecting strong execution and new product introductions. We continue to see good underlying market demand and growth, and we're achieving above-market growth in several geographies, particularly Asia and Latin America. Sales growth this quarter was balanced across our Pediatric and Adult Nutrition businesses with our core leading brands of Similac, PediaSure and Ensure all contributing to strong growth overall.
In Established Pharmaceuticals, sales growth of 5.5% was right in line with our expectations and was a sequential improvement quarter-to-quarter. Performance in the quarter was led by a 7.5% growth in our key emerging markets, which represent the most attractive long-term growth countries for our branded generics portfolio and include India, Brazil, Russia and China, along with several other emerging countries. Underlying growth dynamics in these countries continue to remain strong and intact. 
And lastly, I'll cover Medical Devices, where sales grew nearly 10%, led by strong double-digit growth in Heart Failure, Structural Heart, Electrophysiology and Diabetes Care. In Heart Failure, growth of 23% was led by rapid U.S. market adoption of our HeartMate 3 left ventricular assist device following FDA approval of a long-term use indication late last year. The superior patient outcomes demonstrated in the clinical trial that supported this approval have been a critical component of the growth and the share capture that we're achieving. 
In Structural Heart, several products across our broad portfolio contributed to strong double-digit growth in the quarter, including MitraClip, our market-leading device for the treatment of mitral regurgitation, a condition caused by a leaky heart valve.
During the quarter, we announced U.S. FDA approval for a new expanded indication for MitraClip, which significantly expands the number of people that can be treated. The formal process of seeking Medicare reimbursement for this new indication has been initiated. 
During the quarter, we also filed for CE Mark for our new triclip device, a first of its kind minimally invasive device for repairing a leaky tricuspid heart valve. We plan to initiate our U.S. pivotal trial for triclip in the coming months. 
I'll wrap up with Diabetes Care, where sales grew over 40% in the quarter led by FreeStyle Libre, our market-leading continuous glucose monitoring system, or CGM. Libre continues to perform exceptionally well with worldwide sales of $380 million in the quarter, reflecting growth of 80% with global leadership among CGM systems for both type 1 and type 2 users. In order to meet the tremendous demand that we're seeing for Libre, we're adding a significant amount of new manufacturing capacity, which will come online starting in the second half of this year.
So in summary, we're right on track with our high expectations to start the year. All of our long-term growth drivers are intact and achieving significant growth, including FreeStyle Libre, MitraClip and Alinity. And we're well positioned to achieve the top tier sales and EPS growth targets that we set at the beginning of the year.
I'll now turn the call over to Brian to discuss our results and outlook for the year in more detail. Brian?"

Sales for the first quarter increas",460,"Thanks, Miles. As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis, which is consistent with our previous guidance.
Turning to our results. Sales for the first quarter increased 7.1%, and exchange had a negative impact of 4.8% on sales versus the prior year. Reported sales increased 2% in the quarter. Regarding other aspects of the P&L. The adjusted gross margin ratio was 58.6% of sales, adjusted R&D investment was 7.4% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense was 32.3% of sales. All of these ratios were in line with previous guidance.
Turning to our outlook for the full year. We continue to forecast organic sales growth of 6.5% to 7.5%. Based on current exchange rates, we would expect exchange to have a negative impact of around 2.5% on our full year reported sales, with the vast majority of the impact expected to occur in the first half of the year. We continue to forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of somewhat above 59.5% of sales for the full year, which reflects underlying gross margin improvement across our businesses. We continue to forecast adjusted R&D investment of around 7.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of around 29.5% of sales for the full year. 
Turning to our outlook for the second quarter. We forecast adjusted EPS of $0.79 to $0.81, which reflects strong double-digit underlying growth, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange on our results. We forecast organic sales growth of around 7%. And at current rates, we would expect exchange to have a negative impact of around 4% on our second quarter reported sales. We forecasted adjusted gross margin ratio of somewhat above 59% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of a little less than 7.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of around 29.5% of sales. Lastly, we forecast net interest expense of around $150 million in the second quarter. 
Before we open the call for questions, I'll now provide a quick overview of our second quarter sales growth outlook by business. For Established Pharmaceuticals, we forecast mid-single-digit growth, which is comprised of mid- to high single-digit growth in our priority key emerging markets along with a modest decline in other EPD sales, which reflects the recent continuation of a noncore, low-margin supply agreement. In Nutrition, we forecast mid-single-digit sales growth. In Diagnostics, we forecast Abbott's legacy Diagnostics business, which is comprised of Core Laboratory, Molecular Point of Care, to grow mid- to high single digits. In Rapid Diagnostics, we forecast low to mid-single-digit sales growth. And in Medical Devices, we forecast high single-digit sales growth, which reflects continued double-digit growth in several areas of this business. 
With that, we will now open the call for questions."

We're seeing strength across the board in a lot of device and diagnostic areas. There is a geography here and there, a product line here and there that we might not be completely satisfied with. But I think if you look at us, our product areas, even competitors in various spaces in medical devices, this whole sector is doing pretty well and the growth rates have improved in a number of cases. I know that there was a lot preearnings noise out there about the continuity of the med device sector. I have to say from my perspective, I see nothing but a strong sector going forward. While we've got great pipelines and great products, I think the entire sector has a bright future ahead of us here and the markets are all pretty attractive for us. 
So first of all, I think we're in a much healthier environment than might be reflected right now, and I think a lot of companies are actually doing really well in that environment. There's a lot of good new products and pipelines out there. I think the whole thing is pretty healthy. And then specifically to us, we've got, in our case, I think great pipeline, great new products and launches in many of the segments and sectors we're in. 
To focus on Diabetes Care as a start, that's been a particular bright spot where, clearly, new technology and affordable technology has made a very big difference in life for diabetics, both type 1 and type 2 worldwide. Libre has been a pretty powerful leader in that segment on all accounts and all points. We've been pretty enthused about its success, its uptake, its reception by patients all over the world. In a fairly short amount of time, we've achieved global leadership in terms of continuous glucose monitoring in both type 1 and type 2. I think part of the attraction to patients is obviously not having the finger stick. The information, the continuous nature of it, the way it allows diabetics to manage their health and manage diabetes has been life-changing, and that's been reflective. And I think very importantly, it's been affordable to a degree that it's really -- it's become a very broadly accessible technology, which was our intent with it. It's got a unique ease-of-use and it's got appeal for any kind of patient. So I think that's pretty important and it's reflected in the reimbursements worldwide. 80% of sales are now reimbursed internationally over 30 countries. Well over half of U.S. lives commercially -- commercial lives are covered. So we're seeing a lot of support for the product in all ways. 
We've mentioned a number of times that we've invested heavily in capacity expansion. That is correct. We put significant investment into that. And as we've noted a couple of times, the first waves of that come online in the second half of this year, and then there's a steady cadence of capacity expansions underway that will come online sequentially after that. There won't be any constraints to the growth that's possible there. I think it's going to be a very different kind of device or diagnostic product than we've seen in the past. Because there are so many of millions of diabetics worldwide, this is not a niche product, not for type 1s or type 2s. There's not a niche here. There's a massive population around the world that needs to manage diabetes, and this product will be broadly accessible to all of them. So it calls for quite a lot of capacity and in the second half of this year that will be initiated. 
We have a number of things we're expecting and waiting for. You asked about Libre 2. That is under review at the FDA. We have filed Libre 2 with alarms in the U.S. as an iCGM. We're not going to forecast FDA review time lines, but we clearly have expectations to achieve that milestone. I'm trying to think of what else to tell you about that. It's already on the market in Europe."

So to Miles' point, we're not going to forecast here as to when that approval will come through. But I think it's clear in terms of what we filed and why we filed. 
Regarding payers, specifically in the U.S., I think that what we've always intended for this product is to remove some of the hurdles, and affordability was one of those. And if you look at a lot of the evolution of the reimbursement here in the U.S. that's slowly moving from something that was -- with a lot of prior authorizations, only going through mail order to now looking very much like the blood glucose monitoring market where we start to see less prior authorizations, formulary positions that are allowing patients to go to a pharmacy and pick that up. So a lot of our managed care strategy was focused on driving that shift, and a key part of that is the access and affordability. So we're seeing that in our managed care coverage. As Miles said, we're over 50% now of managed care life coverage in this patient population. And you see the shift into pharmacy. If you look at the script data, total Rxes, you can see that shift. You can see that occurring with Libre. And that was a very intentional strategy to accelerate adoption, specifically in the U.S., by going to pharmacy, which is something that hadn't been done before with CGM systems. And we did that, and we're starting to kind of move that category into the pharmacy."

And we've been pretty pleased with the performance going through pharmacy. The patient acquisition and so forth continues to be obviously strong, frankly, right in line with our growth rates around the world, as you'd expect, because we're not trying to drive price here. We're trying to drive the volume and acquisition of patients. And obviously, that's going pretty strongly. So there's nothing but happiness about this product. I can tell you, we're pretty happy with it. It's doing really well. I actually think we're kind of in its early stages. And at this point, there's over 1 million type 1 users of Libre around the world and those only make up 2/3 of our user base. So with this kind of a growth rate, that kind of a user base with the capacity expansion coming online, we're obviously expecting this to be a continuingly big and bigger product for us."

Miles, I just wonder if you can kind of share with us how you see sort of the pacing of the year from here. I think in the fourth quarter, the messaging was core growth drivers very much intact, some one-off dynamics were suppressing growth and you expected that growth to improve in the first quarter. And sure enough, that's sort of what happened here, back in sort of the 7% range. As you think about the balance of the year, you had these core growth drivers doing relatively well, a couple of businesses probably not performing where you'd like to perform. So how do we think about the pacing of the business from the first quarter on given some of these very solid businesses and some of the businesses that are not performing as you'd like?"

Every year, we're going to the year and the gating of earnings per share for any given quarter tends to start out lower at the front end of the year and it always looks back-end loaded and -- toward the third and fourth quarters. I'd say, increasingly, that's leveling a little bit in that it's still a climb as the year goes on. But in our case, it's reflecting growth and penetration of new products. And there's a couple of seasonalities in there, but they're not big enough to really affect the overall earnings profile. We've increasingly seen stronger and stronger first quarters. But to be honest, third and fourth is always strong, but it's driven right now by the incredible growth of Alinity, Libre, HeartMate, MitraClip. There's so much real growth in the new products that are launching that it just gets better and better as the year rolls on. So I think it's always hard to gate to the penny. We try to get our estimates to a point like that. Then we're always subject to a couple of lumpy comparisons to whatever happened last year and so on, I guess, because it looks optically weird when it's bumpy. But the fact is the growth is steady. As you said, it's not only intact, it's strong. But there are a couple of places you could poke and say, ""Okay, you must not be satisfied with that."" And I'd say, ""Yes, you're right about that."" 
But while we've got some places we're putting a lot of more focus on and we've obviously miscalled the pace of improvement, I'd say, in general, I'm glad that what we have to work on for improvement is where it is and not in these major growth drivers. So Alinity is performing strongly. We are winning over 95% of accounts where we already have the business, and we're winning almost 2/3 of the accounts where we're head-to-head with an entrenched competitor. That's pretty powerful data when you consider that customers have to switch out mainframe systems. It's a big commitment. It takes months. There are long-term contracts. So -- but winning almost 2/3 of those new business, new accounts, that's pretty significant. That's a pretty powerful endorsement by the market of the Alinity systems and the laboratory solutions we're offering. We're seeing improvement in growth just about every place. 
I'm really pleased with Nutrition. I had to sit here on this call a number of times and explain, well, we're expecting it to get a little better. But it's performing really well and I think consistently so across all geographies and across both major product lines there. That's been a nice story. And we've estimated to you that the growth rate of that business going forward we will look for in the 4% to 6% range. And obviously, we're a little beyond that. I don't know that we're going to constantly be beyond that. But that 4% to 6% range is all good. So anywhere in there is pretty good for us. There does tend to be some up and down with it in some countries depending on holidays and seasons and so forth. But overall, if we're not watching it week to week, that's a pretty strong business right now and we like what we see. The management has done a great job worldwide. 
So as far as quarters coming, I'm hard-pressed to find a lot of things to point at as watchouts other than, as you pointed out, we got a couple of places where we think we've got work to do and to improve the performance of the business. I'm pleased that we can show that we know how to correct the performance of an underperforming business. But as you would probably rightly point out to me right now, there's a couple that are taking longer than I might have guessed."

So yes, we had a very good quarter in Structural Heart, and we showed growth across many of our different franchises and geographies. Obviously, MitraClip was a big driver and we're right where we wanted to be with MitraClip. The FDA approval was a few months ahead. But I think that speaks to the data and the evidence that was generated through COAPT. Label is very much in line with our expectations and reflects the COAPT patient enrollment criteria. So we're now obviously working on CMS. Process is underway. These usually take between 6 to 9 months. If you look at our experience when we achieved the primary MR reimbursement indication a few years back, that took us about 7.5 months from when we started to when we got it approved. So we know how to do this. We're currently in the process. And it'll just be a little bit difficult to forecast here, but we're very optimistic. But I'd say reimbursement is only one of the building blocks. It's definitely an important building block, but it's not the only one to really think about this business as a multiyear, double-digit kind of growth driver for us. 
There are other building blocks here that are very important that we're currently already underway. Opening of new centers is a key aspect here, and the timing and the framework and the cycle of how we do that is important. We have currently about 350 implanting centers in the U.S. And I think over the next few years, we'll see that number get to about 550. There's a lot of training that's involved here also, sales force training, center training, implanter training. And if you look at a sales rep, it'll usually take them between 6 to 9 months until they get fully proficient on MitraClip. So -- and then there's obviously the development, support and sustaining of a patient referral network as we build awareness of the therapy and the technology amongst the physician groups and ensure that those got funneled into our implant centers. So those are some of the key blocks. 
But I'd say we know how to do this. We've been doing it in the U.S. for the last 4 years and we're not going to wait for final CMS approval before we start hiring. We're already hiring more reps. We're expanding our sales force. We're expanding our clinical specialists so that we're going to be ready to go. So we're definitely taking an invest ahead approach here. So I like our position. The mitral is a tremendous opportunity, unmet need and an opportunity for Abbott. And quite frankly, we've been -- this position didn't happen just because of COAPT. We've been building this position for over a decade. So whether it's mitral repair or mitral repayment, we're in a pretty unique position. So I do see kind of sequential growth as we go through the year. 
Your question on MITRA-FR, yes, we did see that impact some of our European markets. And we know it's a French study, so it did have a little bit of an impact on some of the kind of implanting rates in some key European markets. But I think that's more of a transition thing. I don't think that's a fundamental change in the market in Europe. And we had expanded internationally to other large opportunities. Japan is another market where we see a very large opportunity for us. So that is also going to help kind of drive the growth. I think the Mitra-FR study will take another quarter or so to play out, but I -- we do expect the international business to kind of continue its growth."

And where we underestimated that was we're expanding our sales force by 40% to 50%, and that's been a little more disruptive than I think we had expected. But I'm confident in the business. I'm confident in the management. I'm confident in the direction we're headed. I clearly wasn't right about the timing. So I'm not worrying about it from the standpoint of, boy, this business is really broken or hurt. It's not. And so I have a lot of confidence about that. 
As far as growth goes, I don't think that it's a high double-digit grower, but it's a double-digit grower. And I think in med devices and in some of these markets as it becomes established, to be maintaining a double-digit growth rate as a market segment, I think, is pretty healthy. So I haven't -- we're not losing any confidence in the segments or the potential in the segments or the growth in the segments. I put the growth sort of in that double-digit range. That's what we would expect. And it's not 50%, but it's not 5% either. So our performance in this particular segment is clearly underperforming what it should be. So I'd say if you want to know if the market is slowing, well, it's not 50%. But slow is a relative thing. I'd take any double-digit market, and I think this is a healthy market."

And that was -- that's -- it's not a market thing. That's more of an Abbott as we get ready to launch -- as we're launching our new ablation catheter, TactiCath SE, in the U.S., which we have already launched OUS. We obviously saw some kind of inventory depletion of the older product in getting ready for the new product. So we expect that to get back to the double-digit growth rate in the U.S. on the EP side. On CRM, that is definitely another area of disappointment and obviously, focus for us. We showed some recovery in the international markets, and I think the team there has done a good job at execution. But we're obviously not satisfied with our U.S. performance. It's an important business for us and we got to do better. But what we've seen internationally is where we've deployed dedicated EP and CRM teams, the business does better. It does better in CRM. And quite frankly, it does better in EP. So we -- as you saw, we recently made some organizational changes here to sharpen our focus and create a more, I'd say, stand-alone vertical business unit in CRM. We think that's going to get the accountability and the focus that we need out in the commercial field, especially in the U.S. And we've got several new product innovations that are progressing very nicely. Our next-gen ICD and our 2 leadless programs. And now this structure will ensure that they get the focus that they need.
In Heart Failure, as you mentioned, our sales were up 23%. U.S. was up 26%, and that was the impact of, I'd say, the rapid share capture that we achieved in the U.S. in the destination therapy, I'd say, a pretty strong execution of the commercial team with the product, achieving about 20 share points in that quarter. So we expect that share to kind of maintain. The product has done very well, not only on our, I'd say, traditional Abbott accounts, but even in our competitor accounts, that's doing very nicely also. So we look -- we think Heart Failure has got strong potential also throughout the year with CardioMEMS. It's a little bit smaller product here, but it also continues to do very well."

It's been a little unprecedented, I think, for as much debt as we had. I mean, when we were done with the St. Jude and Alere acquisitions, I think we were at about $28 billion, something like that. We've paid down more $10 billion of that. So -- and almost $8.5 billion of it just last year. Another $0.5 billion in the first quarter this year. So our debt -- everybody watches net debt-to-EBITDA ratio. We're down to about 2x right now from what was, I think, about 4.3 when we completed the second of the 2 acquisitions. That's a pretty rapid paydown. We expect to be about 1.5x by year-end. So I think I could declare strategic flexibility achieved. Obviously, we want to keep paying down the debt. We've got nice, strong cash flow. We've got a number of choices. We increased the dividend, as you know, back in December by 14%. And we tend to target that dividend at around 40% to 45% of EPS. And I think right now, we're at 40%, something like that. EPS is growing pretty rapidly, so probably be adjusting at some point. But the -- there's good times and bad times to purchase shares, as you know. And our share repurchases, we haven't done a lot of share repurchasing. We've done some primarily just to offset dilution, but that has not been a big consumer of capital. 
We have made significant investments internally in our growth with Alinity expansion and with the Libre capacity expansion. And again, while those are important users of our capital with high return, we still have pretty strong cash flow. So back to the point of your question, we have strategic flexibility. We have strong cash flow. We have choice. The -- I think the question is whether or not at any point there's something out there that fits us or we're particularly interested in or that we're focused on, et cetera. And as you know, I've told you in the past, even if I have that, I wouldn't tell you, that would be true. I would say today, what is also true is we are very much focused on our internal organic execution, and that's getting sort of 95% of our attention. We're not paying attention to other opportunities. We always are tracking and monitoring other opportunities. But I have to tell you right now, I don't see a very robust target-rich environment out there. It's not target-rich. I don't think it is anyway. And I don't see a lot of meaningful adjunctive things that necessarily fit what we're trying to do. 
So obviously, as we move forward here, one of our challenges is going to be capital deployment because we're going to have a lot of it. And I think we're going to generate a lot of cash over the coming years. I think we're going to generate a lot of profit. And we obviously want to either invest at or return it to shareholders at the highest possible return. And if it means there's opportunities in M&A, as you know, historically, we've always been pretty attentive and diligent about that. I wouldn't forecast it when or what. We -- but we are out of the range where we're constrained about our choices. We are no longer constrained. And I think that's a positive. We've gotten there pretty quickly. And that means that we can consider whatever. We don't happen to be focused on M&A right now, but M&A isn't a steady every year thing. It's opportunistic when it fits the strategy and the intent of the company and when an opportunity fits and a return can be earned. And so if something like that comes along, I'd say we're well positioned. We'd be ready to do something. But to be honest, we haven't seen something that attractive."

You kind of answered it at the end of your question there when you said it's not my style. I rarely, if ever, raise in a first quarter. I kind of feel like if I raised in the first quarter, why didn't I put it in the original plan 3 months ago or 6 months ago? But I have generally waited to consider such a thing in the mid-year because at various points in time, well, there's been a number of times we've all been burned by exchange around April, May, June or something for the remainder of the year. I don't actually expect that this year. I'm no forecaster of exchange and we're not currency traders, as you know. But just based on what we all see, we were all -- like all industries, all companies, all multinationals and so forth, we were all cautious about China trade and exchange and volatility, the price of oil, even Brexit. These were sort of the big factors everybody talked about. Oil is almost $70, and I don't think Brexit is weighing on a lot of minds. It's weighing on a lot of European minds, it's weighing on a lot of U.K. minds and it depends on how much business you got tied up in the U.K. But companies have had time to figure out how to mitigate a lot of these things and deal with them. So I'd say the reason that we didn't look at raising in the first quarter is because I just don't raise in the first quarter.
We're obviously off to a strong start. As I told you before, all of our growth story is solid and intact, not seeing any -- gosh, I feel like I should knock on wood. I'm not seeing any threats to the growth vehicles in the business. And while some analysts have speculated that med tech or med devices is somewhat slowing, I'd tell you, I don't see that. And I don't think a lot of other CEOs in medical devices are seeing it either. In fact, if anything, I see projected growth rates rising across competitors. I take that as a very healthy signal from the industry that people are seeing positive, robust opportunity. I think a lot of people have new products and robust pipelines. And I think that's healthy for the whole sector worldwide. There's a lot of things that haven't changed, but we've been navigating those kinds of things for a while and doing well as an industry and as a company.
So could we have raised in the first quarter? Well, a lot of you may think so. I'm a little more cautious than that. I always kind of wait until the midyear so -- to kind of assess things. I like how the company is performing. I think the company is performing really well. I'm not sure we've ever had such healthy pipeline so broadly across the line in the company. So I don't have any negatives. I'm just thinking that one quarter into the year seems a little early to me. That's about as much as I can tell, that's a honest answer."

There are other improvements that we can make in the product. All of that is in development. We know this platform well. It is a platform. It is not just a glucose test kit. And so there's, I guess, what I'll call an R&D development innovation strategy with it that is underway, has been underway. Our capacity expansion plans are well planned. We've already got almost 1.5 million users of Libre. And to be honest, we haven't exactly let the floodgates go. So I think you can kind of back into the math of that. This product is already great.

Before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2019. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A, risk factors, to our annual report on Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments except as required by law. Please note that second quarter financial results and guidance provided on the call today for sales, EPS and line items of the P&L will be for continuing operations only.
On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com. Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth, which is defined in our earnings news release issued earlier today.
With that, I will now turn the call over to miles."
247483,622961692,1772336,"Abbott Laboratories, Q2 2019 Earnings Call, Jul 17, 2019",2019-07-17,"Earnings Calls","Abbott Laboratories","Executives","Thank you, Scott. Good morning. Today, we reported results of another strong quarter with ongoing earnings per share of $0.82, above our previous guidance range and reflecting double-digit growth. Sales increased 7.5% on an organic basis in the quarter wi",803,"Thank you, Scott. Good morning. Today, we reported results of another strong quarter with ongoing earnings per share of $0.82, above our previous guidance range and reflecting double-digit growth. Sales increased 7.5% on an organic basis in the quarter with all 4 businesses exceeding expectations. 
I'm particularly pleased with our ability to consistently achieve these types of strong results. Over the past 2 years, our quarterly organic sales growth averaged more than 7% and importantly, we're well-positioned with our portfolio and new product pipeline for this type of strong growth going forward. 
Based on our performance and momentum in the first half of the year, we're raising our full year outlook, and we now forecast adjusted earnings per share of $3.21 to $3.27, reflecting nearly 13% growth at the midpoint on a reported basis and even faster growth when excluding the impact of foreign exchange. While we achieved broad-based growth across several areas of our portfolio, I'd like to highlight just a few areas where we continued to perform exceptionally well. I'll start our Medical Devices business with FreeStyle Libre, where we achieved sales of $430 million and continued to add significantly to our global user base as reflected by our organic sales growth of more than 70% in the quarter. We also continued to make excellent progress expanding reimbursement and access in the U.S. where libre is now reimbursed for approximately 75% of people with private pharmacy benefit insurance. Libre offers a unique value proposition. and as by design, it provides great clinical benefits, and we priced it to ensure affordability. There's recognize that value -- that recognize that value and are increasingly providing reimbursement coverage for Libre, which also lower out-of-pocket costs even further for patients. 
As I mentioned before, we've been investing significantly to expand our manufacturing capacity for Libre to meet demand. The first wave of that expansion will come online in the next couple of months followed by a cadence of incremental capacity after that. There's a massive population that needs help managing our diabetes, and our intent is to make Libre broadly accessible to all of them. 
Turning to our Structural Heart business, where we achieved mid-teens growth. This was led by MitraClip, our market-leading device for the treatment of mitral regurgitation, which had global sales growth of more than 30% in the quarter. And MitraClip grew more than 50% in the U.S., where we recently received a new expanded indication. 
Earlier this week, we announced U.S. approval of our fourth generation MitraClip device, which builds on this leading platform with enhanced features and new clip sizes, providing physicians further options when treating disease. We've been building our position in Structural Heart for more than a decade and have a deep pipeline of technologies and development, including Tendyne and Safia, which are minimally invasive devices to replace faulty mitral heart valves. Triclip, a first of its kind device for the repair of a leaky tricuspid heart valve, and [indiscernible] amulet, our left atrial appendage device to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. With the rapid adoption of MitraClip in a highly underpenetrated market as well as a pipeline of technologies targeting new growth areas that will launch over the next several years, our Structural Heart business is well positioned for strong, steady growth for years to come.
Next, diagnostics, where we remain focused on a global rollout of our Alinity suite of instruments for every area of diagnostics in which we compete. We're making great progress with our systems for immunoassay in clinical chemistry testing in Europe where the launch of Alinity is helping to drive double-digit growth in our international core laboratory business. We're now also in early stages of launching Alinity instruments for hematology and molecular testing in Europe. 
In the U.S., we're making steady progress achieving regulatory approvals for our broad menu of core laboratory tests. And just last week, we announced FDA approval of Alinity S for blood and plasma screen. Abbott screens the majority of the world's blood supply, and this system is designed to be faster and more efficient within a smaller amount of space while maintaining the highest levels of accuracy. The global rollout of Alinity is an ambitious undertaking that positions our Diagnostics business for sustainable, strong growth going forward.
So in summary, all 4 of our businesses exceeded expectations in the quarter. Our growth is strong, it's accelerating and it's sustainable. We've strategically positioned ourselves in some of the most attractive areas of health care and our key growth platforms are delivering impressive results. And today, we're adding to what was already a strong growth forecast by raising our outlook for the year. I'll now turn the call over to Brian to discuss our results and outlook for the year in more detail. Brian?"
247483,622961692,1772336,"Abbott Laboratories, Q2 2019 Earnings Call, Jul 17, 2019",2019-07-17,"Earnings Calls","Abbott Laboratories","Executives","Okay. Thanks, Miles. As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis, which is consistent with our previous guidance.Turning to our results. Sales for the second quarter",570,"Okay. Thanks, Miles. As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis, which is consistent with our previous guidance.
Turning to our results. Sales for the second quarter increased 7.5%. Sales in medical devices grew 10.5% with double-digit growth in Electrophysiology, Heart Failure, Structural Heart and Diabetes Care. In Nutrition, sales increased 5.1%, led by a strong growth in adult nutrition. Sales in Established Pharmaceuticals grew 6.1% with 8% growth in our key emerging markets. And sales increased 6.2% in diagnostics, led by high single-digit growth in Core Laboratory Diagnostics and sequential improvements in point-of-care and Rapid Diagnostics.
Exchange had an unbearable impact on total Abbott sales of 4.6%, which was approximately 0.5% more unfavorable to our expectations at the time of our earnings call in April. Regarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 59.4% of sales. Adjusted R&D investment was 7.1% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense was 29.9% of sales.
The second quarter adjusted tax rate was 13.7%, lower than our previous full year guidance of around 15%, due entirely to continued implementation of and adaptation to the U.S. tax reform regulations. Our second quarter tax rate reflects the aggregate adjustment to align our tax rate for the first half of 2019 with our revised full year effective tax rate forecast of 14.5%.
Turning to our outlook for the full year. We now forecast organic sales growth of 7% to 8%. Based on current rates, we would expect exchange to have a negative impact of approximately 3% on our full year reported sales, which is in line with the expected impact we had at the beginning of the year. We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of a little less than 59.5% of sales for the full year. This is modestly lower than our prior forecast and reflects the temporary effects of investments to support the unprecedented ramp up and market adoption of our Alinity diagnostic systems as well as investments in Libre capacity expansion. 
We forecast adjusted R&D investment of somewhat less than 7.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of around 29.5% of sales. And as I mentioned previously, we forecasted adjusted tax rate of around 14.5% for the full year 2019.
Turning to our outlook for the third quarter, we forecast adjusted EPS of $0.83 to $0.85, which reflects strong double-digit growth. We forecast organic sales growth of 7% to 8%. And at current rates, we would expect exchange to have a negative impact of around 1.5% on our third quarter reported sales. We forecasted adjusted gross margin ratio of a little less than 59.5% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of around 7.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of around 29% of sales. 
Before we open the call for questions, I'll now provide a quick overview of our third quarter organic sales growth outlook by business. For Established Pharmaceuticals, we forecast mid- to high single digit growth. In Nutrition, we forecast a mid-single-digit growth. In Diagnostics, we forecast Abbott's legacy diagnostics businesses, which is comprised of core laboratory, molecular and point-of-care to grow high single digits. And in Rapid Diagnostics, we forecast low to mid-single-digit growth. And finally, in Medical Devices, we forecast high single-digit growth, which reflects continued double-digit growth in several areas of this business. 
With that, we'll now open the call up for questions."

We are seeing strength in our growth drivers. We've got of launches going on in all segments across the board. We're going to be opening up the capacity, new manufacturing and so forth to supplement Libre.",422,"Well, I think, first of all, about the guidance. We are seeing strength in our growth drivers. We've got of launches going on in all segments across the board. We're going to be opening up the capacity, new manufacturing and so forth to supplement Libre. The Alinity systems are obviously successfully rolling out. MitraClip is picking up momentum. A lot of the businesses that I've been sort of chronically dissatisfied with from time to time have also in sequential improvement, which I'm happy to see. I'm never quite satisfied with that. But the pharmaceutical business, the cardiac rhythm management business, the stent business, neuromodulation, the point-of-care diagnostics business, the Rapid Diagnostics business, which is primarily the acquisition, they're all showing sequential sales growth improvement, which is what we planned, what we've worked for, et cetera. So based on the strength across the board of all of that, we felt comfortable that, frankly, our growth rate on the top line going forward, we sort of see in that 7% to 8% range. And I challenge, is this temporary for the quarter, for the half year thing or do we feel fairly sustainable about this and we feel sustainable about it. 
So I think that's all good. And then as a record earnings, there's a step up in earnings here in the second half, earnings growth rate. And it's just an unusual quarter. I mean we always target, as you know, at the beginning of the year, double-digit growth. We always had kind of an aggressive or at least ambitious target for ourselves going into the next year. That's no different now. So in the second half, our earnings remains strong. I don't know -- I'm kind of -- I feel pretty good that we do the numbers we say and we never fall short. So it's 18% on the bottom line right now. So you're asking me about what we do week to get to the high end of the range. I'm thinking, geez, isn't that good enough? It's a pretty healthy growth rate. So 7% to 8% on the top and high double-digit teens on the bottom I think is probably best-in-class in the peer group that we're compared to and several different peer groups that we're compared to. And quite frankly, with the breadth of products launching and rollouts, obviously, there's always challenges somewhere in the world in some way. But we seem to be doing pretty well across-the-board here in all areas. and I think that's a pretty good investment."

But majority of that growth coming to increased utilization. So we continued to invest in clinical and field sales expansion. And when you do this, they had this direct impact in account utilization and productivity. International was up also double digits in the quarter. You've got Japan, where we believe is a significant opportunity for us long term there. We are building our capabilities in Japan. And Europe saw a rebound in Q2 versus where we were in Q1. I think the [indiscernible] into that, the clinical and medical teams have done a really good job that putting into context and framing some of those conflicting trials that came out in the second half of the year. So we think there's a lot of sustainability here not only in the U.S. I mean our penetration rates here in terms of the opportunity is still kind of low single-digits. So we've got a lot of run away here. Regarding your question on CMS, I mean there's obviously a lot of coordination that's been going on between CMS and the physician societies. We expect the NCD to be open a very soon as part of that coordination. As I say, we're not going to forecast an exact timeline here, but we anticipate getting through the process around year-end early next year. As you said, the process here hasn't really kind of impeded our growth. 
We have seen a dozen or so flight of commericial insurance companies already reflect updates to their decision to their coverage to include the new indication. Obviously, the largest segment there is the Medicare segment, but it's good to kind to see that traction in your private segment. So very good quarter. We continue to see this expansion in the second half of the year and towards the end of the year looking at achieving the CMS reimbursement."

Well, first, you made a comment that it touches every part of diagnostics. That's true. And these are 6 different systems, the immunoassay system, the chemical system, obviously, a smaller point of core system for that market. There's a dedicated blood and plasma screening system and of course, hematology and molecular. And they're all at various stages of rollout. The one that is the furthest along would bat the rollout of our immunoassay and clinical chemistry systems in the core laboratories of Europe. We're also in the process of expanding menu approvals in the United States and China and South East Asia, where customers want to have a certain critical mass of menu as they make the conversion from whatever they're using to these new Alinity systems. So I'd say we're running as fast as we can, I think, at this point in Europe, and that's going pretty well. There's over 3,000 systems placed now running test, generating revenue, et cetera. We do measure not just the deal, the close of a deal, et cetera. We measure what was called test of record when the account is up and running, generating results, generating tests, et cetera. 
And so I'd say that process is going well. That's going to begin to pick up more momentum in the United States as we're getting more and more menu breath. Same with China. We're tracking all of that pretty closely as we build those menus. We're talking hundreds of tests. We did recently get approval for the Alinity as the blood plasma screening system. Today, we screen about 80% of the world's blood supply as it is. This is -- it's an important transition product that labs I think will find more efficient, more economic, et cetera. But that's a plus. 
We closed and started out the Japanese Red Cross, which is the largest Japanese blood screening organization. And we took that from a long-standing Japanese competitor. So that was a big win for us. So there's just a lot of success that way. 
Hematology's in the very early stages of rolling out. The Molecular system in the earlier stage of rolling out. And which is why this will be, I guess, a slower moving launch that's got sort of years of growth and momentum in it as we look over the next, call it, 5 to 7 years to completely replace an existing install base and add a lot of new share and new volume. And to that end, I think we quoted you before. It remains true. In accounts where we already have the business, we're winning about 95% of the time. And in accounts where we do not have the business and there's an entrenched competitor of ours, we're winning about 60% of the time. Now those win rates and penetration rates and share gains and so forth in our experience so far over now what I said over 3,000 instruments, tell us that we've got a very competitive system. We do run into, on the occasional accounts, a heavy-duty price cutting. We've got a very disciplined system. Our pricing and contracting in accounts, we have not had to do that. I think that speaks to the superiority of the instrument and assay offering. So we're feeling like our offering is uniquely competitive. It's born out by the win rates no matter what type of accounts. It's unprecedented to launch this many systems across-the-board in all areas. So I think there's only fixed up momentum gets better as the assay menu expands and as there's some experience in the field with the analyzers."

I can tell you he's not playing golf. We -- I'll say a couple of things. First of all, we anticipated that for the time being, we wanted him to stay directly on top of the medical device business because he's been responsible for the bringing on board St. Jude as we acquire that, he was integral to that entire integration. We went through with St. Jude, a reorganization of the business to align with the way we like to run a business at Abbott. And I guess I would describe that as we like to have a fully integrated business. Meaning, the General Manager of that business, President of that business has responsibility for our commercial -- the commercial people, commercial sales of the customers, et cetera, but also manufacturing, R&D, technical support, service, et cetera. We like all those functions reporting into one GM. 
So we realigned St. Jude. We did the same with Alere, quite frankly, when we took them over. And so each of the business has full integrated general management responsibility, and that was a transition. And Robert led that. It's all in place. That meant that we added a number of experienced general managers. We replaced some who had left us as part of this St. Jude or Alere acquisitions and so forth. So we went through a management transition. And at the same time, there's been a little bit of a generational change happening here. Quite certainly, there's been an awful lot of people that has been part of my management team for a long time and a lot of our managers are long-term Abbott groomed and grown management team. But we've also been thinking about making sure that with all the growth we've got, the new products, the new organization, the new structure of that organization that we're always looking at the talent and experience of our management team as we look forward now toward, let's just call it, a decade of what I think is going to be pretty robust growth. 
So in that, we needed to replace the EVP role that Robert has held previous to his Chief Operating Officer role. We did that. We went outside for that and of course, sourced Lisa, who we think has terrific background and experience for that. We're very pleased to have brought fresh perspective and great experience and great energy level into the company. So we're very pleased with that. 
We went through a little further, I'd say, organization changed kind of break up what have gotten big and perhaps really, in some cases, into slightly smaller units because we are managing some pretty aggressive growth capital improvement, plant building, et cetera, in a number of these businesses, including diagnostics. And to give us more focused around it, we've done some of that adjusting. 
I feel like that's gone very smoothly and very well. Obviously, we read into Robert was in his mid-40s, moving up into the COO role, that we expect them to be in a key leadership role at the company for a long time. Read between the lines. 
And so there's a preparation process going on. And I think one of the most important things I can do after leaving the company for so long is to make sure that when a transition comes, nobody notices. And the best legacy to leave is that the momentum of this company, its growth and its prospects are every bit as good going forward as we think they are now. And from my perspective, a smooth leadership transition, which is not just me, it's literally right down to the upper ranks of all management, is key and important. And I feel like of all of the sort of track record of legacies that I can give this company, I think a transition that way is probably the most important of all. 
So you can read into it, that we're preparing for continuity of leadership, what I would call it, with no speed bumps. And I think that actually is going exceptionally well. Will I give you timeframe? No. Do I think we should be nervous about it? No. I think that this company is so poised to perform well across-the-board for years to come that I've got great confidence in that continuity and the management team because we've got a nice mix here of very experienced and trained Abbott people and people we brought from other companies on the outside like Lisa. And I think the mix we got in that team is exceptional. Robert's been with the company over 20 years. I've known him every bit of those 20 plus years. And I think he brings to his job right now tremendous experience, perspective, everything you would look for in a leader and to see you over the company. So from my perspective, I think this is nothing but good and just keeps getting better."

First of all, the great thing is we've got a lot of things to invest in. From a capital standpoint, obviously, it was important for us to pay down debt, we did. We've paid down a significant amount going",795,"Okay. Well, I'll give you a couple of perspectives. First of all, the great thing is we've got a lot of things to invest in. From a capital standpoint, obviously, it was important for us to pay down debt, we did. We've paid down a significant amount going on $10 billion at this point. And as we've said before, we're in a comfortable position of strategic flexibility, but that doesn't mean we're dying to go use it. 
So the next need was, obviously, we've got some capital to put into plant and expansion. And we put a fair amount into both diagnostics and Libre at this point. We're investing in expansion of plant and manufacturing firm MitraClip and other products. So given that we've got an awful lot of growth happening and the potential for more, obviously, we've got to support that growth from a plant and capital standpoint in a timely fashion and appropriate quality and so forth, and we're doing that. And so there's capital use, et cetera, there. Will we continue to pay down debt, we will. We'll be prudent and careful about making sure it makes sense it's the right debt, right time, all that good stuff. We'll maintain a healthy, strong dividend. We increased it substantially in the last year. We'll continue to grow our dividends. Given where the PE is now, I've been told by a number of shareholders trying to get that yield rate upward dividend funds are happy as is difficult. But that's a nice problem to have. We will continue to grow our dividend. It's been a hallmark of the company for decades and it will continue to be. And then it's not always that prudent to buy back shares. The timing matters, the return matters, et cetera. Is it an option? Yes, it is. Probably won't get too carried away because, frankly, we're able to grow and return cash to shareholders a number of different ways and return good return to our shareholders. So it's always an option as it presents itself. We've just got a lot we can do. If you're asking about M&A and other things, we don't feel like right now that we need something nor do we think we see something that we can add sufficient value to make it worth investing. And we've got so many organic growth opportunities that while we continue to monitor and we're always tracking opportunities in all of our businesses, I can't tell you that that's really front burner right now. We don't ignore it. We don't -- we try to maintain our currency on the things that we might be interested in. We just did a small acquisition in Germany that's a nice injunctive thing to our Diagnostics business in terms of automation and so forth. There are things like that, that I think are valuable for us. But we have so much growth potential and opportunity in devices, diagnostics, even nutrition and pharma that we're just not real hard on the M&A front right now nor do I foresee that being true for quite a while. So that's the capital side. 
On the expense side, we're always trying to balance the voracious appetite of investors for growing earnings with investing in the growth of the business. And I doubt that there's a General Manager or business at Abbott that wouldn't claim that if we gave them more money, they could spend it effectively and efficiently to grow our products faster. So we're always trying to find the right balance of how much gas that's thrown in the fire, the growth of the products with returning a healthy return to the expectations of our investors. I think that's always a balance because there's always some investor there must be an extra $0.01 in the quarter. And I was speaking somebody this morning who asked about that very issue of another $0.01. And the issue here is much bigger than $0.01. We've got tremendous growth. Our top line were accelerating. It's strong. It's sustainable. This isn't about $0.01 in a given quarter, this is about a pretty, healthy sales growth rate and a commensurate healthy growth rate on the bottom line that's unusual in our sector and particularly unusual for companies of our size to be able to sustain such a healthy growth rate with so much new product richness for the coming years. And it's not the coming quarter, it's coming years. 
So you raise the right question, is how do we keep investing in the spending and R&D and the sales and marketing expenses to drive that growth. And we're trying to find that right balance as well by putting enough fuel to the fire here to drive the growth rates even higher"

I remember in my discussions with Dan Starck when we were renegotiating over the acquisition of St. Jude, Dan felt pretty strongly that the pipeline of St. Jude was underappreciated and that in their own internal models, that the growth rate was out there in the high single digits. The street didn't agree with that at the time because it didn't see it yet, et cetera. But Dan was right. And I think that we've seen that in the performance of the medical device business we acquired from St. Jude because it's been performing at sort of a 9% to 10% level as new products have gone to the market, either replacing older products or just simply brand new products altogether. 
So I'd say the first thing about Medical Devices is you got to keep innovating in new spaces. MitraClip new space, heart failure and heart mate and so forth, these are new spaces, new technologies, et cetera. Libre is that. Libre is unique. It approaches a mass-market, not a niche market. Most Medical Devices address niches of therapy. But diabetes is something that affects more than 80 million people around the world who would benefit from Libre in about a 50-50 split of type 1s and type 2s. And that is massive. It's unlike anything seen before in device for diagnostic businesses. So there's just an enormous, enormous opportunity there. To be honest, traditional medical device companies aren't used to having to deal with at that kind of scale. 
And so we're addressing that by investing very heavily in manufacturing expansion so that we can go after the mass market, not a niche. And so I think the sustainability of the growth is driven not only by the innovation, but the ability to go after much bigger markets at a much more affordable level. More people will have access. There will be more growth as we make technologies and products more and more affordable. 
And then, finally, you asked about some of the businesses that aren't growing that fast. And I'd say, well, I'm always disappointed that they're not going as fast as we like them to. But I am pleased that we've seen sequential improvement quarter-to-quarter in almost all of them. We've seen that in CRM, we've seen it neuro-mode. We've seen it even EPD and stents and so forth. We're seeing incremental improvement. Some of these businesses is more mature businesses may not see strong or high single-digit or double-digit growth. But I think they're still capable of pretty strong growth in the low to mid-single-digit area and there's still a lot of upside. 
If we take a CRM business from flat slightly negative to 3% or 4%, that's a pretty big bump in growth. We'd be -- it was going from 10 to 14, we'd be all excited about it. The same incremental growth improvement I think is possible. It's just at a lower level. So I think that there's a lot here to sustain the kind of growth we're seeing, is always going to be new products like Libre or MitraClip or a heart mate that singularly for a period of time, disproportionally drive the overall growth. One of the benefits of having many businesses in the device arena is there's always going to be somewhere that's growing that way and other place where we're innovating for the future."

And now, obviously, the focus is improving the productivity of that sales team. And we saw that in the second quarter. If you look at some of the KPIs, we look at whether it's trials or trial to permanent implant conversion rates, we saw definitely sequential improvement versus Q1. And we expect that to improve as we go into the second half of this year. 
A big portion of this also is, I'd say, product innovation life cycle. You've seen a couple of quarters now where there really hasn't been any kind of launch from competitors in this space. That's a key driver also. So sales force productivity and execution, we'll start to see some of our innovation out but we made double the investment in that are in the business so over the last couple of years, we'll start to see some output of that into second half of this year, beginning of next year in terms of new products that will provide, say, more for the sales team to kind of work with."

I just wouldn't have expected it 90 days later. But to answer your question, I think that kind of potential is there. I think it's awfully hard to speculate about a number that big. But we -- do I think we'll get the $5 billion and do I think we'll do it in a reasonable time. $5 billion of sales? Yes, I do. And they think it's -- the growth rate here is reflective of not only the size of the market, but the need and utility and affordability of the product. And I think it's just, as I've said many times, it's a very different market where affordability and the utility, the access, all those things make this a mess market product, not a niche. And it's designed for that, it's priced for that, it's a very profitable product. And we're going through the large scale, scale up of addressing that kind of growth, which is unprecedented for products in our space. 
So do I think it can grow to that sort of level? I won't jinx anything by trying to make some prognostication about $10 billion. But I would say that I think it's got an enormous potential. And it's got potential beyond glucose. It's got potential as a wearable in other analytes and other products over time. We have R&D programs underway not only for the repeated enhancement, improvement, expansion of Libre, but also in the other categories beyond diabetes and other analyzers and so forth. So I think that there's just a lot of things that will evolve over the coming years here that today, people weren't even contemplating with the product. We're going as hard as we can at the glucose opportunity, which is enormous. But there's so much more beyond that that I think at least to your aspirational consideration, to be honest, has validity. I'm just not ready to put any numbers around it."

Navigator, when we have launched it back in 2008, we were able to do that. It was very accurate and we were able to get an accurate reading. The challenge that we went about with Libre is how to do that in a way that is cost effective for the health systems and for consumers and for all of that. So that was what we really went after, is how can you get the accurate reading at a cost position at the core of Libre. And you might remember at the time, Navigator at a time was considered the most accurate sensor. In the core of Libre is that chemistry, is that core technology of Navigator, which provides accurate, reliable readings. But we're able to do that or the cost position that now make sense for the insurance and for the payer community in the health systems to cover it. It wasn't a question of whether the outcomes were right or whether the outcomes were enough. They were convinced that the outcomes were there for a sensor-based glucose monitoring. It was just that and I do it in a way that makes sense for me to do it on a mass scale. And Miles has talked about this miles scale. That's what we went after 10 years ago. And that's at the core. And I think maybe that's misunderstood because a lot of this discussion gets focused on, well, accuracy at this level and accuracy at that level. And the reality is accuracy is obviously important. But our goal here is to make this massively available without having to sacrifice accuracy. And the fact that we priced it at a different price point wouldn't say necessarily implied that XML missing something. We just had a difference for strategy and different view of what we can."

Ours is not expensive and it's not high cost. It does not lack for clinical performance, accuracy or any of the like. But the come to manufacturing is sold sophisticated and automated, we were able to achieve a pretty low cost in what is a pretty sophisticated product. It's a highly profitable product. So we haven't compromised that it's a product, it's successful in terms of profit. That's not been compromised at all. It is completely different design and approach and cost structure. It relies on scale for that cost. And we've actually seen the improving gross margin. 
We told you before the gross margin is over 60%. It is and rising. And that's what a heavy capital investment so that we can produce the kind of volume that is broadly available. So I think among the misunderstandings out there, I think people say, well, geez, how do you make money? Oh, we make money. We do just fine. Thank you. And the product is designed to be affordable and accessible. I guess there are some days where we think if the health care market community ensures payers, Congress, patient, whatever, I always saying is it got to be lower costs. The health care is going to be more affordable. Here's an example. And it is. It's massively so. And so we've gone at it with that approach to make it broadly available. Broadly, this case means 80 million people worldwide. That's unprecedented. 
So I'm not sure that the device community is totally understood it because it's so different. But we keep saying so. And I think now at the new capacity comes online, we've also staged in the capacity so that literally, every 90 days, we're adding another increment, significant incremental capacity. We will not be capacity constraint. And that kind of release is a lot of freedom to market and push a product forward and even open up markets we haven't opened yet. So I think there's a lot of opportunity here. And I think 2, I think there's opportunity for a number of things like this, as I mentioned earlier, in what's called the wearables market, the more affordable and accessible technologies make products like this, then I think we're going to see a very different market expansion."

Today, we reported results of another strong quarter with ongoing earnings per share of $0.82, above our previous guidance range and reflecting double-digit growth. Sales increased 7.5% on an organic basis in the quarter wi",807,"Thank you, Scott. Good morning. Today, we reported results of another strong quarter with ongoing earnings per share of $0.82, above our previous guidance range and reflecting double-digit growth. Sales increased 7.5% on an organic basis in the quarter with all 4 businesses exceeding expectations. 
I'm particularly pleased with our ability to consistently achieve these types of strong results. Over the past 2 years, our quarterly organic sales growth has averaged more than 7%. And importantly, we're well positioned with our portfolio and new product pipeline for this type of strong growth going forward. 
Based on our performance and momentum in the first half of the year, we're raising our full year outlook, and we now forecast adjusted earnings per share of $3.21 to $3.27, reflecting nearly 13% growth at the midpoint on a reported basis and even faster growth when excluding the impact of foreign exchange. 
While we achieved broad-based growth across several areas of our portfolio, I'd like to highlight just a few areas where we continue to perform exceptionally well. 
I'll start our Medical Devices business with FreeStyle Libre, where we achieved sales of $430 million and continued to add significantly to our global user base, as reflected by our organic sales growth of more than 70% in the quarter. We also continue to make excellent progress expanding reimbursement and access in the U.S., where Libre is now reimbursed for approximately 75% of people with private pharmacy benefit insurance. 
Libre offers a unique value proposition. And as by design, it provides great clinical benefits, and we priced it to ensure affordability. Peers recognize that value -- that recognize that value and are increasingly providing reimbursement coverage for Libre, which also lower out-of-pocket costs even further for patients. 
As I've mentioned before, we've been investing significantly to expand our manufacturing capacity for Libre to meet demand. The first wave of that expansion will come online in the next couple of months, followed by a cadence of incremental capacity after that. There's a massive population that needs help managing our diabetes, and our intent is to make Libre broadly accessible to all of them. 
Turning to our Structural Heart business, where we achieved mid-teens growth. This was led by MitraClip, our market-leading device for the treatment of mitral regurgitation, which had global sales growth of more than 30% in the quarter. And MitraClip grew more than 50% in the U.S., where we recently received a new expanded indication. 
Earlier this week, we announced U.S. approval of our fourth generation MitraClip device, which builds on this leading platform with enhanced features and new clip sizes, providing physicians further options when treating a disease. We've been building our position in Structural Heart for more than a decade and have a deep pipeline of technologies and development, including Tendyne and Cephea, which are minimally invasive devices to replace faulty mitral heart valves. 
TriClip, a first of its kind device for the repair of a leaky tricuspid heart valve; and AMPLATZER Amulet, our left atrial appendage device, to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. With the rapid adoption of MitraClip in a highly underpenetrated market as well as a pipeline of technologies targeting new growth areas that will launch over the next several years, our Structural Heart business is well positioned for strong, steady growth for years to come.
Next, Diagnostics, where we remain focused on the global rollout of our Alinity suite of instruments for every area of diagnostics in which we compete. We're making great progress with our systems for immunoassay in clinical chemistry testing in Europe, where the launch of Alinity is helping to drive double-digit growth in our international core laboratory business. We're now also in the early stages of launching Alinity instruments for hematology and molecular testing in Europe. 
In the U.S., we're making steady progress achieving regulatory approvals for our broad menu of core laboratory tests. And just last week, we announced FDA approval of Alinity s for blood and plasma screen. 
Abbott screens the majority of the world's blood supply, and this system is designed to be faster and more efficient within a smaller amount of space while maintaining the highest levels of accuracy. The global rollout of Alinity is an ambitious undertaking that positions our Diagnostics business for sustainable, strong growth going forward.
So in summary, all 4 of our businesses exceeded expectations in the quarter. Our growth is strong, it's accelerating and it's sustainable. We've strategically positioned ourselves in some of the most attractive areas of health care, and our key growth platforms are delivering impressive results. And today, we're adding to what was already a strong growth forecast by raising our outlook for the year. I'll now turn the call over to Brian to discuss our results and outlook for the year in more detail. Brian?"

As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis, which is consistent with our previous guidance.Turning to our results. Sales for the second quarter",570,"Okay. Thanks, Miles. As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis, which is consistent with our previous guidance.
Turning to our results. Sales for the second quarter increased 7.5%. Sales in medical devices grew 10.5% with double-digit growth in Electrophysiology, Heart Failure, Structural Heart and Diabetes Care. In Nutrition, sales increased 5.1%, led by a strong growth in Adult Nutrition. Sales in Established Pharmaceuticals grew 6.1% with 8% growth in our key emerging markets. And sales increased 6.2% in Diagnostics, led by high single-digit growth in Core Laboratory Diagnostics and sequential improvements in point-of-care and Rapid Diagnostics.
Exchange had an unbearable impact on total Abbott sales of 4.6%, which was approximately 0.5% more unfavorable to our expectations at the time of our earnings call in April. Regarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 59.4% of sales. Adjusted R&D investment was 7.1% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense was 29.9% of sales.
The second quarter adjusted tax rate was 13.7%, lower than our previous full year guidance of around 15%, due entirely to continued implementation of and adaptation to the U.S. tax reform regulations. Our second quarter tax rate reflects the aggregate adjustment to align our tax rate for the first half of 2019 with our revised full year effective tax rate forecast of 14.5%.
Turning to our outlook for the full year. We now forecast organic sales growth of 7% to 8%. Based on current rates, we would expect exchange to have a negative impact of approximately 3% on our full year reported sales, which is in line with the expected impact we had at the beginning of the year. We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of a little less than 59.5% of sales for the full year. This is modestly lower than our prior forecast and reflects the temporary effect of investments to support the unprecedented ramp-up and market adoption of our Alinity diagnostics systems as well as investments in Libre capacity expansion. 
We forecast adjusted R&D investment of somewhat less than 7.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of around 29.5% of sales. And as I mentioned previously, we forecasted an adjusted tax rate of around 14.5% for the full year 2019.
Turning to our outlook for the third quarter, we forecast adjusted EPS of $0.83 to $0.85, which reflects strong double-digit growth. We forecast organic sales growth of 7% to 8%, and, at current rates, we would expect exchange to have a negative impact of around 1.5% on our third quarter reported sales. We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of a little less than 59.5% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of around 7.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of around 29% of sales. 
Before we open the call for questions, I'll now provide a quick overview of our third quarter organic sales growth outlook by business. For Established Pharmaceuticals, we forecast mid- to high single digit growth. In Nutrition, we forecast mid-single-digit growth. In Diagnostics, we forecast Abbott's legacy diagnostics businesses, which is comprised of core laboratory, molecular and point-of-care to grow high single digits. And in Rapid Diagnostics, we forecast low to mid-single-digit growth. And finally, in Medical Devices, we forecast high single-digit growth, which reflects continued double-digit growth in several areas of this business. 
With that, we'll now open the call up for questions."

We've got a lot of launches going on in all segments across the board. We're going to be opening up the capacity, new manufacturing and so forth to supplement Libre. The Alinity systems are obviously successfully rolling out. MitraClip is picking up momentum. A lot of the businesses that I've been sort of chronically dissatisfied with from time to time have also in sequential improvement, which I'm happy to see. I'm never quite satisfied with that. But the pharmaceutical business, the cardiac rhythm management business, the stent business, neuromodulation, the point-of-care Diagnostics business, the Rapid Diagnostics business, which is primarily the Alere acquisition, they're all showing sequential sales growth improvement, which is what we've planned, what we've worked for, et cetera. So based on the strength across the board of all of that, we felt comfortable that, frankly, our growth rate on the top line going forward, we sort of see in that 7% to 8% range. And I challenged the team. I said, is this temporary for the quarter or for the half year thing? Or do we feel fairly sustainable about this? And we feel sustainable about it. 
So I think that's all good. And then with record earnings, there's a step-up in earnings here in the second half, earnings growth rate. And it's just an unusual quarter. I mean, we always target, as you know, at the beginning of the year, double-digit growth. We always had kind of an aggressive or at least ambitious target for ourselves going into the next year. That's no different now. So in the second half, our earnings remains strong. I don't know, I'm kind of -- I feel pretty good if we do the numbers we say and we never fall short. So it's 18% on the bottom line right now. So you're asking me about what we do to get to the high end of the range? I'm thinking, geez, isn't that good enough? It's a pretty healthy growth rate. So 7% to 8% on the top and high double digit teens on the bottom, I think, is probably best-in-class in the peer group that we're compared to and several different peer groups that we're compared to. And quite frankly, with the breadth of products launching and rollouts, obviously, there's always challenges somewhere in the world in some way, but we seem to be doing pretty well across the board here in all areas, and I think that's a pretty good investment."

So we obviously were constantly doing market development, opening new accounts, but a majority of that growth coming through increased utilization. So we've continued to invest in clinical and field sales expansion. And when you do this, they have this direct impact in account utilization and productivity. International was up also double digits in the quarter. You've got Japan, where we believe is a significant opportunity for us long term there. We're building our capabilities in Japan. And Europe saw a rebound in Q2 versus where we were in Q1. I think the teams there, the clinical and medical teams have done a really good job at putting into context and framing some of those conflicting trials that came out in the second half of the year. 
So we think there's a lot of sustainability here not only in the U.S. I mean, our penetration rates here, in terms of the opportunity, are still kind of low single digits. So we've got a lot of runway here. Regarding to your question on CMS, I mean, there's obviously a lot of coordination that's been going on between CMS and the physician societies. We expect the NCD to be opened up a very soon as part of that coordination. As I say, we're not going to forecast an exact timeline here, but we anticipate getting through the process around year-end early next year. But as you said, the process here hasn't really kind of impeded our growth. 
We have seen a dozen or so flight of commericial insurance companies already reflect updates to their decision to their coverage to include the new indication. Obviously, the larger segment there is the Medicare segment, but it's good to kind to see that traction in the private segment. So very good quarter. We continue to see this expansion in the second half of the year and towards the end of the year looking at achieving the CMS reimbursement."

Well, first, you made a comment that it touches every part of diagnostics. That's true. And these are 6 different systems, the immunoassay system, the clinical chemistry system, obviously a smaller point-of-core system for that market. There's a dedicated blood and plasma screening system, and then, of course, hematology and molecular. And they're all at various stages of rollout. The one that is the furthest along would be the rollout of our immunoassay and clinical chemistry systems in the core laboratories of Europe. We're also in the process of expanding menu approvals in the United States and China and Southeast Asia, where customers want to have a certain critical mass of menu as they make the conversion from whatever they're using to these new Alinity systems. 
So I'd say we're running as fast as we can, I think, at this point, in Europe, and that's going pretty well. There's over 3,000 systems placed now running test, generating revenue, et cetera. We do measure not just the deal, the close of a deal, et cetera. We measure what was called test of record when the account is up and running, generating results, generating tests, et cetera. 
And so I'd say that process is going well. That's going to begin to pick up more momentum in the United States as we're getting more and more menu breadth. Same with China. We're tracking all of that pretty closely as we build those menus. We're talking hundreds of tests. We did recently get approval for the Alinity as the blood and plasma screening system. Today, we screen about 80% of the world's blood supply as it is. This is -- it's an important transition product that labs, I think, will find more efficient, more economic, et cetera, but that's a plus. 
We closed and started up the Japanese Red Cross, which is the largest Japanese blood screening organization, and we took that from a long-standing Japanese competitor. So that was a big win for us. So there's just a lot of success that way. 
Hematology's in the very early stages of rolling out, the molecular system in the earliest stage of rolling out. And which is why this will be, I guess, a slower moving launch that's got sort of years of growth and momentum in it as we look over the next, call it, 5 to 7 years to completely replace an existing installed base and add a lot of new share and new volume. And to that end, I think we've quoted you before, that remains true. In accounts where we already have the business, we're winning about 95% of the time. And in accounts where we do not have the business, and there's an entrenched competitor of ours, we're winning about 60% of the time. Those win rates and penetration rates and share gains and so forth in our experience so far, over now what I said is over 3,000 instruments, tell us that we've got a very competitive system. We do run into, under the occasional accounts, a heavy-duty price-cutting. 
We've got a very disciplined system. Our pricing and contracting in accounts, we have not had to do that. I think that speaks to the superiority of the instrument and assay offering. So we're feeling like our offering is uniquely competitive. It's borne out by the win rates no matter what type of account. It's unprecedented to launch these many systems across-the-board in all areas. So I think there's only fixed up momentum gets better as the assay menu expands and as there's some experience in the field with the analyzers."

Well, I can tell you he's not playing golf. We -- I'd say a couple of things. First of all, we anticipated that for the time being, we wanted him to stay directly on top of the medical device business because he's been responsible for the bringing onboard St. Jude. As we acquired that, he was integral to that entire integration. We went through, with St. Jude, a reorganization of the business to align with the way we like to run a business at Abbott. And I guess I would describe that as we like to have a fully integrated business, meaning the general manager of that business, president of that business has responsibility for our commercial -- the commercial people, commercial sales of the customers, et cetera, but also manufacturing, R&D, technical support, service, et cetera. We like all those functions reporting into one GM. 
And so we realigned St. Jude. We did the same with Alere, quite frankly, when we took them over. And so each of the business has full integrated general management responsibility. And that was a transition, and Robert led that. It's all in place. That meant that we added a number of experienced general managers. We replaced some who had left us as part of this St. Jude or Alere acquisitions and so forth. So we went through a management transition. And at the same time, there's been a little bit of a generational change happening here. Quite certainly, there's been an awful lot of people that has been part of my management team for a long time. And a lot of our managers are long-term Abbott groomed and grown management team, but we've also been thinking about making sure that with all the growth we've got, the new products, the new organization, the new structure of that organization that we're always looking at the talent and the experience of our management team as we look forward now toward, let's just call it, a decade of what I think is going to be pretty robust growth. 
So in that, we needed to replace the EVP role that Robert has held previous to his Chief Operating Officer role. We did that. We went outside for that and, of course, sourced Lisa, who we think has terrific background and experience for that. We're very pleased to have brought fresh perspective and great experience and great energy level into the company. So we're very pleased with that. 
We went through a little further, I'd say, organization change to kind of break up what had gotten big and perhaps really, in some cases, into slightly smaller units because we are managing some pretty aggressive growth capital improvement, plant building, et cetera, in a number of these businesses, including diagnostics. And to give us more focus around it, we've done some of that adjusting. 
I feel like that's gone very smoothly and very well. Obviously, we read into Robert was in his mid-40s, moving up into the COO role, that we expect him to be in a key leadership role at the company for a long time. Read between the lines. 
And so there's a preparation process going on. And I think one of the most important things I can do, after leading the company for so long, is to make sure that when a transition comes, nobody notices. And the best legacy to leave is at the momentum of this company. Its growth and its prospects are every bit as good going forward as we think they are now and, from my perspective, a smooth leadership transition, which is not just me, it's literally right down through the upper ranks of all management is key and important. And I feel like of all of the sort of track record of legacies that I can give this company, I think a transition that way is probably the most important of all. 
So you can read into it that we're preparing for continuity of leadership, what I would call it, with no speed bumps. And I think that actually is going exceptionally well. Will I give you a time frame? No. Do I think we should be nervous about it? No. I think that this company is so poised to perform well across the board for years to come that I've got great confidence in that continuity and the management team because we've got a nice mix here of very experienced and trained Abbott people and people we've brought from other companies on the outside like Lisa. And I think the mix we've got in that team is exceptional. Robert's been with the company over 20 years. I've known him every bit of those 20-plus years, and I think he brings to his job right now tremendous experience, perspective, everything you would look for in a leader as a COO of the company. So from my perspective, I think this is nothing but good and just keeps getting better."

First of all, the great thing is we've got a lot of things to invest in. From a capital standpoint, obviously, it was important for us to pay down debt. We did. We've paid down a significant amount going",809,"Okay. Well, I'd give you a couple of perspectives. First of all, the great thing is we've got a lot of things to invest in. From a capital standpoint, obviously, it was important for us to pay down debt. We did. We've paid down a significant amount going on $10 billion at this point. And as we've said before, we're in a comfortable position of strategic flexibility, but that doesn't mean we're dying to go use it. 
So the next need was, obviously, we've got some capital to put into plant and expansion, and we've put a fair amount into both Diagnostics and Libre at this point. We're investing in expansion of plant and manufacturing from MitraClip and other products. So given that we've got an awful lot of growth happening and the potential for more, obviously, we've got to support that growth from a plant and capital standpoint in a timely fashion and appropriate quality and so forth, and we're doing that. And so there's capital use, et cetera, there. Will we continue to pay down debt? We will. We'll be prudent and careful about making sure it makes sense it's the right debt, right time and all that good stuff. 
We'll maintain a healthy, strong dividend. We increased it substantially in the last year. We'll continue to grow our dividend. Given where the PE is now, I've been told by a number of shareholders that trying to get that yield rate upward dividend funds are happy as is difficult, but that's a nice problem to have. We will continue to grow our dividend. It's been a hallmark of the company for decades, and it will continue to be. And then it's not always that prudent to buy back shares. The timing matters, the return matters, et cetera. Is it an option? Yes, it is. I probably won't get too carried away because, frankly, we're able to grow and return cash to shareholders a number of different ways and return good return to our shareholders. So it's always an option as it presents itself. We've just got a lot we can do. If you're asking about M&A and other things, we don't feel like right now that we need something, nor do we think we see something that we can add sufficient value to, to make it worth it to investing. And we've got so many organic growth opportunities that, while we continue to monitor and we're always tracking opportunities in all of our businesses, I can't tell you that that's real front-burner right now. We don't ignore it. We don't -- we try to maintain our currency on the things that we might be interested in. We just did a small acquisition in Germany. That's a nice adjunctive thing to our Diagnostics business in terms of automation and so forth. There are things like that, that I think are valuable for us. But we have so much growth potential and opportunity in devices, diagnostics, even nutrition and pharma that we're just not out cut and real hard on the M&A front right now, nor do I foresee that being true for quite a while. So that's the capital side. 
On the expense side, we're always trying to balance the voracious appetite of investors for growing earnings with investing in the growth of the business. And I doubt that there's a general manager or business at Abbott that wouldn't claim that if we gave them more money, they could spend it effectively and efficiently to grow our products faster. So we're always trying to find the right balance of how much gas that's thrown in the fire or the growth of the products with returning a healthy return to the expectations of our investors. I think that's always a balance because there's always some investor who thinks there must be an extra $0.01 in the quarter. And I was speaking to somebody this morning who asked about that very issue of another $0.01. And I said, ""The issue here is much bigger than $0.01."" We've got tremendous growth. Our top line were accelerating. It's strong. It's sustainable. This isn't about $0.01 in a given quarter, this is about a pretty, healthy sales growth rate and a commensurate healthy growth rate on the bottom line that's unusual in our sector and particularly unusual for companies of our size to be able to sustain such a healthy growth rate with so much new product richness for the coming years. And it's not a coming quarter, it's coming years. 
So you raised the right question, is how do we keep investing in the spending in R&D and the sales and marketing expenses to drive that growth? And we're trying to find that right balance as well by putting enough fuel to the fire here to drive the growth rates even higher"

How do you just think about the ability to sustain that level of growth? It seems that Medical Devices has a bit of a tale of 2 cities with several businesses reporting really nice, strong double-digit growth, but a couple of obvious businesses costs still lagging around that flattish growth. How do you kind of think about the longer-term dynamic there?"
247483,622961692,1772368,"Abbott Laboratories, Q2 2019 Earnings Call, Jul 17, 2019",2019-07-17,"Earnings Calls","Abbott Laboratories","Executives","Yes. You've got a mix of business this year. You've got some that are a little mature than others, some that have brand new products that are perfect innovations. In general, in Medical Devices, innovation is what drives the growth. And over time, that's",639,"Yes. You've got a mix of business this year. You've got some that are a little mature than others, some that have brand new products that are perfect innovations. In general, in Medical Devices, innovation is what drives the growth. And over time, that's the case. And different businesses are at different stages of either maturity or new innovation. We believe there's still a lot of opportunity there. 
I remember in my discussions with Dan Starks when we were renegotiating over the acquisition of St. Jude, Dan felt pretty strongly that the pipeline of St. Jude was underappreciated and, that in their own internal models, that the growth rate was out there in the high single digits. The Street didn't agree with that at the time because it didn't see it yet, et cetera. But Dan was right, and I think that we've seen that in the performance of the medical device business we acquired from St. Jude because it's been performing at sort of a 9% to 10% level as new products have gone to the market, either replacing older products or just simply brand new products altogether. 
So I'd say the first thing about Medical Devices is you've got to keep innovating in new spaces. MitraClip's new space, Heart Failure and HeartMate and so forth, these are new spaces, new technologies, et cetera. Libre is that. Libre is unique. It approaches a mass market, not a niche market. Most medical devices address niches of therapy. But diabetes is something that affects more than 80 million people around the world who would benefit from Libre in about a 50-50 split of type 1s and type 2s. And that is massive. It's unlike anything seen before in device for diagnostic businesses. And so there's just an enormous, enormous opportunity there. To be honest, traditional medical device companies aren't used to having to deal with at that kind of scale. 
And so we're addressing that by investing very heavily in manufacturing expansion, so that we can go after the mass market, not a niche. And so I think the sustainability of the growth is driven not only by the innovation, but the ability to go after much bigger markets at a much more affordable level. More people will have access. There will be more growth as we make technologies and products more and more affordable. 
And then finally, you asked about some of the businesses that aren't growing that fast. And I'd say, well, I'm always disappointed that they're not growing as fast as we'd like them to, but I am pleased that we've seen sequential improvement quarter-to-quarter in almost all of them. We've seen that in CRM. We've seen it neuromod. We've seen it even EPD and stents and so forth. We're seeing incremental improvement. Some of these businesses as more mature businesses may not see strong or high single digit or double digit growth, but I think they're still capable of pretty strong growth in the low to mid-single-digit area, and there's still a lot of upside. 
If we take a CRM business from where it's flat slightly negative to 3% or 4%, that's a pretty big bump in growth. We'd be -- if it was going from 10% to 14%, we'd be all excited about it. So the same incremental growth improvement, I think, is possible. It's just at a lower level. So I think that there's a lot here to sustain the kind of growth we're seeing. There's always going to be new products like Libre or a MitraClip or a HeartMate that singularly for a period of time disproportionally drive the overall growth. One of the benefits of having many businesses in the device arena is there's always going to be somewhere that's growing that way and other places where we're innovating for the future."

So we've completed that, and now, obviously, the focus is improving the productivity of that sales team. And we saw that in the second quarter. If you look at some of the KPIs, we look at whether it's trials or trial to permanent implant conversion rates. We saw definitely sequential improvement versus Q1, and we expect that to improve as we go into the second half of this year. 
A big portion of this also is, I'd say, product innovation life cycle. You've seen a couple of quarters now where there really hasn't been any kind of launch from competitors in this space. That's a key driver also. So sales force productivity and execution, we'll start to see some of our innovation output we made double the investment in that R&D business over the last couple of years.

I remember I've got this call or this question last quarter, I can't recall if it was you, on whether we thought we could get the $5 billion and how soon, and gosh, 3 months later, it's $10 billion. I've got the same ambitions, to be honest. I just wouldn't have expected them 90 days later. But to answer your question, I think that kind of potential is there. I think it's awfully hard to speculate about a number that big. But will we -- do I think we'll get the $5 billion? And do I think we'll do it in a reasonable time, $5 billion of sales over? Yes, I do. And I think it's -- the growth rate here is reflective of not only the size of the market, but the need and utility and affordability of the product. And I think it's just, as I've said many times, it's a very different market where affordability and the utility, the access, all those things make this a mess market product, not a niche. And it's designed for that. It's priced for that. It's a very profitable product. And we're going through the large-scale scale-up of addressing that kind of growth, which is unprecedented for products in our space. 
So do I think it can grow to that sort of level? I won't jinx anything by trying to make some prognostication about $10 billion, but I would say that I think it's got enormous potential. And it's got potential beyond glucose. It's got potential as a wearable in other analytes and other products over time. We have R&D programs underway, not only for the repeated enhancement, improvement, expansion of Libre, but also in the other categories beyond diabetes and other analytes and so forth. So I think that there's just a lot of things that will evolve over the coming years here that, today, people weren't even contemplating with the product. We're going as hard as we can at the glucose opportunity, which is enormous. But there's so much more beyond that, that, I think, at least to your aspirational consideration, to be honest, has validity. I'm just not ready to put any numbers around it."

I think when we went out about this several years ago, the challenge here, Matt, wasn't to get an accurate reading of glucose from interstitial fluid. Navigator, when we have launched it back in 2008, we were able to do that. It was very accurate, and we're able to get an accurate reading. The challenge that we went about with Libre is how to do that in a way that is cost-effective for the health systems and for consumers and for all of that. So that was what we really went after, is how can you get the accurate reading at a cost position at the core of Libre? And you might remember at the time, Navigator at the time was considered the most accurate sensor. In the core of Libre is that chemistry, is that core technology of Navigator, which provides accurate, reliable readings, but we're able to do that at a cost position that now makes sense for the insurance and for the payer community and the health systems to cover it. It wasn't a question of whether the outcomes were right or whether the outcomes were enough. They were convinced that the outcomes were there for sensor-based glucose monitoring. It was just can I now do it in a way that makes sense for me to do it on a mass scale? And Miles just talked about this about mass scale. That's what we went after 10 years ago. And that's at the core. And I think maybe that's misunderstood because a lot of this discussion gets focused on, well, accuracy at this level and accuracy at that level. And the reality is accuracy is obviously important, but our goal here is to make this massively available without having to sacrifice accuracy. And the fact that we priced it at a different price point wouldn't say necessarily imply that it's somehow missing something, we just have a different strategy and adjustment view of what we could do."

Ours is not expensive, and it's not high cost. It does not lack for clinical performance, accuracy or any of the like. But the cope of manufacturing is so sophisticated and automated, we were able to achieve a pretty low cost in what is a pretty sophisticated product. It's a highly profitable product, so we haven't compromised that it's a product that is successful in terms of profit. That's not been compromised at all. It has a completely different design and approach and cost structure. It relies on scale for that cost, and we've actually seen improving gross margin. 
We've told you before the gross margin is over 60%. It is and rising. And that's with a heavy capital investment, so that we can produce the kind of volume that is broadly available. So I think among the misunderstandings out there, I think people say, ""Well, geez, how do you make money?"" Oh, we make money. We do just fine, thank you. And the product is designed to be affordable and accessible. I guess, there are some days when we think, if the health care market community ensures payers, Congress, patients, whatever, I always say it's got to be lower cost. The health care has got to be more affordable. Here's our example. And it is. It's massively so. And so we've gone at it with that approach to make it broadly available. Broadly, this case means 80 million people worldwide. That's unprecedented. 
So I'm not sure that the device community has totally understood it because it's so different. But we keep saying so. And I think now as the new capacity comes online, we've also staged the capacity so that literally, every 90 days, we're adding another increment, significant incremental capacity. We will not be capacity-constrained. And that kind of release is a lot of freedom to market and push the product forward and even open up markets we haven't opened yet. So I think there's a lot of opportunity here. And I think to, I think, opportunity -- there's opportunity for a number of things like this, as I mentioned earlier, in what's called the wearables market, a more affordable and accessible technologies make products like this, then I think we're going to see a very different market expansion."

Today, we reported results of another strong quarter with ongoing earnings per share of $0.82, above our previous guidance range and reflecting double-digit growth.

Today, we reported results of another strong quarter with ongoing earnings per share of $0.82, above our previous guidance range and reflecting double-digit growth. Sales increased 7.5% on an organic basis in the quarter with all 4 businesses exceeding expectations. 
I'm particularly pleased with our ability to consistently achieve these types of strong results. Over the past 2 years, our quarterly organic sales growth has averaged more than 7%. And importantly, we're well positioned with our portfolio and new product pipeline for this type of strong growth going forward. 
Based on our performance and momentum in the first half of the year, we're raising our full year outlook, and we now forecast adjusted earnings per share of $3.21 to $3.27, reflecting nearly 13% growth at the midpoint on a reported basis and even faster growth when excluding the impact of foreign exchange. 
While we achieved broad-based growth across several areas of our portfolio, I'd like to highlight just a few areas where we continue to perform exceptionally well. 
I'll start our Medical Devices business with FreeStyle Libre, where we achieved sales of $430 million and continued to add significantly to our global user base, as reflected by our organic sales growth of more than 70% in the quarter. We also continue to make excellent progress expanding reimbursement and access in the U.S., where Libre is now reimbursed for approximately 75% of people with private pharmacy benefit insurance. 
Libre offers a unique value proposition. And as by design, it provides great clinical benefits, and we priced it to ensure affordability. Peers recognize that value -- that recognize that value and are increasingly providing reimbursement coverage for Libre, which also lower out-of-pocket costs even further for patients. 
As I've mentioned before, we've been investing significantly to expand our manufacturing capacity for Libre to meet demand. The first wave of that expansion will come online in the next couple of months, followed by a cadence of incremental capacity after that. There's a massive population that needs help managing their diabetes, and our intent is to make Libre broadly accessible to all of them. 
Turning to our Structural Heart business, where we achieved mid-teens growth. This was led by MitraClip, our market-leading device for the treatment of mitral regurgitation, which had global sales growth of more than 30% in the quarter. And MitraClip grew more than 50% in the U.S., where we recently received a new expanded indication. 
Earlier this week, we announced U.S. approval of our fourth generation MitraClip device, which builds on this leading platform with enhanced features and new clip sizes, providing physicians further options when treating the disease. We've been building our position in Structural Heart for more than a decade and have a deep pipeline of technologies and development, including Tendyne and Cephea, which are minimally invasive devices to replace faulty mitral heart valves. 
TriClip, a first of its kind device for the repair of a leaky tricuspid heart valve; and AMPLATZER Amulet, our left atrial appendage device, to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. With the rapid adoption of MitraClip in a highly underpenetrated market as well as a pipeline of technologies targeting new growth areas that will launch over the next several years, our Structural Heart business is well positioned for strong, steady growth for years to come.
Next, Diagnostics, where we remain focused on the global rollout of our Alinity suite of instruments for every area of diagnostics in which we compete. We're making great progress with our systems for immunoassay in clinical chemistry testing in Europe, where the launch of Alinity is helping to drive double-digit growth in our international core laboratory business. We're now also in the early stages of launching Alinity instruments for hematology and molecular testing in Europe. 
In the U.S., we're making steady progress achieving regulatory approvals for our broad menu of core laboratory tests. And just last week, we announced the FDA approval of Alinity s for blood and plasma screen. 
Abbott screens the majority of the world's blood supply, and this system is designed to be faster and more efficient within a smaller amount of space while maintaining the highest levels of accuracy. The global rollout of Alinity is an ambitious undertaking that positions our Diagnostics business for sustainable, strong growth going forward.
So in summary, all 4 of our businesses exceeded expectations in the quarter. Our growth is strong, it's accelerating and it's sustainable. We've strategically positioned ourselves in some of the most attractive areas of health care, and our key growth platforms are delivering impressive results. And today, we're adding to what was already a strong growth forecast by raising our outlook for the year. I'll now turn the call over to Brian to discuss our results and outlook for the year in more detail. Brian?"

As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis, which is consistent with our previous guidance.
Turning to our results. Sales for the second quarter increased 7.5%. Sales in medical devices grew 10.5% with double-digit growth in Electrophysiology, Heart Failure, Structural Heart and Diabetes Care. In Nutrition, sales increased 5.1%, led by a strong growth in Adult Nutrition. Sales in Established Pharmaceuticals grew 6.1% with 8% growth in our key emerging markets. And sales increased 6.2% in Diagnostics, led by high single-digit growth in Core Laboratory Diagnostics and sequential improvements in point-of-care and Rapid Diagnostics.
Exchange had an unbearable impact on total Abbott sales of 4.6%, which was approximately 0.5% more unfavorable to our expectations at the time of our earnings call in April. Regarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 59.4% of sales. Adjusted R&D investment was 7.1% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense was 29.9% of sales.
The second quarter adjusted tax rate was 13.7%, lower than our previous full year guidance of around 15%, due entirely to continued implementation of and adaptation to the U.S. tax reform regulations. Our second quarter tax rate reflects the aggregate adjustment to align our tax rate for the first half of 2019 with our revised full year effective tax rate forecast of 14.5%.
Turning to our outlook for the full year. We now forecast organic sales growth of 7% to 8%. Based on current rates, we would expect exchange to have a negative impact of approximately 3% on our full year reported sales, which is in line with the expected impact we had at the beginning of the year. We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of a little less than 59.5% of sales for the full year. This is modestly lower than our prior forecast and reflects the temporary effect of investments to support the unprecedented ramp-up and market adoption of our Alinity diagnostics systems as well as investments in Libre capacity expansion. 
We forecast adjusted R&D investment of somewhat less than 7.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of around 29.5% of sales. And as I mentioned previously, we forecasted an adjusted tax rate of around 14.5% for the full year 2019.
Turning to our outlook for the third quarter, we forecast adjusted EPS of $0.83 to $0.85, which reflects strong double-digit growth. We forecast organic sales growth of 7% to 8%, and, at current rates, we would expect exchange to have a negative impact of around 1.5% on our third quarter reported sales. We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of a little less than 59.5% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of around 7.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of around 29% of sales. 
Before we open the call for questions, I'll now provide a quick overview of our third quarter organic sales growth outlook by business. For Established Pharmaceuticals, we forecast mid- to high single digit growth. In Nutrition, we forecast mid-single-digit growth. In Diagnostics, we forecast Abbott's legacy diagnostics businesses, which is comprised of core laboratory, molecular and point-of-care to grow high single digits. And in Rapid Diagnostics, we forecast low to mid-single-digit growth. And finally, in Medical Devices, we forecast high single-digit growth, which reflects continued double-digit growth in several areas of this business. 
With that, we'll now open the call up for questions."

We've got a lot of launches going on in all segments across the board. We're going to be opening up the capacity, new manufacturing and so forth to supplement Libre. The Alinity systems are obviously successfully rolling out. MitraClip is picking up momentum. A lot of the businesses that I've been sort of chronically dissatisfied with from time to time have also in sequential improvement, which I'm happy to see. I'm never quite satisfied with that. But the pharmaceutical business, the cardiac rhythm management business, the stent business, neuromodulation, the point-of-care Diagnostics business, the Rapid Diagnostics business, which is primarily the Alere acquisition, they're all showing sequential sales growth improvement, which is what we've planned, what we've worked for, et cetera. So based on the strength across the board of all of that, we felt comfortable that, frankly, our growth rate on the top line going forward, we sort of see in that 7% to 8% range. And I challenged the team. I said, is this temporary for the quarter or for the half year thing? Or do we feel fairly sustainable about this? And we feel sustainable about it. 
So I think that's all good. And then with record earnings, there's a step-up in earnings here in the second half, earnings growth rate. And it's just an unusual quarter. I mean, we always target, as you know, at the beginning of the year, double-digit growth. We always had kind of an aggressive or at least ambitious target for ourselves going into the next year. That's no different now. So in the second half, our earnings remain strong. I don't know, I'm kind of -- I feel pretty good if we do the numbers we say and we never fall short. So it's 18% on the bottom line right now. So you're asking me about what we do to get to the high end of the range? I'm thinking, geez, isn't that good enough? It's a pretty healthy growth rate. So 7% to 8% on the top and high double digit teens on the bottom, I think, is probably best-in-class in the peer group that we're compared to and several different peer groups that we're compared to. And quite frankly, with the breadth of products launching and rollouts, obviously, there's always challenges somewhere in the world in some way, but we seem to be doing pretty well across the board here in all areas, and I think that's a pretty good investment."

So we obviously were constantly doing market development, opening new accounts, but a majority of that growth coming through increased utilization. So we've continued to invest in clinical and field sales expansion. And when you do this, they have this direct impact in account utilization and productivity. International was up also double digits in the quarter. You've got Japan, where we believe is a significant opportunity for us long term there where we're building our capabilities in Japan. And Europe saw a rebound in Q2 versus where we were in Q1. I think the teams there, the clinical and medical teams have done a really good job at putting into context and framing some of those conflicting trials that came out in the second half of the year. 
So we think there's a lot of sustainability here not only in the U.S. I mean, our penetration rates here, in terms of the opportunity, are still kind of low single digits. So we've got a lot of runway here. Regarding your question on CMS, I mean, there's obviously a lot of coordination that's been going on between CMS and the physician societies. We expect the NCD to be opened up a very soon as part of that coordination. As I say, we're not going to forecast an exact timeline here, but we anticipate getting through the process around year-end early next year. But as you said, the process here hasn't really kind of impeded our growth. 
We have seen a dozen or so private commercial insurance companies already reflect updates to their decision to their coverage to include the new indication. Obviously, the larger segment there is the Medicare segment, but it's good to kind to see that traction in the private segment. So very good quarter. We continue to see this expansion in the second half of the year and towards the end of the year looking at achieving the CMS reimbursement."

And these are 6 different systems, the immunoassay system, the clinical chemistry system, obviously a smaller point of care system for that market. There's a",607,"Sure. Well, so first, you made a comment that it touches every part of diagnostics. That's true. And these are 6 different systems, the immunoassay system, the clinical chemistry system, obviously a smaller point of care system for that market. There's a dedicated blood and plasma screening system, and then, of course, hematology and molecular. And they're all at various stages of rollout. The one that is the furthest along would be the rollout of our immunoassay and clinical chemistry systems in the core laboratories of Europe. We're also in the process of expanding menu approvals in the United States and China and Southeast Asia, where customers want to have a certain critical mass of menu as they make the conversion from whatever they're using to these new Alinity systems. 
So I'd say we're running as fast as we can, I think, at this point, in Europe, and that's going pretty well. There's over 3,000 systems placed now running test, generating revenue, et cetera. We do measure not just the deal, the close of a deal, et cetera. We measure what is called test of record when the account is up and running, generating results, generating tests, et cetera. 
And so I'd say that process is going well. That's going to begin to pick up more momentum in the United States as we're getting more and more menu breadth. Same with China. We're tracking all of that pretty closely as we build those menus. We're talking hundreds of tests. We did recently get approval for the Alinity as the blood and plasma screening system. Today, we screen about 80% of the world's blood supply as it is. This is -- it's an important transition product that labs, I think, will find more efficient, more economic, et cetera, but that's a plus. 
We closed and started up the Japanese Red Cross, which is the largest Japanese blood screening organization, and we took that from a long-standing Japanese competitor. So that was a big win for us. So there's just a lot of success that way. 
Hematology's in the very early stages of rolling out, the molecular system in the earliest stage of rolling out. And which is why this will be, I guess, a slower moving launch that's got sort of years of growth and momentum in it as we look over the next, call it, 5 to 7 years to completely replace an existing installed base and add a lot of new share and new volume. And to that end, I think we've quoted you before, that remains true. In accounts where we already have the business, we're winning about 95% of the time. And in accounts where we do not have the business, and there's an entrenched competitor of ours, we're winning about 60% of the time. Those win rates and penetration rates and share gains and so forth in our experience so far, over now what I said is over 3,000 instruments, tell us that we've got a very competitive system. We do run into, on the occasional accounts, a heavy-duty price-cutting. 
We've got a very disciplined system of our pricing and contracting in accounts. We have not had to do that. I think that speaks to the superiority of the instrument and assay offering. So we're feeling like our offering is uniquely competitive. It's borne out by the win rates no matter what type of account. It's unprecedented to launch these many systems across-the-board in all areas. So I think this only picks up momentum and gets better as the assay menu expands and as there's some experience in the field with the analyzers."

Well, I can tell you he's not playing golf. We -- I'd say a couple of things. First of all, we anticipated that for the time being, we wanted him to stay directly on top of the medical device business because he's been responsible for the bringing onboard St. Jude. As we acquired that, he was integral to that entire integration. We went through, with St. Jude, a reorganization of the business to align with the way we like to run a business at Abbott. And I guess I would describe that as we like to have a fully integrated business, meaning the general manager of that business, president of that business has responsibility for commercial -- the commercial people, commercial sales, of the customers, et cetera, but also manufacturing, R&D, technical support, service, et cetera. We like all those functions reporting into one GM. 
And so we realigned St. Jude. We did the same with Alere, quite frankly, when we took them over. And so each of the business has full integrated general management responsibility. And that was a transition, and Robert led that. It's all in place. That meant that we added a number of experienced general managers. We replaced some who had left us as part of the St. Jude or Alere acquisitions and so forth. So we went through a management transition. And at the same time, there's been a little bit of a generational change happening here. Quite certainly, there's been an awful lot of people that has been part of my management team for a long time. And a lot of our managers are long-term Abbott groomed and grown management team, but we've also been thinking about making sure that with all the growth we've got, the new products, the new organization, the new structure of that organization that we're always looking at the talent and the experience of our management team as we look forward now toward, let's just call it, a decade of what I think is going to be pretty robust growth. 
So in that, we needed to replace the EVP role that Robert has held previous to his Chief Operating Officer role. We did that. We went outside for that and, of course, sourced Lisa, who we think has terrific background and experience for that. We're very pleased to have brought fresh perspective and great experience and great energy level into the company. So we're very pleased with that. 
We went through a little further, I'd say, organization change to kind of break up what had gotten big and perhaps unwieldy, in some cases, into slightly smaller units because we are managing some pretty aggressive growth capital improvement, plant building, et cetera, in a number of these businesses, including diagnostics. And to give us more focus around it, we've done some of that adjusting. 
I feel like that's gone very smoothly and very well. Obviously, we read into Robert, who's in his mid-40s, moving up into the COO role, that we expect him to be in a key leadership role at the company for a long time. Read between the lines. 
And so there's a preparation process going on. And I think one of the most important things I can do, after leading the company for so long, is to make sure that when a transition comes, nobody notices. And the best legacy to leave is that the momentum of this company. Its growth and its prospects are every bit as good going forward as we think they are now and, from my perspective, a smooth leadership transition, which is not just me, it's literally right down through the upper ranks of all management is key and important. And I feel like of all of the sort of track record of legacies that I can give this company, I think a transition that way is probably the most important of all. 
So you can read into it that we're preparing for continuity of leadership, what I would call it, with no speed bumps. And I think that actually is going exceptionally well. Will I give you a time frame? No. Do I think we should be nervous about it? No. I think that this company is so poised to perform well across the board for years to come that I've got great confidence in that continuity and the management team because we've got a nice mix here of very experienced and trained Abbott people and people we've brought from other companies on the outside like Lisa. And I think the mix we've got in that team is exceptional. Robert's been with the company over 20 years. I've known him every bit of those 20-plus years, and I think he brings to his job right now tremendous experience, perspective, everything you would look for in a leader, as a COO of the company. So from my perspective, I think this is nothing but good and just keeps getting better."

From a capital standpoint, obviously, it was important for us to pay down debt. We did. We've paid down a significant amount going on $10 billion at this point. And as we've said before, we're in a comfortable position of strategic flexibility, but that doesn't mean we're dying to go use it. 
So the next need was, obviously, we've got some capital to put into plant and expansion, and we've put a fair amount into both Diagnostics and Libre at this point. We're investing in expansion of plant and manufacturing for MitraClip and other products. So given that we've got an awful lot of growth happening and the potential for more, obviously, we've got to support that growth from a plant and capital standpoint in a timely fashion and appropriate quality and so forth, and we're doing that. And so there's capital use, et cetera, there. Will we continue to pay down debt? We will. We'll be prudent and careful about making sure it makes sense it's the right debt, right time and all that good stuff. 
We'll maintain a healthy, strong dividend. We increased it substantially at the end of last year. We'll continue to grow our dividend. Given where the PE is now, I've been told by a number of shareholders that trying to get that yield rate upward dividend funds are happy as is difficult, but that's a nice problem to have. We will continue to grow our dividend. It's been a hallmark of the company for decades, and it will continue to be. And then it's not always that prudent to buy back shares. The timing matters, the return matters, et cetera. Is it an option? Yes, it is. I probably won't get too carried away because, frankly, we're able to grow and return cash to shareholders a number of different ways and return good return to our shareholders. So it's always an option as it presents itself. We've just got a lot we can do. If you're asking about M&A and other things, we don't feel like right now that we need something, nor do we think we see something that we can add sufficient value to, to make it worth it to invest in. And we've got so many organic growth opportunities that, while we continue to monitor and we're always tracking opportunities in all of our businesses, I can't tell you that, that's real front burner right now. We don't ignore it. We don't -- we try to maintain our currency on the things that we might be interested in. We just did a small acquisition in Germany. That's a nice adjunctive thing to our Diagnostics business in terms of automation and so forth. There are things like that, that I think are valuable for us. But we have so much growth potential and opportunity in devices, diagnostics, even nutrition and pharma that we're just not out cut and real hard on the M&A front right now, nor do I foresee that being true for quite a while. So that's the capital side. 
On the expense side, we're always trying to balance the voracious appetite of investors for growing earnings with investing in the growth of the business. And I doubt that there's a general manager or business at Abbott that wouldn't claim that if we gave them more money, they could spend it effectively and efficiently to grow our products faster. So we're always trying to find the right balance of how much gas that's thrown in the fire or the growth of the products with returning a healthy return to the expectations of our investors. I think that's always a balance because there's always some investor who thinks there must be an extra $0.01 in the quarter. And I was speaking to somebody this morning who asked about that very issue of another $0.01. And I said, ""The issue here is much bigger than $0.01."" We've got tremendous growth. Our top line were accelerating. It's strong. It's sustainable. This isn't about $0.01 in a given quarter, this is about a pretty, healthy sales growth rate and a commensurate healthy growth rate on the bottom line that's unusual in our sector and particularly unusual for companies of our size to be able to sustain such a healthy growth rate with so much new product richness for the coming years. And it's not a coming quarter, it's coming years. 
So you raised the right question, is how do we keep investing in the spending in R&D and the sales and marketing expenses to drive that growth? And we're trying to find that right balance as well by putting enough fuel to the fire here to drive the growth rates even higher"

How do you just think about the ability to sustain that level of growth? It seems that Medical Devices has a bit of a tale of 2 cities with several businesses reporting really nice, strong double-digit growth, but a couple of obvious businesses kind of still lagging around that flattish growth. How do you kind of think about the longer-term dynamic there?"
247483,622961692,1772621,"Abbott Laboratories, Q2 2019 Earnings Call, Jul 17, 2019",2019-07-17,"Earnings Calls","Abbott Laboratories","Executives","Yes. You've got a mix of business this year. You've got some that are a little mature than others, some that have brand new products that are perfect innovations. In general, in Medical Devices, innovation is what drives the growth. And over time, that's",639,"Yes. You've got a mix of business this year. You've got some that are a little mature than others, some that have brand new products that are perfect innovations. In general, in Medical Devices, innovation is what drives the growth. And over time, that's the case. And different businesses are at different stages of either maturity or new innovation. We believe there's still a lot of opportunity there. 
I remember in my discussions with Dan Starks when we were renegotiating over the acquisition of St. Jude, Dan felt pretty strongly that the pipeline of St. Jude was underappreciated and, that in their own internal models, that the growth rate was out there in the high single digits. The Street didn't agree with that at the time because it didn't see it yet, et cetera. But Dan was right, and I think that we've seen that in the performance of the medical device business we acquired from St. Jude because it's been performing at sort of a 9% to 10% level as new products have gone to the market, either replacing older products or just simply brand new products altogether. 
So I'd say the first thing about Medical Devices is you've got to keep innovating in new spaces. MitraClip's new space, Heart Failure and HeartMate and so forth, these are new spaces, new technologies, et cetera. Libre is that. Libre is unique. It approaches a mass market, not a niche market. Most medical devices address niches of therapy. But diabetes is something that affects more than 80 million people around the world who would benefit from Libre in about a 50-50 split of type 1s and type 2s. And that is massive. It's unlike anything seen before in device for diagnostic businesses. And so there's just an enormous, enormous opportunity there. To be honest, traditional medical device companies aren't used to having to deal with at that kind of scale. 
And so we're addressing that by investing very heavily in manufacturing expansion, so that we can go after the mass market, not a niche. And so I think the sustainability of the growth is driven not only by the innovation, but the ability to go after much bigger markets at a much more affordable level. More people will have access. There will be more growth as we make technologies and products more and more affordable. 
And then finally, you asked about some of the businesses that aren't growing that fast. And I'd say, well, I'm always disappointed that they're not growing as fast as we'd like them to, but I am pleased that we've seen sequential improvement quarter-to-quarter in almost all of them. We've seen that in CRM. We've seen it neuromod. We've seen it even EPD and stents and so forth. We're seeing incremental improvement. Some of these businesses as more mature businesses may not see strong or high single digit or double digit growth, but I think they're still capable of pretty strong growth in the low to mid-single-digit area, and there's still a lot of upside. 
If we take a CRM business from what is flat slightly negative to 3% or 4%, that's a pretty big bump in growth. We'd be -- if it was going from 10% to 14%, we'd be all excited about it. So the same incremental growth improvement, I think, is possible. It's just at a lower level. So I think that there's a lot here to sustain the kind of growth we're seeing. There's always going to be new products like Libre or a MitraClip or a HeartMate that singularly for a period of time disproportionally drive the overall growth. One of the benefits of having many businesses in the device arena is there's always going to be somewhere that's growing that way and other places where we're innovating for the future."

So we've completed that, and now, obviously, the focus is improving the productivity of that sales team. And we saw that in the second quarter. If you look at some of the KPIs, we look at whether it's trials or trial to permanent implant conversion rates. We saw definitely sequential improvement versus Q1, and we expect that to improve as we go into the second half of this year. 
A big portion of this also is, I'd say, product innovation life cycle. You've seen a couple of quarters now where there really hasn't been any kind of launch from competitors in this space. That's a key driver also. So sales force productivity and execution, we'll start to see some of our innovation output we made double the investment in that R&D business over the last couple of years.

I remember I've got this call or this question last quarter, I can't recall if it was you, on whether we thought we could get the $5 billion and how soon, and gosh, 3 months later, it's $10 billion. I've got the same ambitions, to be honest. I just wouldn't have expected them 90 days later. But to answer your question, I think that kind of potential is there. I think it's awfully hard to speculate about a number that big. But will we -- do I think we'll get the $5 billion? And do I think we'll do it in a reasonable time, $5 billion of sales over? Yes, I do. And I think it's -- the growth rate here is reflective of not only the size of the market, but the need and utility and affordability of the product. And I think it's just, as I've said many times, it's a very different market where affordability and the utility, the access, all those things make this a mass market product, not a niche. And it's designed for that. It's priced for that. It's a very profitable product. And we're going through the large-scale, scale-up of addressing that kind of growth, which is unprecedented for products in our space. 
So do I think it can grow to that sort of level? I won't jinx anything by trying to make some prognostication about $10 billion, but I would say that I think it's got enormous potential. And it's got potential beyond glucose. It's got potential as a wearable in other analytes and other products over time. We have R&D programs underway, not only for the repeated enhancement, improvement, expansion of Libre, but also in the other categories beyond diabetes and other analytes and so forth. So I think that there's just a lot of things that will evolve over the coming years here that, today, people weren't even contemplating with the product. We're going as hard as we can at the glucose opportunity, which is enormous. But there's so much more beyond that, that, I think, at least to your aspirational consideration, to be honest, has validity. I'm just not ready to put any numbers around it."

I think when we went out about this several years ago, the challenge here, Matt, wasn't to get an accurate reading of glucose from interstitial fluid. Navigator, when we have launched it back in 2008, we were able to do that. It was very accurate, and we're able to get an accurate reading. The challenge that we went about with Libre is how to do that in a way that is cost-effective for the health systems and for consumers and for all of that. So that was what we really went after, is how can you get the accurate reading at a cost position at the core of Libre? And you might remember at the time, Navigator at the time was considered the most accurate sensor. In the core of Libre is that chemistry, is that core technology of Navigator, which provides accurate, reliable readings, but we're able to do that at a cost position that now makes sense for the insurance and for the payer community and the health systems to cover it. It wasn't a question of whether the outcomes were right or whether the outcomes were enough. They were convinced that the outcomes were there for sensor-based glucose monitoring. It was just, can I now do it in a way that makes sense for me to do it on a mass scale? And Miles just talked about this about mass scale. That's what we went after 10 years ago. And that's at the core. And I think maybe that's misunderstood because a lot of this discussion gets focused on, well, accuracy at this level and accuracy at that level. And the reality is accuracy is obviously important, but our goal here is to make this massively available without having to sacrifice accuracy. And the fact that we priced it at a different price point wouldn't say necessarily imply that it's somehow missing something, we just have a different strategy and adjustment view of what we could do."

Ours is not expensive, and it's not high cost. It does not lack for clinical performance, accuracy or any of the like. But because the manufacturing is so sophisticated and automated, we were able to achieve a pretty low cost in what is a pretty sophisticated product. It's a highly profitable product, so we haven't compromised that it's a product that is successful in terms of profit. That's not been compromised at all. It has a completely different design and approach and cost structure. It relies on scale for that cost, and we've actually seen improving gross margin. 
We've told you before the gross margin is over 60%. It is and rising. And that's with a heavy capital investment, so that we can produce the kind of volume that is broadly available. So I think among the misunderstandings out there, I think people say, ""Well, geez, how do you make money?"" Oh, we make money. We do just fine, thank you. And the product is designed to be affordable and accessible. I guess, there are some days when we think, if the health care market community ensures payers, Congress, patients, whatever, I always say it's got to be lower cost. The health care has got to be more affordable. Here's our example. And it is. It's massively so. And so we've gone at it with that approach to make it broadly available. Broadly, in this case means 80 million people worldwide. That's unprecedented. 
So I'm not sure that the device community has totally understood it because it's so different. But we keep saying so. And I think now as the new capacity comes online, we've also staged the capacity so that literally, every 90 days, we're adding another increment, significant incremental capacity. We will not be capacity-constrained. And that kind of release is a lot of freedom to market and push the product forward and even open up markets we haven't opened yet. So I think there's a lot of opportunity here. And I think to, I think, opportunity -- there's opportunity for a number of things like this, as I mentioned earlier, in what's called the wearables market, the more affordable and accessible technologies make products like this, then I think we're going to see a very different market expansion."

Today, we reported results of another strong quarter with ongoing earnings per share of $0.82, above our previous guidance range and reflecting double-digit growth.

Today, we reported results of another strong quarter with ongoing earnings per share of $0.82, above our previous guidance range and reflecting double-digit growth. Sales increased 7.5% on an organic basis in the quarter with all 4 businesses exceeding expectations. 
I'm particularly pleased with our ability to consistently achieve these types of strong results. Over the past 2 years, our quarterly organic sales growth has averaged more than 7%. And importantly, we're well positioned with our portfolio and new product pipeline for this type of strong growth going forward. 
Based on our performance and momentum in the first half of the year, we're raising our full year outlook, and we now forecast adjusted earnings per share of $3.21 to $3.27, reflecting nearly 13% growth at the midpoint on a reported basis and even faster growth when excluding the impact of foreign exchange. 
While we achieved broad-based growth across several areas of our portfolio, I'd like to highlight just a few areas where we continue to perform exceptionally well. 
I'll start our Medical Devices business with FreeStyle Libre, where we achieved sales of $430 million and continued to add significantly to our global user base, as reflected by our organic sales growth of more than 70% in the quarter. We also continue to make excellent progress expanding reimbursement and access in the U.S., where Libre is now reimbursed for approximately 75% of people with private pharmacy benefit insurance. 
Libre offers a unique value proposition. And as by design, it provides great clinical benefits, and we priced it to ensure affordability. Peers recognize that value -- that recognize that value and are increasingly providing reimbursement coverage for Libre, which also lower out-of-pocket costs even further for patients. 
As I've mentioned before, we've been investing significantly to expand our manufacturing capacity for Libre to meet demand. The first wave of that expansion will come online in the next couple of months, followed by a cadence of incremental capacity after that. There's a massive population that needs help managing their diabetes, and our intent is to make Libre broadly accessible to all of them. 
Turning to our Structural Heart business, where we achieved mid-teens growth. This was led by MitraClip, our market-leading device for the treatment of mitral regurgitation, which had global sales growth of more than 30% in the quarter. And MitraClip grew more than 50% in the U.S., where we recently received a new expanded indication. 
Earlier this week, we announced U.S. approval of our fourth generation MitraClip device, which builds on this leading platform with enhanced features and new clip sizes, providing physicians further options when treating the disease. We've been building our position in Structural Heart for more than a decade and have a deep pipeline of technologies and development, including Tendyne and Cephea, which are minimally invasive devices to replace faulty mitral heart valves. 
TriClip, a first of its kind device for the repair of a leaky tricuspid heart valve; and AMPLATZER Amulet, our left atrial appendage device, to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. With the rapid adoption of MitraClip in a highly underpenetrated market as well as a pipeline of technologies targeting new growth areas that will launch over the next several years, our Structural Heart business is well positioned for strong, steady growth for years to come.
Next, Diagnostics, where we remain focused on the global rollout of our Alinity suite of instruments for every area of diagnostics in which we compete. We're making great progress with our systems for immunoassay in clinical chemistry testing in Europe, where the launch of Alinity is helping to drive double-digit growth in our international core laboratory business. We're now also in the early stages of launching Alinity instruments for hematology and molecular testing in Europe. 
In the U.S., we're making steady progress achieving regulatory approvals for our broad menu of core laboratory tests. And just last week, we announced the FDA approval of Alinity s for blood and plasma screen. 
Abbott screens the majority of the world's blood supply, and this system is designed to be faster and more efficient within a smaller amount of space while maintaining the highest levels of accuracy. The global rollout of Alinity is an ambitious undertaking that positions our Diagnostics business for sustainable, strong growth going forward.
So in summary, all 4 of our businesses exceeded expectations in the quarter. Our growth is strong, it's accelerating and it's sustainable. We've strategically positioned ourselves in some of the most attractive areas of health care, and our key growth platforms are delivering impressive results. And today, we're adding to what was already a strong growth forecast by raising our outlook for the year. I'll now turn the call over to Brian to discuss our results and outlook for the year in more detail. Brian?"

As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis, which is consistent with our previous guidance.Turning to our results. Sales for the second quarter",570,"Okay. Thanks, Miles. As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis, which is consistent with our previous guidance.
Turning to our results. Sales for the second quarter increased 7.5%. Sales in medical devices grew 10.5% with double-digit growth in Electrophysiology, Heart Failure, Structural Heart and Diabetes Care. In Nutrition, sales increased 5.1%, led by a strong growth in Adult Nutrition. Sales in Established Pharmaceuticals grew 6.1% with 8% growth in our key emerging markets. And sales increased 6.2% in Diagnostics, led by high single-digit growth in Core Laboratory Diagnostics and sequential improvements in point-of-care and Rapid Diagnostics.
Exchange had an unbearable impact on total Abbott sales of 4.6%, which was approximately 0.5% more unfavorable to our expectations at the time of our earnings call in April. Regarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 59.4% of sales. Adjusted R&D investment was 7.1% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense was 29.9% of sales.
The second quarter adjusted tax rate was 13.7%, lower than our previous full year guidance of around 15%, due entirely to continued implementation of and adaptation to the U.S. tax reform regulations. Our second quarter tax rate reflects the aggregate adjustment to align our tax rate for the first half of 2019 with our revised full year effective tax rate forecast of 14.5%.
Turning to our outlook for the full year. We now forecast organic sales growth of 7% to 8%. Based on current rates, we would expect exchange to have a negative impact of approximately 3% on our full year reported sales, which is in line with the expected impact we had at the beginning of the year. We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of a little less than 59.5% of sales for the full year. This is modestly lower than our prior forecast and reflects the temporary effect of investments to support the unprecedented ramp-up and market adoption of our Alinity diagnostics systems as well as investments in Libre capacity expansion. 
We forecast adjusted R&D investment of somewhat less than 7.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of around 29.5% of sales. And as I mentioned previously, we forecasted an adjusted tax rate of around 14.5% for the full year 2019.
Turning to our outlook for the third quarter, we forecast adjusted EPS of $0.83 to $0.85, which reflects strong double-digit growth. We forecast organic sales growth of 7% to 8%, and, at current rates, we would expect exchange to have a negative impact of around 1.5% on our third quarter reported sales. We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of a little less than 59.5% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of around 7.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of around 29% of sales. 
Before we open the call for questions, I'll now provide a quick overview of our third quarter organic sales growth outlook by business. For Established Pharmaceuticals, we forecast mid- to high single digit growth. In Nutrition, we forecast mid-single-digit growth. In Diagnostics, we forecast Abbott's legacy diagnostics businesses, which is comprised of core laboratory, molecular and point-of-care to grow high single digits. And in Rapid Diagnostics, we forecast low to mid-single-digit growth. And finally, in Medical Devices, we forecast high single-digit growth, which reflects continued double-digit growth in several areas of this business. 
With that, we'll now open the call up for questions."

We've got a lot of launches going on in all segments across the board. We're going to be opening up the capacity, new manufacturing and so forth to supplement Libre. The Alinity systems are obviously successfully rolling out. MitraClip is picking up momentum. A lot of the businesses that I've been sort of chronically dissatisfied with from time to time have also in sequential improvement, which I'm happy to see. I'm never quite satisfied with that. But the pharmaceutical business, the cardiac rhythm management business, the stent business, neuromodulation, the point-of-care Diagnostics business, the Rapid Diagnostics business, which is primarily the Alere acquisition, they're all showing sequential sales growth improvement, which is what we've planned, what we've worked for, et cetera. So based on the strength across the board of all of that, we felt comfortable that, frankly, our growth rate on the top line going forward, we sort of see in that 7% to 8% range. And I challenged the team. I said, is this temporary for the quarter or for the half year thing? Or do we feel fairly sustainable about this? And we feel sustainable about it. 
So I think that's all good. And then with record earnings, there's a step-up in earnings here in the second half, earnings growth rate. And it's just an unusual quarter. I mean, we always target, as you know, at the beginning of the year, double-digit growth. We always had kind of an aggressive or at least ambitious target for ourselves going into the next year. That's no different now. So in the second half, our earnings remain strong. I don't know, I'm kind of -- I feel pretty good if we do the numbers we say and we never fall short. So it's 18% on the bottom line right now. So you're asking me about what we do to get to the high end of the range? I'm thinking, geez, isn't that good enough? It's a pretty healthy growth rate. So 7% to 8% on the top and high double digit teens on the bottom, I think, is probably best-in-class in the peer group that we're compared to and several different peer groups that we're compared to. And quite frankly, with the breadth of products launching and rollouts, obviously, there's always challenges somewhere in the world in some way, but we seem to be doing pretty well across the board here in all areas, and I think that's a pretty good investment."

So we obviously were constantly doing market development, opening new accounts, but a majority of that growth coming through increased utilization. So we've continued to invest in clinical and field sales expansion. And when you do this, they have this direct impact in account utilization and productivity. International was up also double digits in the quarter. You've got Japan, where we believe is a significant opportunity for us long term there where we're building our capabilities in Japan. And Europe saw a rebound in Q2 versus where we were in Q1. I think the teams there, the clinical and medical teams have done a really good job at putting into context and framing some of those conflicting trials that came out in the second half of the year. 
So we think there's a lot of sustainability here not only in the U.S. I mean, our penetration rates here, in terms of the opportunity, are still kind of low single digits. So we've got a lot of runway here. Regarding your question on CMS, I mean, there's obviously a lot of coordination that's been going on between CMS and the physician societies. We expect the NCD to be opened up a very soon as part of that coordination. As I say, we're not going to forecast an exact timeline here, but we anticipate getting through the process around year-end early next year. But as you said, the process here hasn't really kind of impeded our growth. 
We have seen a dozen or so private commercial insurance companies already reflect updates to their decision to their coverage to include the new indication. Obviously, the larger segment there is the Medicare segment, but it's good to kind to see that traction in the private segment. So very good quarter. We continue to see this expansion in the second half of the year and towards the end of the year looking at achieving the CMS reimbursement."

Well, so first, you made a comment that it touches every part of diagnostics. That's true. And these are 6 different systems, the immunoassay system, the clinical chemistry system, obviously a smaller point of care system for that market. There's a dedicated blood and plasma screening system, and then, of course, hematology and molecular. And they're all at various stages of rollout. The one that is the furthest along would be the rollout of our immunoassay and clinical chemistry systems in the core laboratories of Europe. We're also in the process of expanding menu approvals in the United States and China and Southeast Asia, where customers want to have a certain critical mass of menu as they make the conversion from whatever they're using to these new Alinity systems. 
So I'd say we're running as fast as we can, I think, at this point, in Europe, and that's going pretty well. There's over 3,000 systems placed now running test, generating revenue, et cetera. We do measure not just the deal, the close of a deal, et cetera. We measure what is called test of record when the account is up and running, generating results, generating tests, et cetera. 
And so I'd say that process is going well. That's going to begin to pick up more momentum in the United States as we're getting more and more menu breadth. Same with China. We're tracking all of that pretty closely as we build those menus. We're talking hundreds of tests. We did recently get approval for the Alinity as the blood and plasma screening system. Today, we screen about 80% of the world's blood supply as it is. This is -- it's an important transition product that labs, I think, will find more efficient, more economic, et cetera, but that's a plus. 
We closed and started up the Japanese Red Cross, which is the largest Japanese blood screening organization, and we took that from a long-standing Japanese competitor. So that was a big win for us. So there's just a lot of success that way. 
Hematology's in the very early stages of rolling out, the molecular system in the earliest stage of rolling out. And which is why this will be, I guess, a slower moving launch that's got sort of years of growth and momentum in it as we look over the next, call it, 5 to 7 years to completely replace an existing installed base and add a lot of new share and new volume. And to that end, I think we've quoted you before, that remains true. In accounts where we already have the business, we're winning about 95% of the time. And in accounts where we do not have the business, and there's an entrenched competitor of ours, we're winning about 60% of the time. Those win rates and penetration rates and share gains and so forth in our experience so far, over now what I said is over 3,000 instruments, tell us that we've got a very competitive system. We do run into, on the occasional accounts, a heavy-duty price-cutting. 
We've got a very disciplined system of our pricing and contracting in accounts. We have not had to do that. I think that speaks to the superiority of the instrument and assay offering. So we're feeling like our offering is uniquely competitive. It's borne out by the win rates no matter what type of account. It's unprecedented to launch these many systems across-the-board in all areas. So I think this only picks up momentum and gets better as the assay menu expands and as there's some experience in the field with the analyzers."

Well, I can tell you he's not playing golf. We -- I'd say a couple of things. First of all, we anticipated that for the time being, we wanted him to stay directly on top of the medical device business because he's been responsible for the bringing onboard St. Jude. As we acquired that, he was integral to that entire integration. We went through, with St. Jude, a reorganization of the business to align with the way we like to run a business at Abbott. And I guess I would describe that as we like to have a fully integrated business, meaning the general manager of that business, president of that business has responsibility for commercial -- the commercial people, commercial sales, of the customers, et cetera, but also manufacturing, R&D, technical support, service, et cetera. We like all those functions reporting into one GM. 
And so we realigned St. Jude. We did the same with Alere, quite frankly, when we took them over. And so each of the business has full integrated general management responsibility. And that was a transition, and Robert led that. It's all in place. That meant that we added a number of experienced general managers. We replaced some who had left us as part of the St. Jude or Alere acquisitions and so forth. So we went through a management transition. And at the same time, there's been a little bit of a generational change happening here. Quite certainly, there's been an awful lot of people that has been part of my management team for a long time. And a lot of our managers are long-term Abbott groomed and grown management team, but we've also been thinking about making sure that with all the growth we've got, the new products, the new organization, the new structure of that organization that we're always looking at the talent and the experience of our management team as we look forward now toward, let's just call it, a decade of what I think is going to be pretty robust growth. 
So in that, we needed to replace the EVP role that Robert has held previous to his Chief Operating Officer role. We did that. We went outside for that and, of course, sourced Lisa, who we think has terrific background and experience for that. We're very pleased to have brought fresh perspective and great experience and great energy level into the company. So we're very pleased with that. 
We went through a little further, I'd say, organization change to kind of break up what had gotten big and perhaps unwieldy, in some cases, into slightly smaller units because we are managing some pretty aggressive growth capital improvement, plant building, et cetera, in a number of these businesses, including diagnostics. And to give us more focus around it, we've done some of that adjusting. 
I feel like that's gone very smoothly and very well. Obviously, we read into Robert, who's in his mid-40s, moving up into the COO role, that we expect him to be in a key leadership role at the company for a long time. Read between the lines. 
And so there's a preparation process going on. And I think one of the most important things I can do, after leading the company for so long, is to make sure that when a transition comes, nobody notices. And the best legacy to leave is that the momentum of this company. Its growth and its prospects are every bit as good going forward as we think they are now and, from my perspective, a smooth leadership transition, which is not just me, it's literally right down through the upper ranks of all management is key and important. And I feel like of all of the sort of track record of legacies that I can give this company, I think a transition that way is probably the most important of all. 
So you can read into it that we're preparing for continuity of leadership, what I would call it, with no speed bumps. And I think that actually is going exceptionally well. Will I give you a time frame? No. Do I think we should be nervous about it? No. I think that this company is so poised to perform well across the board for years to come that I've got great confidence in that continuity and the management team because we've got a nice mix here of very experienced and trained Abbott people and people we've brought from other companies on the outside like Lisa. And I think the mix we've got in that team is exceptional. Robert's been with the company over 20 years. I've known him every bit of those 20-plus years, and I think he brings to his job right now tremendous experience, perspective, everything you would look for in a leader, as a COO of the company. So from my perspective, I think this is nothing but good and just keeps getting better."

And as we've said before, we're in a comfortable position of strategic flexibility, but that doesn't mean we're dying to go use it. 
So the next need was, obviously, we've got some capital to put into plant and expansion, and we've put a fair amount into both Diagnostics and Libre at this point. We're investing in expansion of plant and manufacturing for MitraClip and other products. So given that we've got an awful lot of growth happening and the potential for more, obviously, we've got to support that growth from a plant and capital standpoint in a timely fashion and appropriate quality and so forth, and we're doing that. And so there's capital use, et cetera, there. Will we continue to pay down debt? We will. We'll be prudent and careful about making sure it makes sense it's the right debt, right time and all that good stuff. 
We'll maintain a healthy, strong dividend. We increased it substantially at the end of last year. We'll continue to grow our dividend. Given where the PE is now, I've been told by a number of shareholders that trying to get that yield rate upward dividend funds are happy as is difficult, but that's a nice problem to have. We will continue to grow our dividend. It's been a hallmark of the company for decades, and it will continue to be. And then it's not always that prudent to buy back shares. The timing matters, the return matters, et cetera. Is it an option? Yes, it is. I probably won't get too carried away because, frankly, we're able to grow and return cash to shareholders a number of different ways and return good return to our shareholders. So it's always an option as it presents itself. We've just got a lot we can do. If you're asking about M&A and other things, we don't feel like right now that we need something, nor do we think we see something that we can add sufficient value to, to make it worth it to invest in. And we've got so many organic growth opportunities that, while we continue to monitor and we're always tracking opportunities in all of our businesses, I can't tell you that, that's real front burner right now. We don't ignore it. We don't -- we try to maintain our currency on the things that we might be interested in. We just did a small acquisition in Germany. That's a nice adjunctive thing to our Diagnostics business in terms of automation and so forth. There are things like that, that I think are valuable for us. But we have so much growth potential and opportunity in devices, diagnostics, even nutrition and pharma that we're just not out cut and real hard on the M&A front right now, nor do I foresee that being true for quite a while. So that's the capital side. 
On the expense side, we're always trying to balance the voracious appetite of investors for growing earnings with investing in the growth of the business. And I doubt that there's a general manager or business at Abbott that wouldn't claim that if we gave them more money, they could spend it effectively and efficiently to grow our products faster. So we're always trying to find the right balance of how much gas that's thrown in the fire or the growth of the products with returning a healthy return to the expectations of our investors. I think that's always a balance because there's always some investor who thinks there must be an extra $0.01 in the quarter. And I was speaking to somebody this morning who asked about that very issue of another $0.01. And I said, ""The issue here is much bigger than $0.01."" We've got tremendous growth. Our top line were accelerating. It's strong. It's sustainable. This isn't about $0.01 in a given quarter, this is about a pretty, healthy sales growth rate and a commensurate healthy growth rate on the bottom line that's unusual in our sector and particularly unusual for companies of our size to be able to sustain such a healthy growth rate with so much new product richness for the coming years. And it's not a coming quarter, it's coming years. 
So you raised the right question, is how do we keep investing in the spending in R&D and the sales and marketing expenses to drive that growth? And we're trying to find that right balance as well by putting enough fuel to the fire here to drive the growth rates even higher"

How do you just think about the ability to sustain that level of growth? It seems that Medical Devices has a bit of a tale of 2 cities with several businesses reporting really nice, strong double-digit growth, but a couple of obvious businesses kind of still lagging around that flattish growth. How do you kind of think about the longer-term dynamic there?"
247483,622961692,1773679,"Abbott Laboratories, Q2 2019 Earnings Call, Jul 17, 2019",2019-07-17,"Earnings Calls","Abbott Laboratories","Executives","Yes. You've got a mix of business this year. You've got some that are a little mature than others, some that have brand new products that are perfect innovations. In general, in Medical Devices, innovation is what drives the growth. And over time, that's",639,"Yes. You've got a mix of business this year. You've got some that are a little mature than others, some that have brand new products that are perfect innovations. In general, in Medical Devices, innovation is what drives the growth. And over time, that's the case. And different businesses are at different stages of either maturity or new innovation. We believe there's still a lot of opportunity there. 
I remember in my discussions with Dan Starks when we were renegotiating over the acquisition of St. Jude, Dan felt pretty strongly that the pipeline of St. Jude was underappreciated and, that in their own internal models, that the growth rate was out there in the high single digits. The Street didn't agree with that at the time because it didn't see it yet, et cetera. But Dan was right, and I think that we've seen that in the performance of the medical device business we acquired from St. Jude because it's been performing at sort of a 9% to 10% level as new products have gone to the market, either replacing older products or just simply brand new products altogether. 
So I'd say the first thing about Medical Devices is you've got to keep innovating in new spaces. MitraClip's new space, Heart Failure and HeartMate and so forth, these are new spaces, new technologies, et cetera. Libre is that. Libre is unique. It approaches a mass market, not a niche market. Most medical devices address niches of therapy. But diabetes is something that affects more than 80 million people around the world who would benefit from Libre in about a 50-50 split of type 1s and type 2s. And that is massive. It's unlike anything seen before in device for diagnostic businesses. And so there's just an enormous, enormous opportunity there. To be honest, traditional medical device companies aren't used to having to deal with at that kind of scale. 
And so we're addressing that by investing very heavily in manufacturing expansion, so that we can go after the mass market, not a niche. And so I think the sustainability of the growth is driven not only by the innovation, but the ability to go after much bigger markets at a much more affordable level. More people will have access. There will be more growth as we make technologies and products more and more affordable. 
And then finally, you asked about some of the businesses that aren't growing that fast. And I'd say, well, I'm always disappointed that they're not growing as fast as we'd like them to, but I am pleased that we've seen sequential improvement quarter-to-quarter in almost all of them. We've seen that in CRM. We've seen it neuromod. We've seen it even EPD and stents and so forth. We're seeing incremental improvement. Some of these businesses as more mature businesses may not see strong or high single digit or double digit growth, but I think they're still capable of pretty strong growth in the low to mid-single-digit area, and there's still a lot of upside. 
If we take a CRM business from what is flat slightly negative to 3% or 4%, that's a pretty big bump in growth. We'd be -- if it was going from 10% to 14%, we'd be all excited about it. So the same incremental growth improvement, I think, is possible. It's just at a lower level. So I think that there's a lot here to sustain the kind of growth we're seeing. There's always going to be new products like Libre or a MitraClip or a HeartMate that singularly for a period of time disproportionally drive the overall growth. One of the benefits of having many businesses in the device arena is there's always going to be somewhere that's growing that way and other places where we're innovating for the future."

So we've completed that, and now, obviously, the focus is improving the productivity of that sales team. And we saw that in the second quarter. If you look at some of the KPIs, we look at whether it's trials or trial to permanent implant conversion rates. We saw definitely sequential improvement versus Q1, and we expect that to improve as we go into the second half of this year. 
A big portion of this also is, I'd say, product innovation life cycle. You've seen a couple of quarters now where there really hasn't been any kind of launch from competitors in this space. That's a key driver also. So sales force productivity and execution, we'll start to see some of our innovation output we made double the investment in that R&D business over the last couple of years.

I remember I've got this call or this question last quarter, I can't recall if it was you, on whether we thought we could get the $5 billion and how soon, and gosh, 3 months later, it's $10 billion. I've got the same ambitions, to be honest. I just wouldn't have expected them 90 days later. But to answer your question, I think that kind of potential is there. I think it's awfully hard to speculate about a number that big. But will we -- do I think we'll get the $5 billion? And do I think we'll do it in a reasonable time, $5 billion of sales over? Yes, I do. And I think it's -- the growth rate here is reflective of not only the size of the market, but the need and utility and affordability of the product. And I think it's just, as I've said many times, it's a very different market where affordability and the utility, the access, all those things make this a mass market product, not a niche. And it's designed for that. It's priced for that. It's a very profitable product. And we're going through the large-scale, scale-up of addressing that kind of growth, which is unprecedented for products in our space. 
So do I think it can grow to that sort of level? I won't jinx anything by trying to make some prognostication about $10 billion, but I would say that I think it's got enormous potential. And it's got potential beyond glucose. It's got potential as a wearable in other analytes and other products over time. We have R&D programs underway, not only for the repeated enhancement, improvement, expansion of Libre, but also in the other categories beyond diabetes and other analytes and so forth. So I think that there's just a lot of things that will evolve over the coming years here that, today, people weren't even contemplating with the product. We're going as hard as we can at the glucose opportunity, which is enormous. But there's so much more beyond that, that, I think, at least to your aspirational consideration, to be honest, has validity. I'm just not ready to put any numbers around it."

I think when we went out about this several years ago, the challenge here, Matt, wasn't to get an accurate reading of glucose from interstitial fluid. Navigator, when we have launched it back in 2008, we were able to do that. It was very accurate, and we're able to get an accurate reading. The challenge that we went about with Libre is how to do that in a way that is cost-effective for the health systems and for consumers and for all of that. So that was what we really went after, is how can you get the accurate reading at a cost position at the core of Libre? And you might remember at the time, Navigator at the time was considered the most accurate sensor. In the core of Libre is that chemistry, is that core technology of Navigator, which provides accurate, reliable readings, but we're able to do that at a cost position that now makes sense for the insurance and for the payer community and the health systems to cover it. It wasn't a question of whether the outcomes were right or whether the outcomes were enough. They were convinced that the outcomes were there for sensor-based glucose monitoring. It was just, can I now do it in a way that makes sense for me to do it on a mass scale? And Miles just talked about this about mass scale. That's what we went after 10 years ago. And that's at the core. And I think maybe that's misunderstood because a lot of this discussion gets focused on, well, accuracy at this level and accuracy at that level. And the reality is accuracy is obviously important, but our goal here is to make this massively available without having to sacrifice accuracy. And the fact that we priced it at a different price point wouldn't say necessarily imply that it's somehow missing something, we just have a different strategy and adjustment view of what we could do."

Ours is not expensive, and it's not high cost. It does not lack for clinical performance, accuracy or any of the like. But because the manufacturing is so sophisticated and automated, we were able to achieve a pretty low cost in what is a pretty sophisticated product. It's a highly profitable product, so we haven't compromised that it's a product that is successful in terms of profit. That's not been compromised at all. It has a completely different design and approach and cost structure. It relies on scale for that cost, and we've actually seen improving gross margin. 
We've told you before the gross margin is over 60%. It is and rising. And that's with a heavy capital investment, so that we can produce the kind of volume that is broadly available. So I think among the misunderstandings out there, I think people say, ""Well, geez, how do you make money?"" Oh, we make money. We do just fine, thank you. And the product is designed to be affordable and accessible. I guess, there are some days when we think, if the health care market community ensures payers, Congress, patients, whatever, I always say it's got to be lower cost. The health care has got to be more affordable. Here's our example. And it is. It's massively so. And so we've gone at it with that approach to make it broadly available. Broadly, in this case means 80 million people worldwide. That's unprecedented. 
So I'm not sure that the device community has totally understood it because it's so different. But we keep saying so. And I think now as the new capacity comes online, we've also staged the capacity so that literally, every 90 days, we're adding another increment, significant incremental capacity. We will not be capacity-constrained. And that kind of release is a lot of freedom to market and push the product forward and even open up markets we haven't opened yet. So I think there's a lot of opportunity here. And I think to, I think, opportunity -- there's opportunity for a number of things like this, as I mentioned earlier, in what's called the wearables market, the more affordable and accessible technologies make products like this, then I think we're going to see a very different market expansion."

Today, we reported results of another strong quarter with ongoing earnings per share of $0.84, reflecting 12% growth on an absolute basis and even higher growth when excluding the impact of currency. 
Sales increased more than 7.5% on an organic basis in the quarter led by double-digit growth in Medical Devices and sequential improvements in Established Pharmaceuticals and Diagnostics. We also mirrored our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance range to $3.23 to $3.25, which at current rates would reflect high teens growth excluding the impact of currency and is at the upper end of the range we set that the beginning of the year.
As we've discussed previously, following our recent strategic shaping and acquisitions, we've been completely focused on running the company we built. This focus on organic execution is delivering strong performance on a remarkably consistent basis. Over the last 8 quarters, we've averaged 7.5% organic sales growth worldwide with very little variation. We've also continued to strengthen our portfolio with new products, expanded access and reimbursement coverage and generated new clinical data that further enhances the sustainability of our strong growth outlook going forward.
I'm particularly pleased with the continued exceptional performance across several of our key growth platforms, including FreeStyle Libre, MitraClip and Alinity, which I'll highlight as I summarize our third quarter results in more detail. 
And I'll start in our Medical Devices business were sales increased double-digit for the second quarter in a row. In Structural Heart, we achieved 16% sales growth led by MitraClip, our market-leading device for the treatment of mitral regurgitation or leaking heart valve. MitraClip sales increased more than 30% in the quarter, including U.S. growth of nearly 50%. During the quarter, we received U.S. FDA approval for our next generation MitraClip device, and we initiated the first-ever U.S. pubertal trial for the minimally invasive treatment of tricuspid regurgitation, which will evaluate the safety and efficacy of our TriClip repair system.
Turning now to FreeStyle Libre, our market-leading continuous glucose monitoring system that eliminates the need for routine fingersticks. We achieved sales of $0.5 billion in the quarter and continued to add significantly to our global user base as reflected by our organic sales growth of nearly 70%. During the quarter, FreeStyle Libre obtained public reimbursement coverage in Ontario and Quebec, becoming the first and only center-based glucose monitoring system to be listed by any provincial health plan in Canada. 
We also continued to advance our strategy to develop integrated solutions where people with diabetes can seamlessly manage their condition across devices, including recent announcements that we're seeking to integrate Libre with the insulin delivery technologies of Sanofi and Tandem as well as the digital care platform of Omada Health. These easy-to-use, affordable device is changing the way millions people managed their diabetes and our ongoing efforts to expand awareness, adoption and access for Libre around the world will drive tremendous growth for years to come.
Turning now to Diagnostics where sales grew 6.5% in the quarter led by double-digit growth in Core Laboratory Diagnostics. The rollout of Alinity in Europe and other international markets continues to drive strong growth in our core laboratory business outside the U.S. In the U.S. where we continue to outperform the market with our legacy architect system, we've made good progress achieving regulatory approvals of immunoassay and clinical chemistry tests for Alinity and are beginning to ramp up our launch efforts in these areas. With highly differentiated instruments and a matrix rollout across multiple geographies and diagnostic testing areas over time, Alinity is well positioned to be a multiyear growth platform for our Diagnostics business. 
In Nutrition, sales increased nearly 4% in the quarter led by double-digit growth in international Adult Nutrition for the third quarter in a row. In Pediatric Nutrition, above market growth in the U.S. and several other countries was partially offset by challenging market dynamics in Greater China, which comprises a little less than 10% of our overall nutrition sales. While consumers continue to trade up to premium brands, which is a segment where we compete, we've seen volume in a market decline due to historically low birth rates. We remain focused on strengthening our portfolio and competitiveness across the various segments and purchasing channels in China and, given our broad portfolio and global footprint, anticipate continued strong performance across other geographies and long-term growth opportunities such as Adult Nutrition.
I'll wrap up with Established Pharmaceuticals, or EPD, where sales increased 8% in the quarter led by strong growth in several geographies including India, China and Brazil. Sales growth in EPD has now improved sequentially for each of the last 3 quarters. With leading market positions in several international growth geographies, EPD is well positioned for sustained above market growth in some of the largest and fastest growing pharmaceutical markets in the world.
So in summary, we're performing extremely well across several areas of our portfolio, resulting in another quarter of strong sales and earnings growth. We continue to strengthen our product portfolios and key product platforms with a steady cadence of new product approvals, reimbursement coverage and clinical data. And we're well on track to deliver ongoing EPS and organic sales growth at the upper ends of the ranges we set at the beginning of the year. 
I'll now turn the call over to Brian to discuss our results and outlook for the year in more detail. Brian?"

As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis, which is consistent with our previous guidance.
Turning to our results. Sales for the third quarter increased 7.6% on an organic basis. During the quarter, we saw the U.S. dollar strengthened modestly, resulting in an unfavorable impact on sales of 1.9% from exchange or 50 basis points higher than [indiscernible] Study since the time of our call in July. Reported sales increased 5.5% in the quarter. 
Regarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 59.2% of sales. Adjusted R&D investment was 7% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense was 29.1% of sales.
Turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter. We forecast adjusted EPS of $0.94 to $0.96, which reflects nearly 17.5% growth at the midpoint. We forecast organic sales growth of around 8% and at current rates, we expect the exchange to have a negative impact of somewhat above 1.5% on fourth quarter reported sales. We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of approximately 59.5% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of around 7% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense approaching 27.5% of sales.
Before we open the call for questions, I'll now provide a quick overview of our fourth quarter organic sales growth outlook by business. For Established Pharmaceuticals, we forecast high single-digit growth. In Nutrition, we forecast low to mid-single-digit growth. In Diagnostics, we forecast and mid- to high single digits growth. And in Medical Devices, we forecast growth similar to the third quarter, which reflects continued double-digit growth in several areas of this business.
With that, we'll now open the call for questions."

We've got sequential growth in a number of areas that we expected improvement in and we're saying that. EPD comes to mind. Obviously, our growth drivers, Libre and MitraClip and the Alinity systems, et cetera, are all very strong, Structural Heart is very strong. As I've said in the past, many times, this is sustainable and strong going forward. I see no change of momentum, no change to progress, no change to growth rates. If anything, I think, it gets better. And it clearly will in the fourth quarter. So it's pretty strong. And the earnings flows with it.

We're currently working through a handful of open items with the agency. And what I can tell you, I've got the same confidence level that Miles does. I'm confident in the data. I'm confident in the product, right? In the meantime, if you look at Libre in Q3, we had an exceptional Q3. Sales of just under $0.5 billion, that puts us on a $2 billion run rate here with growth rate over 70%. Our international business grew 50%. And that's on a large base. And then the U.S. sales nearly tripled. So -- and it's tripled because we're adding new patients at a strong and steady rate. And it's a higher rate. And you can see that progression in our [indiscernible]. And one of the challenges we've had over like the 9 months here is really been how to pull our demand generation activities with aligning to our supply. We talked a little bit about supply constraints. So we've now released in the third quarter, towards the end of the third quarter, our next launch of manufacturing capacity, on plan, on schedule. And I can tell you, the commercial team right now is really feeling excited about not being able to have that constraint over and really start to intensify the commercial promotional efforts, whether that's advertising, whether that's sampling, et cetera. Both in the U.S. and international. I think that gives us a lot of excitement as we exit the year going into next year. 
The value proposition still continues to be very strong to patients and physicians and to payers. And as Miles mentioned in his opening comments, we achieved a reimbursement in Canada, public reimbursement, the only sensor system reimbursed in Canada. And it's important because it's one of the top 5 largest glucose monitoring markets in the world. And similar to what we saw in some of these large markets when we obtained national reimbursement, we see a pretty accelerated kind of explosive growth. We saw that in Germany, we saw that in France and U.K. So we expect to see that same trajectory in Canada and early indications suggest that kind of same curve. So that'll be also excited for the team as we move into Q4. 
And as Miles also said, we're pleased with the partnership strategy that we've adopted. We've gone through at a very intentional phased approach. First with Bigfoot, as you know, we then moved into announcing our agreements with insulin manufacturers like Novo and Sanofi that connect Libre to their pen systems. In the next phase here will start to move into insulin pumps. And that was with the agreement that we announced yesterday with Tandem to codevelop an integrated system because we know this is an important segment also, connecting to pumps, and we're now at a phase where we feel we could start to kind of roll that out as we thought about our partnership strategies. So I think momentum here on Libre is exceptional. It is very strong. As we go into Q4, I think we've got a lot of stuff going right, firing on all cylinders, whether it's commercial, whether it's operation, whether it's R&D program. I'm very confident on the sustainability of Libre and Libre going forward."

And I think we find ourselves in a good capital balance. I think we're -- we've gotten to the place where net debt-to-EBITDA ratio is well ahead of what we targeted, probably a year earlier than we expected, that's aggressive pay down strategy, et cetera. Our business is performing strong. Our cash flows are strong. And we still continue to pay down debt, we can. Can we refinanced debt? We can. Can we do think that are prudent, good balance sheet management? Yes. And we're also generating cash. We are generating sufficient cash, more than sufficient cash, to invest in a lot of manufacturing, expansion for all the new products we've talked about. Robert just mentioned one of the biggest. And that's fully funded. And obviously coming online and good. 
So you say, all right, then how about the dividend? Well, we raised the dividend 14% last December. And we have a targeted range where we like to keep that dividend as a percent of our EPS, et cetera. So as we go across all the things you can do with your cash, returning cash to shareholders is also a positive thing to do, if the conditions are right and if the return is good, et cetera. And we want to be prepared to have that flexibility on the table as well. We have not done significant share repurchases, as you know, for several years while we focused on the paydown of debt. But now, we wanted to add back the flexibility to do that as well. So I'd say, in general, we find ourselves in a strong cash position, strong performance position, good strong balance sheet position. We can continue to pay down some debt. But we've got the flexibility to do just about whatever makes sense for us on a return basis or return to shareholder basis. We don't have any active M&A on the radar screen to the extent that we trap or follow anything, I'd say it's your typical bolt-ones and tuck-ins and so forth that are additions to already strong businesses. We're pretty happy with our pipeline. We're pretty happy with our R&D pipeline. So our standards are pretty high right now about what's attractive and what may not be. But I'm not forecasting anything significant at all in the M&A area. So obviously, we want to keep our options open here with how we manage cash for shareholder."

So I think we'll be in the December-January time frame kind of get exactly what core that's going to land in. But in the meantime, you see kind of our growth rate. The reimbursements are going to be important, but Structural Heart was up mid-teens and the big driver of that was MitraClip, up 30%, up 50% in the U.S. So reimbursement is going to be important. There are definitely going to be an inflection point when we get it. But as I said in the previous call, that is a component, it's a building block here that we're focusing on. So opening new centers is another kind of key building block. We have about 400 today and I do want to get to about 550 over time. And we've been supporting that we've made investments. Investments in our sales force, clinical specialist, our therapy development specialist so that we can only train the centers, train the implanters to keep up with the demand that we see, but also to support the demand generation through the development of these patient referral networks. So that investment is ongoing, on target, on plan. It's how we're ramping up the field team. As Miles said in his opening comments, we continue to invest also in the innovation side, on the product development side, so in July we obtained approval for our fourth generation MitraClip, which has independent graspers, more sizes, et cetera. It speaks of more options to the business. And so I think that MitraClip here is in its early innings and I think this is a multiyear, multibillion dollar growth opportunity that we've got and it's just going to continue to ramp over time and we're making the investments to make sure we're going to lead in that. So as I look at 2020, I think we've got the right momentum and once we have NCD coverage, yes, I think, they'll be an inflection to growth."

As Miles mentioned, we're saying the consumer trade up into the premium brand segment, but  the volume has been declining, partly because of these low birth rates. So this has led to what I would say a much more competitive environment, competitive in terms of pricing, competitive in terms of promotional activities. And this has now got our full attention. Full attention from the management team here. And our key thing is really focusing and the market dynamics are the market dynamics, but we've got to really focus on improving our competitive fitness, our competitive position here in the pediatric segment. We're launching a series of new strategies here in the coming weeks regarding our media campaigns, strengthening our consumer relationship platforms. We've got some plans to launch some new products over the next several quarters.

While it's affecting some segments of the U.S. economy and U.S. businesses pretty directly, it doesn't seem to be affecting us or our business. The nutrition challenge we have is completely separate from any kind of trade or economic or economy issues other than birth rates. And the performance in our Device businesses, our Diagnostics businesses and so forth are double digits and strong. There's all kinds of ways that people can hypothesize that maybe the Chinese government would intervene and make things more difficult and so forth for U.S. multinationals. But in our business, we actually don't see that. The product approvals are coming in a timely manner, the China FDA is doing everything that they're supposed to do for our products. We haven't seen any of that kind of friction at all and the demand for our products and the performance of our businesses in China has been strong.

But there are -- the advancement of healthcare systems, the advancement in demand for health products, pharmaceuticals, et cetera, strong. China in particular for us for our pharmaceutical business, strong. We're doing well. I don't think we have a lot of exposure. I'll let Robert expand on that on a minute. But overall, I think, the conditions for us in those markets remain strong. As we've said many, many times, single most difficult thing we deal with is the volatile currency, if it's volatile. Sometimes it is, sometimes it isn't. And right now, currency isn't exactly working in our favor in those markets. So while we grow at a pretty healthy rate on an underlying basis and typically faster than the market, currency erases some of that. Robert?"

You were absolutely correct. Foreign exchange had an impact on us of about 50 basis points. Otherwise, it would be 59.7%. So I feel good about where we're guiding Q4. Q4 tends to be that quarter where we get a little bit more natural leverage as well. And you see that play out through the bottom line. Pretty consistent with how we thought about this at the beginning of the year. As you know, I mean gross margin improvement is just part of our DNA. It's part of what we do and how we think about it in addition to cash flow and is something we're going to continue to improve upon across all of our businesses. I think you can expect that to continue in the next year. That's how we get to double-digit growth that usually start with and continue to invest back into our SG&A and R&D for our growth."

If you think about Core Lab and the rollout of Alinity program, it's doing very well. And you can see that in our top line. The rollout has been particularly strong in Europe. We're winning over 50% of the businesses where we targeted an entrenched competitor. And if you think about kind of the renewal process, we're retaining nearly all of our current business that comes up for contract. So we placed over 3,000 -- over 3,700 instruments. When we gave out that number, we're talking about instruments that are actually placed in the market, placed in the account, running tests and generating revenue. So that's gone very well. In the quarter, you're so that we also got an approval in the U.S. for the Alinity blood and plasma screening. So this fourth quarter here, the team is kind of rolling out that commercial launch. We had a lot of success in rolling out the blood plasma systems in Europe and in Asia last year. So it's great to see that, a little bit ahead of schedule here in the U.S. and teams have jumped on the opportunity. As it relates to the immunoassay side, a lot of our focus here is really kind of ramping up on the R&D side, ramping up the menu and the assay menu. I'd say that assay completion rate of what we need to be kind of fully competitive in Europe is getting close to about 100% mark that we need. And in the U.S., it's a little bit behind. A lot of our focus here is just to get those systems, those assays approved and in place. And we'll start to see that kind of play affecting our growth rate in the U.S. as we move into next year. So I think internationally, we're doing really well. U.S., we've got the opportunity here as the assays come onboard to be able to accelerate our growth rates. So I'm really pleased with the momentum that the team has done here. Of course, we feel we can always do better and that's what we're going to keep on pushing too."

So obviously, still work in progress here. It's a little bit longer than we had initially hoped. When we talked about it over the last couple of quarters, we talked about the sales force hiring, the sales force productivity and it's a very specific selling process here in devices. If you're new rep, it takes some time to kind of understand it. So that's been going -- that's been progressing well. We've had some stabilization in the sales force and some of the monthly KPIs that we track them on, they're approving. But we've also seen, as you pointed out, a little bit of a market decline, especially the first half of this year. And it follows a couple of years of double-digit growth, right? So a lot of our focus here has got to be on sales force execution and productivity, the approval of [ ProClaim XR ] this quarter, I think, really provides a nice addition to the portfolio. It provide the salesforce with a new technology to promote and over the of the launch, it's only been a couple of weeks. But early signs are positive. We tend to look at our trials on our trials across the U.S. in spinal as our leading indicator. And I'd say early signs are positive, but there's more monitoring there for us to be aware of. On the market side, there's real no third-party data source here like we have in stents or pacemakers, et cetera. So it's a little bit difficult to peg the growth rate here. We usually have to wait until everybody reports and can kind of look it up and add it up and kind of see where it's at. I would anticipate here Q3 to be similar in terms of market growth rate as the first half of this year, which is in that low to mid-single-digit decline here."

Rick, I'd say I'm never quite as satisfied as I'd like to be. That's for sure. What -- we learned a couple of things.

Rick, I'd say I'm never quite as satisfied as I'd like to be. That's for sure. What -- we learned a couple of things. I think of the 7 or 8 years we've now been fundamentally focused on emerging markets and their growing economies and so forth, I'd say if anything was underestimated, it was the degree of volatility of currency, which was also heavily driven by the strength of the U.S. dollar. And while we can't predict those things, so this business is 100% in emerging markets. That's always a bit of a challenge. Now that said, the underlying growth in those markets has been steadily strong. It's interesting. 1 indicator for attractiveness for those markets is -- let's just say the multiples and prices and so forth that anybody who owns a pharmaceutical business in those markets thinks that the company is worse. And [indiscernible] a long time, they're probably some of the highest multiples in the world in any business, for businesses that make money. They're are attractive. The markets are attractive. And the attractive parts of branded, generic pharmaceutical worldwide. They're the most profitable. They're very profitable markets for good branded products as compared to Europe or the U.S. or something like that if you're in that business. We've targeted for this business for a reason. There's underlying real growth, brands matter, quality matters, breadth matters. And it's kind of all the fundamentals that we think are stable, durable, attractive, et cetera. And frankly, all those economies have progressed as we would like. Maybe not as stably and maybe not as strongly in some cases, but the growth there is still strong. Our own challenge is the R&D investments to continue to expand product lines and product depth into the markets. We keep our R&D somewhat decentralized by region. India has its own, Latin America has its own, et cetera. We're always looking for greater and greater productivity and greater and greater launch activity out of our teams. Every now and then, we're going to run into an Argentina, a Venezuela or a tax issue in a country like we did in India a couple of years ago, et cetera. They're going to put a dent in the growth rate for a given year and we've seen that. But the underlying fundamentals are quite strong, quite good. We keep plugging away on all the fundamentals that we know how to manage. And as you can tell, this last year, we've had steady sequential improvement in our performance, excluding exchange. And they're up at 8%. I think that's pretty good. That means we know how to take the corrective actions to get stronger, to get better, to drive the business better. And I think the fact that the managers of pharmaceutical business are up to an 8% growth rate, we're looking forward to even improvement. And that, I think that's pretty strong. So yes, we like the business."

So we expect kind of midyear approval here and launch. And we're getting ready for that. On your question on vascular, as we've previously mentioned, there are couple of what I would call noncommercial items had impacted growth rate here. These are third-party loyalties, third-party manufacturing agreements that we put in place as part of the same divestiture of some of the assets. So those -- as those ramp down, as those manufacturing agreements ramp down, those royalties ramp down, they obviously impact the growth rate. And we've allocated those agreements into the U.S. line even though they're global, they're global agreements. So if you remove those items that are naturally going down as we transition to manufacturing over to the new owners of those businesses and as royalties ramp down, you remove that out, our Vascular business was flat. And the dynamic there was really a little bit of pricing that we've seen on the stent side. We've continued to grow share in the U.S. actually and maintain our leadership position in the international markets. And that price pressure was then offset double-digit growth in our endo and peripheral business and in our imaging and diagnostic business. And that's part of our strategy, which is we know there would be some pricing pressure on the DES side. We know we need to make our investments to maintain our competitive position there. But we also know that we're over investing in our Endo and our Imaging strategy so that those businesses could get large enough and that those double digits can really return Vascular to a healthy growth rate."

The one way to describe it here is pretty large and it's growing. We focus a lot on the sales side. But if you look at the user base where you're up the 1.5 million, close to 1.6 million users at the end of this quarter",410,"Yes. So let's talk about that base. The one way to describe it here is pretty large and it's growing. We focus a lot on the sales side. But if you look at the user base where you're up the 1.5 million, close to 1.6 million users at the end of this quarter, as we talked a little bit of constraint on that user base given our manufacturing capacity. So as we've now unleashed it, I think we got the potential here to kind of grow that user base even faster. One of the things that is important here that we've seen as payers and contract start to look at this is that they're very convinced on the outcomes of using sensor-based technology. There's a lot of clinical data that proves that. We actually have RCT trials that show Libre reduces hypo, reduces time out of range, reduces the time that patients are in hypoglycemia. And we backed it up with some fairly large real world evidence showing that. And competitors also have that, too. So the value proposition here is how do you get that outcome at a cost that makes sense for the payer where they can actually expand the use of the product and the technology into a much larger user base versus kind of ditching into kind of very small segments. And that's been the value proposition that we've adopted. And as I said in the beginning of the call, that value proposition is not only very intact, but it is growing. And we see that in the negotiations we've had with Canadian reimbursement authorities. We see that expansion of the technology beyond just type 1 or insulin users in other markets. We started seeing it expand into type 2. So we think the value proposition here is very strong. And it's a real opportunity to provide the benefits of the outcomes that are proven at a cost profile that makes sense for the payers. And it's ultimately about having the impact on outcomes for patients. And we're seeing that through our trials and through our real world evidence. If you think about the composition of the patients, we're looking at 50-50. We're getting a lot of type 1s and insulin users, but we're also getting a lot of type 2s, type 2s that are on single injections or type 2s that are in oral medication. There's different utilization rates, but we're getting on those patients."

And as we look into 2020, I see no reason to change any expectations about the strength of our top line sales growth rate, which is, I think all of you know, for a fairly large company, unusual to find. The other people that are able to do this are tech companies. And so we got some great strengths here owing to the strength of our pipeline, our new product launches, the improvements to access and/or reimbursements and further capabilities of those products. So we've got a good sustainable road ahead of us. Obviously, there are surprises or things that don't meet our expectations from time to time or the speed with which we want to accomplish things.

We also narrowed off our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance range to $3.23 to $3.25, which, at current rates, would reflect high-teens growth, excluding the impact of currency and is at the upper end of the range we set at the beginning of the year.
As we've discussed previously, following our recent strategic shaping and acquisitions, we've been completely focused on running the company we built. This focus on organic execution is delivering strong performance on a remarkably consistent basis. Over the last 8 quarters, we've averaged 7.5% organic sales growth worldwide with very little variation. We've also continued to strengthen our portfolio with new products, expanded access on reimbursement coverage and generated new clinical data that further enhances the sustainability of our strong growth outlook going forward.
I'm particularly pleased with the continued exceptional performance across several of our key growth platforms, including FreeStyle Libre, MitraClip and Alinity, which I'll highlight as I summarize our third quarter results in more detail. 
And I'll start in our Medical Devices business where sales increased double digits for the second quarter in a row. In Structural Heart, we achieved 16% sales growth led by MitraClip, our market-leading device for the treatment of mitral regurgitation or leaking heart valve. MitraClip sales increased more than 30% in the quarter, including U.S. growth of nearly 50%. During the quarter, we received U.S. FDA approval for our next-generation MitraClip device, and we initiated the first-ever U.S. pivotal trial for the minimally invasive treatment of tricuspid regurgitation, which will evaluate the safety and efficacy of our TriClip repair system.
Turning now to FreeStyle Libre, our market-leading continuous glucose monitoring system that eliminates the need for routine fingersticks. We achieved sales of $0.5 billion in the quarter and continued to add significantly to our global user base, as reflected by organic sales growth of nearly 70%. During the quarter, FreeStyle Libre obtained public reimbursement coverage in Ontario and Quebec, becoming the first and only sensor-based glucose monitoring system to be listed by any provincial health plan in Canada. 
We also continued to advance our strategy to develop integrated solutions where people with diabetes can seamlessly manage their condition across devices, including recent announcements that we're seeking to integrate Libre with the insulin delivery technologies of Sanofi and Tandem as well as the digital care platform of Omada Health. This easy-to-use, affordable device is changing the way millions of people manage their diabetes. And our ongoing efforts to expand awareness, adoption and access for Libre around the world will drive tremendous growth for years to come.
Turning now to Diagnostics where sales grew 6.5% in the quarter led by double-digit growth in Core Laboratory Diagnostics. The rollout of Alinity in Europe and other international markets continues to drive strong growth in our Core Laboratory business outside the U.S. In the U.S. where we continue to outperform the market with our legacy ARCHITECT system, we've made good progress achieving regulatory approvals of immunoassay and clinical chemistry test for Alinity and are beginning to ramp up our launch efforts in these areas. With highly differentiated instruments and a matrix rollout across multiple geographies and diagnostic testing areas over time, Alinity is well positioned to be a multiyear growth platform for our Diagnostics business. 
In Nutrition, sales increased nearly 4% in the quarter led by double-digit growth in international Adult Nutrition for the third quarter in a row. In Pediatric Nutrition, above-market growth in the U.S. and several other countries was partially offset by challenging market dynamics in Greater China, which comprises a little less than 10% of our overall nutrition sales. While consumers continue to trade up for premium brands, which is the segment where we compete, we've seen volume in the market decline due to historically low birth rates. We remain focused on strengthening our portfolio and competitiveness across the various segments and purchasing channels in China and, given our broad portfolio and global footprint, anticipate continued strong performance across other geographies and long-term growth opportunities such as Adult Nutrition.
I'll wrap up with Established Pharmaceuticals, or EPD, where sales increased 8% in the quarter led by strong growth in several geographies including India, China and Brazil. Sales growth in EPD has now improved sequentially for each of the last 3 quarters. With leading market positions in several international growth geographies, EPD is well positioned for sustained above-market growth in some of the largest and fastest growing pharmaceutical markets in the world.
So in summary, we're performing extremely well across several areas of the portfolio, resulting in another quarter of strong sales and earnings growth. We continue to strengthen our product portfolios and key product platforms with a steady cadence of new product approvals, reimbursement coverage and clinical data. And we're well on track to deliver ongoing EPS and organic sales growth at the upper ends of the ranges we set at the beginning of the year. 
I'll now turn the call over to Brian to discuss our results and outlook for the year in more detail. Brian?"

As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis, which is consistent with our previous guidance.
Turning to our results. Sales for the third quarter increased 7.6% on an organic basis. During the quarter, we saw the U.S. dollar strengthened modestly, resulting in an unfavorable impact on sales of 1.9% from exchange or 50 basis points higher than if rates held steady since the time of our call in July. Reported sales increased 5.5% in the quarter. 
Regarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 59.2% of sales, adjusted R&D investment was 7% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense was 29.1% of sales.
Turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter. We forecast adjusted EPS of $0.94 to $0.96, which reflects nearly 17.5% growth at the midpoint. We forecast organic sales growth of around 8% and, at current rates, would expect exchange to have a negative impact of somewhat above 1.5% on fourth quarter reported sales. We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of approximately 59.5% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of around 7% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense approaching 27.5% of sales.
Before we open the call for questions, I'll now provide a quick overview of our fourth quarter organic sales growth outlook by business. For Established Pharmaceuticals, we forecast high single-digit growth. In Nutrition, we forecast low to mid-single-digit growth. In Diagnostics, we forecast mid- to high single-digit growth. And in Medical Devices, we forecast growth similar to the third quarter, which reflects continued double-digit growth in several areas of this business.
With that, we will now open the call for questions."

And frankly, I've seen no change to that. I don't see any change to momentum at all here. If anything, we've got pretty strong momentum across the board. We've got sequential growth in a number of areas that we've expected improvement in, and we're seeing that. EPD comes to mind. 
Obviously, our growth drivers, Libre and MitraClip and the Alinity systems, et cetera, are all very strong, Structural Heart is very strong. So as I've said in the past many times, this is sustainable and strong going forward. I see no change to momentum, no change to progress, no change to growth rates. If anything, it gets better. So -- and it clearly will in the fourth quarter. 
So it's pretty strong, and the earnings flows with it. And we're not going to make any guidance forecast or anything, but I think directionally here, all fundamentals are strong for us."

But it's not quite working out as yesterday. And Robert can comment on that here, but there is nothing but good here looking forward with Libre. And we anticipate a lot of expansion with this product, including with some of these partnerships that we've announced and working with the interoperability with various partners for what I think will be the future of glucose monitoring and diabetes management.

We're currently working through a handful of open items with the agency. And what I can tell you, I'm -- I've got the same confidence level that Miles does. I'm confident in the data. I'm confident in the product, right? In the meantime, if you look at Libre in Q3, we had an exceptional Q3. Sales of just under $0.5 billion, that puts us on a $2 billion run rate here with growth rate over 70%. Our international business grew 50%, and that's on a large base. And then the U.S. sales nearly tripled. So -- and it's tripled because we're adding new patients at a strong and steady rate. And it's a high rate. And you could see that progression in our total Rxs. So -- and one of the challenges we've had over, like, the 9 months here has really been about how to pulse our demand generation activities with aligning to our supply, and we talked a little bit about kind of some of those supply constraints. 
So we've now released in the third quarter, towards the end of the third quarter, our next tranche of manufacturing capacity on plan, on schedule. And I can tell you, the commercial team right now is really feeling excited about not being able to have that constraint over and really start to intensify the commercial promotional efforts, whether that's advertising, whether that's sampling, et cetera, both in the U.S. and international. I think that gives us a lot of excitement as we exit the year going into next year. 
The value proposition still continues to be very strong to patients and physicians and to payers. And as Miles mentioned in his opening comments, we achieved reimbursement in Canada, public reimbursement, the only sensor system reimbursed in Canada. And it's important because it's one of the top 5 largest glucose monitoring markets in the world. And similar to what we saw in some of these large markets when we obtained national reimbursement, we see a pretty accelerated kind of explosive growth. We saw that in Germany, we saw that in France and U.K. So we expect to see that same trajectory in Canada. And early indications suggest that kind of same curve. So that'll be also exciting for the team as we move into Q4. 
And as Miles also said, we're pleased with the partnership strategy that we've adopted. We've gone through it at a very intentional phased approach first with Bigfoot, as you know. We then moved into announcing our agreements with insulin manufacturers, like Novo and Sanofi, that connect Libre to their pen systems. And the next phase here, we'll start to move into insulin pumps, and that was the agreement that we announced yesterday with Tandem to codevelop an integrated system because we know this is an important segment also connecting to pumps. And we're now at a phase where we feel we can start to kind of roll that out as we've thought about our partnership strategy. So I think momentum here on Libre is exceptional. It is very strong. As we go into Q4, I think we've got a lot of stuff going right, firing all cylinders, whether it's commercial, whether it's operation, whether it's our R&D program. So I'm very confident on the sustainability of Libre and Libre going forward."

I think we're -- we've gotten to the place where our net debt to EBITDA ratio is well ahead of what we targeted probably a year earlier than we expected and that's with an aggressive pay down strategy, et cetera. Our business is performing strong. Our cash flows are strong. Can we still continue to pay down debt? We can. Can we refinance debt? We can. Can we do things that are prudent, good balance sheet management? Yes. And we're also generating cash. We are generating sufficient cash, more than sufficient cash, to invest in a lot of manufacturing expansion for all the new products we've talked about. Robert just mentioned one of the biggest, and that's fully funded and obviously coming online and good. 
So you say, all right, well, then how about the dividend? Well, we raised the dividend 14% last December. And we have a targeted range where we like to keep that dividend as a percent of our EPS, et cetera. So as we go across all the things you can do with your cash, returning cash to shareholders is also a positive thing to do if the conditions are right and if the return is good, et cetera. And we want to be prepared to have that flexibility on the table as well. We have not done significant share repurchase, as you know, for several years while we focused on the pay down of debt. But now, we wanted to add back the flexibility to do that as well. 
So I'd say, in general, we find ourselves in a strong cash position, strong performance position, good strong balance sheet position. We can continue to pay down some debt, but we've got the flexibility to do just about whatever makes sense for us on a return basis or return to shareholder basis. We don't have any active M&A on the radar screen to the extent that we track or follow anything. I'd say it's your typical bolt-ons and tuck-ins and so forth that are additions to already strong businesses. We're pretty happy with our pipeline. We're pretty happy with our R&D pipeline. So our standards are pretty high right now about what's attractive and what may not be. But I'm not forecasting anything significant at all in the M&A area. So obviously, we want to keep our options open here with how we manage cash for our shareholder."

So I think we'll be in the December-January time frame kind of get exactly what core of that's going to land in. But in the meantime, you see kind of our growth rate. The reimbursement is going to be important, but Structural Heart was up mid-teens and the big driver of that was MitraClip, up 30%, up 50% in the U.S. So reimbursement is going to be important. There will definitely be an inflection point when we get it. But as I said in the previous call, that is a component. It's a building block here that we're focusing on. 
So opening new centers is another kind of key building block. We have about 400 today, and I do want to get to about 550 over time. And we've been supporting that with investments, investments in our sales force, our clinical specialists, our therapy development specialists, so that we can not only train the centers, train the implanters to keep up with that demand that we see, but also to support the demand generation through the development of this patient referral network. So that investment is ongoing, on target, on plan in terms of how we're ramping up the field team. And as Miles said in his opening comments, we continue to invest also in the innovation side, on the product development side. So in July, we obtained approval for our fourth-generation MitraClip, which has independent graspers, more sizes, et cetera, that's [ supposed ] to give more options to the business. And so I think that MitraClip here is in its early innings, although I think this is a multiyear, multibillion-dollar growth opportunity that we've got. And it is going to continue to ramp over time, and we're making the investments to make sure we're going to lead in that. So as I look into 2020, I think we've got the right momentum. And once we have NCD coverage, yes, I think there'll be an inflection to growth."

As Miles mentioned, we're seeing the consumer trade up into the premium brand segment, but the volume has been declining partly because of this low birth rate. So this has led to, what I would say, a much more competitive environment, competitive in terms of pricing, competitive in terms of promotional activities. And this has now got our full attention, full attention from the management team here. And our key thing is really focusing. And the market dynamics are the market dynamics, but we've got to really focus on improving our competitive fitness, our competitive position here in the pediatric segment. We're launching a series of new strategies here in the coming weeks regarding our media campaigns, strengthening our consumer relationship platforms.

While it's affecting some segments of the U.S. economy and U.S. businesses pretty directly, it doesn't seem to be affecting us or our business. The nutrition challenge we have is completely separate from any kind of trade or economic or economy issues other than birth rates. And the performance in our Device businesses, our Diagnostics businesses and so forth are double digits and strong. There's all kinds of ways that people can hypothesize that maybe the Chinese government would intervene and make things more difficult and so forth for U.S. multinationals. But in our business, we actually don't see that. And the product approvals are coming in a timely manner. The China FDA is doing everything that they're supposed to do and -- for our products. We haven't seen any of that kind of friction at all. And the demand for our products and the performance of our businesses in China has been strong.

You can say there's the occasional Argentina. Okay, that's not good. Argentina is it's own thing. But there are -- the advancement of health care systems, the advancement in demand for health products, pharmaceuticals, et cetera, strong. China, in particular, for us for our pharmaceutical business, strong. We're doing well. I don't think we have a lot of exposure. I'll let Robert expand on that in a minute. But overall, I think the conditions for us on those markets remain strong. As we've said many, many times, single most difficult thing we deal with is the volatile currency, if it's volatile. And sometimes it is, sometimes it isn't. And right now, currency isn't exactly working on our favor in those markets. So while we grow at a pretty healthy rate on an underlying basis and typically faster than the market, currency erases some of that. Robert?"

So I feel good about where we're guiding Q4. Q4 tends to be that quarter where we get a little bit more natural leverage as well. And you'll see that play out through the bottom line. Pretty consistent with how we thought about this at the beginning of the year. As you know, I mean, gross margin improvement is just part of our DNA. It's part of what we do and how we think about in addition to cash flow and is something we're going to continue to improve upon across all of our businesses. And I think you could expect that to continue in the next year. That's how we get to double-digit growth that we usually start with and continue to invest back into our SG&A and R&D for our growth."

If you think about the Core Lab and the rollout of Alinity program, it's doing very well. And you can see that in our top line. The rollout has been particularly strong in Europe. We're winning over 50% of the businesses where we targeted an entrenched competitor. And if you think about kind of the renewal process, we're retaining nearly all of our current business that comes up for contract. So we placed over 3,000 -- over 3,700 instruments. And when we gave out that number, we're talking about instruments that are actually placed in the market, placed in the account, running tests and generating revenue. So that's gone very well. 
In the quarter, you saw that we also got an approval in the U.S. for the Alinity blood and plasma screening. So this fourth quarter here, the team is already kind of rolling out that commercial launch. We had a lot of success in rolling out the blood plasma systems in Europe and in Asia last year. So it's great to see that a little bit ahead of schedule here in the U.S. And the team has jumped on, on the opportunity. 
As relates to the immunoassay side, a lot of our focus here is really kind of ramping up on the R&D side, ramping up the menu and the assay menu. I'd say that assay completion rate of what we need to be kind of fully competitive in Europe is getting close to about 100% mark that we need. And in the U.S., it's a little bit behind, but a lot of our focus here is to get those systems, those assays approved and in place. And we'll start to see that kind of play affecting our growth rate in the U.S. as we move into next year. So I think, internationally, we're doing really well. U.S., we've got the opportunity here as the assays come onboard to be able to accelerate our growth rates. So I'm really pleased with the momentum that the team has done here. Of course, we could -- we feel that we can always do better, and that's what we're going to keep on pushing, too."

So obviously, still work in progress here. It's a little bit longer than we had initially hoped. When we've talked about it over the last couple of quarters, we've talked about the sales force hiring, the sales force productivity. And it's a very specific selling process here in devices. And if you're a new rep, it takes some time to kind of understand it. So that's been going -- that's been progressing well. We've had some stabilization in the sales force. And some of the monthly KPIs that we track them on, they're approving. But we've also seen, as you pointed out, a little bit of a market decline, especially in the first half of this year. And it follows a couple of years of double-digit growth, right? So a lot of our focus here has got to be on sales force execution and productivity. 
The approval of Proclaim XR this quarter, I think, really provides a nice addition to the portfolio. It provides the sales force with a new technology to promote. And early signs of the launch, it's only been a couple of weeks, but early signs are positive. We tend to look at our trials -- on our trials across the U.S. in spinal as our leading indicator. And I'd say, early signs are positive, but there's more monitoring there for us to be aware of. 
On the market side, there's real no third-party data source here like we have in stents or pacemakers, et cetera. So it's a little bit difficult to peg the growth rate here. We usually have to wait until everybody reports and can kind of look at and add it up and kind of see where it's at. So I would anticipate here Q3 to be similar in terms of market growth rate as to the first half of this year, which is in that low to mid-single-digit decline here."

Rick, I'd say I'm never quite as satisfied as I'd like to be. That's for sure. What -- we've learned a couple of things. I think of the 7 or 8 years we've now been fundamentally focused on emerging markets and their growing economies and so forth, I'",500,"Yes. Rick, I'd say I'm never quite as satisfied as I'd like to be. That's for sure. What -- we've learned a couple of things. I think of the 7 or 8 years we've now been fundamentally focused on emerging markets and their growing economies and so forth, I'd say, if anything was underestimated, it was the degree of volatility of currency, which is also heavily driven by the strength of the U.S. dollar. And while we can't predict those things, so this business is 100% in emerging markets, that's always a bit of a challenge. Now that said, the underlying growth in those markets has been steadily strong. And it's interesting. One indicator of the attractiveness for those markets is, let's just say, the multiples and prices and so forth that anybody who owns a pharmaceutical business in those markets thinks that the company is worth. And as we track those for a long time, they're probably some of the highest multiples in the world than any business -- the businesses that make money. They're attractive. The markets are attractive. The attractive parts of branded, generic pharmaceutical worldwide, they're the most profitable. They're very profitable markets for good branded products as compared to Europe or the U.S. or something like that if you're in that business. So we targeted this business for a reason. There's underlying real growth. Brands matter. Quality matters. Breadth matters. And it's kind of all the fundamentals that we think are stable, durable, attractive, et cetera. And frankly, all those economies have progressed as we would like, maybe not as stably and maybe not as strongly, in some cases, but the growth there is still strong. 
Our own challenge is the R&D investments, to continue to expand product lines and product depth into the markets. We keep our R&D somewhat decentralized by region. India has its own, Latin America has its own, et cetera. We're always looking for greater and greater productivity and greater and greater launch activity out of our teams. Every now and then, we're going to run into an Argentina, a Venezuela or a tax issue in a country, like we did in India a couple of years ago, et cetera that are going to put a dent in the growth rate for a given year, and we've seen that. But the underlying fundamentals are quite strong, quite good. And we keep plugging away at all the fundamentals that we know how to manage. And as you can tell, this last year, we've had steady sequential improvement in our performance, excluding exchange. And they're up at 8%. I think that's pretty good. That means that we know how to take the corrective actions to get stronger, to get better, to drive the business better. And I think the fact that the managers of pharmaceutical business are up to an 8% growth rate and looking forward to even improvement. And that -- I think that's pretty strong. So yes, we like the business."

So on your Portico question, yes, we submitted end of Q3, so we expect a kind of midyear approval here and launch. And we're getting ready for that. 
On your question on Vascular, as we've previously mentioned, there are a couple, what I would call, noncommercial items that impacted growth rate here. These are third-party royalties, third-party manufacturing agreements that we put in place as part of the St. Jude divestiture, some of the assets. So those -- as those ramp down, as those manufacturing agreements ramp down, those royalties ramp down, they obviously impact the growth rate. And we've allocated those agreements into the U.S. line, even though they're global agreements. So if you remove those items that are naturally going down as we transition the manufacturing over to the new owners of those businesses and as the royalties ramp down, you remove that out, our Vascular business was flat. And the dynamic there was really a little bit of pricing that we've seen on the stent side. We've continued to grow share in the U.S. actually and maintain our leadership position in the international markets. And that price pressure was then offset by double-digit growth in our Endo and peripheral business and in our imaging and diagnostic business. And that's part of our strategy, which is we know that there will be some pricing pressure on the DES side, and we know we need to make our investments to maintain our competitive position there. But we also know that we're over investing in our Endo and our imaging strategy, so that those businesses can get large enough and that those double digits then can really return Vascular to a healthy growth rate."

I mean, the one way to describe it here that it's pretty large and it's growing. We focus a lot on the sales side. But if you look at the user base where you're at the 1.5 million, close to 1.6 million users at the end",423,"Yes. So let's talk about that base. I mean, the one way to describe it here that it's pretty large and it's growing. We focus a lot on the sales side. But if you look at the user base where you're at the 1.5 million, close to 1.6 million users at the end of this quarter, as we talked a little bit, there's a little bit of constraint on that user base given our manufacturing capacity. So as we've now unleashed it, I think we've got the potential here to kind of grow that user base even faster. 
One of the things that is important here that we've seen as payers and contract start to look at this is that they're very convinced on the outcomes of using sensor-based technology. There's a lot of clinical data that proves that. We actually have RCT trials that show that Libre reduces hypo, reduces time out of range, reduces the time that patients are in hypoglycemia. And we backed it up with some fairly large real world evidence trial showing that. And competitors also have that, too. 
So the value proposition here is how do you get that outcome at a cost that makes sense for the payer where they can actually expand the use of the product and the technology into a much larger user base versus kind of niching it to kind of very small segments. And that's been the value proposition that we've adopted. And as I said in the beginning of the call, that value proposition is not only very intact, but it is growing. And we see that in the negotiations we've had with Canadian reimbursement authorities. We see that expansion of the technology beyond just type 1 or insulin users in other markets. We start seeing it expand into type 2. So we think the value proposition here is very strong, and it's a real opportunity to provide the benefits of the outcomes that are proven at a cost profile that makes sense for the payers. So -- and it's ultimately about having the impact on outcomes for patients. And we're seeing that through our trials and through our real world evidence. 
If you think about the composition of the patients, we're looking at 50-50. We're getting a lot of type 1s and insulin users, but we're also getting a lot of type 2s, type 2s that are on single injections or type 2s that are on oral medication. There are different utilization rates, but we're getting all those patients."

We've got some great growth drivers in Libre, MitraClip, the Alinity platforms, other businesses. They're all growing, many of them double digits and across the board. So the balance of that performance across all businesses and across all geographies is heartening. It is sustainable. We -- our top line growth rate was 7.6% this quarter. We think it will be close to 8% in the fourth quarter. And as we look into 2020, I see no reason to change any expectations about the strength of our top line sales growth rate, which is, I think, all of you know, for a fairly large company, unusual to find. The other people that are able to do this are tech companies. And so we've got some great strengths here owing to the strength of our pipeline, our new product launches, the improvements to access and/or reimbursements and further capabilities of those products. So we've got a good sustainable road ahead of us. Obviously, there are surprises or things that don't meet our expectations from time to time or the speed with which we want to accomplish things. But overall, I think this is good evidence to you all, a good performance, super performance, really, and sustainably.

Before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2019. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in items 1A, Risk Factors, to our annual report on Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law. 
Please note that financial results and guidance provided on the call today for sales, EPS and line items of the P&L will be for continuing operations only.
On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com. Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth, which is defined in our earnings news release issued earlier today.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Miles."

Today, we reported results of another strong quarter with ongoing earnings per share of $0.84, reflecting 12% growth on an absolute basis and even higher growth when excluding the impact of currency. Sales increased mo",904,"Okay. Thanks, Scott. Good morning. Today, we reported results of another strong quarter with ongoing earnings per share of $0.84, reflecting 12% growth on an absolute basis and even higher growth when excluding the impact of currency. 
Sales increased more than 7.5% on an organic basis in the quarter led by double-digit growth in Medical Devices and sequential improvements in Established Pharmaceuticals and Diagnostics. We also narrowed off our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance range to $3.23 to $3.25, which, at current rates, would reflect high-teens growth, excluding the impact of currency and is at the upper end of the range we set at the beginning of the year.
As we've discussed previously, following our recent strategic shaping and acquisitions, we've been completely focused on running the company we built. This focus on organic execution is delivering strong performance on a remarkably consistent basis. Over the last 8 quarters, we've averaged 7.5% organic sales growth worldwide with very little variation. We've also continued to strengthen our portfolio with new products, expanded access on reimbursement coverage and generated new clinical data that further enhances the sustainability of our strong growth outlook going forward.
I'm particularly pleased with the continued exceptional performance across several of our key growth platforms, including FreeStyle Libre, MitraClip and Alinity, which I'll highlight as I summarize our third quarter results in more detail. 
And I'll start in our Medical Devices business where sales increased double digits for the second quarter in a row. In Structural Heart, we achieved 16% sales growth led by MitraClip, our market-leading device for the treatment of mitral regurgitation or leaking heart valve. MitraClip sales increased more than 30% in the quarter, including U.S. growth of nearly 50%. During the quarter, we received U.S. FDA approval for our next-generation MitraClip device, and we initiated the first-ever U.S. pivotal trial for the minimally invasive treatment of tricuspid regurgitation, which will evaluate the safety and efficacy of our TriClip repair system.
Turning now to FreeStyle Libre, our market-leading continuous glucose monitoring system that eliminates the need for routine fingersticks. We achieved sales of $0.5 billion in the quarter and continued to add significantly to our global user base, as reflected by organic sales growth of nearly 70%. During the quarter, FreeStyle Libre obtained public reimbursement coverage in Ontario and Quebec, becoming the first and only sensor-based glucose monitoring system to be listed by any provincial health plan in Canada. 
We also continued to advance our strategy to develop integrated solutions where people with diabetes can seamlessly manage their condition across devices, including recent announcements that we're seeking to integrate Libre with the insulin delivery technologies of Sanofi and Tandem as well as the digital care platform of Omada Health. This easy-to-use, affordable device is changing the way millions of people manage their diabetes. And our ongoing efforts to expand awareness, adoption and access for Libre around the world will drive tremendous growth for years to come.
Turning now to Diagnostics where sales grew 6.5% in the quarter led by double-digit growth in Core Laboratory Diagnostics. The rollout of Alinity in Europe and other international markets continues to drive strong growth in our Core Laboratory business outside the U.S. In the U.S. where we continue to outperform the market with our legacy ARCHITECT system, we've made good progress achieving regulatory approvals of immunoassay and clinical chemistry test for Alinity and are beginning to ramp up our launch efforts in these areas. With highly differentiated instruments and a matrix rollout across multiple geographies and diagnostic testing areas over time, Alinity is well positioned to be a multiyear growth platform for our Diagnostics business. 
In Nutrition, sales increased nearly 4% in the quarter led by double-digit growth in international Adult Nutrition for the third quarter in a row. In Pediatric Nutrition, above-market growth in the U.S. and several other countries was partially offset by challenging market dynamics in Greater China, which comprises a little less than 10% of our overall nutrition sales. While consumers continue to trade up for premium brands, which is the segment where we compete, we've seen volume in the market decline due to historically low birth rates. We remain focused on strengthening our portfolio and competitiveness across the various segments and purchasing channels in China and, given our broad portfolio and global footprint, anticipate continued strong performance across other geographies and long-term growth opportunities such as Adult Nutrition.
I'll wrap up with Established Pharmaceuticals, or EPD, where sales increased 8% in the quarter led by strong growth in several geographies including India, China and Brazil. Sales growth in EPD has now improved sequentially for each of the last 3 quarters. With leading market positions in several international growth geographies, EPD is well positioned for sustained above-market growth in some of the largest and fastest growing pharmaceutical markets in the world.
So in summary, we're performing extremely well across several areas of the portfolio, resulting in another quarter of strong sales and earnings growth. We continue to strengthen our product portfolios and key product platforms with a steady cadence of new product approvals, reimbursement coverage and clinical data. And we're well on track to deliver ongoing EPS and organic sales growth at the upper ends of the ranges we set at the beginning of the year. 
I'll now turn the call over to Brian to discuss our results and outlook for the year in more detail. Brian?"

As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis, which is consistent with our previous guidance.
Turning to our results. Sales for the third quarter increased 7.6% on an organic basis. During the quarter, we saw the U.S. dollar strengthen modestly, resulting in an unfavorable impact on sales of 1.9% from exchange or 50 basis points higher than if rates held steady since the time of our call in July. Reported sales increased 5.5% in the quarter. 
Regarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 59.2% of sales, adjusted R&D investment was 7% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense was 29.1% of sales.
Turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter. We forecast adjusted EPS of $0.94 to $0.96, which reflects nearly 17.5% growth at the midpoint. We forecast organic sales growth of around 8% and, at current rates, would expect exchange to have a negative impact of somewhat above 1.5% on fourth quarter reported sales. We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of approximately 59.5% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of around 7% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense approaching 27.5% of sales.
Before we open the call for questions, I'll now provide a quick overview of our fourth quarter organic sales growth outlook by business. For Established Pharmaceuticals, we forecast high single-digit growth. In Nutrition, we forecast low to mid-single-digit growth. In Diagnostics, we forecast mid- to high single-digit growth. And in Medical Devices, we forecast growth similar to the third quarter, which reflects continued double-digit growth in several areas of this business.
With that, we will now open the call for questions."

Going into the fourth quarter, we actually are going to be close to 8%. And then going into next year, I think where we are in the range we've given, I think we gave a range at the beginning of this last quarter of 7% to 8%, somewhere in that range. And frankly, I've seen no change to that. I don't see any change to momentum at all here. If anything, we've got pretty strong momentum across the board. We've got sequential growth in a number of areas that we've expected improvement in, and we're seeing that. EPD comes to mind. 
Obviously, our growth drivers, Libre and MitraClip and the Alinity systems, et cetera, are all very strong, Structural Heart is very strong. So as I've said in the past many times, this is sustainable and strong going forward. I see no change to momentum, no change to progress, no change to growth rates. If anything, it gets better. So -- and it clearly will in the fourth quarter. 
So it's pretty strong, and the earnings flows with it. And we're not going to make any guidance forecast or anything, but I think directionally here, all fundamentals are strong for us."

And while I recognize a lot of people, including us, are feeling impatience, impatience doesn't translate to concern. We're all inpatient and we'd all like everything yesterday. But it's not quite working out as yesterday. And Robert can comment on that here, but there is nothing but good here looking forward with Libre. And we anticipate a lot of expansion with this product, including with some of these partnerships that we've announced and working with the interoperability with various partners for what I think will be the future of glucose monitoring and diabetes management. I think all of this is not just on plan, but spectacular, particularly for diabetes patients. And I have nothing but confidence in it. So let me turn over to Robert to expand on that a little bit."

We're currently working through a handful of open items with the agency. And what I can tell you, I'm -- I've got the same confidence level that Miles does. I'm confident in the data. I'm confident in the product, right? In the meantime, if you look at Libre in Q3, we had an exceptional Q3. Sales of just under $0.5 billion, that puts us on a $2 billion run rate here with growth rate over 70%. Our international business grew 50%, and that's on a large base. And then the U.S. sales nearly tripled. So -- and it's tripled because we're adding new patients at a strong and steady rate. And it's a high rate. And you could see that progression in our total Rxs. So -- and one of the challenges we've had over, like, the 9 months here has really been about how to pulse our demand generation activities with aligning to our supply, and we talked a little bit about kind of some of those supply constraints. 
So we've now released in the third quarter, towards the end of the third quarter, our next tranche of manufacturing capacity on plan, on schedule. And I can tell you, the commercial team right now is really feeling excited about not being able to have that constraint over and really start to intensify the commercial promotional efforts, whether that's advertising, whether that's sampling, et cetera, both in the U.S. and international. I think that gives us a lot of excitement as we exit the year going into next year. 
The value proposition still continues to be very strong to patients and physicians and to payers. And as Miles mentioned in his opening comments, we achieved reimbursement in Canada, public reimbursement, the only sensor system reimbursed in Canada. And it's important because it's one of the top 5 largest glucose monitoring markets in the world. And similar to what we saw in some of these large markets when we obtained national reimbursement, we see a pretty accelerated kind of explosive growth. We saw that in Germany, we saw that in France and U.K. So we expect to see that same trajectory in Canada. And early indications suggest that kind of same curve. So that'll be also exciting for the team as we move into Q4. 
And as Miles also said, we're pleased with the partnership strategy that we've adopted. We've gone through it at a very intentional phased approach first with Bigfoot, as you know. We then moved into announcing our agreements with insulin manufacturers, like Novo and Sanofi, that connect Libre to their pen systems. And the next phase here, we'll start to move into insulin pumps, and that was the agreement that we announced yesterday with Tandem to codevelop an integrated system because we know this is an important segment also connecting to pumps. And we're now at a phase where we feel we can start to kind of roll that out as we've thought about our partnership strategy. So I think momentum here on Libre is exceptional. It is very strong. As we go into Q4, I think we've got a lot of stuff going right, firing all cylinders, whether it's commercial, whether it's operation, whether it's our R&D program. So I'm very confident on the sustainability of Libre and Libre going forward."

I think we're -- we've gotten to the place where our net debt to EBITDA ratio is well ahead of what we targeted probably a year earlier than we expected and that's with an aggressive pay down strategy, et cetera. Our business is performing strong. Our cash flows are strong. Can we still continue to pay down debt? We can. Can we refinance debt? We can. Can we do things that are prudent, good balance sheet management? Yes. And we're also generating cash. We are generating sufficient cash, more than sufficient cash, to invest in a lot of manufacturing expansion for all the new products we've talked about. Robert just mentioned one of the biggest, and that's fully funded and obviously coming online and good. 
So you say, all right, well, then how about the dividend? Well, we raised the dividend 14% last December. And we have a targeted range where we like to keep that dividend as a percent of our EPS, et cetera. So as we go across all the things you can do with your cash, returning cash to shareholders is also a positive thing to do if the conditions are right and if the return is good, et cetera. And we want to be prepared to have that flexibility on the table as well. We have not done significant share repurchase, as you know, for several years while we focused on the pay down of debt. But now, we wanted to add back the flexibility to do that as well. 
So I'd say, in general, we find ourselves in a strong cash position, strong performance position, good strong balance sheet position. We can continue to pay down some debt, but we've got the flexibility to do just about whatever makes sense for us on a return basis or return to shareholder basis. We don't have any active M&A on the radar screen to the extent that we track or follow anything. I'd say it's your typical bolt-ons and tuck-ins and so forth that are additions to already strong businesses. We're pretty happy with our pipeline. We're pretty happy with our R&D pipeline. So our standards are pretty high right now about what's attractive and what may not be. But I'm not forecasting anything significant at all in the M&A area. So obviously, we want to keep our options open here with how we manage cash for our shareholder."

That time line there is -- usually takes about 9 months. I mean that's the statutory maximum, as we'll say. When we did FMR in MitraClip, that took about 7 months. So I think we'll be in the December-January time frame kind of get exactly what quarter that's going to land in. But in the meantime, you see kind of our growth rate. The reimbursement is going to be important, but Structural Heart was up mid-teens and the big driver of that was MitraClip, up 30%, up 50% in the U.S. So reimbursement is going to be important. There will definitely be an inflection point when we get it. But as I said in the previous call, that is a component. It's a building block here that we're focusing on. 
So opening new centers is another kind of key building block. We have about 400 today, and I do want to get to about 550 over time. And we've been supporting that with investments, investments in our sales force, our clinical specialists, our therapy development specialists, so that we can not only train the centers, train the implanters to keep up with that demand that we see, but also to support the demand generation through the development of this patient referral network. So that investment is ongoing, on target, on plan in terms of how we're ramping up the field team. And as Miles said in his opening comments, we continue to invest also in the innovation side, on the product development side. So in July, we obtained approval for our fourth-generation MitraClip, which has independent graspers, more sizes, et cetera, that basically give more options to the position. And so I think that MitraClip here is in its really early innings, although I think this is a multiyear, multibillion-dollar growth opportunity that we've got. And it is going to continue to ramp over time, and we're making the investments to make sure we're going to lead in that. So as I look into 2020, I think we've got the right momentum. And once we have NCD coverage, yes, I think there'll be an inflection to growth."

As Miles mentioned, we're seeing the consumer trade up into the premium brand segment, but the volume has been declining partly because of this low birth rate. So this has led to, what I would say, a much more competitive environment, competitive in terms of pricing, competitive in terms of promotional activities. And this has now got our full attention, full attention from the management team here. And our key thing is really focusing. And the market dynamics are the market dynamics, but we've got to really focus on improving our competitive fitness, our competitive position here in the pediatric segment. We're launching a series of new strategies here in the coming weeks regarding our media campaigns, strengthening our consumer relationship platforms.

We, the multinational CEOs of the world, or we -- if we do business in China, are we nervous about trade? Are we nervous about China? Are we nervous about all this? I think you can't help but be nervous about it. But I'll tell you what's interesting. While it's affecting some segments of the U.S. economy and U.S. businesses pretty directly, it doesn't seem to be affecting us or our business. The nutrition challenge we have is completely separate from any kind of trade or economic or economy issues other than birth rates. And the performance in our Device businesses, our Diagnostics businesses and so forth are double digits and strong. There's all kinds of ways that people can hypothesize that maybe the Chinese government would intervene and make things more difficult and so forth for U.S. multinationals. But in our business, we actually don't see that. And the product approvals are coming in a timely manner. The China FDA is doing everything that they're supposed to do and -- for our products. We haven't seen any of that kind of friction at all. And the demand for our products and the performance of our businesses in China has been strong. Other than the challenge we've got with Pediatric Nutrition, all other businesses are doing well, show no signs of any kinds of issues. So while I know that there are industries and segments that are tied to whether it's automobiles, oil, big industries, et cetera, that may have challenges, particularly agriculture, we're not seeing that. And our China business is good."

Pretty consistent with how we thought about this at the beginning of the year. As you know, I mean, gross margin improvement is just part of our DNA. It's part of what we do and how we think about in addition to cash flow and is something we're going to continue to improve upon across all of our businesses.

If you think about the Core Lab and the rollout of Alinity program, it's doing very well. And you can see that in our top line. The rollout has been particularly strong in Europe. We're winning over 50% of the businesses where we targeted an entrenched competitor. And if you think about kind of the renewal process, we're retaining nearly all of our current business that comes up for contract. So we placed over 3,000 -- over 3,700 instruments. And when we gave out that number, we're talking about instruments that are actually placed in the market, placed in the account, running tests and generating revenue. So that's gone very well. 
In the quarter, you saw that we also got an approval in the U.S. for the Alinity blood and plasma screening. So this fourth quarter here, the team is already kind of rolling out that commercial launch. We had a lot of success in rolling out the blood plasma systems in Europe and in Asia last year. So it's great to see that a little bit ahead of schedule here in the U.S. And the team has jumped on, on the opportunity. 
As relates to the immunoassay side, a lot of our focus here is really kind of ramping up on the R&D side, ramping up the menu and the assay menu. I'd say that assay completion rate of what we need to be kind of fully competitive in Europe is getting close to that 100% mark that we need. And in the U.S., it's a little bit behind, but a lot of our focus here is to get those systems, those assays approved and in place. And we'll start to see that kind of play affecting our growth rate in the U.S. as we move into next year. So I think, internationally, we're doing really well. U.S., we've got the opportunity here as the assays come onboard to be able to accelerate our growth rates. So I'm really pleased with the momentum that the team has done here. Of course, we could -- we feel that we can always do better, and that's what we're going to keep on pushing to."

So obviously, still work in progress here. It's a little bit longer than we had initially hoped. When we've talked about it over the last couple of quarters, we've talked about the sales force hiring, the sales force productivity. And it's a very specific selling process here in devices. And if you're a new rep, it takes some time to kind of understand it. So that's been going -- that's been progressing well. We've had some stabilization in the sales force. And some of the monthly KPIs that we track them on, they're improving. But we've also seen, as you pointed out, a little bit of a market decline, especially in the first half of this year. And it follows a couple of years of double-digit growth, right? So a lot of our focus here has got to be on sales force execution and productivity. 
The approval of Proclaim XR this quarter, I think, really provides a nice addition to the portfolio. It provides the sales force with a new technology to promote. And early signs of the launch, it's only been a couple of weeks, but early signs are positive. We tend to look at our trials -- on our trials across the U.S. in spinal as our leading indicator. And I'd say, early signs are positive, but there's more monitoring there for us to be aware of. 
On the market side, there's real no third-party data source here like we have in stents or pacemakers, et cetera. So it's a little bit difficult to peg the growth rate here. We usually have to wait until everybody reports and can kind of look at and add it up and kind of see where it's at. So I would anticipate here Q3 to be similar in terms of market growth rate as to the first half of this year, which is in that low to mid-single-digit decline here."

Rick, I'd say I'm never quite as satisfied as I'd like to be. That's for sure. What -- we've learned a couple of things.

Rick, I'd say I'm never quite as satisfied as I'd like to be. That's for sure. What -- we've learned a couple of things. I think of the 7 or 8 years we've now been fundamentally focused on emerging markets and their growing economies and so forth, I'd say, if anything was underestimated, it was the degree of volatility of currency, which is also heavily driven by the strength of the U.S. dollar. And while we can't predict those things, since this business is 100% in emerging markets, that's always a bit of a challenge. Now that said, the underlying growth in those markets has been steadily strong. And it's interesting. One indicator of the attractiveness for those markets is, let's just say, the multiples and prices and so forth that anybody who owns a pharmaceutical business in those markets thinks that the company is worth. And as we track those for a long time, they're probably some of the highest multiples in the world than any business -- the businesses that make money. They're attractive. The markets are attractive. The attractive parts of branded, generic pharmaceutical worldwide, they're the most profitable. They're very profitable markets for good branded products as compared to Europe or the U.S. or something like that if you're in that business. So we targeted this business for a reason. There's underlying real growth. Brands matter. Quality matters. Breadth matters. And it's kind of all the fundamentals that we think are stable, durable, attractive, et cetera. And frankly, all those economies have progressed as we would like, maybe not as stably and maybe not as strongly, in some cases, but the growth there is still strong. 
Our own challenge is the R&D investments, to continue to expand product lines and product depth into the markets. We keep our R&D somewhat decentralized by region. India has its own, Latin America has its own, et cetera. We're always looking for greater and greater productivity and greater and greater launch activity out of our teams. Every now and then, we're going to run into an Argentina, a Venezuela or a tax issue in a country, like we did in India a couple of years ago, et cetera that are going to put a dent in the growth rate for a given year, and we've seen that. But the underlying fundamentals are quite strong, quite good. And we keep plugging away at all the fundamentals that we know how to manage. And as you can tell, this last year, we've had steady sequential improvement in our performance, excluding exchange. And they're up at 8%. I think that's pretty good. That means that we know how to take the corrective actions to get stronger, to get better, to drive the business better. And I think the fact that the managers of pharmaceutical business are up to an 8% growth rate and looking forward to even improvement in that -- I think that's pretty strong. So yes, we like the business."

So on your Portico question, yes, we submitted end of Q3, so we expect a kind of midyear approval here and launch. And we're getting ready for that. 
On your question on Vascular, as we've previously mentioned, there are a couple, what I would call, noncommercial items that impacted growth rate here. These are third-party royalties, third-party manufacturing agreements that we put in place as part of the St. Jude divestiture, some of the assets. So those -- as those ramp down, as those manufacturing agreements ramp down, those royalties ramp down, they obviously impact the growth rate. And we've allocated those agreements into the U.S. line, even though they're global agreements. So if you remove those items that are naturally going down as we transition the manufacturing over to the new owners of those businesses and as the royalties ramp down, you remove that out, our Vascular business was flat. And the dynamic there was really a little bit of pricing that we've seen on the stent side. We've continued to grow share in the U.S. actually and maintain our leadership position in the international markets. And that price pressure was then offset by double-digit growth in our Endo and peripheral business and in our imaging and diagnostic business. And that's part of our strategy, which is we know that there will be some pricing pressure on the DES side, and we know we need to make our investments to maintain our competitive position there. But we also know that we're over investing in our Endo and our imaging strategy, so that those businesses can get large enough and that those double digits then can really return Vascular to a healthy growth rate."

I mean, the one way to describe it here that it's pretty large and it's growing. We focus a lot on the sales side. But if you look at the user base where you're at the 1.5 million, close to 1.6 million users at the end",423,"Yes. So let's talk about that base. I mean, the one way to describe it here that it's pretty large and it's growing. We focus a lot on the sales side. But if you look at the user base where you're at the 1.5 million, close to 1.6 million users at the end of this quarter, as we talked a little bit, there's a little bit of constraint on that user base given our manufacturing capacity. So as we've now unleashed it, I think we've got the potential here to kind of grow that user base even faster. 
One of the things that is important here that we've seen as payers and contract start to look at this is that they're very convinced on the outcomes of using sensor-based technology. There's a lot of clinical data that proves that. We actually have RCT trials that show that Libre reduces hypo, reduces time out of range, reduces the time that patients are in hypoglycemia. And we backed it up with some fairly large real world evidence trials showing that. And competitors also have that, too. 
So the value proposition here is how do you get that outcome at a cost that makes sense for the payer where they can actually expand the use of the product and the technology into a much larger user base versus kind of niching it to kind of very small segments. And that's been the value proposition that we've adopted. And as I said in the beginning of the call, that value proposition is not only very intact, but it is growing. And we see that in the negotiations we've had with Canadian reimbursement authorities. We see that expansion of the technology beyond just type 1 or insulin users in other markets. We start seeing it expand into type 2. So we think the value proposition here is very strong, and it's a real opportunity to provide the benefits of the outcomes that are proven at a cost profile that makes sense for the payers. So -- and it's ultimately about having the impact on outcomes for patients. And we're seeing that through our trials and through our real world evidence. 
If you think about the composition of the patients, we're looking at 50-50. We're getting a lot of type 1s and insulin users, but we're also getting a lot of type 2s, type 2s that are on single injections or type 2s that are on oral medication. There are different utilization rates, but we're getting all those patients."

So the balance of that performance across all businesses and across all geographies is heartening. It is sustainable. We -- our top line growth rate was 7.6% this quarter. We think it will be close to 8% in the fourth quarter. And as we look into 2020, I see no reason to change any expectations about the strength of our top line sales growth rate, which is, I think, all of you know, for a fairly large company, unusual to find. The other people that are able to do this are tech companies. And so we've got some great strengths here owing to the strength of our pipeline, our new product launches, the improvements to access and/or reimbursements and further capabilities of those products. So we've got a good sustainable road ahead of us. Obviously, there are surprises or things that don't meet our expectations from time to time or the speed with which we want to accomplish things.

Before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2019. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in items 1A, Risk Factors, to our annual report on Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law. 
Please note that financial results and guidance provided on the call today for sales, EPS and line items of the P&L will be for continuing operations only.
On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com. Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth, which is defined in our earnings news release issued earlier today.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Miles."
247483,637508538,1834216,"Abbott Laboratories, Q3 2019 Earnings Call, Oct 16, 2019",2019-10-16,"Earnings Calls","Abbott Laboratories","Executives","Okay. Thanks, Scott. Good morning. Today, we reported results of another strong quarter with ongoing earnings per share of $0.84, reflecting 12% growth on an absolute basis and even higher growth when excluding the impact of currency. Sales increased mo",904,"Okay. Thanks, Scott. Good morning. Today, we reported results of another strong quarter with ongoing earnings per share of $0.84, reflecting 12% growth on an absolute basis and even higher growth when excluding the impact of currency. 
Sales increased more than 7.5% on an organic basis in the quarter led by double-digit growth in Medical Devices and sequential improvements in Established Pharmaceuticals and Diagnostics. We also narrowed off our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance range to $3.23 to $3.25, which, at current rates, would reflect high-teens growth, excluding the impact of currency and is at the upper end of the range we set at the beginning of the year.
As we've discussed previously, following our recent strategic shaping and acquisitions, we've been completely focused on running the company we built. This focus on organic execution is delivering strong performance on a remarkably consistent basis. Over the last 8 quarters, we've averaged 7.5% organic sales growth worldwide with very little variation. We've also continued to strengthen our portfolio with new products, expanded access on reimbursement coverage and generated new clinical data that further enhances the sustainability of our strong growth outlook going forward.
I'm particularly pleased with the continued exceptional performance across several of our key growth platforms, including FreeStyle Libre, MitraClip and Alinity, which I'll highlight as I summarize our third quarter results in more detail. 
And I'll start in our Medical Devices business where sales increased double digits for the second quarter in a row. In Structural Heart, we achieved 16% sales growth led by MitraClip, our market-leading device for the treatment of mitral regurgitation or leaking heart valve. MitraClip sales increased more than 30% in the quarter, including U.S. growth of nearly 50%. During the quarter, we received U.S. FDA approval for our next-generation MitraClip device, and we initiated the first-ever U.S. pivotal trial for the minimally invasive treatment of tricuspid regurgitation, which will evaluate the safety and efficacy of our TriClip repair system.
Turning now to FreeStyle Libre, our market-leading continuous glucose monitoring system that eliminates the need for routine fingersticks. We achieved sales of $0.5 billion in the quarter and continued to add significantly to our global user base, as reflected by organic sales growth of nearly 70%. During the quarter, FreeStyle Libre obtained public reimbursement coverage in Ontario and Quebec, becoming the first and only sensor-based glucose monitoring system to be listed by any provincial health plan in Canada. 
We also continued to advance our strategy to develop integrated solutions where people with diabetes can seamlessly manage their condition across devices, including recent announcements that we're seeking to integrate Libre with the insulin delivery technologies of Sanofi and Tandem as well as the digital care platform of Omada Health. This easy-to-use, affordable device is changing the way millions of people manage their diabetes. And our ongoing efforts to expand awareness, adoption and access for Libre around the world will drive tremendous growth for years to come.
Turning now to Diagnostics where sales grew 6.5% in the quarter led by double-digit growth in Core Laboratory Diagnostics. The rollout of Alinity in Europe and other international markets continues to drive strong growth in our Core Laboratory business outside the U.S. In the U.S. where we continue to outperform the market with our legacy ARCHITECT system, we've made good progress achieving regulatory approvals of immunoassay and clinical chemistry test for Alinity and are beginning to ramp up our launch efforts in these areas. With highly differentiated instruments and a matrix rollout across multiple geographies and diagnostic testing areas over time, Alinity is well positioned to be a multiyear growth platform for our Diagnostics business. 
In Nutrition, sales increased nearly 4% in the quarter led by double-digit growth in international Adult Nutrition for the third quarter in a row. In Pediatric Nutrition, above-market growth in the U.S. and several other countries was partially offset by challenging market dynamics in Greater China, which comprises a little less than 10% of our overall nutrition sales. While consumers continue to trade up for premium brands, which is the segment where we compete, we've seen volume in the market decline due to historically low birth rates. We remain focused on strengthening our portfolio and competitiveness across the various segments and purchasing channels in China and given our broad portfolio and global footprint, anticipate continued strong performance across other geographies and long-term growth opportunities such as Adult Nutrition.
I'll wrap up with Established Pharmaceuticals, or EPD, where sales increased 8% in the quarter led by strong growth in several geographies including India, China and Brazil. Sales growth in EPD has now improved sequentially for each of the last 3 quarters. With leading market positions in several international growth geographies, EPD is well positioned for sustained above-market growth in some of the largest and fastest growing pharmaceutical markets in the world.
So in summary, we're performing extremely well across several areas of the portfolio, resulting in another quarter of strong sales and earnings growth. We continue to strengthen our product portfolios and key product platforms with a steady cadence of new product approvals, reimbursement coverage and clinical data. And we're well on track to deliver ongoing EPS and organic sales growth at the upper ends of the ranges we set at the beginning of the year. 
I'll now turn the call over to Brian to discuss our results and outlook for the year in more detail. Brian?"

As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis, which is consistent with our previous guidance.
Turning to our results. Sales for the third quarter increased 7.6% on an organic basis. During the quarter, we saw the U.S. dollar strengthen modestly, resulting in an unfavorable impact on sales of 1.9% from exchange or 50 basis points higher than if rates held steady since the time of our call in July. Reported sales increased 5.5% in the quarter. 
Regarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 59.2% of sales, adjusted R&D investment was 7% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense was 29.1% of sales.
Turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter. We forecast adjusted EPS of $0.94 to $0.96, which reflects nearly 17.5% growth at the midpoint. We forecast organic sales growth of around 8% and at current rates, would expect exchange to have a negative impact of somewhat above 1.5% on fourth quarter reported sales. We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of approximately 59.5% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of around 7% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense approaching 27.5% of sales.
Before we open the call for questions, I'll now provide a quick overview of our fourth quarter organic sales growth outlook by business. For Established Pharmaceuticals, we forecast high single-digit growth. In Nutrition, we forecast low to mid-single-digit growth. In Diagnostics, we forecast mid- to high single-digit growth. And in Medical Devices, we forecast growth similar to the third quarter, which reflects continued double-digit growth in several areas of this business.
With that, we will now open the call for questions."

One, your guidance for the fourth quarter implies a little bit of momentum deceleration in the business. Anything specific to call out there?

Going into the fourth quarter, we actually are going to be close to 8%. And then going into next year, I think where we are in the range we've given, I think we gave a range at the beginning of this last quarter of 7% to 8%, somewhere in that range. And frankly, I've seen no change to that. I don't see any change to momentum at all here. If anything, we've got pretty strong momentum across the board. We've got sequential growth in a number of areas that we've expected improvement in, and we're seeing that. EPD comes to mind. 
Obviously, our growth drivers, Libre and MitraClip and the Alinity systems, et cetera, are all very strong, Structural Heart is very strong. So as I've said in the past many times, this is sustainable and strong going forward. I see no change to momentum, no change to progress, no change to growth rates. If anything, it gets better. So -- and it clearly will in the fourth quarter. 
So it's pretty strong, and the earnings flows with it. And we're not going to make any guidance forecast or anything, but I think directionally here, all fundamentals are strong for us."

And while I recognize a lot of people, including us, are feeling impatience, impatience doesn't translate to concern. We're all inpatient and we'd all like everything yesterday. But it's not quite working out as yesterday. And Robert can comment on that here, but there is nothing but good here looking forward with Libre. And we anticipate a lot of expansion with this product, including with some of these partnerships that we've announced and working with the interoperability with various partners for what I think will be the future of glucose monitoring and diabetes management. I think all of this is not just on plan, but spectacular, particularly for diabetes patients. And I have nothing but confidence in it. So let me turn over to Robert to expand on that a little bit."

We're currently working through a handful of open items with the agency. And what I can tell you, I'm -- I've got the same confidence level that Miles does. I'm confident in the data. I'm confident in the product, right? In the meantime, if you look at Libre in Q3, we had an exceptional Q3. Sales of just under $0.5 billion, that puts us on a $2 billion run rate here with growth rate over 70%. Our international business grew 50%, and that's on a large base. And then the U.S. sales nearly tripled. So -- and it's tripled because we're adding new patients at a strong and steady rate. And it's a high rate. And you could see that progression in our total Rxs. So -- and one of the challenges we've had over, like, the 9 months here has really been about how to pulse our demand generation activities with aligning to our supply, and we talked a little bit about kind of some of those supply constraints. 
So we've now released in the third quarter, towards the end of the third quarter, our next tranche of manufacturing capacity on plan, on schedule. And I can tell you, the commercial team right now is really feeling excited about not being able to have that constraint over and really start to intensify the commercial promotional efforts, whether that's advertising, whether that's sampling, et cetera, both in the U.S. and international. I think that gives us a lot of excitement as we exit the year going into next year. 
The value proposition still continues to be very strong to patients and physicians and to payers. And as Miles mentioned in his opening comments, we achieved reimbursement in Canada, public reimbursement, the only sensor system reimbursed in Canada. And it's important because it's one of the top 5 largest glucose monitoring markets in the world. And similar to what we saw in some of these large markets when we obtained national reimbursement, we see a pretty accelerated kind of explosive growth. We saw that in Germany, we saw that in France and U.K. So we expect to see that same trajectory in Canada. And early indications suggest that kind of same curve. So that'll be also exciting for the team as we move into Q4. 
And as Miles also said, we're pleased with the partnership strategy that we've adopted. We've gone through it at a very intentional phased approach first with Bigfoot, as you know. We then moved into announcing our agreements with insulin manufacturers, like Novo and Sanofi, that connect Libre to their pen systems. And the next phase here, we'll start to move into insulin pumps, and that was the agreement that we announced yesterday with Tandem to codevelop an integrated system because we know this is an important segment also connecting to pumps. And we're now at a phase where we feel we can start to kind of roll that out as we've thought about our partnership strategy. So I think momentum here on Libre is exceptional. It is very strong. As we go into Q4, I think we've got a lot of stuff going right, firing all cylinders, whether it's commercial, whether it's operation, whether it's our R&D program. So I'm very confident on the sustainability of Libre and Libre going forward."

I think we're -- we've gotten to the place where our net debt to EBITDA ratio is well ahead of what we targeted probably a year earlier than we expected and that's with an aggressive pay down strategy, et cetera. Our business is performing strong. Our cash flows are strong. Can we still continue to pay down debt? We can. Can we refinance debt? We can. Can we do things that are prudent, good balance sheet management? Yes. And we're also generating cash. We are generating sufficient cash, more than sufficient cash, to invest in a lot of manufacturing expansion for all the new products we've talked about. Robert just mentioned one of the biggest, and that's fully funded and obviously coming online and good. 
So you say, all right, well, then how about the dividend? Well, we raised the dividend 14% last December. And we have a targeted range where we like to keep that dividend as a percent of our EPS, et cetera. So as we go across all the things you can do with your cash, returning cash to shareholders is also a positive thing to do if the conditions are right and if the return is good, et cetera. And we want to be prepared to have that flexibility on the table as well. We have not done significant share repurchase, as you know, for several years while we focused on the pay down of debt. But now we wanted to add back the flexibility to do that as well. 
So I'd say, in general, we find ourselves in a strong cash position, strong performance position, good strong balance sheet position. We can continue to pay down some debt, but we've got the flexibility to do just about whatever makes sense for us on a return basis or return to shareholder basis. We don't have any active M&A on the radar screen to the extent that we track or follow anything. I'd say it's your typical bolt-ons and tuck-ins and so forth that are additions to already strong businesses. We're pretty happy with our pipeline. We're pretty happy with our R&D pipeline. So our standards are pretty high right now about what's attractive and what may not be. But I'm not forecasting anything significant at all in the M&A area. So obviously, we want to keep our options open here with how we manage cash for our shareholder."

So I think we'll be in the December-January time frame kind of get exactly what quarter that's going to land in. But in the meantime, you see kind of our growth rate. The reimbursement is going to be important, but Structural Heart was up mid-teens and the big driver of that was MitraClip, up 30%, up 50% in the U.S. So reimbursement is going to be important. There will definitely be an inflection point when we get it. But as I said in the previous call, that is a component. It's a building block here that we're focusing on. 
So opening new centers is another kind of key building block. We have about 400 today, and I do want to get to about 550 over time. And we've been supporting that with investments, investments in our sales force, our clinical specialists, our therapy development specialists, so that we can not only train the centers, train the implanters to keep up with that demand that we see, but also to support the demand generation through the development of this patient referral network. So that investment is ongoing, on target, on plan in terms of how we're ramping up the field team. And as Miles said in his opening comments, we continue to invest also in the innovation side, on the product development side. So in July, we obtained approval for our fourth-generation MitraClip, which has independent graspers, more sizes, et cetera, that basically give more options to the position. And so I think that MitraClip here is in its really early innings, although I think this is a multiyear, multibillion-dollar growth opportunity that we've got. And it is going to continue to ramp over time, and we're making the investments to make sure we're going to lead in that. So as I look into 2020, I think we've got the right momentum. And once we have NCD coverage, yes, I think there'll be an inflection to growth."

Let me start off then with the nutritional question here then. So you saw our Nutrition business was just under 4%. We had really good growth in the U.S. in pediatrics up 4%, double-digit growth in international adult for the second quarter in a row. So our challenge here really was the international pediatric performance. This was really driven by Greater China. And I would say there were some challenging market dynamics here. As Miles mentioned, we're seeing the consumer trade up into the premium brand segment, but the volume has been declining partly because of this low birth rate. So this has led to, what I would say, a much more competitive environment, competitive in terms of pricing, competitive in terms of promotional activities. And this has now got our full attention, full attention from the management team here. And our key thing is really focusing. And the market dynamics are the market dynamics, but we've got to really focus on improving our competitive fitness, our competitive position here in the pediatric segment. We're launching a series of new strategies here in the coming weeks regarding our media campaigns, strengthening our consumer relationship platforms. We've got some plans to launch some new products over the next several quarters. So I'd say that the key focus of us right now in nutrition really has been, at this point here, to focus on improving our competitive fitness in China."

I think you can't help but be nervous about it. But I'll tell you what's interesting. While it's affecting some segments of the U.S. economy and U.S. businesses pretty directly, it doesn't seem to be affecting us or our business. The nutrition challenge we have is completely separate from any kind of trade or economic or economy issues other than birth rates. And the performance in our Device businesses, our Diagnostics businesses and so forth are double digits and strong. There's all kinds of ways that people can hypothesize that maybe the Chinese government would intervene and make things more difficult and so forth for U.S. multinationals. But in our business, we actually don't see that. And the product approvals are coming in a timely manner. The China FDA is doing everything that they're supposed to do and -- for our products. We haven't seen any of that kind of friction at all. And the demand for our products and the performance of our businesses in China has been strong. Other than the challenge we've got with Pediatric Nutrition, all other businesses are doing well, show no signs of any kinds of issues. So while I know that there are industries and segments that are tied to whether it's automobiles, oil, big industries, et cetera, that may have challenges, particularly agriculture, we're not seeing that.

Pretty consistent with how we thought about this at the beginning of the year. As you know, I mean, gross margin improvement is just part of our DNA. It's part of what we do and how we think about in addition to cash flow and is something we're going to continue to improve upon across all of our businesses.

If you think about the Core Lab and the rollout of Alinity program, it's doing very well. And you can see that in our top line. The rollout has been particularly strong in Europe. We're winning over 50% of the businesses where we targeted an entrenched competitor. And if you think about kind of the renewal process, we're retaining nearly all of our current business that comes up for contract. So we placed over 3,000 -- over 3,700 instruments. And when we gave out that number, we're talking about instruments that are actually placed in the market, placed in the account, running tests and generating revenue. So that's gone very well. 
In the quarter, you saw that we also got an approval in the U.S. for the Alinity blood and plasma screening. So this fourth quarter here, the team is already kind of rolling out that commercial launch. We had a lot of success in rolling out the blood plasma systems in Europe and in Asia last year. So it's great to see that a little bit ahead of schedule here in the U.S. And the team has jumped on, on the opportunity. 
As relates to the immunoassay side, a lot of our focus here is really kind of ramping up on the R&D side, ramping up the menu and the assay menu. I'd say that assay completion rate of what we need to be kind of fully competitive in Europe is getting close to that 100% mark that we need. And in the U.S., it's a little bit behind, but a lot of our focus here is to get those systems, those assays approved and in place. And we'll start to see that kind of play affecting our growth rate in the U.S. as we move into next year. So I think, internationally, we're doing really well. U.S., we've got the opportunity here as the assays come onboard to be able to accelerate our growth rates. So I'm really pleased with the momentum that the team has done here. Of course, we could -- we feel that we can always do better, and that's what we're going to keep on pushing to."

So obviously, still work in progress here. It's a little bit longer than we had initially hoped. When we've talked about it over the last couple of quarters, we've talked about the sales force hiring, the sales force productivity. And it's a very specific selling process here in devices. And if you're a new rep, it takes some time to kind of understand it. So that's been going -- that's been progressing well. We've had some stabilization in the sales force. And some of the monthly KPIs that we track them on, they're improving. But we've also seen, as you pointed out, a little bit of a market decline, especially in the first half of this year. And it follows a couple of years of double-digit growth, right? So a lot of our focus here has got to be on sales force execution and productivity. 
The approval of Proclaim XR this quarter, I think, really provides a nice addition to the portfolio. It provides the sales force with a new technology to promote. And early signs of the launch, it's only been a couple of weeks, but early signs are positive. We tend to look at our trials -- on our trials across the U.S. in spinal as our leading indicator. And I'd say, early signs are positive, but there's more monitoring there for us to be aware of. 
On the market side, there's real no third-party data source here like we have in stents or pacemakers, et cetera. So it's a little bit difficult to peg the growth rate here. We usually have to wait until everybody reports and can kind of look at and add it up and kind of see where it's at. So I would anticipate here Q3 to be similar in terms of market growth rate as to the first half of this year, which is in that low to mid-single-digit decline here."

Rick, I'd say I'm never quite as satisfied as I'd like to be. That's for sure. What -- we've learned a couple of things. I think of the 7 or 8 years we've now been fundamentally focused on emerging markets and their growing economies and so forth, I'd say, if anything was underestimated, it was the degree of volatility of currency, which is also heavily driven by the strength of the U.S. dollar. And while we can't predict those things, since this business is 100% in emerging markets, that's always a bit of a challenge. Now that said, the underlying growth in those markets has been steadily strong. And it's interesting. One indicator of the attractiveness for those markets is, let's just say, the multiples and prices and so forth that anybody who owns a pharmaceutical business in those markets thinks that the company is worth. And as we track those for a long time, they're probably some of the highest multiples in the world than any business -- the businesses that make money. They're attractive. The markets are attractive. The attractive parts of branded, generic pharmaceutical worldwide, they're the most profitable. They're very profitable markets for good branded products as compared to Europe or the U.S. or something like that if you're in that business. So we targeted this business for a reason. There's underlying real growth. Brands matter. Quality matters. Breadth matters. And it's kind of all the fundamentals that we think are stable, durable, attractive, et cetera. And frankly, all those economies have progressed as we would like, maybe not as stably and maybe not as strongly, in some cases, but the growth there is still strong. 
Our own challenge is the R&D investments, to continue to expand product lines and product depth into the markets. We keep our R&D somewhat decentralized by region. India has its own, Latin America has its own, et cetera. We're always looking for greater and greater productivity and greater and greater launch activity out of our teams. Every now and then, we're going to run into an Argentina, a Venezuela or a tax issue in a country, like we did in India a couple of years ago, et cetera that are going to put a dent in the growth rate for a given year, and we've seen that. But the underlying fundamentals are quite strong, quite good. And we keep plugging away at all the fundamentals that we know how to manage. And as you can tell, this last year, we've had steady sequential improvement in our performance, excluding exchange. And they're up at 8%. I think that's pretty good. That means that we know how to take the corrective actions to get stronger, to get better, to drive the business better. And I think the fact that the managers of pharmaceutical business are up to an 8% growth rate and looking forward to even improvement in that -- I think that's pretty strong. So yes, we like the business."

So on your Portico question, yes, we submitted end of Q3, so we expect a kind of midyear approval here and launch. And we're getting ready for that. 
On your question on Vascular, as we've previously mentioned, there are a couple, what I would call, noncommercial items that impacted growth rate here. These are third-party royalties, third-party manufacturing agreements that we put in place as part of the St. Jude divestiture, some of the assets. So those -- as those ramp down, as those manufacturing agreements ramp down, those royalties ramp down, they obviously impact the growth rate. And we've allocated those agreements into the U.S. line, even though they're global agreements. So if you remove those items that are naturally going down as we transition the manufacturing over to the new owners of those businesses and as the royalties ramp down, you remove that out, our Vascular business was flat. And the dynamic there was really a little bit of pricing that we've seen on the stent side. We've continued to grow share in the U.S. actually and maintain our leadership position in the international markets. And that price pressure was then offset by double-digit growth in our Endo and peripheral business and in our imaging and diagnostic business. And that's part of our strategy, which is we know that there will be some pricing pressure on the DES side, and we know we need to make our investments to maintain our competitive position there. But we also know that we're over investing in our Endo and our imaging strategy, so that those businesses can get large enough and that those double digits then can really return Vascular to a healthy growth rate."

I mean, the one way to describe it here that it's pretty large and it's growing. We focus a lot on the sales side. But if you look at the user base where you're at the 1.5 million, close to 1.6 million users at the end",423,"Yes. So let's talk about that base. I mean, the one way to describe it here that it's pretty large and it's growing. We focus a lot on the sales side. But if you look at the user base where you're at the 1.5 million, close to 1.6 million users at the end of this quarter, as we talked a little bit, there's a little bit of constraint on that user base given our manufacturing capacity. So as we've now unleashed it, I think we've got the potential here to kind of grow that user base even faster. 
One of the things that is important here that we've seen as payers and contract start to look at this is that they're very convinced on the outcomes of using sensor-based technology. There's a lot of clinical data that proves that. We actually have RCT trials that show that Libre reduces hypo, reduces time out of range, reduces the time that patients are in hypoglycemia. And we backed it up with some fairly large real world evidence trials showing that. And competitors also have that, too. 
So the value proposition here is how do you get that outcome at a cost that makes sense for the payer where they can actually expand the use of the product and the technology into a much larger user base versus kind of niching it to kind of very small segments. And that's been the value proposition that we've adopted. And as I said in the beginning of the call, that value proposition is not only very intact, but it is growing. And we see that in the negotiations we've had with Canadian reimbursement authorities. We see that expansion of the technology beyond just type 1 or insulin users in other markets. We start seeing it expand into type 2. So we think the value proposition here is very strong, and it's a real opportunity to provide the benefits of the outcomes that are proven at a cost profile that makes sense for the payers. So -- and it's ultimately about having the impact on outcomes for patients. And we're seeing that through our trials and through our real world evidence. 
If you think about the composition of the patients, we're looking at 50-50. We're getting a lot of type 1s and insulin users, but we're also getting a lot of type 2s, type 2s that are on single injections or type 2s that are on oral medication. There are different utilization rates, but we're getting all those patients."

And as we look into 2020, I see no reason to change any expectations about the strength of our top line sales growth rate, which is, I think, all of you know, for a fairly large company, unusual to find. The other people that are able to do this are tech companies. And so we've got some great strengths here owing to the strength of our pipeline, our new product launches, the improvements to access and/or reimbursements and further capabilities of those products. So we've got a good sustainable road ahead of us. Obviously, there are surprises or things that don't meet our expectations from time to time or the speed with which we want to accomplish things. But overall, I think this is good evidence to you all, a good performance, super performance, really, and sustainably so. We look at 2020 with great optimism and great expectations, in spite of a lot of the uncertainties in the world and in the economies around the world. We're feeling pretty strong and pretty bullish about where we sit. So with that, we'll see you in 90 days."
