First, we delivered solid financial results in the fourth qu",1115,"Thank you, Manisha. Good morning, and thank you, everyone, for joining our Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2018 Earnings Call. 
There are 3 key themes that I'd like to highlight on the call today. First, we delivered solid financial results in the fourth quarter, finishing up a strong 2018, underscoring the strength of our core business. Second, our R&D pipeline is advancing, and we expect many significant clinical and regulatory milestones in 2019. And third, based on the strength of our core business, the emerging pipeline and continued focus on strong execution, we feel confident about our outlook in 2019. 
Turning to Slide 5. 2018 was a year of steady strategic progress for Allergan, and we achieved the financial and operational goals that we had set at the beginning of the year. I'm very proud of our team's operational, R&D and non-GAAP financial results in 2018. 
In 2018, we made significant headway with our pipeline and delivered positive clinical results from 6 late-stage development programs across our therapeutic areas. We made 10 major registrational submissions globally, including for VRAYLAR in bipolar depression, and we expect an FDA decision in May. 
On the migraine front, we reported compelling data for both ubrogepant in acute treatment of prevention of migraine and Atogepant for episodic migraine. Assuming these 2 oral CGRPs are approved, we will have one of the most comprehensive migraine portfolios in the industry. 
We have made significant progress with our Eye Care pipeline and recorded positive Phase III data for abicipar in wet AMD and with Bimatoprost SR in glaucoma and are on track to make regulatory submissions for both later this year. 
In the GI space, we've advanced 3 important late-stage programs: brazikumab, an IL-23 antibody for inflammatory bowel disease; Relamorelin for diabetic gastroparesis; and CBC for NASH. With 13 pharmaceutical and 10 device programs in late-stage development, we are well positioned to launch 1 or 2 new products each year for the next several years. 
In 2018, despite the sales impact from products losing exclusivity, or LOEs, we maintained healthy margins and invested in our core business for growth. And we took a disciplined approach to capital allocation, which was balanced across driving growth, strengthening our balance sheet and returning attractive levels of capital to our shareholders. In 2018, our net performance -- our performance net income per share came in at $16.69 for the full year, which is above the high end of our most recently provided guidance range. We generated strong cash flows of $5.6 billion, improved our balance sheet and continued to return capital to shareholders. And we reduced our outstanding debt by over $6 billion and executed more than $2.7 billion in share repurchases in 2018 alone. 
Our 2018 performance reinforces our commitment to successfully execute our strategy and create a global biopharma leader focused on 4 key therapeutic areas: Medical Aesthetics, CNS, Eye Care and GI. Taken together, these accomplishments give me confidence in our ability to continue producing solid results in 2019 and beyond while also delivering innovation that will have an enduring impact on patients, customers and shareholders.
Turning to Slide 6. I will briefly review the key drivers of our 2018 performance. Our core business, which accounted for 87% of our total revenues in 2018, was $13.8 billion, growing 8.3% year-over-year at constant currency. This was driven by robust growth in many of our anchor brands such as BOTOX Cosmetics, BOTOX Therapeutic, JUVÉDERM, VRAYLAR, Lo LOESTRIN and LINZESS. Core business growth in 2018 was offset by declines in brand space and LOEs, divestitures of nonstrategic assets and, in the later part of the year, some shortfalls in the international business associated with the recalls of OZURDEX and textured breast implants in certain international markets. We believe we have resolved the OZURDEX issue and expect supply to be normalized in the second quarter. Overall, our core business continues to perform well and is poised for durable growth over the long term. 
Slide 7 provides a brief snapshot of key financial metrics for the quarter and for the full year. You will hear more about this in the financial guidance for 2019 from Matt. Of note, our guidance does not take into consideration any impact from potential future divestitures. 
Before I turn to our goals for 2019, I'd like to provide an update on the sale process that we have been conducting for anti-infectives and Women's Health. On anti-infectives, we are in the final stages of this process and believe that it is -- that this business is more likely than not to be sold. While we do not yet have a completed transaction to announce at this time, and there are always risks to completing a transaction, current facts and circumstances are indicating that a sale of anti-infectives is probable over the near term. For Women's Health, we have concluded that the highest value proposition for this business at this time is to continue managing it and optimizing it. As a result, we are winding down the advisory web process. We will continue to explore future opportunities to unlock value with Women's Health. Several flagship products in Women's Health were up 15% year-over-year, which is a true testament to the scale and expertise of our Women's Health team, and I'd like to recognize them for their strong contribution.
Looking ahead to 2019 and beyond, our strategy for long-term growth is clear. Outlined on Slide 8 is a snapshot of our 4 main businesses, which represent over 80% of our top line sales. We are committed to these areas and take a long-term view of each of these for 3 reasons. First, we have product line in depth and own a #1 or #2 position. Second, we have a clear line of site to innovation and new product flow. And third, our regulatory development and commercial expertise are competitive advantages. 
Medical Aesthetics and Eye Care are the largest in global, followed by CNS and GI, which have strong future growth potential. The other key point here is that each of these businesses is supported by several mid- to late-stage pipeline products. In other words, each business has a bench of future growth catalysts and development. I expect that we will launch more new products than any other company in these 4 therapeutic areas. And finally, we intend to accomplish these goals with disciplined and balance capital deployment. 
These clear strategic priorities, combined with our resolute focus on strong execution operationally, commercially and financially, give me confidence that we are well positioned to create sustainable growth and shareholder value in 2019 and beyond. 
Now let me turn the call over to Bill for more detail on product highlights."
36478,596989005,1641738,"Allergan plc, Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2019",2019-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Allergan plc","Executives","Thanks, Brent. Slide 10 of the product-level sales analysis for the fourth quarter ranked in terms of sales growth versus prior year. We had another solid quarter with double-digit sales growth for a number of our major products. BOTOX, VRAYLAR, JUVÉDERM",1187,"Thanks, Brent. Slide 10 of the product-level sales analysis for the fourth quarter ranked in terms of sales growth versus prior year. We had another solid quarter with double-digit sales growth for a number of our major products. BOTOX, VRAYLAR, JUVÉDERM and Lo LOESTRIN were standouts in the quarter. Other key brands, including OZURDEX, ALLODERM and CoolSculpting, had lower growth rates for the quarter and the year, which I'll discuss shortly. The core business is in an excellent position as we start 2019. 
At the bottom of the graph, and as expected, total sales growth was impacted by products already facing loss of exclusivity as well as RESTASIS sales decline, ahead of anticipated generic competition. 
Slide 11 reflects full year sales results for our top 8 or flagship products. These products account for over 50% of the core business and most of our growth. Collectively, sales for these products increased by $1 billion -- approximately $1 billion in 2018, and 6 of the 8 increased by 10% or more versus prior year. BOTOX was the biggest growth contributor, and VRAYLAR was the fastest growing. The fundamentals for each one of these businesses are strong for 2019. 
Now I'll touch our key therapeutic areas, starting with our largest one, Medical Aesthetics. 
Turning to Slide 12. For the full year 2018, sales for Medical Aesthetics were up 13%. Sales for BOTOX Cosmetics, JUVÉDERM and ALLODERM were very strong and up 14%, 12% and 18%, respectively, and drove the majority of our aesthetics business growth. Sales of ALLODERM were well above expectations, driven by more product utilization per surgery. Sales in the fourth quarter, however, were impacted by constraint for donor material. We anticipate donor capacity to increase during the course of 2019 and that sales will continue to grow. 
For the full year 2018, sales for CoolSculpting globally were up 6.3% pro forma. Consumables sales, which represent 64% of the total, were up 12%, both in the United States and internationally, for the year. System sales declined 2% due primarily to price in the United States. Importantly, we added almost 1,200 systems in the United States, representing a 24% increase versus the prior year. In 2009 (sic) [ 2019 ] we estimate sales growth for CoolSculpting will be driven primarily by consumable demand off of a much larger installed systems base and overall greater contribution from our international business. We estimate roughly 50% of 2019 CoolSculpting growth will come from International and 50% from the U.S. By way of comparison, in 2018, International sales for CoolSculpting represented only about 1/3 of total growth. 
We will also be launching a new body contouring system in the United States in the fourth quarter of 2019 called CoolTone. This is the first of 3 new systems that will create the most comprehensive body contouring solution in aesthetics to address fat reduction, which is the foundation of treatment; and muscle toning and skin tightening. Our CoolTone device is complementary and will be marketed alongside CoolSculpting. 
In 2019, our primary focus for Medical Aesthetics is maintaining our market leadership and expanding the category, and we've taken the following steps to maximize sales. We've expanded our field forces for facial injectables and body contouring by 20% to drive better and broader customer coverage. We've significantly increased the scale of our consumer and digital marketing programs, including new consumer campaigns for both BOTOX, which launched yesterday; and JUVÉDERM, which launched in October. We plan doing more CoolSculpting training programs than we did in 2018. And finally, we expect to launch a new customer service portal in the first quarter, which will make doing business with Allergan even more efficient. The fundamentals and outlook for this business continue to be very strong in 2019 and beyond. 
Turning to Slide 13 and CNS. Our flagship product, as you know, are BOTOX and VRAYLAR. Sales for BOTOX were up 13% and were ahead of expectations. Growth was coming from all indications: migraines, spasticity and OAB and across all channels. I want to take a moment to talk about the impact of new products on BOTOX, specifically in migraine. No different from the last quarter, we've not experienced a visible impact on BOTOX demand from any of the approved CGRP monoclonal antibodies. The branded migraine prevention market had nearly doubled since the launch of Aimovig, and we have a 50% share of new patients with BOTOX. As I've talked about before, we expect BOTOX and CGRB antibodies to coexist in a much larger market. And we expect the growth rate in '19 will be at least in the mid- to high single digits. We estimate today that only 2% of Aimovig patients were switched from BOTOX, and it appears that combination use is also limited at this time. Finally, medical benefit coverage for BOTOX in 2018 was broad, and we expect the same in 2019. The underlying growth of this business is volume based. 
Sales for VRAYLAR in '18 totaled $487 million, up 69%. This product continues to exceed expectation on every metric, including prescribers, prescription levels and formulary coverage rates. And our consumer campaign is producing exceptional returns. The growth catalyst for VRAYLAR in '19 is the anticipated new medication for bipolar depression, which is currently under review with the FDA. Over time, this is projected to be one of the most important products at Allergan. 
Turning to Slide 14 on Eye Care and GI. In Eye Care, full year revenues for our glaucoma business were stable on a year-over-year basis. OZURDEX sales declined 6%, impacted by a product recall. We expect to fully resolve the supply situation in the second quarter. U.S. sales were up 13% versus prior year. 
RESTASIS prescription ban was stable year-over-year. This was offset by lower average selling price and lower trade inventory levels. 
Turning now to GI. Sales for our IBS line VIBERZI totaled $963 million. Underlying prescription demand for LINZESS in 2018 was very strong at 13% versus prior year. This was partially offset by a lower average selling price, resulting in a net revenue gain of 9% versus 2017. 
The outlook for this business is positive, with OTC conversion being the primary source of growth. We have a strong following in both GI and primary care, very high consumer awareness and widespread formulary coverage. And we will continue to invest in LINZESS, alongside our partner, Ironwood, to maximize sales and profitability.
Sales for ZENPEP in 2018 were up 12%, and growth is coming from increased utilization in the GI segment and from our highest dose. ZENPEP is expected to be a solid growth contributor again in '19. 
Turning to Slide 15. Our International sales were up 6% in 2018. The growth drivers were BOTOX Cosmetic, JUVÉDERM and CoolSculpting as well as BOTOX Therapeutic, which were partially offset by the recalls of OZURDEX and textured implants. Excluding these events, International sales grew 9% for the full year. The Asia Pacific/Middle East/Africa regions continue to be most important growth drivers for us, and the outlook for the International business is very strong. 
And with that, let me turn the call over to David."

We have positive data readouts from several late-stage programs. 
For cariprazine, we reported positive Phase III data and have a regulatory submission under review for the bipolar depression indication with an FDA action date in May. We've also initiated additional clinical studies for cariprazine as an adjunctive treatment in major depressive disorder. 
For ubrogepant, our oral CGRP inhibitor, the acute treatment of migraine, we reported positive data from 2 Phase III efficacy and safety studies, a long-term safety study and also safety study in healthy volunteers. We expect a regulatory filing with the FDA very soon. 
For Atogepant, our oral CGRP inhibitor for the prevention of episodic migraine, we reported positive data from a Phase II/III study and have a Phase III study in episodic migraine as well as the requisite long-term safety study ongoing. We will initiate Phase III studies in chronic migraine in the first half of the year. 
For Bimatoprost SR, we have reported data from 2 positive Phase III studies, and I will be providing some additional details on this program later in the call. 
For abicipar, we reported and presented data from 2 positive Phase III studies and expect to report data from the ongoing MAPLE study in the first half of this year. This study evaluates a further-optimized formulation. 
For Brimonidine DDS in geographic atrophy, we reported and presented positive Phase II data in 2018 and expect to initiate Phase III studies in the second half of the year. 
Our Rapastinel Phase III program for major depressive disorders is ongoing, and we expect to report in the first half of the year top line data from 3 studies of Rapastinel in the adjunctive setting as well as data from a relapse prevention study. Separate Phase III studies of Rapastinel as monotherapy in major depressive disorder are underway or about to commence. We also have a Phase II study of Rapastinel for suicidality in major depressive disorder ongoing. 
AGN-241751, our oral MNDA modulator, is in Phase II clinical development for MDD. This agent received Fast Track designation from the FDA. 
Turning to Slide 18 and Bimatoprost SR. Here, we have reported data from 2 positive Phase III data studies. Bimatoprost SR is a first-in-class, biodegradable intracameral implant providing slow release of Bimatoprost, a differentiated approach to treat glaucoma beyond daily eyedrop treatments. While drops are effective, compliance remains a big challenge and results in suboptimal outcomes for patients. Our U.S. Phase III program provides 2 identical studies, each enrolling over 500 patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. They were randomized to receive either Bimatoprost SR or Timolol. Of the 12-week primary efficacy period, Bimatoprost SR reduced intraocular pressure by approximately 30%, easily meeting the predefined criteria for noninferiority to the study comparator, Timolol, in both studies. 
Importantly, both the studies demonstrate the potential for the majority of patients to remain treatment-free for at least 1 year after their last of 3 implants was inserted at 4 monthly intervals. In both studies, Bimatoprost SR was well tolerated by the majority of the patients. Based on these positive data, we plan to make a regulatory submission with the FDA in the second half of 2019. 
turning now to Slide 19. As you heard from Brent, 2019 is shaping up to be another critical year for pipeline progress and data readouts. Summarized here are some of the key events we anticipate this year and beyond. 
We plan to make significant advances in late-stage programs across all 4 of our key therapeutic areas. In addition to the important developments in the pharmaceutical pipeline, we are also making significant progress with innovation in Medical Aesthetics, including the anticipated launch of CoolTone in the fourth quarter of 2019. 
Before I turn the call over to Matt, I would like to take a minute to highlight both our pharmaceutical as well as our device pipeline. 
Turning to Slide 20. Our pharmaceutical pipeline has over 45 programs in various stages of development. With 13 programs in Phase III, including innovative earlier-stage programs in the areas of Medical Aesthetics, genetically validated targets, gene editing, optogenetics in the microbiome. Whilst all of these programs may be successful, we have depth across all our therapeutic areas. 
Turning to Slide 21. On the device side, we have 30 programs in development. The majority of these programs enhance our Medical Aesthetics portfolio and include a new line of facial fillers. 
As always, I thank my colleagues in R&D for their hard work as well as the physicians and especially the patients who participate in our clinical trials. 
With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Matt."
36478,596989005,1641738,"Allergan plc, Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2019",2019-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Allergan plc","Executives","Thank you, David. Turning now to the key financial highlights on Page 23. Fourth quarter results exceeded the high end of guidance that we provided last quarter, both for revenue and non-GAAP performance net income per share. Net revenues for the fourth",1663,"Thank you, David. Turning now to the key financial highlights on Page 23. Fourth quarter results exceeded the high end of guidance that we provided last quarter, both for revenue and non-GAAP performance net income per share. 
Net revenues for the fourth quarter were $4.08 billion, a 5.7% decline compared to the prior year period. In addition to the impact from LOEs and divesting the Medical Dermatology business, fourth quarter results also faced a challenging comparison to the prior year period, which happened to be a  very strong quarter. 
Net revenues for the full year were $15.8 billion, a narrow or 1.1% decline versus prior year. Foreign currency translation created a 1.3 percentage point growth headwind for Q4 but had a de minimis impact on fiscal year revenues. 
In the fourth quarter, the core business grew 3% year-on-year on a reported basis and 4.5% at constant currency. We saw 3 near-term headwinds, which impacted results in total, although none were significant individually: first, the OZURDEX recall, which occurred in Q3 and carried into Q4; and second, the recall of textured implants in certain international markets; and third, the negative impact from foreign exchange translation. Normalizing for the impact of these near-term headwinds, the underlying core business growth was 6.4% at constant currency, which more closely aligns with the strong core business growth realized in prior quarters. 
For fiscal year 2018, the core business delivered over $1 billion in revenue growth, offsetting almost the entire $1.2 billion of revenue decline from LOEs. Strong performance in the promoted brands with ongoing exclusively, together with all other revenues, drove 6.9% core business growth. This figure represents true organic growth, and it excludes benefits of the 2017 acquisitions of CoolSculpting and Regenerative Medicine as well as the impact of foreign exchange translation. 
Now moving to the margins in the middle of the page. Fiscal year operating margin of 47.9% aligned closely to prior year as the impact of lower operating costs due to restructuring essentially offset a 1 percentage point decline in gross margin, which was driven by product mix and, to a lesser extent, the product recalls just discussed. 
You can also see that our fourth quarter operating margin declined 330 basis points as compared to a very strong result in the prior year period. The decline was due to lower revenues, as previously explained, and also the phasing of both R&D and initiate a spending, which were more heavily weighted to the fourth quarter, in part due to reinvestment of RESTASIS profits back into the core business to fund growth initiatives. 
Moving tin the lower section. Non-GAAP performance net income per share in the fourth quarter declined 12%, reflecting the revenue and margin issues just described. On a full year basis, our fiscal year 2018 non-GAAP performance net income per share increased 2% versus prior year as the decline in non-GAAP performance net income was more than offset by lower share count due to buybacks that we executed throughout the year. 
On Slide 24, you can see a more complete look at our key P&L line items for the fourth quarter and the full year as compared to prior year. I've already covered most of the highlights, but a couple of additional items to touch on. 
Net interest expense improved in both Q4 and the full year, largely due to a lower average debt balances as we continue to reduce debt. Net  interest expense was further reduced as a result of our 2018 leverage neutral refinancing, which we undertook to optimize their currency mix of our total debt. 
Not otherwise mentioned on the slide is the GAAP accounting item for which I'd like to provide some color. We monitor goodwill and intangible assets for indicators of impairment each and every quarter. This quarter, we recorded a GAAP impairment charge of $5.4 billion, with the key drivers being a $1.6 billion intangible asset impairment related to Kybella and a $3.5 billion impairment related to goodwill of our U.S. General Medicines segment, a portion of which was allocated to our anti-infectives business, which is now classified as held for sale as a result of the advanced status of the sale process, which Brent covered at the outset of the call. 
Turning now to our fourth quarter performance versus prior year by reporting segment on Slide 25. U.S. Specialized Therapeutics revenue declined 3.9%, was mainly due to lower RESTASIS as well as lower sales of the divested Med Derma business. Contribution margin also decreased 350 basis points due to the revenue decline, coupled with higher sales and marketing expenses, which were in part driven by timing. 
U.S. General Medicine continues to be the segment was impacted by LOEs, as reflected by the revenue decline of 8.4%, which more than offset the strong performance of VRAYLAR and Lo LOESTRIN. Contribution margin increased 140 basis points as the impact of lower revenues was more than offset by a favorable partnership true-up credit on LINZESS, net expense savings from restructuring. 
International revenue decline of 5% was significantly impacted by foreign exchange translation as well as the impact of recalls. At constant currency, revenue grew 1% versus prior year, which expands to 8.5%, excluding the impact of OZURDEX and textured implants. Contribution margin was also impacted by the same issues, resulting in a 310 basis point decline versus prior year. 
Turning to Slide 26, you can see on the left. Operating cash flow on the last 12 months basis for each ending period. In the fourth quarter, operating cash flow was strong at $1.5 billion, driving our fiscal year 2018 operating cash flow to $5.6 billion, which was above our prior guidance. 
On the right, our capitalization table shows the discipline actions taken towards capital deployment and return of capital to stakeholders. A couple of points to make here. We ended the year with total debt of $23.8 billion after paying down $6.2 billion or approximately 21% of debt outstanding at the start of the year. Gross and net leverage ratios are down to 3x and 2.8x, respectively, as of December 31. 
On share buybacks, we repurchased a total of $2.7 billion in 2018, including $750 million completed during the fourth quarter. We have $800 million remaining under the 2018 $2 billion share buyback authorization. And as we announced this morning, our board just recently authorized a new $2 billion share buyback program, which we expect to deploy similarly, and that is with a priority on offsetting dilution created by long-term incentive plans as well as potential earnings dilution from asset divestitures that we may complete. 
Our capital allocation priorities continue, as stated previously: first, reinvestment in our business for growth in our 4 key therapeutic areas; second, debt reduction, which is important in the context of the anticipated loss of RESTASIS exclusively. We continue to pursue a target net leverage ratio of 2.5x by the end of 2020, and we will maintain our commitment to an investment-grade credit rating. Three, funding the current dividend and prudent growing that dividend annually as the performance of our business allows; and last and finally, share buybacks, as we just talked about. Moving on to Slide 27, our 2019 guidance. Let's start with net revenues. We expect fiscal year 2019 net revenues to be between $15 billion and $15.3 billion, which assumes RESTASIS exclusivity through March 31. This revenue guidance also includes anticipated headwinds previously discussed related to OZURDEX and textured implants in certain international markets as well as industry-wide pricing pressures and foreign exchange translation headwinds. 
We expect non-GAAP gross margin for 2019 to be between 85% and 85.5%, reflecting the impact of product mix, including the anticipated RESTASIS LOE. Our non-GAAP SG&A expense is expected to be between $4.1 billion and $4.3 billion, which supports continued investments in key long-term growth drivers within the core business. We expect non-GAAP R&D expense to be between $1.6 billion and $1.7 billion, which reflects increased investment in our pipeline, as we continue to advance key programs in clinical development, as you just heard from David. 
Net interest expense other of approximately $800 million reflects interest savings from debt reduction but also lower interest income from reduced cash balances relative to 2018. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate in 2019 is expected to be between 13% and 13.5%. And our average 2019 share account is forecasted to be approximately 332 million shares, which assumes completion of the remaining $800 million under the 2018 $2 billion share buyback authorization. As a result, and as previously committed, we expect full year 2019 non-GAAP performance net income per share to be greater than or equal to $16.36. And please note that any significant asset divestiture, should they be completed, will be dilutive enough to non-GAAP performance net income per share, and we'd have to revisit this and most of the other metrics for which we provide guidance. 
Continuing down the page. Reported cash flow from operations for 2019 is expected to be between $5 billion and $5.5 billion, with the key assumptions being RESTASIS exclusivity through March 31 and success-based development milestones premised upon 100% achievement. In line with our previous commentary, we will continue to provide quarterly guidance until there is a RESTASIS generic entrant. 
So for the first quarter of 2019, we expect total reported net revenue between $3.4 billion and $3.55 billion as most of the revenue pressures in 2019 we discussed are more heavily weighted in the first half of the year and non-GAAP performance net income per share between $3.40 and $3.60, which reflects a more even phasing of operating expenses throughout the year. 
In wrapping up the financial discussion, we finished 2018 with solid results. Our core business drivers continue to deliver strong growth. We've rightsized the business to absorb the impact of LOEs and other headwinds, all of which positions us well to achieve the targets we set for ourselves in the coming year. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back to Brent."

That's going to provide an important platform for consumable growth, which, I think, can trade in the double digits. And then I would, again, keep your eye on that international business, which looks very good right now; and then, finally, the launch of the CoolTone system. I think that pretty much covers the questions on CoolSculpting. As it relates to BOTOX Therapeutic, I thought about it this way. There are 2 tests. The first test was 2018, and I think that we passed it. The growth rate in the quarter was 13%. The business looks very, very good. But to be fair, there's a second test, and I think, by the second half of 2019, we'll have a better sense of how this migraine market's going to look. There's no question, when you look at the IMS data, that the market is much bigger today than it was 9 months ago. There's also no question that demand for BOTOX has been stable. We didn't have a quarter in 2018 that was below 10%. So I like the way it looks as we go into the year, and we'll provide an update on the next call."

With respect to discounting, I would tell you that if you looked kind of anecdotally at what happened during the Christmas season with discounting from the exist -- the already existing competitors on the marketplace, it was fairly significant versus the price of BOTOX. And so we have been competing against very steep discounted products for years, and BOTOX has done very well despite that.

We don't view it as market share battle at this point. I don't think toxins are interchangeable. They are definitely similar but in the hands of very large [ injectors ]. There are differences. And even if they're subtle, they're important. I think there are 2 market segments here. There's the branded segment, which is essentially BOTOX; and then there's a nondifferentiated segment. And it's an efficient market, and over time, I don't think it's going to support more than 3 products. It's not going to support 4, 5 or 6. I don't see why an aesthetic specialist would buy inventory and inject so many different toxins. And BOTOX has been a practice builder for these physicians. It's the only toxin that is requested, and it's a gateway for physicians. And our focus is on maintaining it. And it's supported by the largest sales force in aesthetics, the largest training program in aesthetics and the only -- really, the only loyalty program in aesthetics.

And in fact, we did memorialize that in our social contract a couple of years ago and changed our strategy several years ago to focus on more innovative pipeline developments across our therapeutic areas. When you look at price, and this is consistent of how we thought about it last year, this year and over the next several years, it's basically a nonfactor, right? We saw no price appreciation on a net basis in '18. We anticipate no price appreciation on a net basis in '19, and we baked no price appreciation into our outlook on a go-forward basis. So I think the facts support what our assumption was a few years ago, which was price was not going to be growth driver in any way, shape or form in this industry, not unique to Allergan, but across the entire industry, as you would expect it to. So we kind of don't think about price essentially."

We're expecting about $1.4 billion of LOEs. And then the other issues related to the near-term headwinds, I'll try and dimensionalize those a bit for you in terms of how they were incorporated into our planning. So for textured implants, we had said that the international market for textured implants was about $60 million. As we incorporated that into our planning for 2019, we've expanded that a bit to include some knock-on effects in other ex U.S. markets. So that's about $100 million relative to what our normalized expectation for 2019 would have been. OZURDEX is about half that. Let's call it about $50 million.

As it relates to BOTOX and neurology, first of all, if you link at the IMS data, I think it has a new name now because they were required. There's -- [indiscernible]. There's nearly 200,000 new patients that have been placed on the CGRPs and mostly [indiscernible]. You can ask the management team Amgen, Teva and Lilly, but that's at least my take on it. And the reason why I think you haven't seen a material impact on BOTOX is fairly straightforward. First of all, half of those 200,000 patients have episodic migraine. And so they are really not in our universe of users, and you can see that in the Acuvue data, too. Next is think about the large off-label market for the prevention of migraine. You have literally over 50 million prescriptions being written between products like Topamax or generic [indiscernible], TCAs and beta blockers. And so if you look -- although this data is not perfect, if you look at the IMS data, you have roughly 70% of use for CGRPs, it appears to me company from new patients, continuing patients and then switches from generic agents like topiramate. And so it's not surprising that you have BOTOX coexisting in the market with the CGRPs. And to be fair, what I think is most reassuring as we think about BOTOX long term is that with the number of new patients for the prevention of migraine, the branded prevention of migraine nearly doubling, the CGRPs, to a certain extent, become a gateway to BOTOX. And I suppose the reverse is true. And when you look at the data on BOTOX, the effect of BOTOX on migraine in terms of prevention of migraine days on a monthly basis can't be beat by any of the CGRPs. And the benefit-risk ratio of BOTOX is pretty well characterized. And so like I said, there are 2 tests year. '18 was the first one, and I think the second the first half of 2019 is the second one. It's too early to call this, but the business looks very healthy right now."

But to the headache specialists that I interact with and Bill interacts with, it's just another tool. They don't view it as superior to BOTOX. And so we should keep in mind, while the pharmaceutical industry and the people who follow the industry are excited about a novel new entrant, the clinical implication is just another tool. A good tool but just another tool. And so -- they will select for the patients as they feel appropriate between the 2 therapies."

There are 3 key themes that I'd like to highlight on the call today. First, we delivered solid financial results in the fourth quarter, finishing up a strong 2018, underscoring the strength of our core business. Second, our R&D pipeline is advancing, and we expect many significant clinical and regulatory milestones in 2019. And third, based on the strength of our core business, the emerging pipeline and continued focus on strong execution, we feel confident about our outlook in 2019. 
Turning to Slide 5. 2018 was a year of steady strategic progress for Allergan, and we achieved the financial and operational goals that we had set at the beginning of the year. I'm very proud of our team's operational, R&D and non-GAAP financial results in 2018. 
In 2018, we made significant headway with our pipeline and delivered positive clinical results from 6 late-stage development programs across our therapeutic areas. We made 10 major registrational submissions globally, including for VRAYLAR in bipolar depression, and we expect an FDA decision in May. 
On the migraine front, we reported compelling data for both ubrogepant in acute treatment and prevention of migraine and atogepant for episodic migraine. Assuming these 2 oral CGRPs are approved, we will have one of the most comprehensive migraine portfolios in the industry. 
We have made significant progress with our Eye Care pipeline and recorded positive Phase III data for abicipar in wet AMD and with Bimatoprost SR in glaucoma and are on track to make regulatory submissions for both later this year. 
In the GI space, we have advanced 3 important late-stage programs: brazikumab, an IL-23 antibody for inflammatory bowel disease; relamorelin for diabetic gastroparesis; and CVC for NASH. 
With 13 pharmaceutical and 10 device programs in late-stage development, we are well positioned to launch 1 or 2 new products each year for the next several years. 
In 2018, despite the sales impact from products losing exclusivity, or LOEs, we maintained healthy margins and invested in our core business for growth. And we took a disciplined approach to capital allocation, which was balanced across driving growth, strengthening our balance sheet and returning attractive levels of capital to our shareholders. 
In 2018, our net performance -- our performance net income per share came in at $16.69 for the full year, which is above the high end of our most recently provided guidance range. We generated strong cash flows of $5.6 billion, improved our balance sheet and continued to return capital to shareholders. And we reduced our outstanding debt by over $6 billion and executed more than $2.7 billion in share repurchases in 2018 alone. 
Our 2018 performance reinforces our commitment to successfully execute our strategy and create a global biopharma leader focused on 4 key therapeutic areas: Medical Aesthetics; CNS; Eye Care; and GI. Taken together, these accomplishments give me confidence in our ability to continue producing solid results in 2019 and beyond, while also delivering innovation that will have an enduring impact on patients, customers and shareholders.
Turning to Slide 6. I will briefly review the key drivers of our 2018 performance. Our core business, which accounted for 87% of our total revenues in 2018, was $13.8 billion, growing 8.3% year-over-year at constant currency. This was driven by robust growth in many of our anchor brands, such as BOTOX Cosmetic, BOTOX Therapeutic, JUVÉDERM, VRAYLAR, Lo LOESTRIN and LINZESS. Core business growth in 2018 was offset by declines in brand spacing LOEs, divestitures of nonstrategic assets and, in the later part of the year, some shortfalls in the international business associated with the recalls of OZURDEX and textured breast implants in certain international markets. We believe we have resolved the OZURDEX issue and expect supply to be normalized in the second quarter. Overall, our core business continues to perform well and is poised for durable growth over the long term. 
Slide 7 provides a brief snapshot of key financial metrics for the quarter and for the full year. You will hear more about this in the financial guidance for 2019 from Matt. Of note, our guidance does not take into consideration any impact from potential future divestitures. 
Before I turn to our goals for 2019, I'd like to provide an update on the sale process that we have been conducting for anti-infectives and Women's Health.
On anti-infectives, we are in the final stages of this process and believe that it is -- that this business is more likely than not to be sold. While we do not yet have a completed transaction to announce at this time, and there are always risks to completing a transaction, current facts and circumstances are indicating that a sale of anti-infectives is probable over the near term. 
For Women's Health, we have concluded that the highest value proposition for this business at this time is to continue managing it and optimizing it. As a result, we are winding down the advisory web process. We will continue to explore future opportunities to unlock value with Women's Health. Several flagship products in Women's Health were up 15% year-over-year, which is a true testament to the scale and expertise of our Women's Health team, and I'd like to recognize them for their strong contribution.
Looking ahead to 2019 and beyond, our strategy for long-term growth is clear. Outlined on Slide 8 is a snapshot of our 4 main businesses, which represent over 80% of our top line sales. We are committed to these areas and take a long-term view of each of these for 3 reasons. First, we have product line in depth and own a #1 or #2 position. Second, we have a clear line of site to innovation and new product flow. And third, our regulatory development and commercial expertise are competitive advantages. 
Medical Aesthetics and Eye Care are the largest in global, followed by CNS and GI, which have strong future growth potential. The other key point here is that each of these businesses is supported by several mid- to late-stage pipeline products. In other words, each business has a bench of future growth catalysts and development. I expect that we will launch more new products than any other company in these 4 therapeutic areas. And finally, we intend to accomplish these goals with discipline and balanced capital deployment. 
These clear strategic priorities, combined with our resolute focus on strong execution operationally, commercially and financially, give me confidence that we are well positioned to create sustainable growth and shareholder value in 2019 and beyond. 
Now let me turn the call over to Bill for more detail on product highlights."

Slide 10 is a product-level sales analysis for the fourth quarter ranked in terms of sales growth versus prior year. We had another solid quarter with double-digit sales growth for a number of our major products. BOTOX, VRAYLAR, JUVÉDERM a",1191,"Thanks, Brent. Slide 10 is a product-level sales analysis for the fourth quarter ranked in terms of sales growth versus prior year. We had another solid quarter with double-digit sales growth for a number of our major products. BOTOX, VRAYLAR, JUVÉDERM and Lo LOESTRIN were standouts in the quarter. Other key brands, including OZURDEX, ALLODERM and CoolSculpting, had lower growth rates for the quarter and the year, which I'll discuss shortly. The core business is in an excellent position as we start 2019. 
At the bottom of the graph, and as expected, total sales growth was impacted by products already facing loss of exclusivity as well as RESTASIS sales decline, ahead of anticipated generic competition. 
Slide 11 reflects full year sales results for our top 8 or flagship products. These products account for over 50% of the core business and most of our growth. Collectively, sales for these products increased by $1 billion -- approximately $1 billion in 2018, and 6 of the 8 increased by 10% or more versus prior year. BOTOX was the biggest growth contributor, and VRAYLAR was the fastest growing. The fundamentals for each one of these businesses are strong for 2019. 
Now I'll touch on our key therapeutic areas, starting with our largest one, Medical Aesthetics. 
Turning to Slide 12. For the full year 2018, sales for Medical Aesthetics were up 13%. Sales for BOTOX Cosmetic, JUVÉDERM and ALLODERM were very strong and up 14%, 12% and 18%, respectively, and drove the majority of our aesthetics business growth. Sales of ALLODERM were well above expectations, driven by more product utilization per surgery. Sales in the fourth quarter, however, were impacted by constraint for donor material. We anticipate donor capacity to increase during the course of 2019 and that sales will continue to grow. 
For the full year 2018, sales for CoolSculpting globally were up 6.3% pro forma. Consumables sales, which represent 64% of the total, were up 12%, both in the United States and internationally for the year. System sales declined 2% due primarily to price in the United States. Importantly, we added almost 1,200 systems in the United States, representing a 24% increase versus the prior year. In 2009 (sic) [ 2019 ], we estimate sales growth for CoolSculpting will be driven primarily by consumable demand off of a much larger installed systems base and overall greater contribution from our international business. We estimate roughly 50% of 2019 CoolSculpting growth will come from International and 50% from the U.S. By way of comparison, in 2018, International sales for CoolSculpting represented only about 1/3 of total growth. 
We will also be launching a new body contouring system in the United States in the fourth quarter of 2019 called CoolTone. This is the first of 3 new systems that will create the most comprehensive body contouring solution in aesthetics to address fat reduction, which is the foundation of treatment; and muscle toning and skin tightening. Our CoolTone device is complementary and will be marketed alongside CoolSculpting. 
In 2019, our primary focus for Medical Aesthetics is maintaining our market leadership and expanding the category, and we've taken the following steps to maximize sales. We've expanded our field forces for facial injectables and body contouring by 20% to drive better and broader customer coverage. We have significantly increased the scale of our consumer and digital marketing programs, including new consumer campaigns for both BOTOX, which launched yesterday; and JUVÉDERM, which launched in October. We plan more injector and CoolSculpting training programs than we did in 2018. And finally, we expect to launch a new customer service portal in the first quarter, which will make doing business with Allergan even more efficient. The fundamentals and outlook for this business continue to be very strong in 2019 and beyond. 
Turning to Slide 13 in CNS. Our flagship products, as you know, are BOTOX and VRAYLAR. Sales for BOTOX were up 13% and were ahead of expectations. Growth was coming from all indications: migraines, spasticity, NOAB and across all channels. I want to take a moment to talk about the impact of new products on BOTOX, specifically in migraine. No different from the last quarter, we've not experienced a visible impact on BOTOX demand from any of the approved CGRP monoclonal antibodies. The branded migraine prevention market has nearly doubled since the launch of Aimovig, and we have a 50% share of new patients with BOTOX. As I've talked about before, we expect BOTOX and CGRP antibodies to coexist in a much larger market. And we expect the growth rate in '19 will be at least in the mid- to high single digits. We estimate today that only 2% of Aimovig patients were switched from BOTOX, and it appears that combination use is also limited at this time. Finally, medical benefit coverage for BOTOX in 2018 was broad, and we expect the same in 2019. The underlying growth of this business is volume based. 
Sales for VRAYLAR in '18 totaled $487 million, up 69%. This product continues to exceed expectation on every metric, including prescribers, prescription levels and formulary coverage rates. And our consumer campaign is producing exceptional returns. The growth catalyst for VRAYLAR in '19 is the anticipated new indication for bipolar depression, which is currently under review at the FDA. Over time, this is projected to be one of the most important products at Allergan. 
Turning to Slide 14 on Eye Care and GI. In Eye Care, full year revenues for our glaucoma business were stable on a year-over-year basis. OZURDEX sales declined 6%, impacted by a product recall. We expect to fully resolve the supply situation in the second quarter. U.S. sales were up 13% versus prior year. 
RESTASIS prescription demand was stable year-over-year. This was offset by lower average selling price and lower trade inventory levels. 
Turning now to GI. Sales for our IBS line, LINZESS and VIBERZI, totaled $963 million. Underlying prescription demand for LINZESS in 2018 was very strong at 13% versus prior year. This was partially offset by lower average selling price, resulting in a net revenue gain of 9% versus 2017. 
The outlook for this business is positive, with OTC conversion being the primary source of growth. We have a strong following in both GI and primary care, very high consumer awareness and widespread formulary coverage. And we will continue to invest in LINZESS, alongside our partner, Ironwood, to maximize sales and profitability.
Sales for ZENPEP in 2018 were up 12%, and growth was coming from increased utilization in the GI segment and from our highest dose. ZENPEP is expected to be a solid growth contributor again in '19. 
Turning to Slide 15. Our International sales were up 6% in 2018. The growth drivers were BOTOX Cosmetic, JUVÉDERM and CoolSculpting as well as BOTOX Therapeutic, which were partially offset by the recalls of OZURDEX and textured implants. Excluding these events, International sales grew 9% for the full year. The Asia Pacific/Middle East/Africa regions continue to be the most important growth drivers for us, and the outlook for the International business is very strong. 
And with that, let me turn the call over to David."

For cariprazine,",809,"Thank you, Bill. 2018 was another important year for the R&D organization. As highlighted on Slide 17, we've progressed our pipeline in all 4 of our key therapeutic areas. We have positive data readouts from several late-stage programs. 
For cariprazine, we reported positive Phase III data and have a regulatory submission under review for the bipolar depression indication with an FDA action date in May. We have also initiated additional clinical studies for cariprazine as an adjunctive treatment in major depressive disorder. 
For ubrogepant, our oral CGRP inhibitor for the acute treatment of migraine, we reported positive data from 2 Phase III efficacy and safety studies, a long-term safety study and also a safety study in healthy volunteers. We expect a regulatory filing in -- with the FDA very soon. 
For atogepant, our oral CGRP inhibitor for the prevention of episodic migraine, we reported positive data from a Phase II/III study and have a Phase III study in episodic migraine as well as the requisite long-term safety study ongoing. We will initiate Phase III studies in chronic migraine in the first half of the year. 
For Bimatoprost SR, we have reported data from 2 positive Phase III studies, and I will be providing some additional details on this program later in the call. 
For abicipar, we reported and presented data from 2 positive Phase III studies and expect to report data from the ongoing MAPLE Study in the first half of this year. This study evaluates a further-optimized formulation. 
For Brimonidine DDS in geographic atrophy, we reported and presented positive Phase II data in 2018 and expect to initiate Phase III studies in the second half of the year. 
Our Rapastinel Phase III program for major depressive disorder is ongoing, and we expect to report in the first half of the year top line data from 3 studies of Rapastinel in the adjunctive setting as well as data from a relapse prevention study. Separate Phase III studies of Rapastinel as monotherapy in major depressive disorder are either underway or about to commence. We also have a Phase II study of Rapastinel for suicidality in major depressive disorder ongoing. 
AGN-241751, our oral NMDA modulator, is in Phase II clinical development for MDD. This agent received Fast Track designation from the FDA. 
Turning to Slide 18 on Bimatoprost SR. Here, we have reported data from 2 positive Phase III data studies. Bimatoprost SR is a first-in-class, biodegradable, intracameral implant providing slow release of bimatoprost, a differentiated approach to treat glaucoma beyond daily eye drop treatments. While drops are effective, compliance remains a big challenge and results in suboptimal outcomes for patients. Our U.S. Phase III program provides 2 identical studies, each enrolling over 500 patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. They were randomized to receive either Bimatoprost SR or Timolol. Over the 12-week primary efficacy period, Bimatoprost SR reduced intraocular pressure by approximately 30%, easily meeting the predefined criteria for noninferiority to the study comparator, Timolol, in both studies. 
Importantly, both the studies demonstrate the potential for the majority of patients to remain treatment-free for at least one year after their last of 3 implants was inserted at 4 monthly intervals. In both studies, Bimatoprost SR was well tolerated by the majority of the patients. Based on these positive data, we plan to make a regulatory submission with the FDA in the second half of 2019. 
Turning now to Slide 19. As you heard from Brent, 2019 is shaping up to be another critical year for pipeline progress and data readouts. Summarized here are some of the key events we anticipate this year and beyond. 
We plan to make significant advances in late-stage programs across all 4 of our key therapeutic areas. In addition to the important developments in the pharmaceutical pipeline, we are also making significant progress with innovation in Medical Aesthetics, including the anticipated launch of CoolTone in the fourth quarter of 2019. 
Before I turn the call over to Matt, I would like to take a minute to highlight both our pharmaceutical as well as our device pipeline. 
Turning to Slide 20. Our pharmaceutical pipeline has over 45 programs in various stages of development. With 13 programs in Phase III, including innovative earlier-stage programs in the areas of Medical Aesthetics, genetically validated targets, gene editing, optogenetics and the microbiome. Whilst all of these programs may be successful, we have depth across all our therapeutic areas. 
Turning to Slide 21. On the device side, we have 30 programs in development. The majority of these programs enhance our Medical Aesthetics portfolio and include a new line of facial fillers. 
As always, I thank my colleagues in R&D for their hard work as well as the physicians and especially the patients who participate in our clinical trials. 
With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Matt."
36478,596989005,1641887,"Allergan plc, Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2019",2019-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Allergan plc","Executives","Thank you, David. Turning now to the key financial highlights on Page 23. Fourth quarter results exceeded the high end of guidance that we provided last quarter, both for revenue and non-GAAP performance net income per share. Net revenues for the fourth",1666,"Thank you, David. Turning now to the key financial highlights on Page 23. Fourth quarter results exceeded the high end of guidance that we provided last quarter, both for revenue and non-GAAP performance net income per share. 
Net revenues for the fourth quarter were $4.08 billion, a 5.7% decline compared to the prior year period. In addition to the impact from LOEs and divesting the Medical Dermatology business, fourth quarter results also faced a challenging comparison to the prior year period, which happened to be a very strong quarter. 
Net revenues for the full year were $15.8 billion, a narrower 1.1% decline versus prior year. Foreign currency translation created a 1.3 percentage point growth headwind for Q4, but had a de minimis impact on fiscal year revenues. 
In the fourth quarter, the core business grew 3% year-on-year on a reported basis and 4.5% at constant currency. We saw 3 near-term headwinds, which impacted results in total, though none were significant individually: first, the OZURDEX recall, which occurred in Q3 and carried into Q4; and second, the recall of textured implants in certain international markets; and third, the negative impact from foreign exchange translation. Normalizing for the impact of these near-term headwinds, the underlying core business growth was 6.4% at constant currency, which more closely aligns with the strong core business growth realized in prior quarters. 
For fiscal year 2018, the core business delivered over $1 billion in revenue growth, offsetting almost the entire $1.2 billion of revenue decline from LOEs. Strong performance in the promoted brands with ongoing exclusivity, together with all other revenues, drove 6.9% core business growth. This figure represents true organic growth, and it excludes benefits of the 2017 acquisitions of CoolSculpting and Regenerative Medicine as well as the impact of foreign exchange translation. 
Now moving to the -- now moving to margins in the middle of the page. Fiscal year operating margin of 47.9% aligned closely to prior year as the impact of lower operating cost due to restructuring essentially offset a 1 percentage point decline in gross margin, which was driven by product mix and, to a lesser extent, the product recalls just discussed. 
You can also see that our fourth quarter operating margin declined 330 basis points as compared to a very strong result in the prior year period. The decline was due to lower revenues, as previously explained, and also the phasing of both R&D and SG&A spending, which were more heavily weighted to the fourth quarter, in part due to reinvestment of RESTASIS profits back into the core business to fund growth initiatives. 
Moving to the lower section. Non-GAAP performance net income per share in the fourth quarter declined 12%, reflecting the revenue and margin issues just described. On a full year basis, our fiscal year 2018 non-GAAP performance net income per share increased 2% versus prior year as the decline in non-GAAP performance net income was more than offset by lower share count due to buybacks that we executed throughout the year. 
On Slide 24, you can see a more complete look at our key P&L line items for the fourth quarter and the full year as compared to prior year. I've already covered most of the highlights, but a couple of additional items to touch on. 
Net interest expense improved in both Q4 and the full year, largely due to lower average debt balances as we continue to reduce debt. Net interest expense was further reduced as a result of our 2018 leverage neutral refinancing, which we undertook to optimize the currency mix of our total debt. 
Not otherwise mentioned on the slide is the GAAP accounting item for which I'd like to provide some color. We monitor goodwill and intangible assets for indicators of impairment each and every quarter. This quarter, we recorded a GAAP impairment charge of $5.4 billion, with the key drivers being a $1.6 billion intangible asset impairment related to KYBELLA and a $3.5 billion impairment related to goodwill of our U.S. General Medicine segment, a portion of which was allocated to our anti-infectives business, which is now classified as held for sale as a result of the advanced status of the sale process, which Brent covered at the outset of the call. 
Turning now to our fourth quarter performance versus prior year by reporting segment on Slide 25. U.S. Specialized Therapeutics revenue decline of 3.9% was mainly due to lower RESTASIS as well as lower sales of the divested Med Derm business. Contribution margin also decreased 350 basis points due to the revenue decline, coupled with higher sales and marketing expenses, which were in part driven by timing. 
U.S. General Medicine continues to be the segment was impacted by LOEs, as reflected by the revenue decline of 8.4%, which more than offset the strong performance of VRAYLAR and Lo LOESTRIN. Contribution margin increased 140 basis points as the impact of lower revenues was more than offset by a favorable partnership true-up credit on LINZESS, [ net ] expense savings from restructuring. 
International revenue decline of 5% was significantly impacted by foreign exchange translation as well as the impact of recalls. At constant currency, revenue grew 1% versus prior year, which expands to 8.5%, excluding the impact of OZURDEX and textured implants. Contribution margin was also impacted by the same issues, resulting in a 310 basis point decline versus prior year. 
Turning to Slide 26. You can see on the left, operating cash flow on a last 12-month basis for each ending period. In the fourth quarter, operating cash flow was strong at $1.5 billion, driving our fiscal year 2018 operating cash flow to $5.6 billion, which was above our prior guidance. 
On the right, our capitalization table shows the disciplined actions taken towards capital deployment and return of capital to stakeholders. Couple of points to make here. We ended the year with total debt of $23.8 billion after paying down $6.2 billion or approximately 21% of debt outstanding at the start of the year. Gross and net leverage ratios are down to 3x and 2.8x, respectively, as of December 31. 
On share buybacks, we repurchased a total of $2.7 billion in 2018, including $750 million completed during the fourth quarter. We have $800 million remaining under the 2018 $2 billion share buyback authorization. And as we announced this morning, our board just recently authorized a new $2 billion share buyback program, which we expect to deploy similarly, and that is with the priority on offsetting dilution created by long-term incentive plans as well as potential earnings dilution from asset divestitures that we may complete. 
Our capital allocation priorities continue, as stated previously. First, reinvestment in our business for growth in our 4 key therapeutic areas. Second, debt reduction, which is important in the context of the anticipated loss of RESTASIS exclusivity. We continue to pursue a target net leverage ratio of 2.5x by the end of 2020, and we will maintain our commitment to an investment-grade credit rating. Three, funding the current dividend and prudently growing that dividend annually as the performance of our business allows. And last -- and finally, share buybacks, as we just talked about. 
Moving now to Slide 27, our 2019 guidance. Let's start with net revenues. We expect fiscal year 2019 net revenues to be between $15 billion and $15.3 billion, which assumes RESTASIS exclusivity through March 31. This revenue guidance also includes anticipated headwinds previously discussed related to OZURDEX and textured implants in certain international markets as well as industry-wide pricing pressures and foreign exchange translation headwinds. 
We expect non-GAAP gross margin for 2019 to be between 85% and 85.5%, reflecting the impact of product mix, including the anticipated RESTASIS LOE. 
Our non-GAAP SG&A expense is expected to be between $4.1 billion and $4.3 billion, which supports continued investments in key long-term growth drivers within the core business. 
We expect non-GAAP R&D expense to be between $1.6 billion and $1.7 billion, which reflects increased investment in our pipeline, as we continue to advance key programs in clinical development, as you just heard from David. 
Net interest expense/other of approximately $800 million reflects interest savings from debt reduction, but also lower interest income from reduced cash balances relative to 2018. 
Our non-GAAP effective tax rate in 2019 is expected to be between 13% and 13.5%. 
And our average 2019 share account is forecasted to be approximately 332 million shares, which assumes completion of the remaining $800 million under the 2018 $2 billion share buyback authorization. As a result, and as previously committed, we expect full year 2019 non-GAAP performance net income per share to be greater than or equal to $16.36. 
And please note that any significant asset divestiture, should they be completed, will be dilutive enough to non-GAAP performance net income per share, and we would have to revisit this and most of the other metrics for which we provide guidance. 
Continuing down the page, reported cash flow from operations for 2019 is expected to be between $5 billion and $5.5 billion with the key assumptions being RESTASIS exclusivity through March 31 and success-based development milestones premised upon 100% achievement. 
In line with our previous commentary, we will continue to provide quarterly guidance until there is a RESTASIS generic entrant. 
So for the first quarter of 2019, we expect total reported net revenue between $3.4 billion and $3.55 billion, as most of the revenue pressures in 2019 we've discussed are more heavily weighted in the first half of the year and non-GAAP performance net income per share between $3.40 and $3.60, which reflects a more even phasing of operating expenses throughout the year. 
Then wrapping up the financial discussion, we finished 2018 with solid results. Our core business drivers continue to deliver strong growth. We've rightsized the business to absorb the impact of LOEs and other headwinds, all of which positions us well to achieve the targets we've set for ourselves in the coming year. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back to Brent."

As it relates to CoolSculpting and the outlook for 2019, I would expect that systems revenue over the next 12 months will trade in the mid-single digits and will be primarily driven by the International recovery, which, as you saw in the fourth quarter, was very, very strong. We placed a record number of systems in 2018. That's going to provide an important platform for consumable growth, which, I think, can trade in the double digits. And then I would, again, keep your eye on that international business, which looks very good right now. And then, finally, the launch of the CoolTone system. And I think that pretty much covers the questions on CoolSculpting. As it relates to BOTOX Therapeutic, I thought about it this way. There were 2 tests. The first test was 2018, and I think that we passed it. The growth rate in the quarter was 13%. The business looks very, very good. But to be fair, there's a second test. And I think, by the second half of 2019, we'll have a better sense of how this migraine market is going to look. There's no question, when you look at the IMS data that the market is much bigger today than it was 9 months ago. There's also no question that demand for BOTOX has been stable. We didn't have a quarter in 2018 that was below 10%. And so I like the way it looks as we go into the year, and we'll provide an update on the next call."

With respect to discounting, I would tell you that if you looked kind of anecdotally at what happened during the Christmas season with discounting from the exist -- the already existing competitors on the marketplace, it was fairly significant versus the price of BOTOX. And so we have been competing against very steep discounted products for years, and BOTOX has done very well despite that. So I don't -- I can't speculate what they'll do, but I don't think there's a lot of room to be successful with just a pure discounting strategy. I don't know if Bill has anything he'd add."

This market as much growth potential as, I think, any market in health care. We don't view it as a market share battle at this point. I don't think toxins are interchangeable. They are definitely similar, but in the hands of very large injectors. There are differences. And even if they're subtle, they're important. I think there are 2 market segments here. There's the branded segment, which is essentially BOTOX and then there's a nondifferentiated segment. And it's an efficient market. And over time, I don't think it's going to support more than 3 products. It's not going to support 4, 5 or 6. I don't see why an aesthetic specialist would buy inventory and inject so many different toxins. And BOTOX has been a practice builder for these physicians. It's the only toxin that is requested. And it's a gateway for physicians. And our focus is on maintaining it. And it's supported by the largest sales force in aesthetics, the largest training program in aesthetics and the only -- really, the only loyalty program in aesthetics.

When you look at price, and this is consistent and -- of how we thought about it last year, this year and over the next several years, it's basically a nonfactor, right? We saw no price appreciation on a net basis in '18. We anticipate no price appreciation on a net basis in '19. And we baked no price appreciation into our outlook on a go-forward basis. So I think the facts support what our assumption was a few years ago, which is price was not going to be a growth driver in any way, shape or form in this industry, not unique to Allergan, but across the entire industry, as you would expect it to.

And then the other issues related to the near-term headwinds, I'll try and dimensionalize those a bit for you in terms of how they were incorporated into our planning. So for textured implants, we had said that the international market for textured implants was about $60 million. As we incorporated that into our planning for 2019, we've expanded that a bit to include some knock-on effects in other ex U.S. market. So that's about $100 million relative to what our normalized expectation for 2019 would have been. OZURDEX is about half that. Let's call it about $50 million.

As it relates to BOTOX and neurology, first of all, I think if you look at the IMS data, I think it has a new name now because they were required. There's -- yes, IQVIA. There's nearly 200,000 new patients that have been placed on the CGRPs and mostly Aimovig. At least. that's -- you can ask the management teams at Amgen, Teva and Lilly, but that's at least my take on it. And the reason why I think you haven't seen a material impact on BOTOX is fairly straightforward. First of all, half of those 200,000 patients have episodic migraine. And so they're really not in our universe of users. You can see that in the IIQVIA data, too. Next is think about the large off-label market for the prevention of migraine. You have literally over 15 million prescriptions being written between products, like Topamax or generic topiramate, TCAs and beta blockers. And so if you look -- although this data is not perfect, if you look at the IMS data, you have roughly 70% of use for CGRPs, it appears to me, coming from new patients, continuing patients and then switches from generic agents, like topiramate. And so it's not surprising that you have BOTOX coexisting in the market with the CGRPs. And to be fair, what I think is most reassuring, as we think about BOTOX long term, is that with the number of new patients for the prevention of migraine, the branded prevention of migraine nearly doubling, the CGRPs, to a certain extent, become a gateway to BOTOX. And I suppose the reverse is true. And when you look at the data on BOTOX, the effect of BOTOX on migraine in terms of prevention of migraine days on a monthly basis can't be beat by any of the CGRPs. And it's a -- and the benefit-risk ratio of BOTOX is pretty well characterized. And so like I said, there are 2 tests. Year '18 was the first one. And I think the second -- the first half of 2019 is the second one. It's too early to call this, but the business looks very healthy right now."

We do that on a regular basis and, very specifically, on an annual basis in a more formal way. Right now, our strategic direction is quite clear, as I just outlined.

I think the underlying prescription demand for that business is very, very reassuring, despite some of the pricing headwinds that we're facing. We had a very, very good quarter, both in terms of underlying prescription growth and top line growth. And the partnership with Ironwood continues to be very productive. And then when you look at the pipeline, I think it's a little underappreciated right now because we're in the middle of Phase III, and we need data. Brazikumab is an IL-23 biologic for IBD, Crohn's and ulcerative colitis. And we're doing head-to-head studies versus Humira and versus Stelara. And so if those studies are positive, it should be a significant contributor in the future. Relamorelin is probably the most potent prokinetic on the market for gastroparesis. And again, that's in Phase III. There's really nothing available for gastroparesis. You could look to Reglan or Propulsid as the last 2 pro-motility agents, both very successful commercially. We have to produce more data. And then of course, we have the CVC program, which we'll report out towards the end of 2009 -- 2019, 2020 -- or excuse me, beyond that. And that's also very interesting. And so we're building a bridge, I would describe it, from the market of products today, which are in a good position to a pipeline that could be very promising."

There are 3 key themes that I'd like to highlight on the call today. First, we delivered solid financial results in the fourth quarter, finishing up a strong 2018, underscoring the strength of our core business. Second, our R&D pipeline is advancing, and we expect many significant clinical and regulatory milestones in 2019. And third, based on the strength of our core business, the emerging pipeline and continued focus on strong execution, we feel confident about our outlook in 2019. 
Turning to Slide 5. 2018 was a year of steady strategic progress for Allergan, and we achieved the financial and operational goals that we had set at the beginning of the year. I'm very proud of our team's operational, R&D and non-GAAP financial results in 2018. 
In 2018, we made significant headway with our pipeline and delivered positive clinical results from 6 late-stage development programs across our therapeutic areas. We made 10 major registrational submissions globally, including for VRAYLAR in bipolar depression, and we expect an FDA decision in May. 
On the migraine front, we reported compelling data for both ubrogepant in acute treatment and prevention of migraine and atogepant for episodic migraine. Assuming these 2 oral CGRPs are approved, we will have one of the most comprehensive migraine portfolios in the industry. 
We have made significant progress with our Eye Care pipeline and recorded positive Phase III data for abicipar in wet AMD and with Bimatoprost SR in glaucoma and are on track to make regulatory submissions for both later this year. 
In the GI space, we have advanced 3 important late-stage programs: brazikumab, an IL-23 antibody for inflammatory bowel disease; relamorelin for diabetic gastroparesis; and CVC for NASH. 
With 13 pharmaceutical and 10 device programs in late-stage development, we are well positioned to launch 1 or 2 new products each year for the next several years. 
In 2018, despite the sales impact from products losing exclusivity, or LOEs, we maintained healthy margins and invested in our core business for growth. And we took a disciplined approach to capital allocation, which was balanced across driving growth, strengthening our balance sheet and returning attractive levels of capital to our shareholders. 
In 2018, our net performance -- our performance net income per share came in at $16.69 for the full year, which is above the high end of our most recently provided guidance range. We generated strong cash flows of $5.6 billion, improved our balance sheet and continued to return capital to shareholders. And we reduced our outstanding debt by over $6 billion and executed more than $2.7 billion in share repurchases in 2018 alone. 
Our 2018 performance reinforces our commitment to successfully execute our strategy and create a global biopharma leader focused on 4 key therapeutic areas: Medical Aesthetics; CNS; Eye Care; and GI. Taken together, these accomplishments give me confidence in our ability to continue producing solid results in 2019 and beyond, while also delivering innovation that will have an enduring impact on patients, customers and shareholders.
Turning to Slide 6. I will briefly review the key drivers of our 2018 performance. Our core business, which accounted for 87% of our total revenues in 2018, was $13.8 billion, growing 8.3% year-over-year at constant currency. This was driven by robust growth in many of our anchor brands, such as BOTOX Cosmetic, BOTOX Therapeutic, JUVÉDERM, VRAYLAR, Lo LOESTRIN and LINZESS. Core business growth in 2018 was offset by declines in brands facing LOEs, divestitures of nonstrategic assets and, in the later part of the year, some shortfalls in the international business associated with the recalls of OZURDEX and textured breast implants in certain international markets. We believe we have resolved the OZURDEX issue and expect supply to be normalized in the second quarter. Overall, our core business continues to perform well and is poised for durable growth over the long term. 
Slide 7 provides a brief snapshot of key financial metrics for the quarter and for the full year. You will hear more about this in the financial guidance for 2019 from Matt. Of note, our guidance does not take into consideration any impact from potential future divestitures. 
Before I turn to our goals for 2019, I'd like to provide an update on the sale process that we have been conducting for anti-infectives and Women's Health.
On anti-infectives, we are in the final stages of this process and believe that it is -- that this business is more likely than not to be sold. While we do not yet have a completed transaction to announce at this time, and there are always risks to completing a transaction, current facts and circumstances are indicating that a sale of anti-infectives is probable over the near term. 
For Women's Health, we have concluded that the highest value proposition for this business at this time is to continue managing it and optimizing it. As a result, we are winding down the advisory web process. We will continue to explore future opportunities to unlock value with Women's Health. Several flagship products in Women's Health were up 15% year-over-year, which is a true testament to the scale and expertise of our Women's Health team, and I'd like to recognize them for their strong contribution.
Looking ahead to 2019 and beyond, our strategy for long-term growth is clear. Outlined on Slide 8 is a snapshot of our 4 main businesses, which represent over 80% of our top line sales. We are committed to these areas and take a long-term view of each of these for 3 reasons. First, we have product line in depth and own a #1 or #2 position. Second, we have a clear line of sight to innovation and new product flow. And third, our regulatory development and commercial expertise are competitive advantages. 
Medical Aesthetics and Eye Care are the largest in global, followed by CNS and GI, which have strong future growth potential. The other key point here is that each of these businesses is supported by several mid- to late-stage pipeline products. In other words, each business has a bench of future growth catalysts and development. I expect that we will launch more new products than any other company in these 4 therapeutic areas. And finally, we intend to accomplish these goals with discipline and balanced capital deployment. 
These clear strategic priorities, combined with our resolute focus on strong execution operationally, commercially and financially, give me confidence that we are well positioned to create sustainable growth and shareholder value in 2019 and beyond. 
Now let me turn the call over to Bill for more detail on product highlights."

Slide 10 is a product-level sales analysis for the fourth quarter ranked in terms of sales growth versus prior year. We had another solid quarter with double-digit sales growth for a number of our major products. BOTOX, VRAYLAR, JUVÉDERM and Lo LOESTRIN were standouts in the quarter. Other key brands, including OZURDEX, ALLODERM and CoolSculpting, had lower growth rates for the quarter and the year, which I'll discuss shortly. The core business is in an excellent position as we start 2019. 
At the bottom of the graph, and as expected, total sales growth was impacted by products already facing loss of exclusivity as well as RESTASIS sales decline, ahead of anticipated generic competition. 
Slide 11 reflects full year sales results for our top 8 or flagship products. These products account for over 50% of the core business and most of our growth. Collectively, sales for these products increased by $1 billion -- approximately $1 billion in 2018, and 6 of the 8 increased by 10% or more versus prior year. BOTOX was the biggest growth contributor, and VRAYLAR was the fastest growing. The fundamentals for each one of these businesses are strong for 2019. 
Now I'll touch on our key therapeutic areas, starting with our largest one, Medical Aesthetics. 
Turning to Slide 12. For the full year 2018, sales for Medical Aesthetics were up 13%. Sales for BOTOX Cosmetic, JUVÉDERM and ALLODERM were very strong and up 14%, 12% and 18%, respectively, and drove the majority of our aesthetics business growth. Sales of ALLODERM were well above expectations, driven by more product utilization per surgery. Sales in the fourth quarter, however, were impacted by constraint for donor material. We anticipate donor capacity to increase during the course of 2019 and that sales will continue to grow. 
For the full year 2018, sales for CoolSculpting globally were up 6.3% pro forma. Consumables sales, which represent 64% of the total, were up 12%, both in the United States and internationally for the year. System sales declined 2% due primarily to price in the United States. Importantly, we added almost 1,200 systems in the United States, representing a 24% increase versus the prior year. In 2009 (sic) [ 2019 ], we estimate sales growth for CoolSculpting will be driven primarily by consumable demand off of a much larger installed systems base and overall greater contribution from our international business. We estimate roughly 50% of 2019 CoolSculpting growth will come from International and 50% from the U.S. By way of comparison, in 2018, International sales for CoolSculpting represented only about 1/3 of total growth. 
We will also be launching a new body contouring system in the United States in the fourth quarter of 2019 called CoolTone. This is the first of 3 new systems that will create the most comprehensive body contouring solution in aesthetics to address fat reduction, which is the foundation of treatment; and muscle toning and skin tightening. Our CoolTone device is complementary and will be marketed alongside CoolSculpting. 
In 2019, our primary focus for Medical Aesthetics is maintaining our market leadership and expanding the category, and we've taken the following steps to maximize sales. We've expanded our field forces for facial injectables and body contouring by 20% to drive better and broader customer coverage. We have significantly increased the scale of our consumer and digital marketing programs, including new consumer campaigns for both BOTOX, which launched yesterday; and JUVÉDERM, which launched in October. We plan more injector and CoolSculpting training programs than we did in 2018. And finally, we expect to launch a new customer service portal in the first quarter, which will make doing business with Allergan even more efficient. The fundamentals and outlook for this business continue to be very strong in 2019 and beyond. 
Turning to Slide 13 in CNS. Our flagship products, as you know, are BOTOX and VRAYLAR. Sales for BOTOX were up 13% and were ahead of expectations. Growth was coming from all indications: migraines, spasticity, NOAB and across all channels. I want to take a moment to talk about the impact of new products on BOTOX, specifically in migraine. No different from the last quarter, we've not experienced a visible impact on BOTOX demand from any of the approved CGRP monoclonal antibodies. The branded migraine prevention market has nearly doubled since the launch of Aimovig, and we have a 50% share of new patients with BOTOX. As I've talked about before, we expect BOTOX and CGRP antibodies to coexist in a much larger market. And we expect the growth rate in '19 will be at least in the mid- to high single digits. We estimate today that only 2% of Aimovig patients were switched from BOTOX, and it appears that combination use is also limited at this time. Finally, medical benefit coverage for BOTOX in 2018 was broad, and we expect the same in 2019. The underlying growth of this business is volume based. 
Sales for VRAYLAR in '18 totaled $487 million, up 69%. This product continues to exceed expectation on every metric, including prescribers, prescription levels and formulary coverage rates. And our consumer campaign is producing exceptional returns. The growth catalyst for VRAYLAR in '19 is the anticipated new indication for bipolar depression, which is currently under review at the FDA. Over time, this is projected to be one of the most important products at Allergan. 
Turning to Slide 14 on Eye Care and GI. In Eye Care, full year revenues for our glaucoma business were stable on a year-over-year basis. OZURDEX sales declined 6%, impacted by a product recall. We expect to fully resolve the supply situation in the second quarter. U.S. sales were up 13% versus prior year. 
RESTASIS prescription demand was stable year-over-year. This was offset by lower average selling price and lower trade inventory levels. 
Turning now to GI. Sales for our IBS line, LINZESS and VIBERZI, totaled $963 million. Underlying prescription demand for LINZESS in 2018 was very strong at 13% versus prior year. This was partially offset by a lower average selling price, resulting in a net revenue gain of 9% versus 2017. 
The outlook for this business is positive, with OTC conversion being the primary source of growth. We have a strong following in both GI and primary care, very high consumer awareness and widespread formulary coverage. And we will continue to invest in LINZESS alongside our partner, Ironwood, to maximize sales and profitability.
Sales for ZENPEP in 2018 were up 12%, and growth was coming from increased utilization in the GI segment and from our highest dose. ZENPEP is expected to be a solid growth contributor again in '19. 
Turning to Slide 15. Our International sales were up 6% in 2018. The growth drivers were BOTOX Cosmetic, JUVÉDERM and CoolSculpting as well as BOTOX Therapeutic, which were partially offset by the recalls of OZURDEX and textured implants. Excluding these events, International sales grew 9% for the full year. The Asia Pacific/Middle East/Africa regions continue to be the most important growth drivers for us, and the outlook for the International business is very strong. 
And with that, let me turn the call over to David."

We have positive data readouts from several late-stage programs. 
For cariprazine, we reported positive Phase III data and have a regulatory submission under review for the bipolar depression indication with an FDA action date in May. We have also initiated additional clinical studies for cariprazine as an adjunctive treatment in major depressive disorder. 
For ubrogepant, our oral CGRP inhibitor for the acute treatment of migraine, we reported positive data from 2 Phase III efficacy and safety studies, a long-term safety study and also a safety study in healthy volunteers. We expect a regulatory filing in -- with the FDA very soon. 
For atogepant, our oral CGRP inhibitor for the prevention of episodic migraine, we reported positive data from a Phase II/III study and have a Phase III study in episodic migraine as well as the requisite long-term safety study ongoing. We will initiate Phase III studies in chronic migraine in the first half of the year. 
For Bimatoprost SR, we have reported data from 2 positive Phase III studies, and I will be providing some additional details on this program later in the call. 
For abicipar, we reported and presented data from 2 positive Phase III studies and expect to report data from the ongoing MAPLE Study in the first half of this year. This study evaluates a further-optimized formulation. 
For Brimonidine DDS in geographic atrophy, we reported and presented positive Phase II data in 2018 and expect to initiate Phase III studies in the second half of the year. 
Our Rapastinel Phase III program for major depressive disorder is ongoing, and we expect to report in the first half of the year top line data from 3 studies of Rapastinel in the adjunctive setting as well as data from the relapse prevention study. Separate Phase III studies of Rapastinel as monotherapy in major depressive disorder are either underway or about to commence. We also have a Phase II study of Rapastinel for suicidality in major depressive disorder ongoing. 
AGN-241751, our oral NMDA modulator, is in Phase II clinical development for MDD. This agent received Fast Track designation from the FDA. 
Turning to Slide 18 on Bimatoprost SR. Here, we have reported data from 2 positive Phase III data studies. Bimatoprost SR is a first-in-class, biodegradable, intracameral implant providing slow release of bimatoprost, a differentiated approach to treat glaucoma beyond daily eye drop treatments. While drops are effective, compliance remains a big challenge and results in suboptimal outcomes for patients. Our U.S. Phase III program provides 2 identical studies, each enrolling over 500 patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. They were randomized to receive either Bimatoprost SR or Timolol. Over the 12-week primary efficacy period, Bimatoprost SR reduced intraocular pressure by approximately 30%, easily meeting the predefined criteria for non-inferiority to the study comparator, Timolol, in both studies. 
Importantly, both the studies demonstrate the potential for the majority of patients to remain treatment-free for at least 1 year after their last of 3 implants was inserted at 4 monthly intervals. In both studies, Bimatoprost SR was well tolerated by the majority of the patients. Based on these positive data, we plan to make a regulatory submission with the FDA in the second half of 2019. 
Turning now to Slide 19. As you heard from Brent, 2019 is shaping up to be another critical year for pipeline progress and data readouts. Summarized here are some of the key events we anticipate this year and beyond. 
We plan to make significant advances in late-stage programs across all 4 of our key therapeutic areas. In addition to the important developments in the pharmaceutical pipeline, we are also making significant progress with innovation in Medical Aesthetics, including the anticipated launch of CoolTone in the fourth quarter of 2019. 
Before I turn the call over to Matt, I would like to take a minute to highlight both our pharmaceutical as well as our device pipeline. 
Turning to Slide 20. Our pharmaceutical pipeline has over 45 programs in various stages of development. With 13 programs in Phase III, including innovative earlier-stage programs in the areas of Medical Aesthetics, genetically validated targets, gene editing, optogenetics and the microbiome. Whilst not all of these programs may be successful, we have depth across all our therapeutic areas. 
Turning to Slide 21. On the device side, we have 30 programs in development. The majority of these programs enhance our Medical Aesthetics portfolio and include a new line of facial fillers. 
As always, I thank my colleagues in R&D for their hard work as well as the physicians and especially the patients who participate in our clinical trials. 
With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Matt."
36478,596989005,1642061,"Allergan plc, Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2019",2019-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Allergan plc","Executives","Thank you, David. Turning now to the key financial highlights on Page 23. Fourth quarter results exceeded the high end of guidance that we provided last quarter, both for revenue and non-GAAP performance net income per share. Net revenues for the fourth",1664,"Thank you, David. Turning now to the key financial highlights on Page 23. Fourth quarter results exceeded the high end of guidance that we provided last quarter, both for revenue and non-GAAP performance net income per share. 
Net revenues for the fourth quarter were $4.08 billion, a 5.7% decline compared to the prior year period. In addition to the impact from LOEs and divesting the Medical Dermatology business, fourth quarter results also faced a challenging comparison to the prior year period, which happened to be a very strong quarter. 
Net revenues for the full year were $15.8 billion, a narrower 1.1% decline versus prior year. Foreign currency translation created a 1.3 percentage point growth headwind for Q4, but had a de minimis impact on fiscal year revenues. 
In the fourth quarter, the core business grew 3% year-on-year on a reported basis and 4.5% at constant currency. We saw 3 near-term headwinds, which impacted results in total, though none were significant individually: first, the OZURDEX recall, which occurred in Q3 and carried into Q4; and second, the recall of textured implants in certain international markets; and third, the negative impact from foreign exchange translation. Normalizing for the impact of these near-term headwinds, the underlying core business growth was 6.4% at constant currency, which more closely aligns with the strong core business growth realized in prior quarters. 
For fiscal year 2018, the core business delivered over $1 billion in revenue growth, offsetting almost the entire $1.2 billion of revenue decline from LOEs. Strong performance in the promoted brands with ongoing exclusivity, together with all other revenues, drove 6.9% core business growth. This figure represents true organic growth, and it excludes benefits of the 2017 acquisitions of CoolSculpting and Regenerative Medicine as well as the impact of foreign exchange translation. 
Now moving to the -- now moving to margins in the middle of the page. Fiscal year operating margin of 47.9% aligned closely to prior year as the impact of lower operating cost due to restructuring essentially offset a 1 percentage point decline in gross margin, which was driven by product mix and, to a lesser extent, the product recalls just discussed. 
You can also see that our fourth quarter operating margin declined 330 basis points as compared to a very strong result in the prior year period. The decline was due to lower revenues, as previously explained, and also the phasing of both R&D and SG&A spending, which were more heavily weighted to the fourth quarter, in part due to reinvestment of RESTASIS profits back into the core business to fund growth initiatives. 
Moving to the lower section. Non-GAAP performance net income per share in the fourth quarter declined 12%, reflecting the revenue and margin issues just described. On a full year basis, our fiscal year 2018 non-GAAP performance net income per share increased 2% versus prior year as the decline in non-GAAP performance net income was more than offset by lower share count due to buybacks that we executed throughout the year. 
On Slide 24, you can see a more complete look at our key P&L line items for the fourth quarter and the full year as compared to prior year. I've already covered most of the highlights, but a couple of additional items to touch on. 
Net interest expense improved in both Q4 and the full year, largely due to lower average debt balances as we continue to reduce debt. Net interest expense was further reduced as a result of our 2018 leverage neutral refinancing, which we undertook to optimize the currency mix of our total debt. 
Not otherwise mentioned on this slide is the GAAP accounting item for which I'd like to provide some color. We monitor goodwill and intangible assets for indicators of impairment each and every quarter. This quarter, we recorded a GAAP impairment charge of $5.4 billion, with the key drivers being a $1.6 billion intangible asset impairment related to KYBELLA and a $3.5 billion impairment related to goodwill of our U.S. General Medicine segment, a portion of which was allocated to our anti-infectives business, which is now classified as held for sale as a result of the advanced status of the sale process, which Brent covered at the outset of the call. 
Turning now to our fourth quarter performance versus prior year by reporting segment on Slide 25. U.S. Specialized Therapeutics revenue decline of 3.9% was mainly due to lower RESTASIS as well as lower sales of the divested Med Derm business. Contribution margin also decreased 350 basis points due to the revenue decline, coupled with higher sales and marketing expenses, which were in part driven by timing. 
U.S. General Medicine continues to be the segment was impacted by LOEs, as reflected by the revenue decline of 8.4%, which more than offset the strong performance of VRAYLAR and Lo LOESTRIN. Contribution margin increased 140 basis points as the impact of lower revenues was more than offset by a favorable partnership true-up credit on LINZESS and expense savings from restructuring. 
International revenue decline of 5% was significantly impacted by foreign exchange translation as well as the impact of recalls. At constant currency, revenue grew 1% versus prior year, which expands to 8.5%, excluding the impact of OZURDEX and textured implants. Contribution margin was also impacted by the same issues, resulting in a 310 basis point decline versus prior year. 
Turning to Slide 26. You can see on the left, operating cash flow on a last 12-month basis for each ending period. In the fourth quarter, operating cash flow was strong at $1.5 billion, driving our fiscal year 2018 operating cash flow to $5.6 billion, which was above our prior guidance. 
On the right, our capitalization table shows the disciplined actions taken towards capital deployment and return of capital to stakeholders. Couple of points to make here. We ended the year with total debt of $23.8 billion after paying down $6.2 billion or approximately 21% of debt outstanding at the start of the year. Gross and net leverage ratios are down to 3x and 2.8x, respectively, as of December 31. 
On share buybacks, we repurchased a total of $2.7 billion in 2018, including $750 million completed during the fourth quarter. We have $800 million remaining under the 2018 $2 billion share buyback authorization. And as we announced this morning, our board just recently authorized a new $2 billion share buyback program, which we expect to deploy similarly, and that is with the priority on offsetting dilution created by long-term incentive plans as well as potential earnings dilution from asset divestitures that we may complete. 
Our capital allocation priorities continue, as stated previously. First, reinvestment in our business for growth in our 4 key therapeutic areas. Second, debt reduction, which is important in the context of the anticipated loss of RESTASIS exclusivity. We continue to pursue a target net leverage ratio of 2.5x by the end of 2020, and we will maintain our commitment to an investment-grade credit rating. Three, funding the current dividend and prudently growing that dividend annually as the performance of our business allows. And last -- and finally, share buybacks, as we just talked about. 
Moving now to Slide 27, our 2019 guidance. Let's start with net revenues. We expect fiscal year 2019 net revenues to be between $15 billion and $15.3 billion, which assumes RESTASIS exclusivity through March 31. This revenue guidance also includes anticipated headwinds previously discussed related to OZURDEX and textured implants in certain international markets as well as industry-wide pricing pressures and foreign exchange translation headwinds. 
We expect non-GAAP gross margin for 2019 to be between 85% and 85.5%, reflecting the impact of product mix, including the anticipated RESTASIS LOE. 
Our non-GAAP SG&A expense is expected to be between $4.1 billion and $4.3 billion, which supports continued investments in key long-term growth drivers within the core business. 
We expect non-GAAP R&D expense to be between $1.6 billion and $1.7 billion, which reflects increased investment in our pipeline, as we continue to advance key programs in clinical development, as you just heard from David. 
Net interest expense/other of approximately $800 million reflects interest savings from debt reduction, but also lower interest income from reduced cash balances relative to 2018. 
Our non-GAAP effective tax rate in 2019 is expected to be between 13% and 13.5%. 
And our average 2019 share account is forecasted to be approximately 332 million shares, which assumes completion of the remaining $800 million under the 2018 $2 billion share buyback authorization. As a result, and as previously committed, we expect full year 2019 non-GAAP performance net income per share to be greater than or equal to $16.36. 
And please note that any significant asset divestiture, should they be completed, will be dilutive enough to non-GAAP performance net income per share, and we would have to revisit this and most of the other metrics for which we provide guidance. 
Continuing down the page, reported cash flow from operations for 2019 is expected to be between $5 billion and $5.5 billion with the key assumptions being RESTASIS exclusivity through March 31 and success-based development milestones premised upon 100% achievement. 
In line with our previous commentary, we will continue to provide quarterly guidance until there is a RESTASIS generic entrant. 
So for the first quarter of 2019, we expect total reported net revenue between $3.4 billion and $3.55 billion, as most of the revenue pressures in 2019 we've discussed are more heavily weighted in the first half of the year and non-GAAP performance net income per share between $3.40 and $3.60, which reflects a more even phasing of operating expenses throughout the year. 
Then wrapping up the financial discussion, we finished 2018 with solid results. Our core business drivers continue to deliver strong growth. We've rightsized the business to absorb the impact of LOEs and other headwinds, all of which positions us well to achieve the targets we've set for ourselves in the coming year. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back to Brent."

We placed a record number of systems in 2018. That's going to provide an important platform for consumable growth, which I think can trade in the double digits. And then I would, again, keep your eye on that international business, which looks very good right now, and then finally the launch of the CoolTone system. And I think that pretty much covers the questions on CoolSculpting. As it relates to BOTOX Therapeutic, I thought about it this way. There were 2 tests. The first test was 2018, and I think that we passed it. The growth rate in the quarter was 13%. The business looks very, very good. But to be fair, there's a second test. And I think, by the second half of 2019, we'll have a better sense of how this migraine market is going to look. There's no question, when you look at the IMS data that the market is much bigger today than it was 9 months ago. There's also no question that demand for BOTOX has been stable. We didn't have a quarter in 2018 that was below 10%. And so I like the way it looks as we go into the year, and we'll provide an update on the next call."

And it's an efficient market. And over time, I don't think it's going to support more than 3 products. It's not going to support 4, 5 or 6. I don't see why an aesthetic specialist would buy inventory and inject so many different toxins. And BOTOX has been a practice builder for these physicians. It's the only toxin that is requested and it's a gateway for physicians, and our focus is on maintaining it. And it's supported by the largest sales force in aesthetics, the largest training program in aesthetics and the only -- really, the only loyalty program in aesthetics.

And the first place we see it is in our BD enrollment, which is up significantly since we launched the JUVÉDERM campaign. But the age cohort for BOTOX has been trending younger and younger, given, as you know, this millennial movement. In the past 5 years, the number of millennial users in aesthetics has tripled from our estimation just under 300,000 to over 1 million. I would say in the next 5 years, millennials will be the largest consumer of aesthetics products and services, replacing the Generation X."

When you look at price, and this is consistent and -- of how we thought about it last year, this year and over the next several years, it's basically a nonfactor, right.  We saw no price appreciation on a net basis in '18. We anticipate no price appreciation on a net basis in '19. And we baked no price appreciation into our outlook on a go-forward basis. So I think the facts support what our assumption was a few years ago, which is price was not going to be a growth driver in any way, shape or form in this industry, not unique to Allergan, but across the entire industry, as you would expect it to. So we kind of don't think about price essentially."

And then the other issues related to the near-term headwinds, I'll try and dimensionalize those a bit for you in terms of how they were incorporated into our planning. So for textured implants, we had said that the international market for textured implants was about $60 million. As we incorporated that into our planning for 2019, we've expanded that a bit to include some knock-on effects in other ex U.S. market. So that's about $100 million relative to what our normalized expectation for 2019 would have been. OZURDEX is about half that. Let's call it about $50 million.

As it relates to BOTOX and neurology, first of all, I think if you look at the IMS data, I think it has a new name now because they were required. There's -- yes, IQVIA. There's nearly 200,000 new patients that have been placed on the CGRPs and mostly Aimovig. At least that's -- you can ask the management teams at Amgen, Teva and Lilly, but that's at least my take on it. And the reason why I think you haven't seen a material impact on BOTOX is fairly straightforward. First of all, half of those 200,000 patients have episodic migraine. And so they're really not in our universe of users. You can see that in the IIQVIA data, too. Next is think about the large off-label market for the prevention of migraine. You have literally over 15 million prescriptions being written between products like Topamax or generic topiramate, TCAs and beta blockers. And so if you look -- although this data is not perfect, if you look at the IMS data, you have roughly 70% of use for CGRPs, it appears to me, coming from new patients, continuing patients and then switches from generic agents like topiramate. And so it's not surprising that you have BOTOX coexisting in the market with the CGRPs. And to be fair, what I think is most reassuring, as we think about BOTOX long term, is that with the number of new patients for the prevention of migraine, the branded prevention of migraine nearly doubling, the CGRPs, to a certain extent, become a gateway to BOTOX. And I suppose the reverse is true. And when you look at the data on BOTOX, the effect of BOTOX on migraine in terms of prevention of migraine days on a monthly basis can't be beat by any of the CGRPs. And it's a -- and the benefit-risk ratio of BOTOX is pretty well characterized. And so like I said, there are 2 tests here, '18 was the first one. And I think the second -- the first half of 2019 is the second one. It's too early to call this, but the business looks very healthy right now."

I would take LINZESS and ZENPEP and put that into the growing bucket and then VIBERZI and CARAFATE into the stable bucket. Clearly, of the 4, LINZESS is the flagship. I think the underlying prescription demand for that business is very, very reassuring, despite some of the pricing headwinds that we're facing. We had a very, very good quarter, both in terms of underlying prescription growth and top line growth. And the partnership with Ironwood continues to be very productive. And then when you look at the pipeline, I think it's a little underappreciated right now because we're in the middle of Phase III, and we need data. Brazikumab is an IL-23 biologic for IBD, Crohn's and ulcerative colitis. And we're doing head-to-head studies versus Humira and versus Stelara. And so if those studies are positive, it should be a significant contributor in the future. Relamorelin is probably the most potent prokinetic on the market for gastroparesis. And again, that's in Phase III. There's really nothing available for gastroparesis. You could look to Reglan or Propulsid as the last 2 pro-motility agents, both very successful commercially. We have to produce more data. And then of course, we have the CVC program, which we'll report out towards the end of 2009 -- 2019, 2020 -- or excuse me, beyond that. And that's also very interesting. And so we're building a bridge, I would describe it, from the marketed products today, which are in a good position to a pipeline that could be very promising."

There are 3 key themes that I'd like to highlight on the call today. First, we delivered solid financial results in the fourth quarter, finishing up a strong 2018, underscoring the strength of our core business. Second, our R&D pipeline is advancing, and we expect many significant clinical and regulatory milestones in 2019. And third, based on the strength of our core business, the emerging pipeline and continued focus on strong execution, we feel confident about our outlook in 2019. 
Turning to Slide 5. 2018 was a year of steady strategic progress for Allergan, and we achieved the financial and operational goals that we had set at the beginning of the year. I'm very proud of our team's operational, R&D and non-GAAP financial results in 2018. 
In 2018, we made significant headway with our pipeline and delivered positive clinical results from 6 late-stage development programs across our therapeutic areas. We made 10 major registrational submissions globally, including for VRAYLAR in bipolar depression, and we expect an FDA decision in May. 
On the migraine front, we reported compelling data for both ubrogepant in acute treatment and prevention of migraine and atogepant for episodic migraine. Assuming these 2 oral CGRPs are approved, we will have one of the most comprehensive migraine portfolios in the industry. 
We have made significant progress with our Eye Care pipeline and recorded positive Phase III data for abicipar in wet AMD and with Bimatoprost SR in glaucoma and are on track to make regulatory submissions for both later this year. 
In the GI space, we have advanced 3 important late-stage programs: brazikumab, an IL-23 antibody for inflammatory bowel disease; relamorelin for diabetic gastroparesis; and CVC for NASH. 
With 13 pharmaceutical and 10 device programs in late-stage development, we are well positioned to launch 1 or 2 new products each year for the next several years. 
In 2018, despite the sales impact from products losing exclusivity, or LOEs, we maintained healthy margins and invested in our core business for growth. And we took a disciplined approach to capital allocation, which was balanced across driving growth, strengthening our balance sheet and returning attractive levels of capital to our shareholders. 
In 2018, our net performance -- our performance net income per share came in at $16.69 for the full year, which is above the high end of our most recently provided guidance range. We generated strong cash flows of $5.6 billion, improved our balance sheet and continued to return capital to shareholders. And we reduced our outstanding debt by over $6 billion and executed more than $2.7 billion in share repurchases in 2018 alone. 
Our 2018 performance reinforces our commitment to successfully execute our strategy and create a global biopharma leader focused on 4 key therapeutic areas: Medical Aesthetics; CNS; Eye Care; and GI. Taken together, these accomplishments give me confidence in our ability to continue producing solid results in 2019 and beyond, while also delivering innovation that will have an enduring impact on patients, customers and shareholders.
Turning to Slide 6. I will briefly review the key drivers of our 2018 performance. Our core business, which accounted for 87% of our total revenues in 2018, was $13.8 billion, growing 8.3% year-over-year at constant currency. This was driven by robust growth in many of our anchor brands, such as BOTOX Cosmetic, BOTOX Therapeutic, JUVÉDERM, VRAYLAR, Lo LOESTRIN and LINZESS. Core business growth in 2018 was offset by declines in brands facing LOEs, divestitures of nonstrategic assets and, in the later part of the year, some shortfalls in the international business associated with the recalls of OZURDEX and textured breast implants in certain international markets. We believe we have resolved the OZURDEX issue and expect supply to be normalized in the second quarter. Overall, our core business continues to perform well and is poised for durable growth over the long term. 
Slide 7 provides a brief snapshot of key financial metrics for the quarter and for the full year. You will hear more about this in the financial guidance for 2019 from Matt. Of note, our guidance does not take into consideration any impact from potential future divestitures. 
Before I turn to our goals for 2019, I'd like to provide an update on the sale process that we have been conducting for anti-infectives and Women's Health.
On anti-infectives, we are in the final stages of this process and believe that it is -- that this business is more likely than not to be sold. While we do not yet have a completed transaction to announce at this time, and there are always risks to completing a transaction, current facts and circumstances are indicating that a sale of anti-infectives is probable over the near term. 
For Women's Health, we have concluded that the highest value proposition for this business at this time is to continue managing it and optimizing it. As a result, we are winding down the advisory web process. We will continue to explore future opportunities to unlock value with Women's Health. Several flagship products in Women's Health were up 15% year-over-year, which is a true testament to the scale and expertise of our Women's Health team, and I'd like to recognize them for their strong contribution.
Looking ahead to 2019 and beyond, our strategy for long-term growth is clear. Outlined on Slide 8 is a snapshot of our 4 main businesses, which represent over 80% of our top line sales. We are committed to these areas and take a long-term view of each of these for 3 reasons. First, we have product line in depth and own a #1 or #2 position. Second, we have a clear line of sight to innovation and new product flow. And third, our regulatory development and commercial expertise are competitive advantages. 
Medical Aesthetics and Eye Care are the largest in global, followed by CNS and GI, which have strong future growth potential. The other key point here is that each of these businesses is supported by several mid- to late-stage pipeline products. In other words, each business has a bench of future growth catalysts and development. I expect that we will launch more new products than any other company in these 4 therapeutic areas. And finally, we intend to accomplish these goals with discipline and balanced capital deployment. 
These clear strategic priorities, combined with our resolute focus on strong execution operationally, commercially and financially, give me confidence that we are well positioned to create sustainable growth and shareholder value in 2019 and beyond. 
Now let me turn the call over to Bill for more detail on product highlights."

Slide 10 is a product-level sales analysis for the fourth quarter ranked in terms of sales growth versus prior year. We had another solid quarter with double-digit sales growth for a number of our major products. BOTOX, VRAYLAR, JUVÉDERM a",1192,"Thanks, Brent. Slide 10 is a product-level sales analysis for the fourth quarter ranked in terms of sales growth versus prior year. We had another solid quarter with double-digit sales growth for a number of our major products. BOTOX, VRAYLAR, JUVÉDERM and Lo LOESTRIN were standouts in the quarter. Other key brands, including OZURDEX, ALLODERM and CoolSculpting, had lower growth rates for the quarter and the year, which I'll discuss shortly. The core business is in an excellent position as we start 2019. 
At the bottom of the graph, and as expected, total sales growth was impacted by products already facing loss of exclusivity as well as RESTASIS sales decline, ahead of anticipated generic competition. 
Slide 11 reflects full year sales results for our top 8 or flagship products. These products account for over 50% of the core business and most of our growth. Collectively, sales for these products increased by $1 billion -- approximately $1 billion in 2018, and 6 of the 8 increased by 10% or more versus prior year. BOTOX was the biggest growth contributor, and VRAYLAR was the fastest growing. The fundamentals for each one of these businesses are strong for 2019. 
Now I'll touch on our key therapeutic areas, starting with our largest one, Medical Aesthetics. 
Turning to Slide 12. For the full year 2018, sales for Medical Aesthetics were up 13%. Sales for BOTOX Cosmetic, JUVÉDERM and ALLODERM were very strong and up 14%, 12% and 18%, respectively, and drove the majority of our aesthetics business growth. Sales of ALLODERM were well above expectations, driven by more product utilization per surgery. Sales in the fourth quarter, however, were impacted by constraint for donor material. We anticipate donor capacity to increase during the course of 2019 and that sales will continue to grow. 
For the full year 2018, sales for CoolSculpting globally were up 6.3% pro forma. Consumables sales, which represent 64% of the total, were up 12%, both in the United States and internationally for the year. System sales declined 2% due primarily to price in the United States. Importantly, we added almost 1,200 systems in the United States, representing a 24% increase versus the prior year. In 2009 (sic) [ 2019 ], we estimate sales growth for CoolSculpting will be driven primarily by consumable demand off of a much larger installed systems base and overall greater contribution from our international business. We estimate roughly 50% of 2019 CoolSculpting growth will come from International and 50% from the U.S. By way of comparison, in 2018, International sales for CoolSculpting represented only about 1/3 of total growth. 
We will also be launching a new body contouring system in the United States in the fourth quarter of 2019 called CoolTone. This is the first of 3 new systems that will create the most comprehensive body contouring solution in aesthetics to address fat reduction, which is the foundation of treatment; and muscle toning and skin tightening. Our CoolTone device is complementary and will be marketed alongside CoolSculpting. 
In 2019, our primary focus for Medical Aesthetics is maintaining our market leadership and expanding the category, and we've taken the following steps to maximize sales. We've expanded our field forces for facial injectables and body contouring by 20% to drive better and broader customer coverage. We have significantly increased the scale of our consumer and digital marketing programs, including new consumer campaigns for both BOTOX, which launched yesterday; and JUVÉDERM, which launched in October. We plan more injector and CoolSculpting training programs than we did in 2018. And finally, we expect to launch a new customer service portal in the first quarter, which will make doing business with Allergan even more efficient. The fundamentals and outlook for this business continue to be very strong in 2019 and beyond. 
Turning to Slide 13 in CNS. Our flagship products, as you know, are BOTOX and VRAYLAR. Sales for BOTOX were up 13% and were ahead of expectations. Growth was coming from all indications: migraines, spasticity, NOAB and across all channels. I want to take a moment to talk about the impact of new products on BOTOX, specifically in migraine. No different from the last quarter, we've not experienced a visible impact on BOTOX demand from any of the approved CGRP monoclonal antibodies. The branded migraine prevention market has nearly doubled since the launch of Aimovig, and we have a 50% share of new patients with BOTOX. As I've talked about before, we expect BOTOX and CGRP antibodies to coexist in a much larger market. And we expect the growth rate in '19 will be at least in the mid- to high single digits. We estimate today that only 2% of Aimovig patients were switched from BOTOX, and it appears that combination use is also limited at this time. Finally, medical benefit coverage for BOTOX in 2018 was broad, and we expect the same in 2019. The underlying growth of this business is volume based. 
Sales for VRAYLAR in '18 totaled $487 million, up 69%. This product continues to exceed expectation on every metric, including prescribers, prescription levels and formulary coverage rates. And our consumer campaign is producing exceptional returns. The growth catalyst for VRAYLAR in '19 is the anticipated new indication for bipolar depression, which is currently under review at the FDA. Over time, this is projected to be one of the most important products at Allergan. 
Turning to Slide 14 on Eye Care and GI. In Eye Care, full year revenues for our glaucoma business were stable on a year-over-year basis. OZURDEX sales declined 6%, impacted by a product recall. We expect to fully resolve the supply situation in the second quarter. U.S. sales were up 13% versus prior year. 
RESTASIS prescription demand was stable year-over-year. This was offset by lower average selling price and lower trade inventory levels. 
Turning now to GI. Sales for our IBS line, LINZESS and VIBERZI, totaled $963 million. Underlying prescription demand for LINZESS in 2018 was very strong at 13% versus prior year. This was partially offset by a lower average selling price, resulting in a net revenue gain of 9% versus 2017. 
The outlook for this business is positive, with OTC conversion being the primary source of growth. We have a strong following in both GI and primary care, very high consumer awareness and widespread formulary coverage. And we will continue to invest in LINZESS alongside our partner, Ironwood, to maximize sales and profitability.
Sales for ZENPEP in 2018 were up 12%, and growth was coming from increased utilization in the GI segment and from our highest dose. ZENPEP is expected to be a solid growth contributor again in '19. 
Turning to Slide 15. Our International sales were up 6% in 2018. The growth drivers were BOTOX Cosmetic, JUVÉDERM and CoolSculpting as well as BOTOX Therapeutic, which were partially offset by the recalls of OZURDEX and textured implants. Excluding these events, International sales grew 9% for the full year. The Asia Pacific/Middle East/Africa regions continue to be the most important growth drivers for us, and the outlook for the International business is very strong. 
And with that, let me turn the call over to David."

For ubrogepant, our oral CGRP inhibitor for the acute treatment of migraine, we reported positive data from 2 Phase III efficacy and safety studies, a long-term safety study and also a safety study in healthy volunteers. We expect a regulatory filing in -- with the FDA very soon. 
For atogepant, our oral CGRP inhibitor for the prevention of episodic migraine, we reported positive data from a Phase II/III study and have a Phase III study in episodic migraine as well as the requisite long-term safety study ongoing. We will initiate Phase III studies in chronic migraine in the first half of the year. 
For Bimatoprost SR, we have reported data from 2 positive Phase III studies, and I will be providing some additional details on this program later in the call. 
For abicipar, we reported and presented data from 2 positive Phase III studies and expect to report data from the ongoing MAPLE Study in the first half of this year. This study evaluates a further-optimized formulation. 
For Brimonidine DDS in geographic atrophy, we reported and presented positive Phase II data in 2018 and expect to initiate Phase III studies in the second half of the year. 
Our Rapastinel Phase III program for major depressive disorder is ongoing, and we expect to report in the first half of the year top line data from 3 studies of Rapastinel in the adjunctive setting as well as data from the relapse prevention study. Separate Phase III studies of Rapastinel as monotherapy in major depressive disorder are either underway or about to commence. We also have a Phase II study of Rapastinel for suicidality in major depressive disorder ongoing. 
AGN-241751, our oral NMDA modulator, is in Phase II clinical development for MDD. This agent received Fast Track designation from the FDA. 
Turning to Slide 18 on Bimatoprost SR. Here, we have reported data from 2 positive Phase III data studies. Bimatoprost SR is a first-in-class, biodegradable, intracameral implant providing slow release of bimatoprost, a differentiated approach to treat glaucoma beyond daily eye drop treatments. While drops are effective, compliance remains a big challenge and results in suboptimal outcomes for patients. Our U.S. Phase III program provides 2 identical studies, each enrolling over 500 patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. They were randomized to receive either Bimatoprost SR or Timolol. Over the 12-week primary efficacy period, Bimatoprost SR reduced intraocular pressure by approximately 30%, easily meeting the predefined criteria for non-inferiority to the study comparator, Timolol, in both studies. 
Importantly, both the studies demonstrate the potential for the majority of patients to remain treatment-free for at least 1 year after their last of 3 implants was inserted at 4 monthly intervals. In both studies, Bimatoprost SR was well tolerated by the majority of the patients. Based on these positive data, we plan to make a regulatory submission with the FDA in the second half of 2019. 
Turning now to Slide 19. As you heard from Brent, 2019 is shaping up to be another critical year for pipeline progress and data readouts. Summarized here are some of the key events we anticipate this year and beyond. 
We plan to make significant advances in late-stage programs across all 4 of our key therapeutic areas. In addition to the important developments in the pharmaceutical pipeline, we are also making significant progress with innovation in Medical Aesthetics, including the anticipated launch of CoolTone in the fourth quarter of 2019. 
Before I turn the call over to Matt, I would like to take a minute to highlight both our pharmaceutical as well as our device pipeline. 
Turning to Slide 20. Our pharmaceutical pipeline has over 45 programs in various stages of development. With 13 programs in Phase III, including innovative earlier-stage programs in the areas of Medical Aesthetics, genetically validated targets, gene editing, optogenetics and the microbiome. Whilst not all of these programs may be successful, we have depth across all our therapeutic areas. 
Turning to Slide 21. On the device side, we have 30 programs in development. The majority of these programs enhance our Medical Aesthetics portfolio and include a new line of facial fillers. 
As always, I thank my colleagues in R&D for their hard work as well as the physicians and especially the patients who participate in our clinical trials. 
With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Matt."

Turning now to the key financial highlights on Page 23. Fourth quarter results exceeded the high end of guidance that we provided last quarter, both for revenue and non-GAAP performance net income per share. Net revenues for the fourth",1664,"Thank you, David. Turning now to the key financial highlights on Page 23. Fourth quarter results exceeded the high end of guidance that we provided last quarter, both for revenue and non-GAAP performance net income per share. 
Net revenues for the fourth quarter were $4.08 billion, a 5.7% decline compared to the prior year period. In addition to the impact from LOEs and divesting the Medical Dermatology business, fourth quarter results also faced a challenging comparison to the prior year period, which happened to be a very strong quarter. 
Net revenues for the full year were $15.8 billion, a narrower 1.1% decline versus prior year. Foreign currency translation created a 1.3 percentage point growth headwind for Q4 but had a de minimis impact on fiscal year revenues. 
In the fourth quarter, the core business grew 3% year-on-year on a reported basis and 4.5% at constant currency. We saw 3 near-term headwinds, which impacted results in total, though none were significant individually: first, the OZURDEX recall, which occurred in Q3 and carried into Q4; and second, the recall of textured implants in certain international markets; and third, the negative impact from foreign exchange translation. Normalizing for the impact of these near-term headwinds, the underlying core business growth was 6.4% at constant currency, which more closely aligns with the strong core business growth realized in prior quarters. 
For fiscal year 2018, the core business delivered over $1 billion in revenue growth, offsetting almost the entire $1.2 billion of revenue decline from LOEs. Strong performance in the promoted brands with ongoing exclusivity, together with all other revenues, drove 6.9% core business growth. This figure represents true organic growth, and it excludes benefits of the 2017 acquisitions of CoolSculpting and Regenerative Medicine as well as the impact of foreign exchange translation. 
Now moving to the -- now moving to margins in the middle of the page. Fiscal year operating margin of 47.9% aligned closely to prior year as the impact of lower operating cost due to restructuring essentially offset a 1 percentage point decline in gross margin, which was driven by product mix and, to a lesser extent, the product recalls just discussed. 
You can also see that our fourth quarter operating margin declined 330 basis points as compared to a very strong result in the prior year period. The decline was due to lower revenues, as previously explained, and also the phasing of both R&D and SG&A spending, which were more heavily weighted to the fourth quarter, in part due to reinvestment of RESTASIS profits back into the core business to fund growth initiatives. 
Moving to the lower section. Non-GAAP performance net income per share in the fourth quarter declined 12%, reflecting the revenue and margin issues just described. On a full year basis, our fiscal year 2018 non-GAAP performance net income per share increased 2% versus prior year as the decline in non-GAAP performance net income was more than offset by lower share count due to buybacks that we executed throughout the year. 
On Slide 24, you can see a more complete look at our key P&L line items for the fourth quarter and the full year as compared to prior year. I've already covered most of the highlights, but a couple of additional items to touch on. 
Net interest expense improved in both Q4 and the full year, largely due to lower average debt balances as we continue to reduce debt. Net interest expense was further reduced as a result of our 2018 leverage neutral refinancing, which we undertook to optimize the currency mix of our total debt. 
Not otherwise mentioned on this slide is the GAAP accounting item for which I'd like to provide some color. We monitor goodwill and intangible assets for indicators of impairment each and every quarter. This quarter, we recorded a GAAP impairment charge of $5.4 billion, with the key drivers being a $1.6 billion intangible asset impairment related to KYBELLA and a $3.5 billion impairment related to goodwill of our U.S. General Medicine segment, a portion of which was allocated to our anti-infectives business, which is now classified as held for sale as a result of the advanced status of the sale process, which Brent covered at the outset of the call. 
Turning now to our fourth quarter performance versus prior year by reporting segment on Slide 25. U.S. Specialized Therapeutics revenue decline of 3.9% was mainly due to lower RESTASIS as well as lower sales of the divested Med Derm business. Contribution margin also decreased 350 basis points due to the revenue decline, coupled with higher sales and marketing expenses, which were in part driven by timing. 
U.S. General Medicine continues to be the segment was impacted by LOEs, as reflected by the revenue decline of 8.4%, which more than offset the strong performance of VRAYLAR and Lo LOESTRIN. Contribution margin increased 140 basis points as the impact of lower revenues was more than offset by a favorable partnership true-up credit on LINZESS and expense savings from restructuring. 
International revenue decline of 5% was significantly impacted by foreign exchange translation as well as the impact of recalls. At constant currency, revenue grew 1% versus prior year, which expands to 8.5%, excluding the impact of OZURDEX and textured implants. Contribution margin was also impacted by the same issues, resulting in a 310 basis point decline versus prior year. 
Turning to Slide 26. You can see on the left, operating cash flow on a last 12-month basis for each ending period. In the fourth quarter, operating cash flow was strong at $1.5 billion, driving our fiscal year 2018 operating cash flow to $5.6 billion, which was above our prior guidance. 
On the right, our capitalization table shows the disciplined actions taken towards capital deployment and return of capital to stakeholders. Couple of points to make here. We ended the year with total debt of $23.8 billion after paying down $6.2 billion or approximately 21% of debt outstanding at the start of the year. Gross and net leverage ratios are down to 3x and 2.8x, respectively, as of December 31. 
On share buybacks, we repurchased a total of $2.7 billion in 2018, including $750 million completed during the fourth quarter. We have $800 million remaining under the 2018 $2 billion share buyback authorization. And as we announced this morning, our board just recently authorized a new $2 billion share buyback program, which we expect to deploy similarly, and that is with the priority on offsetting dilution created by long-term incentive plans as well as potential earnings dilution from asset divestitures that we may complete. 
Our capital allocation priorities continue, as stated previously. First, reinvestment in our business for growth in our 4 key therapeutic areas. Second, debt reduction, which is important in the context of the anticipated loss of RESTASIS exclusivity. We continue to pursue a target net leverage ratio of 2.5x by the end of 2020, and we will maintain our commitment to an investment-grade credit rating. Three, funding the current dividend and prudently growing that dividend annually as the performance of our business allows. And last -- and finally, share buybacks, as we just talked about. 
Moving now to Slide 27, our 2019 guidance. Let's start with net revenues. We expect fiscal year 2019 net revenues to be between $15 billion and $15.3 billion, which assumes RESTASIS exclusivity through March 31. This revenue guidance also includes anticipated headwinds previously discussed related to OZURDEX and textured implants in certain international markets as well as industry-wide pricing pressures and foreign exchange translation headwinds. 
We expect non-GAAP gross margin for 2019 to be between 85% and 85.5%, reflecting the impact of product mix, including the anticipated RESTASIS LOE. 
Our non-GAAP SG&A expense is expected to be between $4.1 billion and $4.3 billion, which supports continued investments in key long-term growth drivers within the core business. 
We expect non-GAAP R&D expense to be between $1.6 billion and $1.7 billion, which reflects increased investment in our pipeline, as we continue to advance key programs in clinical development, as you just heard from David. 
Net interest expense/other of approximately $800 million reflects interest savings from debt reduction, but also lower interest income from reduced cash balances relative to 2018. 
Our non-GAAP effective tax rate in 2019 is expected to be between 13% and 13.5%. 
And our average 2019 share account is forecasted to be approximately 332 million shares, which assumes completion of the remaining $800 million under the 2018 $2 billion share buyback authorization. As a result, and as previously committed, we expect full year 2019 non-GAAP performance net income per share to be greater than or equal to $16.36. 
And please note that any significant asset divestiture, should they be completed, will be dilutive enough to non-GAAP performance net income per share, and we would have to revisit this and most of the other metrics for which we provide guidance. 
Continuing down the page, reported cash flow from operations for 2019 is expected to be between $5 billion and $5.5 billion with the key assumptions being RESTASIS exclusivity through March 31 and success-based development milestones premised upon 100% achievement. 
In line with our previous commentary, we will continue to provide quarterly guidance until there is a RESTASIS generic entrant. 
So for the first quarter of 2019, we expect total reported net revenue between $3.4 billion and $3.55 billion, as most of the revenue pressures in 2019 we've discussed are more heavily weighted in the first half of the year and non-GAAP performance net income per share between $3.40 and $3.60, which reflects a more even phasing of operating expenses throughout the year. 
Then wrapping up the financial discussion, we finished 2018 with solid results. Our core business drivers continue to deliver strong growth. We've rightsized the business to absorb the impact of LOEs and other headwinds, all of which positions us well to achieve the targets we've set for ourselves in the coming year. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back to Brent."

We placed a record number of systems in 2018. That's going to provide an important platform for consumable growth, which I think can trade in the double digits. And then I would, again, keep your eye on that international business, which looks very good right now, and then finally the launch of the CoolTone system. And I think that pretty much covers the questions on CoolSculpting. As it relates to BOTOX Therapeutic, I thought about it this way. There were 2 tests. The first test was 2018, and I think that we passed it. The growth rate in the quarter was 13%. The business looks very, very good. But to be fair, there's a second test. And I think, by the second half of 2019, we'll have a better sense of how this migraine market is going to look. There's no question when you look at the IMS data that the market is much bigger today than it was 9 months ago. There's also no question that demand for BOTOX has been stable. We didn't have a quarter in 2018 that was below 10%. And so I like the way it looks as we go into the year, and we'll provide an update on the next call."

With respect to discounting, I would tell you that if you looked kind of anecdotally at what happened during the Christmas season with discounting from the already existing competitors on the marketplace, it was fairly significant versus the price of BOTOX. And so we have been competing against very steep discounted products for years, and BOTOX has done very well despite that. So I don't -- I can't speculate what they'll do, but I don't think there's a lot of room to be successful with just a pure discounting strategy. I don't know if Bill has anything else he'd add."

We don't view it as a market share battle at this point. I don't think toxins are interchangeable. They are definitely similar, but in the hands of very large injectors, there are differences. And even if they're subtle, they're important. I think there are 2 market segments here. There's the branded segment, which is essentially BOTOX and then there's a non-differentiated segment. And it's an efficient market. And over time, I don't think it's going to support more than 3 products. It's not going to support 4, 5 or 6. I don't see why an aesthetic specialist would buy inventory and inject so many different toxins. And BOTOX has been a practice builder for these physicians. It's the only toxin that is requested and it's a gateway for physicians, and our focus is on maintaining it. And it's supported by the largest sales force in aesthetics, the largest training program in aesthetics and the only -- really, the only loyalty program in aesthetics.

When you look at price, and this is consistent and -- of how we thought about it last year, this year and over the next several years, it's basically a nonfactor, right. We saw no price appreciation on a net basis in '18. We anticipate no price appreciation on a net basis in '19. And we baked no price appreciation into our outlook on a go-forward basis. So I think the facts support what our assumption was a few years ago, which is price was not going to be a growth driver in any way, shape or form in this industry, not unique to Allergan, but across the entire industry, as you would expect it to. So we kind of don't think about price essentially."

We're expecting about $1.4 billion of LOEs. And then the other issues related to the near-term headwinds, I'll try and dimensionalize those a bit for you in terms of how they were incorporated into our planning. So for textured implants, we had said that the international market for textured implants was about $60 million. As we incorporated that into our planning for 2019, we've expanded that a bit to include some knock-on effects in other ex U.S. market. So that's about $100 million relative to what our normalized expectation for 2019 would have been. OZURDEX is about half that. Let's call it about $50 million. And pretty importantly, FX translation will be impacting us relative to 2018. That enumerates to about $150 million.

Is it people that failed or are not eligible for anti-CGRPs? It's just trying to understand if this is some sort of a data fluke or actually there's something you can point to that makes this more sustainable. And second, and it's a second commercial question, is you have multiple questions with very, very high gross to net.

As it relates to BOTOX and neurology, first of all, I think if you look at the IMS data, I think it has a new name now because they were required. There's -- yes, IQVIA. There's nearly 200,000 new patients that have been placed on the CGRPs and mostly Aimovig. At least that's -- you can ask the management teams at Amgen, Teva and Lilly, but that's at least my take on it. And the reason why I think you haven't seen a material impact on BOTOX is fairly straightforward. First of all, half of those 200,000 patients have episodic migraine. And so they're really not in our universe of users. You can see that in the IIQVIA data, too. Next is think about the large off-label market for the prevention of migraine. You have literally over 15 million prescriptions being written between products like Topamax or generic topiramate, TCAs and beta blockers. And so if you look -- although this data is not perfect, if you look at the IMS data, you have roughly 70% of use for CGRPs, it appears to me, coming from new patients, continuing patients and then switches from generic agents like topiramate. And so it's not surprising that you have BOTOX coexisting in the market with the CGRPs. And to be fair, what I think is most reassuring, as we think about BOTOX long term, is that with the number of new patients for the prevention of migraine, the branded prevention of migraine nearly doubling, the CGRPs, to a certain extent, become a gateway to BOTOX. And I suppose the reverse is true. And when you look at the data on BOTOX, the effect of BOTOX on migraine in terms of prevention of migraine days on a monthly basis can't be beat by any of the CGRPs. And it's a -- and the benefit-risk ratio of BOTOX is pretty well characterized. And so like I said, there are 2 tests here, '18 was the first one. And I think the second -- the first half of 2019 is the second one. It's too early to call this, but the business looks very healthy right now."

And so we should keep in mind, while the pharmaceutical industry and the people who follow the industry are excited about a novel new entrant, the clinical implication is just another tool, a good tool but just another tool.

Brazikumab is an IL-23 biologic for IBD, Crohn's and ulcerative colitis. And we're doing head-to-head studies versus Humira and versus Stelara. And so if those studies are positive, it should be a significant contributor in the future. Relamorelin is probably the most potent prokinetic on the market for gastroparesis. And again, that's in Phase III. There's really nothing available for gastroparesis. You could look to Reglan or Propulsid as the last 2 pro-motility agents, both very successful commercially. We have to produce more data. And then of course, we have the CVC program, which we'll report out towards the end of 2009 -- 2019, 2020 -- or excuse me, beyond that. And that's also very interesting.

Look, we -- certainly, with the monoamines modulators, the -- which are effective antidepressants, the ability to distinguish those agents from placebo in clinical trials is a well-known issue with a smaller proportion of well-controlled clinical studies actually demonstrating a significant difference between the active drug and the placebo. Clearly, as we move into the -- into a new mechanism of action, we still anticipate large placebo effects in the trials. Whether or not it's going to be more difficult to distinguish the activity of agents, like Rapastinel, with other mechanisms of action, the monoamines modulation from placebo, time will tell as we roll out the data."

Good morning, and thank you for joining us in our call today. Our first quarter results reflected ongoing strength of our core business across our 4 key therapeutic areas: Medical Aesthetics, Eye Care, CNS and GI. This represented the",940,"Thank you, Manisha. Good morning, and thank you for joining us in our call today. Our first quarter results reflected ongoing strength of our core business across our 4 key therapeutic areas: Medical Aesthetics, Eye Care, CNS and GI. This represented the ninth consecutive quarter of core business growth. The growth prospects of these businesses remain strong, driven by product line depth, new product flow, commercial expertise and a robust pipeline, with 5 potential FDA approvals and new product launches anticipated over the next 18 months. As the management team and board, we are focused on strengthening and growing our business while executing disciplined capital allocation and returning capital to shareholders. At the same time, we are realistic about the challenges and risks facing the business and the work we need to continue to create value for our shareholders, customers, patients and colleagues. We understand that we need to continue to earn their trust for our performance, commercially, operationally and in R&D, and we are committed to acting with urgency to do just that. 
Now let me turn to the quarter's results on Slide 5. We had a good start of the year with continued growth of our core business, which was up 4.4% year-over-year. Against the backdrop of continuing product LOEs, our total revenue was stable, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. We made progress on building several important brands, which we expect will be key drivers of long-term growth. There are many standouts in the first quarter such as BOTOX, JUVÉDERM and VRAYLAR as well as some brands which we are working on further bolstering. We will address these in greater detail. In R&D, we believe we are well positioned with 5 anticipated FDA approvals over the next 18 months or so. They include: Cariprazine for bipolar depression where we expect a regulatory decision later this month; ubrogepant for the acute treatment of migraine, where we expect the regulatory decision in December; CoolTone, a new muscle toning system as part of CoolSculpting family, which we expect to launch towards the end of the year; [indiscernible] ,which is a therapy where we plan to make a regulatory submission in the first half of the year; and Abicipar for wet age-related macular degeneration where we plan to make a regulatory submission also in the first half of this year. 
In the first quarter, we reported top line results from the Phase III Rapastinel program, and we were deeply disappointed that these studies were not successful. Our commitment to bring new medicines to patients in need remains unchanged and our pipeline supports this commitment. Across our 4 key therapeutic areas, we now have 46 programs on the pharmaceutical side and 30 programs on the device side. I am happy to report that we achieved solid results in the first quarter while remaining disciplined and shareholder-friendly in terms of capital allocation. You will hear more about this from Matt. 
Slide 6 provides an overview of the key drivers of our financial results in the first quarter of 2019 and illustrates that our core business, accounting for about 90% of total revenues, reached $3.2 billion. This continued strength of our core business, together with our emerging pipeline, positions us well for 2019 and beyond. 
Slide 7 provides more focused look at our core business, which is comprised of promoted brands and brands with ongoing exclusivity. The first quarter of 2019 is the ninth consecutive quarter where our core business has delivered consistent year-over-year growth. Since 2016, our core business has grown by over $3 billion and currently accounts for 90% of our revenues. In 2017, our core business made up 79% of our revenues; and in 2018, it accounted for 87% of our revenues. Looking ahead, we expect to work our way through the impact of the LOEs and reach a place where our core business generates almost all of our revenues. Before I turn the call over to Bill, I wanted to take a moment to comment on the results of our recent Annual Shareholder Meeting and the extensive discussions we, as a Allergan's leadership team and Board of Directors, have had with our shareholders in the weeks and months leading up to it. 
Let me start by saying that I take seriously the opinion of our shareholders, including David. We have benefited from the candid and constructive shareholder feedback and I shared their desire to create more value at Allergan. Our focus and interest are 100% aligned with those of our shareholders. We have been on this transformation journey for almost 3 years since the sale of our generics business. Since then, we have worked to grow our key products at depth and breadth to our pipeline and build scale to compete in 4 therapeutic areas. I share in the disappointment that the value creation has not materialized again. But when I look at the strength of our core business, the potential of our pipeline and the dedication of our team and board, I have great confidence that it will. So how are we going to do that? First, we will continue to focus on growing our core business and realizing value through the pipeline. That means keeping our teams focused, delivering excellent service to our customers and driving key R&D milestones. The sense of urgency to create value is high and the board is actively and continuously reviewing alternative avenues that could unlock value in the near term. I assure you that the board, management team and I recognize the urgency, and we will take decisive action to drive value-enhancing opportunities. Now let me turn the call over to Bill."

Slide 9 is a product level sales analysis for the first quarter ranked in terms of sales growth versus prior year. We had a strong start to the year, posting double-digit growth rates for several of our major products: BOTOX Cosmetics, VRAY",1658,"Thanks, Brent. Slide 9 is a product level sales analysis for the first quarter ranked in terms of sales growth versus prior year. We had a strong start to the year, posting double-digit growth rates for several of our major products: BOTOX Cosmetics, VRAYLAR, VIIBRYD, ZENPEP, JUVÉDERM, OZURDEX and Lo LOESTRIN were standouts in the quarter. Other key  brands implants, ALLODERM and CoolSculpting were down versus prior year which I'll discuss shortly. Overall, our core business performance was solid, and we anticipate growth strengthening throughout the year. At the bottom of the graph and as expected, total sales growth was impacted by products already facing loss of exclusivity as well as the RESTASIS sales decline ahead of anticipated generic competition. 
Now I'll touch on our key therapeutic areas, starting with our largest Medical Aesthetics. Globally sales for our facial injectable line, BOTOX and JUVÉDERM were up 13% versus prior year. Demand was strong domestically and internationally and demand was broad-based across both the aesthetic dermatology and plastic surgery segments. 
Turning to BOTOX. I'll talk about our results, the outlook for the market and our talks and development programs. U.S. BOTOX sales were up 17% and international up 8%. Sales for BOTOX in the United States were powered by a significantly larger consumer activation program with advertising digital and PR efforts and expanded sales force to reach more practices and achieving the higher levels of customer service and a first quarter promotional offer for top customers. Additionally, we added 0.25 million people to our distinctions loyalty program in the first quarter, which is the best quarter in the history of the program. We've added 1 million in the last 12 months for a total of 6 million members. This is relevant because 67% of our BOTOX consumers are BD members and they their practices 23% more often and spend 36% more per year than nonmembers. It's an important asset for customers and for Allergan. No, for a few comments about the aesthetics market. The prospects for growth here are excellent. There is both a youth movement and a prevention movement underway in Allergan has launched 3 digital ventures in partnership with the aesthetic practices to attract new consumers, including Allergan DataLabs, which is a data science and digital marketing group now fully operational in Irvine. They're launching the largest digital marketing campaign ever for BOTOX on Mother's Day which we expect will attract tens of thousands of new users and loyalty members. 
In terms of competition, it's a reality of a growing market. Aesthetics has never been a 1-product market and never will be, but it is an efficient market, which means in the end, it will likely support 3 products, not 4, 5 or 6. Our strategy, like that of our customers, is to compete on quality, innovation and customer service, not on price. That is the only sustainable strategy in our view. When it comes to neurotoxins, customers and patients are more outcome- and service-sensitive than price-sensitive. We are well positioned to defend this business. 
Finally on the product development front, we're developing 1 of 2 types of product, productivity to help providers to live in bit better aesthetic outcomes or products that attract new consumers. Right now, we're advancing new indications for BOTOX, a new prefilled syringe for BOTOX and 3 completely novel toxins, including a liquid, a rapid-acting short duration and a long-acting, which were in various stages of development. 
Turning to JUVÉDERM. Fillers have been a step change in aesthetics. They have given providers the ability to volumize, lift and shape. JUVÉDERM is the #1 filler in the world. Sales international increased 18% with exceptional performance in Asia-Pacific, Middle East Africa and Europe New product launches including last month in Europe, and new consumer programs are fueling demand around the world. In the U.S., sales were up 6% versus prior year. We expect sales growth for the year to be higher than the first quarter, which was impacted by strong buying in the prior fourth quarter of 2018. For reference, fourth quarter sales in '18 were up 14% last year. 
Turning to Slide 11, CoolSculpting. Our first quarter sales, of course, were below expectations, off 4% versus prior year due to consumer demand and a reduction in system sales in the United States. We have a lot of work to do in this business in the short term, especially in the U.S. which I'll talk about shortly. Long term, the outlook for CoolSculpting is still positive for 2 reasons. First, we're set up to launch 3 new sculpts conferencing in the next 2 to 3 years which will improve outcomes for the procedure and underlying demand. And second, we've only scratched the surface of the body contouring market with an estimated penetration rate of less than 10%. There's still a large untapped pool of consumer to convert and we expect sales for the year to be up 5% to 10% globally despite our first quarter performance. We have several priorities when we acquired CoolSculpting. They will expand the U.S. installed base, which is now 50% larger than it was 2 years ago; reorganized the international business; accelerate development of the new CoolSculpting technologies and drive consumer demand. In roughly 2 years, we've achieved 3 of the 4. Right now, more focus is needed in consumer marketing and activation. We have exceptionally high-awareness levels. We have 7 million consumers visiting our website and installed base totaling 4,000 accounts and 6,000 systems so the foundation here is solid, but our consumer conversion rate is low. We're taking a number of measures to fix that, including Allergan DataLabs is launching a new digital initiative to drive website traffic conversion with the first ever Freecycle promotion. We're also partnering with high-end health clubs around the country and conducting marketing events at luxury malls and wellness centers to move consumers from awareness to usage. We're changing the approach here from a focus on not only practices and systems, but also consumers. Two other important sources future growth in this business in '19 are international and CoolTone. In international, we restructured the business transitioning from a distributor model to a direct promotion model. We're now doing business directly in 69 countries and have 3,000 systems placed around the world. Next, CoolTone will launch in late 2019. This is a muscle toning system that is complementary and will be marketed alongside CoolSculpting. We'll be taking orders for CoolTone by mid-year and shipping equipment in early Q4. Now with any launch, current capital sales, slowest providers, want to see new package offers -- what new package offers might look like. We expect capital sales to rebound upon the launch of CoolTone. 
ALLODERM sales in the first quarter were impacted by supply constraint for donor material. The supply situation is stabilized and is expected to improve throughout the year. Sales growth of this business should trade in the mid-single digits. Sales for our 1 breast implants have been impacted by regulatory changes related to our textured implant internationally. Our 2019 sales outlook anticipated these changes. In the U.S., FDA conducted a public hearing on breast implant safety. David will talk more about that shortly. Note that in the U.S., over 90% of our business is smooth implants. 
Turning to Slide 12 in CNS. Sales for BOTOX were at expectations, up 6% for the first quarter. The year-over-year comparison was impacted by the fact that the first quarter of '19 had 2 fewer selling days in the first quarter of '18. Adjusting for quarterly selling days, BOTOX growth was in the high single digits. In terms of the market, the migraine-prevention market is 10% to 15% larger than it was a year ago. Our share of new chronic migraine patients is 47%, remained stable. We estimate that only 2% of CGRP patients were switched from BOTOX and combination use is limited. As we have said before, we expect the growth rate in 2019 will be in the mid- to high single digits. Sales for VRAYLAR in Q1 '19 total $144 million, up 70%. This product continues to exceed expectations on almost all metrics, including prescribers, prescription levels and formulary coverage rates. The growth catalyst for VRAYLAR in 2019 is the anticipated new indication for bipolar depression, which is currently under review at the FDA. The Target audience detailing levels for VRAYLAR will be almost doubled in May to cover not only psychiatrist but also primary care physicians. 
Turning to Slide 13 on GI. Underlying prescription demand growth for LINZESS in the first quarter was in the double digits. This was offset by a lower average selling price and trade buying patterns, resulting in a net revenue gain of 1% versus prior year. Sales for ZENPEP were strong, up 19%. Turning now to Eye Care. Our glaucoma business was impacted by pricing headwinds in the United States and the impact of trade buying patterns internationally. We expect this franchise to be stable for the year. OZURDEX sales increased 10%. Our supply situation has improved significantly, and we expect all markets to be fully restocked in the second quarter. RESTASIS prescription demand was relatively stable year-over-year. This was offset by a lower average selling price. Sales orders for RESTASIS MBPS have been replaced by the RESTASIS single-unit vial as we worked to a backward situation, which we expect to resolve by the second half. 
Finally, turning to Slide 14 and our international sales totaled $802 million, up 1% versus prior year. Excluding the impact of the trail implants, sales were up 5.2%. The growth drivers were JUVÉDERM, CoolSculpting, BOTOX Cosmetic and BOTOX Therapeutic. The Asia Pacific/Middle East/Africa region continues to be the most important growth driver in our international business. In the quarter, hand sales were further impacted by trade buying patterns for our Eye Care business and lower sales and generic RESTASIS in Canada. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Dave."

We've made significant pipeline progress in the first quarter of the year. Before I talk about progress, I will begin with the readout from our Phase III program of Rapastinel as an adjunctive treatment in major depressive disorder. I was very disappointed by these results. Despite the setback, our commitment to bringing innovative medicines to patients with unmet needs and mental health remains unchanged. We expect to present detailed data from the Rapastinel program with an upcoming medical conference. We still have 2 studies with Rapastinel ongoing: One in suicidality; and the other monotherapy. We will perform an interim analysis of these studies to check the futility, and we will see this data later this year. 
Turning to Slide 16, which highlights the major upcoming catalyst for the year. As you heard from Brent, we expect approval of 5 major programs over the course of the next 18 months. Most near term is the anticipated approval of cariprazine for bipolar depression, where we have an FDA action date later this month. As recently announced, our NDA has been filed for ubrogepant, our oral CGRP inhibitor for the acute treatment of migraine, and we have an action date in December. Also within CNS, we expect to report in the second half of the year, top line results from the ongoing Phase II study of AGN-241751, our oral and NDA modulator. This agent has the same mechanism of action as a Rapastinel. The oral formulation allows us to evaluate the safety and efficacy of more frequent dosing. 
Turning to Eye Care. we recently reported safety data from the MAPLE Study for abicipar in neurovascular age-related macular degeneration. Data from this study showed a decrease in the rates of information compared to the previously reported in the Phase III CEDAR and SEQUOIA studies. We view these decrease in inflammation rates as step in the right direction, and we will continue to work on improving the formulation. We expect to make a regulatory submission in the U.S. in the first half of the year followed by a submission in the EU in the second half of the year. We also expect to make a regulatory submission of Bimatoprost sustained release in the U.S. for the treatment of glaucoma in the first half of 2019. In Medical Aesthetics, we are excited to be launching CoolTone, a muscle toning system utilizing high-frequency electromagnetic stimulation aimed to fast the muscle. In addition, versions 3.0 and 4.0 CoolSculpting are expected within the next 2 to 3 years. 
Slide 17 provides a summary of the key events we anticipate over the next 18 months. We continue to advance the rest of our mid- to late-stage pipeline according to our targets and expectations. 
Turning to Slide 18. Our pharmaceutical pipeline has 46 programs in various stages of development with 2 that are currently under regulatory review and 10 programs in Phase III development. Our development programs continue to remain aligned with our timelines, with the exception of map. This IL 23 monoclonal antibody is being developed in a competitive phase within a large number of competing trials. 
Similarly, as outlined on Slide 19, we continue to develop our device pipeline with 30 programs in development. This will continue to drive innovation within Medical Aesthetics. This is a rich development portfolio, in line with our leadership in this area and the search we have more than doubled our R&D investments in devices in Medical Aesthetics over the last 2 years. In the quarter, the FDA held a 2-day advisory committee to discuss the benefits and risk of breast implants and dermal matrices. The agency recently announced that textured breast implant will remain in the market and are considering actions to be taken to improve product labeling and communication. We're excited about the future of our R&D organization. As always, I thank my colleagues in R&D for their hard work as well as the investigators and particularly the patients who are participating in our clinical trials. And now I will turn the call over to Matt."

As Brent mentioned earlier, our core business continues to be strong, and we're delivering in our key financial commitments to the first quarter of 2019. Starting at the top of the page. Net revenues in the quarter were $3.6 billion, flat year-over-year on a constant currency basis, which means the 2% decline in reported revenues was due solely to foreign exchange translation. The highlight of the quarter was the solid performance of the promoted brands with ongoing exclusivity, which was up 5.3%. This entirely offset the 27% decline in LOEs and divestitures which now includes the generic entry of. Our core business which comprises 90% of total revenues grew 4.4% at constant currency and was actually over 1 percentage point higher at 5.5% excluding the impact of regulatory changes in the international textured implant market. 
A few things to bear in mind as we think about 2019 revenues. First, from a phasing perspective, our first quarter tends to be our seasonally slowest quarter revenue historically; and second, as we stated when we issued 2019 guidance, we expect revenue growth rates to accelerate in the remaining quarters of 2019 as we annualize the back half 2018 issues related to the recall and ALLODERM donor supply. 
Now turning to margins. Non-GAAP gross margin grew 50 basis points to 86.7% primarily driven by favorable product mix. Operating margins, however, declined 270 basis points to 45.2%, which was driven by 2 key factors. First, in sales and marketing, we increased expenditures in our Facial Aesthetics business, and we both set our international footprint internationally especially in Asia Pacific; and second, we increased R&D spending to support ongoing late-stage clinical development programs. 
Now turning to the lower section of the slide. Non-GAAP performance net income per share was $3.79, representing 1% growth year-on-year versus the first quarter of 2018, which reflects the impact of share buybacks during 2018 and the first quarter of this year. 
Slide 22 provides an overview of our P&L line items for the quarter, most of which I've already discussed. I would, however, like to highlight 2 important line items, our net interest expense and our tax rate, both of which are meaningfully favorable to prior year and this was contemplated in our 2019 guidance. Now I'd like to discuss the significant GAAP accounting matter and provide the appropriate context. Each quarter, we monitored goodwill and intangible for indicators of impairment. In the first quarter, we recorded a $2.5 billion goodwill impairment in our General Medicines Reporting Unit primarily related to the failure of Rapastinel in Phase III clinical trials and, to a lesser extent, timing true-ups of our other R&D programs. Bear in mind that this goodwill impairment in our gen med reporting unit is not related to the acquisition price of as this was 100% expensed as IT R&D at the time of the acquisition in 2015. But rather, this impairment is a consequence of the removal of future anticipated cash flows related to Rapastinel and the timing true-ups of other programs from our long-term financial projections. This, in turn, lowers the fair value of the gen med reporting unit as of March 31 below book value. While a strong performance we've seen across other parts of Allergan support increased fair values, those increases are in other reporting units which under GAAP did not impact the goodwill impairment test of the gen med business. 
Turning to Slide 23 now and returning to the quarter's results. Here is an overview of our financial results by reporting segment. U.S. Specialized Therapeutics experienced a decline of 2.3% in revenues which was driven by lower RESTASIS sales as well as the sale of our med derm business in 2018. Contribution margin was down 290 basis points driven by the revenue decline, coupled with the increase in promotional spending and our Facial Aesthetics business. Looking at U.S. General Medicine. The segment grew 2.1% year-over-year. This was driven by double-digit growth across key brands including VRAYLAR, VIIBRYD, Lo LOESTRIN and ZENPEP. This growth was offset by the continued impact of products facing LOEs, which in this quarter also includes a generic entry of word. Contribution margin increased 90 basis points due to higher revenues and the benefit from lower promotional selling expenses resulting from the restructuring initiatives. And lastly, on international revenues. These grew 1% on a constant currency basis and was significantly impacted by foreign exchange translation. On a constant currency basis and excluding the impact of the regulatory changes in the textured implant market, international revenues increased 5.2% year-over-year. Contribution margin declined 40 basis points due in part to the textured implant issue as well as increased investment in the high-growth regions especially Asia Pacific. 
Now turning to Slide 24. You can see our operating cash flow in the first quarter was strong at $1.2 billion, and this supports our 2019 guidance of $5 billion to $5.5 billion. Our priorities on capital allocation remain unchanged. First, reinvestment in our business for growth in our 4 key therapeutics areas. During the quarter, we acquired Medical, which increases the breadth of our Medical Aesthetics offerings to now include skin resurfacing and dermal infusion. Second, debt reduction, which is important in the context of the anticipated RESTASIS LOE; third, funding and prudently growing our dividend; and fourth, share buybacks as a means to manage earnings dilution that would result from asset sales or from long-term equity-based incentive plans. And as you can see on our capitalization table, we continue to work towards our capital allocation goals. We ended the quarter with $23.5 billion in total debt and $1.8 billion in cash and equivalents, which brings our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio to 2.8x as of March 31. Coming up in the second quarter. We have a schedule debt maturity of approximately $800 million, and we intend to retire using cash on hand and operating cash flow. We remain committed and on track to achieve our target net leverage ratio of 2.5x by the end of 2020 which would, of course, enable us to sustain our commitment to an investment-grade credit rating. With regard to share buybacks, we said on the last call that as part of our 2019 guidance, we intended to repurchase $800 million of shares during the year. We accomplished this entire amount in the first quarter, which completely utilizes the 2018 $2 billion share repurchase authorization. We have the 2019 $2 billion share authorization available to us. However, it's important to note that our revised guidance contemplates no further share repurchases during 2019. As previously mentioned, this assumption may change depending upon the progression of asset sales. 
Moving now to guidance on Page 25. We're revising guidance upward for 2019. So starting with net revenues, we're raising our full year outlook and now expect 2019 net revenues to be between $15.1 billion and $15.4 billion, $100 million higher on the low and high end from the previously provided guidance of $15 billion to $15.3 billion. We now assume a mid-May LOE for RESTASIS and the increase in revenue guidance is driven by the additional RESTASIS exclusivity. Our updated revenue guidance continues to contemplate strength in the core business, which is expected to grow at a rate similar to last year, in the mid- to high single-digit range. Additionally, we continue to incorporate headwinds previously discussed related to as textured implant, industry-wide pricing pressure and foreign exchange translation, we believe our revised guidance is appropriately conservative across all these points. We continue to expect non-GAAP gross margins for the full year to be 85% to 85.5% based on our product mix and LOE assumptions, including the impact of generic RESTASIS. Our non-GAAP SG&A and R&D expense remains unchanged as we continue to invest in growth drivers for our key businesses and in advancing our clinical programs in development. Should there be a sustained benefit of incremental RESTASIS revenues versus our expectations, we would look at opportunities to reinvest a portion of these proceeds back into the business, and this would be similar to what we executed in 2018. Besides revenue, the only other guidance item that's changing is performance net income per share, which we're increasing from greater than or equal to $16.36 to greater than $16.55. As with revenue, this increase reflects the assumption of additional RESTASIS exclusivity to mid-May. On top of solid core business performance, which is soundly in line with our expectations at this point. Now for reference, each additional month of RESTASIS exclusivity is estimated to add an incremental $60 million to $70 million in sales. Also, please note that our guidance does not include the impact of any significant asset divestitures. If or when we complete these, we will provide an update on the impact to our key financial metrics, including to non-GAAP performance and net income per share. Until such time as there is a generic RESTASIS, we expect to provide quarterly financial guidance, both top and bottom line. With our seasonally slowest quarter of the year in Q1 now behind us, we are forecasting sequentially stronger top line performance for the remainder of the year. For the second quarter of 2019, we expect total reported net revenue between $3.85 billion and $4 billion and a non-GAAP performance net income per share between $4.20 and $4.40. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Brent."

In terms of the shareholder engagement, both the management team and our board did, which was significant over the last few months. I think there is a common theme from our shareholders, which is a frustration in the performance of the stock price. Let me be clear. I share that frustration. I understand that frustration. I made very large shareholder relative to my own personal holdings in Allergan and most of the management team is likewise, situated. And so that is something that was loud and clear, and we need to make sure that we do everything we can to unlock value and create a better shareholder return for our shareholders over the long term. And so that is clearly, I think the top issue we've heard, and we heard loud and clear, and our board heard it loud and clear. And I think that was a very constructive and positive experience for our board members to hear from probably close to 50 different shareholders that they engaged with. So I think that's pretty straightforward. I think in terms of prompting us to do something different, the way I would come at it, I'd say it's multifactorial. We have a very experienced and engaged board. We also have a refreshed board with several new members with lots of different experiences in this industry and in other businesses. And I would say that given the frustration on shareholder return, given the strength of the core business, given the pipeline that we have and then put that in the context of the operating environment, the political environment, the regulatory environment, the global environment, we continue to look at what are the ways that we can unlock value. And I would say that's something that we do regularly and continuously. And now I would say with a sense of urgency and so the board is on it, the board is engaged and stay tuned."

So regarding Rapastinel and 241751, I can make a few comments about breast implants and perhaps Bill, from a commercial perspective, will talk about that mainly. So look, the -- with Rapastinel, we have the positive Phase II study and then we performed the Phase III programs in adjunctive MDD using once-a-week dosing. And we know that with ketamine, another MDA receptor modulator, that such a regimen can be effective in depression. Now clearly, when we look at animal models of the depression or psychiatric disorders, Rapastinel and 751 are incredibly effective in those models. Having said that, some very recent data has shown that more frequent dosing -- or the more frequent the dosing in those animal models, the greater the efficacy. And that holds true both the Rapastinel and for AGN-241751. But clearly, I don't know the answer yet, but with 241751, because it's an oral compound, we can test and are testing more frequent dosing. So by analogy, with the animal data, that may give us a greater chance of showing efficacy with this mechanism of action, because 751 has the same mechanism as Rapastinel. And we plan to have data with 751 by the end of 2019. Yes, regarding breast implants, I was present at the advisory -- the 2-day advisory committee that the FDA held recently. And recently, the FDA told us that based on that advisory committee and their other analyses, that the textured breast implants which was the main topic of discussion there will remain on the market, although they are going to discuss labeling and enhancing communication with the various manufacturers. Of course, majority of implants that are used in the U.S. are in fact smooth implants. There will be a discussion with the FDA about derma matrices but that's different topic. Of course, conversations around the world are taking place with various regulatory authorities about textured implants and perhaps Bill could pick it up from here."

For the purposes of projections, the international business is been appropriately adjusted for our 2019 outlook and beyond. And as it relates to sales in the United States, even the context of the actions FDA is contemplating, I expect that to be a stable business.

So maybe let me answer the second part and Bill can talk about CoolSculpting. So you look, you're exactly right, Chris. I do get the question quite a bit around split and in fact, I think I very publicly and very clearly addressed that as a Leerink conference a couple months ago. Let me just let it reiterate what I just said there, which still holds true is I've always remained open-minded and the board remains open-minded to that idea if we believe it's something that creates long-term value. There are a number of factors that go into looking at that. One, you just said, which is the sustained valuation discount is something that's clearly important. We also tend to look at some of the other important issues which I mentioned at Leerink and at many other times like scale particularly outside the U.S., and that's something that's improving as that business grows. We clearly need to protect BOTOX as a brand, which is both an aesthetic and therapeutic product and one of the most important brands in the Allergan family, so that's something that we would have to clearly be thoughtful and meticulous in terms of how we thought about that. And then scale of R&D as the science of Medical Aesthetics is clearly moving in the direction of biopharmaceutical R&D versus just medical device R&D. And so those are just a few of the things that we tend to look at outside of financial complexities and other things like that. But look, everything is on the table. I said everything was on the table, our board will regularly and actively evaluate these types of decisions. And I think I also made clear in my answer to Ken, we're going to do that with a sense of urgency. So stay tuned, and we'll see where we go."

First, this is getting a lot of attention right now as you can imagine. I'll tell you that the problem we're pacing is not due to market saturation, it's not due to customer satisfaction, and it's not due to competition, right? I think it's important to recognize. We are managing, I think, 2 issues in addition to my earlier remarks. The first one is when we acquired ZELTIQ, we knew that we had what I would describe as an innovation or a new product cycle gap when we guide into this '18 to '19 period. In other words, if you go back between 2013 and 2017 over a 5-year period, there were 6 different applicators launched for CoolSculpting and each applicator opened up a different area of the body and sustained a pretty robust growth rate over that period. It's been fairly quiet for the past 18 to 24 months and I think we've fixed that right now. We're going to launch CoolTone at the end of '19, and then we're set up for 2 additional system upgrades over the next 2 to 3 years. Think iPhone 8, 9 and 10. The second issue is that after several years in the market, we're dealing, to be fair, with a different type of consumer. We've essentially got to all of the early adopters and now we're working on the group of late adopters, and there -- they have more questions and they're somewhat more cautious. And so we've really shifted our focus from, as I mentioned, practices and system placements to a more consumer model. I think the outlook for the business is still very positive. You have to recognize that CoolSculpting has a long runway. And if we're successful with CoolTone, next-generation CoolSculpting and then with our skin-tightening technology over the next, let's call it, 2 to 3 years, and we're successful both domestically and internationally, this business should reach our initial expectations or come very close."

It's important for us and I think just -- Bill just kind of explained it in the context of CoolSculpting to have continues innovation to drive growth. That holds true across the entire portfolio. When we look at the therapeutics side of our business, which is important, clearly, we're focused on 4 therapeutic approvals and launches over the next 18 months that are really important for us, whether that be a bipolar depression for VRAYLAR, ubrogepant, abicipar, Bimatoprost SR. But as David mentioned, we also have 10 Phase III programs, continuing to advance whether that be and or brazikumab or variety of other things that are listed in chart and the presentation. I think when we walk in the earlier pipeline, we absolutely need to continue to look to enhance and increase our opportunities to bring real innovation to patients. Some of that will come through some of the collaborations we've already established. So for example, we have an IND that was accepted or approved related to our partnership with for liver disease and what we expect to enroll patients later this year. Our first IND with the microbiome, our assembly was also approved, and we'll start to enroll patients as well, but we are enrolling patients already in that one. And we have a variety of other partnerships like that as well that will continue for our development candidates. So there are a lot of activity and we constantly look for new science and new partnerships and new collaborations. And in fact, for the second part of your question, upgrading skills is a continuous process. We are always looking to enhance our capabilities in R&D and in science. And in fact, we announced last quarter or right around the JPMorgan conference, I believe, that we were opening up our office in Boston and moving our head of external science and innovation to Boston and building out and hiring and recruiting in the Kendall Square area, new science and scientists and capabilities, and so that is actively underway, and we believe that's the right place to have an additional office for R&D organization. And we are in Southern California, we're in South San Francisco, we're in New Jersey, we're in the U.K. and we're in Boston as well as a few other places. And so I think that we've got a good spread, and we're committed to recruiting the best scientists and the best minds that we can to supplement our thinking. You want to talk, Bill?"

It lessens the perceived value for product, it cuts in the profits, cuts in the customer service, cuts in the R&D. The way we think about is the value of our products and services right now exceeded the prices that we charge. And if we don't believe that at some point in the future, we'd make an adjustment.

And Rapastinel was frankly not a big part of that guidance, it was further out. So it really doesn't our thinking there. ESMYA did, and we've already incorporated that into our thinking but we've seen improvements in other parts of the pipeline, right? So they're all risk-adjusted when we made the comment. We know that the profile of OZURDEX looks very positive and the risk-benefit there looks very positive. Obviously, we need an FDA approval but that looks good. had surprisingly positive results as well and that is being filed in the first half of this year. Abicipar is the only true 12-week anti-VEGF. While we're improving the inflammation, we still believe that could be a very nice product in the forecast, and so that's moving forward. International growth continues to look solid and will be a big contributor. And so bear in mind our outlook was adjusted for some of the asset sales, and so we continue to exceed expectations in the delivery of our quarters. And that I think all of those reasons combined both positive and negative give us reason to be confident."

Bill, CoolSculpting, I understand, the argument you're making around what we're not going to push product. There's a question is, is this part of delivering the expected results from patients who are already using it? And I was wondering if you might have some data about attrition rates and especially in comparison to attrition rates on fillers or on BOTOX. That is, are we seeing kind of the same repeat use rates from even the early adopters of CoolSculpting as we see from the most established BOTOX where benefit is established? And second, back to the General Medicine's business, it seems that the pricing you're obtaining, just looking year-over-year for the Eye Care product for the IVD products, are a little bit lower than they were in 1Q '18. And just talking to the peers, it seems there is more of an effort to go ahead press down some of those older category for discounts. So when we think about kind of like the pricing you obtained from those areas of older products going forward, should we assume kind of a small negative number in terms of pricing year-over-year? Or should we still expect likely to slightly up?"

As it relates to CoolSculpting, I think consumer satisfaction with the procedure is high, a couple points about that. If you take a look at RealSelf, and you take a look at the work rating for CoolSculpting, it's roughly 78%. Now that rate is a little bit lower than a facial injectable but that's not surprising for a body contouring procedure. Satisfaction levels will trade lower if a patient does not receive an adequate number of treatment cycles. Right now, that number's is at roughly 5. Ideally, if you talk to most plastic surgeons, it should be 6 to 8. And so with adequate treatments in a given area of the body, the satisfaction for CoolSculpting is right where it has been and where we expected to be. As it relates to repeat visits, this is -- there isn't a reoccurring revenue stream. In other words, when someone receives their 6 to 8 cycles for a given problem area, then it's in many respects a permanent solution. And so I think that deals with the CoolSculpting question. I would also say that when you take a look at CoolTone and the next-generation CoolSculpting system as well as this skin-tightening solution, each one of those should enable plastic surgeons and derms and other providers to improve outcomes for patients. As it relates to General Medicine business, I think you have it right. I think about price, whether it be for LINZESS or for RESTASIS or for our U.S. glaucoma business as being neutral and there could be some downward pressure on it. I think that's the reality of the health care system right now. I think the positive in all this for us is prescription demand for these businesses obviously, LINZESS is very solid and the product's on the market for 7 years now and prescriptions were up 10% and units were up 14%. As it relates to the more established businesses like RESTASIS or glaucoma, demand is relatively stable. And you'll see a little bit more price pressure read through the sales line on those businesses. But I think your outlook is right."

I mentioned in my remarks, brilliant distinction is a real asset for us. I would describe it as a moat around BOTOX. We added 250,000 members in 1 quarter, which is the best quarter we've had in the history of the program. The digital venture spotlight, which is an online destination for all things beauty, we had 1.5 million visitors to it in the first year. That number will approach 2 million very, very shortly. We're running a Mother's Day promotion which I mentioned and there was a sign-up opportunity for a sweepstakes and we'll get into details, but we have roughly 50,000 women signed up in roughly a week.

Good morning and thank you for joining us on our call today. 
Our first quarter results reflected ongoing strength of our core business across our 4 key therapeutic areas: Medical Aesthetics, Eye Care, CNS and GI. This represented the ninth consecutive quarter of core business growth. The growth prospects of these businesses remain strong driven by product line depth, new product flow, commercial expertise and a robust pipeline with 5 potential FDA approvals and new product launches anticipated over the next 18 months. As the management team and Board, we are focused on strengthening and growing our business while executing disciplined capital allocation and returning capital to shareholders. At the same time, we are realistic about the challenges and risks facing the business and the work we need to continue to create value for our shareholders, customers, patients and colleagues. We understand that we need to continue to earn their trust for our performance commercially, operationally and in R&D. And we are committed to acting with urgency to do just that. 
Now let me turn to the quarter's results on Slide 5. We had a good start of the year with continued growth of our core business, which was up 4.4% year-over-year. Against the backdrop of continuing product LOEs, our total revenue was stable, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. We made progress on building several important brands, which we expect will be key drivers of long-term growth. There are many standouts in the first quarter such as BOTOX, JUVÉDERM and VRAYLAR as well as some brands, which we are working on further bolstering. Bill will address these in greater detail. In R&D, we believe we are well positioned with 5 anticipated FDA approvals over the next 18 months or so. They include: cariprazine for bipolar depression where we expect a regulatory decision later this month; ubrogepant for the acute treatment of migraine where we expect the regulatory decision in December; CoolTone, a new muscle-toning system as part of CoolSculpting family, which we expect to launch towards the end of the year; Bimatoprost SR, which is a drop-free glaucoma therapy where we plan to make a regulatory submission in the first half of the year; and abicipar for wet age-related macular degeneration where we plan to make a regulatory submission also in the first half of this year. 
In the first quarter, we reported top line results from the Phase III Rapastinel program, and we were deeply disappointed that these studies were not successful. Our commitment to bring new medicines to patients in need remains unchanged, and our pipeline supports this commitment. Across our 4 key therapeutic areas, we now have 46 programs on the pharmaceutical side and 30 programs on the device side. I am happy to report that we achieved solid results in the first quarter while remaining disciplined and shareholder-friendly in terms of capital allocation. You will hear more about this from Matt. 
Slide 6 provides an overview of the key drivers of our financial results in the first quarter of 2019 and illustrates that our core business, accounting for about 90% of total revenues, reached $3.2 billion. This continued strength of our core business, together with our emerging pipeline, positions us well for 2019 and beyond. 
Slide 7 provides more focused look at our core business, which is comprised of promoted brands and brands with ongoing exclusivity. The first quarter of 2019 is the ninth consecutive quarter where our core business has delivered consistent year-over-year growth. Since 2016, our core business has grown by over $3 billion and currently accounts for 90% of our revenues. In 2017, our core business made up 79% of our revenues. And in 2018, it accounted for 87% of our revenues. 
Looking ahead, we expect to work our way through the impact of the LOEs and reach a place where our core business generates almost all of our revenues. Before I turn the call over to Bill, I wanted to take a moment to comment on the results of our recent Annual Shareholder Meeting and the extensive discussions we, as Allergan's leadership team and Board of Directors, have had with our shareholders in the weeks and months leading up to it. 
Let me start by saying that I take seriously the opinion of our shareholders, including David Tepper. We have benefited from the candid and constructive shareholder feedback, and I shared their desire to create more value at Allergan. Our focus and interests are 100% aligned with those of our shareholders. We have been on this transformation journey for almost 3 years since the sale of our Generics business. Since then, we have worked to grow our key products at depth and breadth to our pipeline and build scale to compete in 4 therapeutic areas. I share in the disappointment that the value creation has not materialized yet. But when I look at the strength of our core business, the potential of our pipeline and the dedication of our team and Board, I have great confidence that it will. 
So how are we going to do that? First, we will continue to focus on growing our core business and realizing value through the pipeline. That means keeping our teams focused, delivering excellent service to our customers and driving key R&D milestones. The sense of urgency to create value is high, and the Board is actively and continuously reviewing alternative avenues that could unlock value in the nearer term. I assure you that the Board, management team and I recognize the urgency, and we will take decisive action to drive value-enhancing opportunities. 
Now let me turn the call over to Bill."

Slide 9 is a product-level sales analysis for the first quarter ranked in terms of sales growth versus prior year. We had a strong start to the year posting double-digit growth rates for several of our major products. BOTOX Cosmetic, VRAY",1672,"Thanks, Brent. 
Slide 9 is a product-level sales analysis for the first quarter ranked in terms of sales growth versus prior year. We had a strong start to the year posting double-digit growth rates for several of our major products. BOTOX Cosmetic, VRAYLAR, VIIBRYD, ZENPEP, JUVÉDERM, OZURDEX and Lo LOESTRIN were standouts in the quarter. Other key brands, Natrelle implants, ALLODERM and CoolSculpting, were down versus prior year, which I'll discuss shortly. 
Overall, our core business performance was solid, and we anticipate growth strengthening throughout the year. At the bottom of the graph and as expected, total sales growth was impacted by products already facing loss of exclusivity as well as the RESTASIS sales decline ahead of anticipated generic competition. 
Now I'll touch on our key therapeutic areas starting with our largest, Medical Aesthetics. Globally, sales for our facial injectable line, BOTOX and JUVÉDERM, were up 13% versus prior year. Demand was strong domestically and internationally, and demand was broad-based across both the aesthetic dermatology and plastic surgery segments. 
Turning to BOTOX. I'll talk about our results, the outlook for the market and our toxin development programs. U.S. BOTOX sales were up 17% and international up 8%. Sales for BOTOX in the United States were powered by a significantly larger consumer activation program with advertising, digital and PR efforts and expanded sales force to reach more practices and achieving higher levels of customer service and a first quarter promotional offer for top customers. 
Additionally, we added 0.25 million people to our Brilliant Distinctions loyalty program in the first quarter, which is the best quarter in the history of the program. We've added 1 million in the last 12 months for a total of 6 million members. This is relevant because 67% of our BOTOX consumers are BD members, and they visit their practices 23% more often and spend 36% more per year than nonmembers. It's an important asset for customers and for Allergan. 
Now for a few comments about the aesthetics market. The prospects for growth here are excellent. There is both a youth movement and a prevention movement underway, and Allergan has launched 3 digital ventures in partnership with aesthetic practices to attract new consumers, including Allergan Data Labs, which is a data science and digital marketing group now fully operational in Irvine. They're launching the largest digital marketing campaign ever for BOTOX on Mother's Day, which we expect will attract tens of thousands of new users and loyalty members. 
In terms of competition, it's the reality of a growing market. Aesthetics has never been a 1-product market and never will be, but it is an efficient market, which means in the end, it will likely support 3 products, not 4, 5 or 6. Our strategy, like that of our customers, is to compete on quality, innovation and customer service, not on price. That is the only sustainable strategy in our view. When it comes to neurotoxins, customers and patients are more outcome- and service-sensitive than price-sensitive. We are well positioned to defend this business. 
Finally, on the product development front, we're developing 1 of 2 types of products, products that either help providers deliver even better aesthetic outcomes or products that attract new consumers. Right now, we're advancing new indications for BOTOX, masseter and platysma, a new prefilled syringe for BOTOX and 3 completely novel toxins, including a liquid, a rapid-acting short duration and a long-acting, which were in various stages of development. 
Turning to JUVÉDERM. Fillers have been a step change in aesthetics. They have given providers the ability to volumize, lift and shape. JUVÉDERM is the #1 filler in the world. Sales international increased 18% with exceptional performance in Asia Pacific, Middle East, Africa and Europe. New product launches, including VOLUX, last month in Europe. And new consumer programs are fueling demand around the world. 
In the U.S., sales were up 6% versus prior year. We expect sales growth for the year to be higher than the first quarter, which was impacted by strong buying in the prior fourth quarter of 2018. For reference, fourth quarter sales in '18 were up 14% last year. 
Turning to Slide 11, CoolSculpting. Our first quarter sales, of course, were below expectations, off 4% versus prior year, due to consumer demand and a reduction in system sales in the United States. We have a lot of work to do in this business in the short term, especially in the U.S., which I'll talk about shortly. Long term, the outlook for CoolSculpting is still positive for 2 reasons. First, we're set up to launch 3 new CoolSculpting systems in the next 2 to 3 years, which will improve outcomes for the procedure and underlying demand. And second, we've only scratched the surface of the body contouring market with an estimated penetration rate of less than 10%. There's still a large untapped pool of consumer to reach and convert, and we expect sales for the year to be up 5% to 10% globally despite our first quarter performance. 
We have several priorities when we acquired CoolSculpting. They were: expand the U.S. installed base, which is now 50% larger than it was 2 years ago; reorganize the international business; accelerate the development of new CoolSculpting technologies and drive consumer demand. In roughly 2 years, we've achieved 3 of the 4. Right now, more focus is needed on consumer marketing and activation. We have exceptionally high-awareness levels. We have 7 million consumers visiting our website and installed base totaling 4,000 accounts and 6,000 systems. So the foundation here is solid, but our consumer conversion rate is low. We're taking a number of measures to fix that, including Allergan Data Labs is launching a new digital initiative to drive website traffic conversion with the first-ever freecycle promotion. We're also partnering with high-end health clubs around the country and conducting marketing events at luxury malls and wellness centers to move consumers from awareness to usage. We're changing the approach here from a focus on not only practices and systems, but also consumers. Two other important sources of future growth for this business in '19 are International and CoolTone. In International, we've restructured the business transitioning from a distributor model to a direct promotion model. We're now doing business directly in 69 countries and have 3,000 systems placed around the world. Next, CoolTone will launch in late 2019. This is a muscle-toning system that is complementary and will be marketed alongside CoolSculpting. We'll be taking orders for CoolTone by midyear and shipping equipment in early Q4. Now with any launch, current capital sales as well as providers want to see new package offers -- what new package offers might look like. We expect capital sales to rebound upon the launch of CoolTone. 
ALLODERM sales in the first quarter were impacted by a supply constraint for donor material. The supply situation has stabilized and is expected to improve throughout the year. Sales growth of this business should trade in the mid-single digits. Sales for our Natrelle breast implants have been impacted by regulatory changes related to our textured implants internationally. Our 2019 sales outlook anticipated these changes. In the U.S., FDA conducted a public hearing on breast implant safety. David will talk more about that shortly. Note that in the U.S., over 90% of our business is smooth implants.
Turning to Slide 12 and CNS. Sales for BOTOX were at expectations, up 6% for the first quarter. The year-over-year comparison was impacted by the fact that the first quarter of '19 had 2 fewer selling days than the first quarter of '18. Adjusting for quarterly selling days, BOTOX growth was in the high single digits. In terms of the market, the migraine prevention market is 10% to 15% larger than it was a year ago. Our share of new chronic migraine patients is 47%, remained stable. We estimate that only 2% of CGRP patients were switched from BOTOX and combination use is limited. As we have said before, we expect the growth rate in 2019 will be in the mid- to high single digits. 
Sales for VRAYLAR in Q1 '19 totaled $144 million, up 70%. This product continues to exceed expectations on almost all metrics, including prescribers, prescription levels and formulary coverage rates. The growth catalyst for VRAYLAR in 2019 is the anticipated new indication for bipolar depression, which is currently under review at the FDA. Target audience at detailing levels for VRAYLAR will be almost doubled in May to cover not only psychiatrists but also primary care physicians. 
Turning to Slide 13 on GI. Underlying prescription demand growth for LINZESS in the first quarter was in the double digits. This was offset by a lower average selling price and trade buying patterns resulting in a net revenue gain of 1% versus prior year. Sales for ZENPEP were strong, up 19%. 
Turning now to Eye Care. Our glaucoma business was impacted by pricing headwinds in the United States and the impact of trade buying patterns internationally. We expect this franchise to be stable for the year. OZURDEX sales increased 10%. Our supply situation has improved significantly, and we expect all markets to be fully restocked in the second quarter. RESTASIS prescription ban -- demand was relatively stable year-over-year. This was offset by a lower average selling price. Sales orders for RESTASIS MDPF have been replaced by the RESTASIS single-unit vial as we worked through a backorder situation, which we expect to resolve by the second half. 
Finally, turning to Slide 14. Our International sales totaled $802 million, up 1% versus prior year. Excluding the impact of Natrelle implants, sales were up 5.2%. The growth drivers were JUVÉDERM, CoolSculpting, BOTOX Cosmetic and BOTOX Therapeutic. The Asia Pacific/Middle East/Africa region continues to be the most important growth driver in our International business. In the quarter, [ lock hand ] sales were further impacted by trade buying patterns for our Eye Care business and lower Presbysol sales and generic RESTASIS in Canada. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to David."

We made significant pipeline progress in the first quarter of the year. Before I talk about progress, I will begin with the readout from our Phase III program, Rapastinel, as an adjunctive treatment in major depressive disorder. I was very disappointed by these results. Despite the setback, our commitment to bringing innovative medicines to patients with unmet needs in mental health remains unchanged. We expect to present detailed data from the Rapastinel program at an upcoming medical conference. We still have 2 studies with Rapastinel ongoing, one in suicidality and the other in monotherapy. We will perform an interim analysis of these studies to check for futility, and we will see these data later this year. 
Turning to Slide 16, which highlights the major upcoming catalysts for the year. As you heard from Brent, we expect approval of 5 major programs over the course of the next 18 months. Most near term is the anticipated approval of cariprazine for bipolar depression where we have an FDA action date later this month. As recently announced, our NDA has been filed for ubrogepant, our oral CGRP inhibitor for the acute treatment of migraine, and we have an action date in December. Also within CNS, we expect to report in the second half of the year top line results from the ongoing Phase II study of AGN-241751, our oral NMDA modulator. This agent has the same mechanism of action as Rapastinel. The oral formulation allows us to evaluate the safety and efficacy of more frequent dosing. 
Turning to Eye Care. we recently reported safety data from the MAPLE Study for abicipar in neurovascular age-related macular degeneration. Data from this study showed a decrease in the rates of inflammation compared to the previously reported in the Phase III CEDAR and SEQUOIA studies. We view this decrease in inflammation rates as step in the right direction, and we will continue to work on improving the formulation. We expect to make a regulatory submission in the U.S. in the first half of the year, followed by a submission in the EU in the second half of the year. We also expect to make a regulatory submission of Bimatoprost sustained release in the U.S. for the treatment of glaucoma in the first half of 2019. In Medical Aesthetics, we are excited to be launching CoolTone, a muscle-toning system utilizing high-frequency electromagnetic stimulation aimed fast to its [ glita ] muscle. In addition, versions 3.0 and 4.0 of CoolSculpting are expected within the next 2 to 3 years. 
Slide 17 provides a summary of the key events we anticipate over the next 18 months. We continue to advance the rest of our mid- to late-stage pipeline according to our targets and expectations. 
Turning to Slide 18. Our pharmaceutical pipeline has 46 programs in various stages of development with 2 that are currently under regulatory review and 10 programs in Phase III development. Our development programs continue to remain aligned with our time lines with the exception of brazikumab. This IL-23 monoclonal antibody is being developed in a competitive space with a large number of competing trials. 
Similarly, as outlined on Slide 19, we continue to develop our device pipeline with 30 programs in development. This will continue to drive innovation within Medical Aesthetics. This is a rich development portfolio in line with our leadership in this area. And as such, we have more than doubled our R&D investments in devices in Medical Aesthetics over the last 2 years. In the quarter, the FDA held a 2-day advisory committee to discuss the benefits and risks of breast implants and dermal matrices. The agency recently announced that textured breast implants will remain on the market and are considering actions to be taken to improve product labeling and communication. We're excited about the future of our R&D organization. As always, I thank my colleagues in R&D for their hard work as well as the investigators and particularly, the patients who are participating in our clinical trials. 
And now I will turn the call over to Matt."
36478,609716141,1723261,"Allergan plc, Q1 2019 Earnings Call, May 07, 2019",2019-05-07,"Earnings Calls","Allergan plc","Executives","Thank you, David. Looking now at the key financial highlights on Page 21. As Brent mentioned earlier, our core business continues to be strong, and we're delivering on our key financial commitments through the first quarter of 2019. So starting at the t",1577,"Thank you, David. 
Looking now at the key financial highlights on Page 21. As Brent mentioned earlier, our core business continues to be strong, and we're delivering on our key financial commitments through the first quarter of 2019. So starting at the top of the page, net revenues in the quarter were $3.6 billion, flat year-over-year on a constant currency basis, which means the 2% decline in reported revenues was due solely to foreign exchange translation. The highlight of the quarter was the solid performance of the promoted brands with ongoing exclusivity, which was up 5.3%. This entirely offset the 27% decline in LOEs and divestitures, which now includes the generic entry of Canasa. Our core business, which comprises 90% of total revenues, grew 4.4% at constant currency and was actually over 1 percentage point higher at 5.5%, excluding the impact of regulatory changes in the international textured implant market. 
A few things to bear in mind as we think about 2019 revenues. First, from a phasing perspective, our first quarter tends to be our seasonally slowest quarter revenue-wise historically. And second, as we stated when we issued 2019 guidance, we expect revenue growth rates to accelerate in the remaining quarters of 2019 as we annualize the back half 2018 issues related to the OZURDEX recall and ALLODERM donor supply. 
Now turning to margins. Non-GAAP gross margin grew 50 basis points to 86.7% primarily driven by favorable product mix. Operating margins, however, declined 270 basis points to 45.2%, which was driven by 2 key factors. First, in sales and marketing, we increased expenditures in our Facial Aesthetics business, and we bolstered our commercial footprint internationally, especially in Asia Pacific. And second, we increased R&D spending to support ongoing late-stage clinical development programs. 
Now turning to the lower section of the slide. Non-GAAP performance net income per share was $3.79, representing 1% growth year-on-year versus the first quarter of 2018, which reflects the impact of share buybacks during 2018 and the first quarter of this year. 
Slide 22 provides an overview of our P&L line items for the quarter, most of which I've already discussed. I would, however, like to highlight 2 important line items, our net interest expense and our tax rate, both of which are meaningfully favorable to prior year, and this was contemplated in our 2019 guidance. 
Now I'd like to discuss the significant GAAP accounting matter and provide the appropriate context. Each quarter, we monitor goodwill and intangibles for indicators of impairment. In the first quarter, we recorded a $2.5 billion goodwill impairment in our General Medicines Reporting Unit primarily related to the failure of Rapastinel in Phase III clinical trials and, to a lesser extent, timing true-ups of other R&D programs. Bear in mind that this goodwill impairment in our Gen Med reporting unit is not related to the acquisition price of Naurex as this was 100% expensed as IT R&D at the time of the acquisition in 2015. So rather, this impairment is a consequence of the removal of future anticipated cash flows related to Rapastinel and the timing true-ups of other programs from our long-term financial projections. This, in turn, lowered the fair value of the Gen Med reporting unit as of March 31 below book value. While the strong performance we've seen across other parts of Allergan support increased fair values, those increases are in other reporting units, which under GAAP did not impact the goodwill impairment test of the Gen Med business. 
Turning to Slide 23 now and returning to the quarter's results. Here, we see an overview of our financial results by reporting segment. U.S. Specialized Therapeutics experienced a decline of 2.3% in revenues, which was driven by lower RESTASIS sales as well as the sale of our Med Derm business in 2018. Contribution margin was down 290 basis points driven by the revenue decline coupled with the increase in promotional spending in our Facial Aesthetics business. 
Looking at U.S. General Medicine. The segment grew 2.1% year-over-year. This was driven by double-digit growth across key brands, including VRAYLAR, VIIBRYD, Lo LOESTRIN and ZENPEP. This growth was offset by the continued impact of products facing LOEs, which, in this quarter, also includes the generic entry of Canasa. Contribution margin increased 90 basis points due to higher revenues and the benefit from lower promotional selling expenses resulting from the restructuring initiatives. 
And lastly, on International revenues. These grew 1% on a constant currency basis and was significantly impacted by foreign exchange translation. On a constant-currency basis and excluding the impact of the regulatory changes in the textured implant market, International revenues increased 5.2% year-over-year. Contribution margin declined 40 basis points due in part to the textured implant issue as well as increased investment in the high-growth regions, especially Asia Pacific. 
Now turning to Slide 24. You can see our operating cash flow in the first quarter was strong at $1.2 billion, and this supports our 2019 guidance of $5 billion to $5.5 billion. Our priorities on capital allocation remain unchanged. First, reinvestment in our business for growth in our 4 key therapeutics areas. During the quarter, we acquired Envy Medical, which increases the breadth of our Medical Aesthetics offerings to now include skin resurfacing and dermal infusion; second, debt reduction, which is important in the context of the anticipated RESTASIS LOE; third, funding and prudently growing our dividend; and fourth, share buybacks as a means to manage earnings dilution that would result from asset sales or from long-term equity-based incentive plans. 
And as you can see on our capitalization table, we continue to work towards our capital allocation goals. We ended the quarter with $23.5 billion in total debt and $1.8 billion in cash and equivalents, which brings our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio to 2.8x as of March 31. Coming up in the second quarter, we have a scheduled debt maturity of approximately $800 million that we intend to retire using cash on hand and operating cash flow. We remain committed and on track to achieve our target net leverage ratio of 2.5x by the end of 2020, which would of course enable us to sustain our commitment to an investment-grade credit rating. 
With regard to share buybacks, we said on the last call that as part of our 2019 guidance, we intended to repurchase $800 million of shares during the year. We accomplished this entire amount in the first quarter, which completely utilizes the 2018 $2 billion share repurchase authorization. We have the 2019 $2 billion share authorization available to us. However, it's important to note that our revised guidance contemplates no further share repurchases during 2019. As previously mentioned, this assumption may change depending upon the progression of asset sales. 
Moving now to guidance on Page 25. We're revising guidance upward for 2019. So starting with net revenues, we're raising our full year outlook and now expect 2019 net revenues to be between $15.1 billion and $15.4 billion, $100 million higher and the low -- on the low and high end from the previously provided guidance of $15 billion to $15.3 billion. We now assume a mid-May LOE for RESTASIS, and the increase in revenue guidance is driven by the additional RESTASIS exclusivity. 
Our updated revenue guidance continues to contemplate strength in the core business, which is expected to grow at a rate similar to last year, in the mid- to high single-digit range. 
Additionally, we continue to incorporate headwinds previously discussed related to OZURDEX, textured implants, industry-wide pricing pressure and foreign exchange translation. And we believe our revised guidance is appropriately conservative across all these points. We continue to expect non-GAAP gross margins for the full year to be 85% to 85.5% based on our product mix and LOE assumptions, including the impact of generic RESTASIS. Our non-GAAP SG&A and R&D expense remains unchanged as we continue to invest in growth drivers for our key businesses and in advancing our clinical programs in development. Should there be a sustained benefit of incremental RESTASIS revenues versus our expectations, we would look at opportunities to reinvest a portion of these proceeds back into the business, and this would be similar to what we executed in 2018. 
Besides revenue, the only other guidance item that's changing is performance net income per share, which we're increasing from greater than or equal to $16.36 to greater than $16.55. As with revenue, this increase reflects the assumption of additional RESTASIS exclusivity to mid-May on top of solid core business performance, which is soundly in line with our expectations at this point. 
Now for reference, each additional month of RESTASIS exclusivity is estimated to add an incremental $60 million to $70 million in sales. Also, please note that our guidance does not include the impact of any significant asset divestitures. If or when we complete these, we will provide an update on the impact to our key financial metrics, including to non-GAAP performance net income per share. Until such time as there is a generic RESTASIS, we expect to provide quarterly financial guidance, both top and bottom line. With our seasonally slowest quarter of the year in Q1 now behind us, we are forecasting sequentially stronger top line performance for the remainder of the year. For the second quarter of 2019, we expect total reported net revenue between $3.85 billion and $4 billion and non-GAAP performance net income per share between $4.20 and $4.40. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back to Brent."

Can you give us a sense of what would prompt maybe a different turn into than what you're doing? And then along those same lines, what are you hearing as you speak to your shareholders?

So look, I think that -- let me answer your questions perhaps in reverse order, if that's acceptable. In terms of the shareholder engagement both the management team and our Board did, which was significant over the last few months, I think there is a common theme from our shareholders, which is a frustration in the performance of the stock price. Let me be clear. I share that frustration. I understand that frustration. I'm a very large shareholder relative to my own personal holdings in Allergan, and most of the management team is likewise situated. And so that is something that was loud and clear, and we need to make sure that we do everything we can to unlock value and create a better shareholder return for our shareholders over the long term. And so that is clearly I think the top issue we heard, and we heard it loud and clear, and our Board heard it loud and clear. And I think that was a very constructive and positive experience for our Board members to hear from probably close to 50 different shareholders that they engaged with. So I think that's pretty straightforward. I think in terms of prompting us to do something different, the way I would come at it I'd say, it's multifactorial. We have a very experienced and engaged Board. We also have a refreshed Board with several new members with lots of different experiences in this industry and in other businesses. And I would say that given the frustration on shareholder return, given the strength of the core business, given the pipeline that we have and then put that in the context of the operating environment, the political environment, the regulatory environment, the global environment, we continue to look at what are the ways that we can unlock value. And I would say that's something that we do regularly and continuously. And now I would say with a sense of urgency. And so the Board is on it. The Board is engaged and stay tuned."

So regarding Rapastinel and 241751, I can make a few comments about breast implants and perhaps Bill, from a commercial perspective, will talk about that mainly. So look, the -- with Rapastinel, we have the positive Phase II study and then we performed the Phase III programs in adjunctive MDD using once-a-week dosing. And we know that with ketamine, another NMDA receptor modulator, that such a regimen can be effective in depression. Now clearly, when we look at animal models of the depression or psychiatric disorders, Rapastinel and 751 are incredibly effective in those models. Having said that, some very recent data has shown that more frequent dosing -- or the more frequent the dosing in those animal models, the greater the efficacy. And that holds true both for Rapastinel and for AGN-241751. But clearly, I don't know the answer yet. But with 241751, because it's an oral compound, we can test and are testing more frequent dosing. So by analogy, with the animal data, that may give us a greater chance of showing efficacy with this mechanism of action because 751 has the same mechanism as Rapastinel. And we plan to have data with 751 by the end of 2019. Yes. Regarding breast implants, I was present at the advisory -- the 2-day advisory committee that the FDA held recently. And recently, the FDA told us that based on that advisory committee and their other analyses that they -- that the textured breast implants, which was the main topic of discussion there, will remain on the market, although they are going to discuss labeling and enhancing communication with the various manufacturers. Of course, the majority of implants that are used in the U.S. are in fact smooth implants. There will be a discussion with the FDA about derma matrices, but that's a different topic. Of course, conversations around the world are taking place with various regulatory authorities about textured implants. And perhaps, Bill could pick it up from here."

There are a number of factors that go into looking at that. One, you just said, which is the sustained valuation discount is something that's clearly important. We also tend to look at some of the other important issues, which I mentioned at Leerink and at many other times like scale, particularly outside the U.S. And that's something that's improving as that business grows. We clearly need to protect BOTOX as a brand, which is both a aesthetic and therapeutic product and one of the most important brands in the Allergan family. So that's something that we would have to clearly be thoughtful and meticulous in terms of how we thought about that. And then scale of R&D as the science of Medical Aesthetics is clearly moving in the direction of biopharmaceutical R&D versus just medical device R&D. And so those are just a few of the things that we tend to look at outside of financial complexities and other things like that. But look, everything is on the table. I said everything was on the table. Our Board will regularly and actively evaluate these types of decisions. And I think I also made clear in my answer to Ken, they're going to do that with a sense of urgency. So stay tuned, and we'll see where we go."

As it relates to CoolSculpting, first, this is getting a lot of attention right now, as you can imagine. I'll tell you that the problem we're facing is not due to market saturation, it's not due to customer satisfaction and it's not due to competition. And I think that's important to recognize. We are managing I think 2 issues in addition to my earlier remarks. The first one is when we acquired ZELTIQ, we knew that we had what I would describe as an innovation or a new product cycle gap when we guided into this '18 to '19 period. In other words, if you go back between 2013 and 2017 over a 5-year period, there were 6 different applicators launched for CoolSculpting. And each applicator opened up a different area of the body and sustained a pretty robust growth rate over that period. It's been fairly quiet for the past 18 to 24 months, and I think we've fixed that right now. We're going to launch CoolTone at the end of '19, and then we're set up for 2 additional system upgrades over the next 2 to 3 years. Think iPhone 8, 9 and X. The second issue is that after several years on the market, we're dealing, to be fair, with a different type of consumer. We've essentially got to all of the early adopters. And now we're working on a group of late adopters, and they're -- they have more questions and they're somewhat more cautious. And so we've really shifted our focus from, as I mentioned, practices and system placements to a more consumer model. I think the outlook for the business is still very positive. You have to recognize that CoolSculpting has a long runway. And if we're successful with CoolTone, next-generation CoolSculpting and then with our skin-tightening technology over the next, let's call it, 2 to 3 years, and we're successful both domestically and internationally, this business should reach our initial expectations or come very close."

So look, let me start by saying that R&D and innovation is the lifeblood of Allergan as it is for any biopharmaceutical company. It's important for us, and I think just -- Bill just kind of explained it in the context of CoolSculpting to have continuous innovation to drive growth. That holds true across the entire portfolio when we look at the therapeutics side of our business, which is important. Clearly, we're focused on 4 therapeutic approvals and launches over the next 18 months that are really important for us, whether that be a bipolar depression for VRAYLAR, ubrogepant, abicipar, Bimatoprost SR. But as David mentioned, we also have 10 Phase III programs continuing to advance whether that be relamorelin or brazikumab or a variety of other things that are listed on the chart in the presentation. I think when we walk in the earlier pipeline, we absolutely need to continue to look to enhance and increase our opportunities to bring real innovation to patients. Some of that will come through from some of the collaborations we've already established. So for example, we have an IND that was accepted or approved related to our partnership with Editas for liver disease, and we'll -- we expect to enroll patients later this year. Our first IND with the microbiome in our assembly was also approved, and we'll start to enroll patients as well, but we are enrolling patients already in that one. And we have a variety of other partnerships like that as well that will continue for all our development candidates. So there are a lot of activity, and we constantly look for new science and new partnerships and new collaborations. And in fact, for the second part of your question, upgrading skills is a continuous process. We are always looking to enhance our capabilities in R&D and in science. And in fact, we announced last quarter or right around the JPMorgan conference, I believe, that we were opening up our office in Boston and moving our Head of External Science and Innovation to Boston and building out and hiring and recruiting in the Kendall Square area new science and -- scientists and capabilities. And so that is actively underway, and we believe that's the right place to have an additional office for R&D organization. Now we are in Southern California. We're in South San Francisco. We're in New Jersey. We're in the U.K. and we're in Boston as well as a few other places. And so I think that we've got a good spread, and we're committed to recruiting the best scientists and the best minds that we can to supplement our thinking. Do you want to talk, Bill?"

I think that as it relates to the aesthetics market and pricing, I think it's a good question. This market has and I think will continue to trade on innovation and customer service. As you know, it's on a very, very solid growth trajectory. It's hard to predict what some of the other companies might do. I would just say that I think price discounting is tempting, but it can be a trap long term. It's a slippery slope. It lessens the perceived value of a product. It cuts in the profits, cuts in the customer service, cuts in the R&D. The way we think about is, the value of our products and services right now exceed the prices that we charge. And if we don't believe that at some point in the future, we'd make an adjustment. I think the focus here has got to be on attracting new users to the category and introducing products that improve outcomes for those consumers. And that's where we stand right now. I think the business is in great shape as we head into the next several quarters of 2019."

Thanks, Jason. And look, yes, we're absolutely committed to the 5%. I think some reasons to feel confident about that are the ninth consecutive quarters of core business growth, which is now 90% of Allergan, and I think will ultimately become most of Allergan over time; areas like facial injectables that grew 13% this quarter; looking at products like VRAYLAR and even ZENPEP and VIIBRYD that are growing above expectations; we saw Lo LO and OZURDEX strong at roughly 10% or better year-over-year. And so those are reasons to be confident in that core business. 
Clearly, as we look at the back part of that guidance, the pipeline needs to participate to enable us to reach that target. And Rapastinel was frankly not a big part of that guidance. It was further out. So it really doesn't impact our thinking there. ESMYA did. And we've already incorporated that into our thinking, but we've seen improvements in other parts of the pipeline, right? So they're all risk-adjusted when we made the comment. We know that the profile of ubrogepant looks very positive, and the risk-benefit there looks very positive. Obviously, we need an FDA approval, but that looks good. Bim SR had surprisingly positive results as well. And that is being filed in the first half of this year. Abicipar is the only true 12-week anti-VEGF. While we're improving the inflammation, we still believe that could be a very nice product in the forecast. And so that's moving forward. International growth continues to look solid and will be a big contributor. And so bear in mind, our outlook was adjusted for some of the asset sales, and so we continue to exceed expectations in the delivery of our quarters. And that, I think, all those reasons combined, both positive and negative, give us reason to be confident."

I personally believe that's because people are doing more intense workout these days. And when I discuss with my colleagues, Heads of R&D from the pharmaceutical companies, they see it as well. Now back to ubrogepant. The cases are primarily diagnosed based on creatine phosphokinase released form skeletal muscle plus patient history discussions. When we're talking about the incidence of rhabdomyolysis in the ubrogepant studies, you've got to look at, of course, the totality of evidence. And we do see cases of exercise-induced rhabdomyolysis in placebo standard-of-care cases as well as in the ubrogepant arms. The -- where it's differing in arms between studies.

Bill, CoolSculpting, I understand that the argument you're making around look, we're going to push the product. I guess the question is, is this part of delivering the expected results from patients who are already using it? And I was wondering if you might have some data about attrition rates and -- especially in comparison to attrition rates on fillers or on BOTOX. That is, are we seeing the same kind of repeat use rates from even the early adopters of CoolSculpting as we see from the more established BOTOX where benefit is established? And second, back to the General Medicine's business. It seems that the pricing you're obtaining, just looking year-over-year for the Eye Care products or the IBD products are a little bit lower than they were in 1Q '18. And just talking to the peers, it seems there is more of an effort to go ahead and press down some of those older category for discounts. So when we think about kind of like the pricing you obtained from those areas of older products going forward, should we assume kind of a small negative number in terms of pricing year-over-year? Or should we still expect flat to slightly up?"

As it relates to CoolSculpting, I think consumer satisfaction with the procedure is high. A couple of points about that. If you take a look at RealSelf and you look at the work rating for CoolSculpting, it's roughly 78%. Now that rate is a little bit lower than a facial injectable, but that's not surprising for a body contouring procedure. Satisfaction levels will trade lower if a patient does not receive an adequate number of treatment cycles. Right now, that number is at roughly 5. Ideally, if you talk to most plastic surgeons, it should be 6 to 8. And so with adequate treatments in a given area of the body, the satisfaction for CoolSculpting is right where it has been and where we expect it to be. As it relates to repeat visits, this is -- there isn't a reoccurring revenue stream. In other words, when someone receives their 6 to 8 cycles for a given problem area, then it's in many respects a permanent solution. And so I think that deals with the CoolSculpting question. I would also say that when you take a look at CoolTone and the next-generation CoolSculpting system as well as the skin-tightening solution, each one of those should enable plastic surgeons and derms and other providers to improve outcomes for patients. 
As it relates to the General Medicine business, I think you have it right. I think about price, whether it be for LINZESS or for RESTASIS or for our U.S. glaucoma business, as being neutral and there could be some downward pressure on it. I think that's the reality of the health care system right now. I think the positive in all this for us is that prescription demand for these businesses -- obviously, LINZESS is very solid and the product's on the market for 7 years now, and prescriptions were up 10% and units were up 14%. As it relates to the more established businesses like RESTASIS or glaucoma, demand is relatively stable. And so you'll see a little bit more price pressure read through the sales line on those businesses. But I think your outlook is right."

Good morning and thank you for joining us on our call today. 
Our first quarter results reflected ongoing strength of our core business across our 4 key therapeutic areas: Medical Aesthetics, Eye Care, CNS and GI. This represented the ninth consecutive quarter of core business growth. The growth prospects of these businesses remain strong driven by product line depth, new product flow, commercial expertise and a robust pipeline with 5 potential FDA approvals and new product launches anticipated over the next 18 months. As a management team and Board, we are focused on strengthening and growing our business while executing disciplined capital allocation and returning capital to shareholders. At the same time, we are realistic about the challenges and risks facing the business and the work we need to continue to create value for our shareholders, customers, patients and colleagues. We understand that we need to continue to earn their trust for our performance commercially, operationally and in R&D. And we are committed to acting with urgency to do just that. 
Now let me turn to the quarter's results on Slide 5. We had a good start to the year with continued growth of our core business, which was up 4.4% year-over-year. Against the backdrop of continuing product LOEs, our total revenue was stable, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. We made progress on building several important brands, which we expect will be key drivers of long-term growth. There are many standouts in the first quarter such as BOTOX, JUVÉDERM and VRAYLAR as well as some brands, which we are working on further bolstering. Bill will address these in greater detail. In R&D, we believe we are well positioned with 5 anticipated FDA approvals over the next 18 months or so. They include: cariprazine for bipolar depression where we expect a regulatory decision later this month; ubrogepant for the acute treatment of migraine where we expect the regulatory decision in December; CoolTone, a new muscle-toning system as part of CoolSculpting family, which we expect to launch towards the end of the year; Bimatoprost SR, which is a dropless glaucoma therapy where we plan to make a regulatory submission in the first half of the year; and abicipar for wet age-related macular degeneration where we plan to make a regulatory submission also in the first half of this year. 
In the first quarter, we reported top line results from the Phase III Rapastinel program, and we were deeply disappointed that these studies were not successful. Our commitment to bring new medicines to patients in need remains unchanged, and our pipeline supports this commitment. Across our 4 key therapeutic areas, we now have 46 programs on the pharmaceutical side and 30 programs on the device side. I am happy to report that we achieved solid results in the first quarter while remaining disciplined and shareholder-friendly in terms of capital allocation. You will hear more about this from Matt. 
Slide 6 provides an overview of the key drivers of our financial results in the first quarter of 2019 and illustrates that our core business, accounting for about 90% of total revenues, reached $3.2 billion. This continued strength of our core business, together with our emerging pipeline, positions us well for 2019 and beyond. 
Slide 7 provides more focused look at our core business, which is comprised of promoted brands and brands with ongoing exclusivity. The first quarter of 2019 is the ninth consecutive quarter where our core business has delivered consistent year-over-year growth. Since 2016, our core business has grown by over $3 billion and currently accounts for 90% of our revenues. In 2017, our core business made up 79% of our revenues. And in 2018, it accounted for 87% of our revenues. 
Looking ahead, we expect to work our way through the impact of the LOEs and reach a place where our core business generates almost all of our revenues. Before I turn the call over to Bill, I wanted to take a moment to comment on the results of our recent Annual Shareholder Meeting and the extensive discussions we as Allergan's leadership team and Board of Directors have had with our shareholders in the weeks and months leading up to it. 
Let me start by saying that I take seriously the opinion of our shareholders, including David Tepper. We have benefited from the candid and constructive shareholder feedback, and I share their desire to create more value at Allergan. Our focus and interests are 100% aligned with those of our shareholders. We have been on this transformation journey for almost 3 years since the sale of our generics business. Since then, we have worked to grow our key products at depth and breadth to our pipeline and build scale to compete in 4 therapeutic areas. I share in the disappointment that the value creation has not materialized yet. But when I look at the strength of our core business, the potential of our pipeline and the dedication of our team and Board, I have great confidence that it will. 
So how are we going to do that? First, we will continue to focus on growing our core business and realizing value through the pipeline. That means keeping our teams focused, delivering excellent service to our customers and driving key R&D milestones. The sense of urgency to create value is high, and the Board is actively and continuously reviewing alternative avenues that could unlock value in the nearer term. I assure you that the Board, management team and I recognize the urgency, and we will take decisive action to drive value-enhancing opportunities. 
Now let me turn the call over to Bill."

Slide 9 is a product-level sales analysis for the first quarter ranked in terms of sales growth versus prior year.

Slide 9 is a product-level sales analysis for the first quarter ranked in terms of sales growth versus prior year. We had a strong start to the year posting double-digit growth rates for several of our major products. BOTOX Cosmetic, VRAYLAR, VIIBRYD, ZENPEP, JUVÉDERM, OZURDEX and Lo LOESTRIN were standouts in the quarter. Other key brands, Natrelle implants, ALLODERM and CoolSculpting, were down versus prior year, which I'll discuss shortly. 
Overall, our core business performance was solid, and we anticipate growth strengthening throughout the year. At the bottom of the graph and as expected, total sales growth was impacted by products already facing loss of exclusivity as well as the RESTASIS sales decline ahead of anticipated generic competition. 
Now I'll touch on our key therapeutic areas starting with our largest, Medical Aesthetics. Globally, sales for our facial injectable line, BOTOX and JUVÉDERM, were up 13% versus prior year. Demand was strong domestically and internationally, and demand was broad-based across both the aesthetic dermatology and plastic surgery segments. 
Turning to BOTOX. I'll talk about our results, the outlook for the market and our toxin development programs. U.S. BOTOX sales were up 17% and international up 8%. Sales for BOTOX in the United States were powered by a significantly larger consumer activation program with advertising, digital and PR efforts, an expanded sales force to reach more practices and achieving higher levels of customer service and a first quarter promotional offer for top customers. 
Additionally, we added 0.25 million people to our Brilliant Distinctions loyalty program in the first quarter, which is the best quarter in the history of the program. We've added 1 million in the last 12 months for a total of 6 million members. This is relevant because 67% of our BOTOX consumers are BD members, and they visit their practices 23% more often and spend 36% more per year than nonmembers. It's an important asset for customers and for Allergan. 
Now for a few comments about the aesthetics market. The prospects for growth here are excellent. There is both a youth movement and a prevention movement underway, and Allergan has launched 3 digital ventures in partnership with aesthetic practices to attract new consumers, including Allergan Data Labs, which is a data science and digital marketing group now fully operational in Irvine. They're launching the largest digital marketing campaign ever for BOTOX on Mother's Day, which we expect will attract tens of thousands of new users and loyalty members. 
In terms of competition, it's the reality of a growing market. Aesthetics has never been a 1-product market and never will be, but it is an efficient market, which means in the end, it will likely support 3 products, not 4, 5 or 6. Our strategy, like that of our customers, is to compete on quality, innovation and customer service, not on price. That is the only sustainable strategy in our view. When it comes to neurotoxins, customers and patients are more outcomes- and service-sensitive than price-sensitive. We are well positioned to defend this business. 
Finally, on the product development front, we're developing 1 of 2 types of products, products that either help providers deliver even better aesthetic outcomes or products that attract new consumers. Right now, we're advancing new indications for BOTOX, masseter and platysma, a new prefilled syringe for BOTOX and 3 completely novel toxins, including a liquid, a rapid-acting short duration and a long-acting, which are in various stages of development. 
Turning to JUVÉDERM. Fillers have been a step change in aesthetics. They have given providers the ability to volumize, lift and shape. JUVÉDERM is the #1 filler in the world. Sales internationally increased 18% with exceptional performance in Asia Pacific, Middle East, Africa and Europe. New product launches, including VOLUX last month in Europe and new consumer programs are fueling demand around the world. 
In the U.S., sales were up 6% versus prior year. We expect sales growth for the year to be higher than the first quarter, which was impacted by strong buying in the prior fourth quarter of 2018. For reference, fourth quarter sales in '18 were up 14% last year. 
Turning to Slide 11, CoolSculpting. Our first quarter sales, of course, were below expectations, off 4% versus prior year, due to consumer demand and a reduction in system sales in the United States. We have a lot of work to do in this business in the short term, especially in the U.S., which I'll talk about shortly. Long term, the outlook for CoolSculpting is still positive for 2 reasons. First, we're set up to launch 3 new CoolSculpting systems in the next 2 to 3 years, which will improve outcomes for the procedure and underlying demand. And second, we've only scratched the surface of the body contouring market with an estimated penetration rate of less than 10%. There's still a large untapped pool of consumers to reach and convert, and we expect sales for the year to be up 5% to 10% globally despite our first quarter performance. 
We had several priorities when we acquired CoolSculpting. They were: expand the U.S. installed base, which is now 50% larger than it was 2 years ago; reorganize the international business; accelerate the development of new CoolSculpting technologies; and drive consumer demand. In roughly 2 years, we've achieved 3 of the 4. Right now, more focus is needed on consumer marketing and activation. We have exceptionally high-awareness levels. We have 7 million consumers visiting our website, an installed base totaling 4,000 accounts and 6,000 systems. So the foundation here is solid, but our consumer conversion rate is low. We're taking a number of measures to fix that, including Allergan Data Labs is launching a new digital initiative to drive website traffic conversion with the first-ever freecycle promotion. We're also partnering with high-end health clubs around the country and conducting marketing events at luxury malls and wellness centers to move consumers from awareness to usage. We're changing the approach here from a focus on not only practices and systems, but also consumers. Two other important sources of future growth for this business in '19 are International and CoolTone. In International, we've restructured the business transitioning from a distributor model to a direct promotion model. We're now doing business directly in 69 countries and have 3,000 systems placed around the world. Next, CoolTone will launch in late 2019. This is a muscle-toning system that is complementary and will be marketed alongside CoolSculpting. We'll be taking orders for CoolTone by midyear and shipping equipment in early Q4. Now with any launch, current capital sales slow as providers want to see new package offers -- what new package offers might look like. We expect capital sales to rebound upon the launch of CoolTone. 
ALLODERM sales in the first quarter were impacted by a supply constraint for donor material. The supply situation has stabilized and is expected to improve throughout the year. Sales growth of this business should trade in the mid-single digits. Sales for our Natrelle line of breast implants have been impacted by regulatory changes related to our textured implants internationally. Our 2019 sales outlook anticipated these changes. In the U.S., FDA conducted a public hearing on breast implant safety. David will talk more about this shortly. Note that in the U.S., over 90% of our business is smooth implants.
Turning to Slide 12 and CNS. Sales for BOTOX were at expectations, up 6% for the first quarter. The year-over-year comparison was impacted by the fact that the first quarter of '19 had 2 fewer selling days than the first quarter of '18. Adjusting for quarterly selling days, BOTOX growth was in the high single digits. In terms of the market, the migraine prevention market is 10% to 15% larger than it was a year ago. Our share of new chronic migraine patients is 47%, remains stable. We estimate that only 2% of CGRP patients were switched from BOTOX and combination use is limited. As we have said before, we expect the growth rate in 2019 will be in the mid- to high single digits. 
Sales for VRAYLAR in Q1 '19 totaled $144 million, up 70%. This product continues to exceed expectations on almost all metrics, including prescribers, prescription levels and formulary coverage rates. The growth catalyst for VRAYLAR in 2019 is the anticipated new indication for bipolar depression, which is currently under review at the FDA. The target audience and detailing levels for VRAYLAR will be almost doubled in May to cover not only psychiatrists but also primary care physicians. 
Turning to Slide 13 on GI. Underlying prescription demand growth for LINZESS in the first quarter was in the double digits. This was offset by a lower average selling price and trade buying patterns resulting in a net revenue gain of 1% versus prior year. Sales for ZENPEP were strong, up 19%. 
Turning now to Eye Care. Our glaucoma business was impacted by pricing headwinds in the United States and the impact of trade buying patterns internationally. We expect this franchise to be stable for the year. OZURDEX sales increased 10%. Our supply situation has improved significantly, and we expect all markets to be fully restocked in the second quarter. RESTASIS prescription ban -- demand was relatively stable year-over-year. This was offset by a lower average selling price. Sales orders for RESTASIS MDPF have been replaced by the RESTASIS single-unit vial as we work through a backorder situation, which we expect to resolve by the second half. 
Finally, turning to Slide 14. Our International sales totaled $802 million, up 1% versus prior year. Excluding the impact of Natrelle implants, sales were up 5.2%. The growth drivers were JUVÉDERM, CoolSculpting, BOTOX Cosmetic and BOTOX Therapeutic. The Asia Pacific/Middle East/Africa region continues to be the most important growth driver in our International business. In the quarter, LACAN sales were further impacted by trade buying patterns for our Eye Care business and lower Fibristal sales and generic RESTASIS in Canada. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to David."

We made significant pipeline progress in the first quarter of the year. Before I talk about progress, I will begin with the readout from our Phase III program Rapastinel as an adjunctive treatment in major depressive disorder. I was very disappointed by these results. Despite this setback, our commitment to bringing innovative medicines to patients with unmet needs in mental health remains unchanged. We expect to present detailed data from the Rapastinel program at an upcoming medical conference. We still have 2 studies with Rapastinel ongoing, one in suicidality and the other in monotherapy. We will perform an interim analysis of these studies to check for futility, and we will see these data later this year. 
Turning to Slide 16, which highlights the major upcoming catalysts for the year. As you heard from Brent, we expect approval of 5 major programs over the course of the next 18 months. Most near term is the anticipated approval of cariprazine for bipolar depression where we have an FDA action date later this month. As recently announced, our NDA has been filed for ubrogepant, our oral CGRP inhibitor for the acute treatment of migraine, and we have an action date in December. Also within CNS, we expect to report in the second half of the year top line results from the ongoing Phase II study of AGN-241751, our oral NMDA modulator. This agent has the same mechanism of action as Rapastinel. The oral formulation allows us to evaluate the safety and efficacy of more frequent dosing. 
Turning to Eye Care. we recently reported safety data from the MAPLE Study for abicipar in neurovascular age-related macular degeneration. Data from this study showed a decrease in the rates of inflammation compared to that previously reported in the Phase III CEDAR and SEQUOIA studies. We view this decrease in inflammation rates as step in the right direction, and we will continue to work on improving the formulation. We expect to make a regulatory submission in the U.S. in the first half of the year, followed by a submission in the EU in the second half of the year. We also expect to make a regulatory submission of bimatoprost sustained-release in the U.S. for the treatment of glaucoma in the first half of 2019. In Medical Aesthetics, we are excited to be launching CoolTone, a muscle-toning system utilizing high-frequency electromagnetic stimulation aimed at fast-twitch skeletal muscle. In addition, versions 3.0 and 4.0 of CoolSculpting are expected within the next 2 to 3 years. 
Slide 17 provides a summary of the key events we anticipate over the next 18 months. We continue to advance the rest of our mid- to late-stage pipeline according to our targets and expectations. 
Turning to Slide 18. Our pharmaceutical pipeline has 46 programs in various stages of development with 2 that are currently under regulatory review and 10 programs in Phase III development. Our development programs continue to remain aligned with our time lines with the exception of brazikumab. This IL-23 monoclonal antibody is being developed in a competitive space with a large number of competing trials. 
Similarly, as outlined on Slide 19, we continue to develop our device pipeline with 30 programs in development. This will continue to drive innovation within Medical Aesthetics. This is a rich development portfolio in line with our leadership in this area. And as such, we have more than doubled our R&D investments in devices in Medical Aesthetics over the last 2 years. In the quarter, the FDA held a 2-day advisory committee to discuss the benefits and risks of breast implants and dermal matrices. The agency recently announced that textured breast implants will remain on the market and are considering actions to be taken to improve product labeling and communication. We're excited about the future of our R&D organization. As always, I thank my colleagues in R&D for their hard work as well as the investigators and particularly, the patients who are participating in our clinical trials. 
And now I will turn the call over to Matt."
36478,609716141,1723691,"Allergan plc, Q1 2019 Earnings Call, May 07, 2019",2019-05-07,"Earnings Calls","Allergan plc","Executives","Thank you, David. Looking now at the key financial highlights on Page 21. As Brent mentioned earlier, our core business continues to be strong, and we're delivering on our key financial commitments through the first quarter of 2019. So starting at the t",1576,"Thank you, David. 
Looking now at the key financial highlights on Page 21. As Brent mentioned earlier, our core business continues to be strong, and we're delivering on our key financial commitments through the first quarter of 2019. So starting at the top of the page, net revenues in the quarter were $3.6 billion, flat year-over-year on a constant currency basis, which means the 2% decline in reported revenues was due solely to foreign exchange translation. The highlight of the quarter was the solid performance of the promoted brands with ongoing exclusivity, which was up 5.3%. This entirely offset the 27% decline in LOEs and divestitures, which now includes the generic entry of Canasa. Our core business, which comprises 90% of total revenues, grew 4.4% at constant currency and was actually over 1 percentage point higher at 5.5% excluding the impact of regulatory changes in the international textured implant market. 
A few things to bear in mind as we think about 2019 revenues. First, from a phasing perspective, our first quarter tends to be our seasonally slowest quarter revenue-wise historically. And second, as we stated when we issued 2019 guidance, we expect revenue growth rates to accelerate in the remaining quarters of 2019 as we annualize the back half 2018 issues related to the OZURDEX recall and ALLODERM donor supply. 
Now turning to margins. Non-GAAP gross margin grew 50 basis points to 86.7% primarily driven by favorable product mix. Operating margins, however, declined 270 basis points to 45.2%, which was driven by 2 key factors. First, in sales and marketing, we increased expenditures in our Facial Aesthetics business, and we bolstered our commercial footprint internationally, especially in Asia Pacific. And second, we increased R&D spending to support ongoing late-stage clinical development programs. 
Now turning to the lower section of the slide. Non-GAAP performance net income per share was $3.79, representing 1% growth year-on-year versus the first quarter of 2018, which reflects the impact of share buybacks during 2018 and the first quarter of this year. 
Slide 22 provides an overview of our P&L line items for the quarter, most of which I've already discussed. I would, however, like to highlight 2 important line items, our net interest expense and our tax rate, both of which are meaningfully favorable to prior year, and this was contemplated in our 2019 guidance. 
Now I'd like to discuss the significant GAAP accounting matter and provide the appropriate context. Each quarter, we monitor goodwill and intangibles for indicators of impairment. In the first quarter, we recorded a $2.5 billion goodwill impairment in our General Medicine Reporting Unit primarily related to the failure of Rapastinel in Phase III clinical trials and, to a lesser extent, timing true-ups of other R&D programs. Bear in mind that this goodwill impairment in our Gen Med reporting unit is not related to the acquisition price of Naurex as this was 100% expensed as IT R&D at the time of the acquisition in 2015. So rather, this impairment is a consequence of the removal of future anticipated cash flows related to Rapastinel and the timing true-ups of other programs from our long-term financial projections. This, in turn, lowered the fair value of the Gen Med reporting unit as of March 31 below book value. While the strong performance we've seen across other parts of Allergan support increased fair values, those increases are in other reporting units, which under GAAP did not impact the goodwill impairment test of the Gen Med business. 
Turning to Slide 23 now and returning to the quarter's results. Here we see an overview of our financial results by reporting segment. U.S. Specialized Therapeutics experienced a decline of 2.3% in revenues, which was driven by lower RESTASIS sales as well as the sale of our Med Derm business in 2018. Contribution margin was down 290 basis points driven by the revenue decline coupled with the increase in promotional spending in our Facial Aesthetics business. 
Looking at U.S. General Medicine. The segment grew 2.1% year-over-year. This was driven by double-digit growth across key brands, including VRAYLAR, VIIBRYD, Lo LOESTRIN and ZENPEP. This growth was offset by the continued impact of products facing LOEs, which, in this quarter, also includes the generic entry of Canasa. Contribution margin increased 90 basis points due to higher revenues and the benefit from lower promotional selling expenses resulting from the restructuring initiatives. 
And lastly, on International revenues. These grew 1% on a constant currency basis and was significantly impacted by foreign exchange translation. On a constant-currency basis and excluding the impact of the regulatory changes in the textured implant market, International revenues increased 5.2% year-over-year. Contribution margin declined 40 basis points due in part to the textured implant issue as well as increased investment into high-growth regions, especially Asia Pacific. 
Now turning to Slide 24. You can see our operating cash flow in the first quarter was strong at $1.2 billion, and this supports our 2019 guidance of $5 billion to $5.5 billion. Our priorities on capital allocation remain unchanged. First, reinvestment in our business for growth in our 4 key therapeutics areas. During the quarter, we acquired Envy Medical, which increases the breadth of our Medical Aesthetics offerings to now include skin resurfacing and dermal infusion; second, debt reduction, which is important in the context of the anticipated RESTASIS LOE; third, funding and prudently growing our dividend; and fourth, share buybacks as a means to manage earnings dilution that would result from asset sales or from long-term equity-based incentive plans. 
And as you can see on our capitalization table, we continue to work towards our capital allocation goals. We ended the quarter with $23.5 billion in total debt and $1.8 billion in cash and equivalents, which brings our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio to 2.8x as of March 31. Coming up in the second quarter, we have a scheduled debt maturity of approximately $800 million that we intend to retire using cash on hand and operating cash flow. We remain committed and on track to achieve our target net leverage ratio of 2.5x by the end of 2020, which would, of course, enable us to sustain our commitment to an investment-grade credit rating. 
With regard to share buybacks, we said on the last call that as part of our 2019 guidance, we intended to repurchase $800 million of shares during the year. We accomplished this entire amount in the first quarter, which completely utilizes the 2018 $2 billion share repurchase authorization. We have the 2019 $2 billion share authorization available to us. However, it's important to note that our revised guidance contemplates no further share repurchases during 2019. As previously mentioned, this assumption may change depending upon the progression of asset sales. 
Moving now to guidance on Page 25. We're revising guidance upward for 2019. So starting with net revenues, we're raising our full year outlook and now expect 2019 net revenues to be between $15.1 billion and $15.4 billion, $100 million higher and the low -- on the low and high end from the previously provided guidance of $15 billion to $15.3 billion. We now assume a mid-May LOE for RESTASIS, and the increase in revenue guidance is driven by the additional RESTASIS exclusivity. 
Our updated revenue guidance continues to contemplate strength in the core business, which is expected to grow at a rate similar to last year, in the mid- to high single-digit range. 
Additionally, we continue to incorporate headwinds previously discussed related to OZURDEX, textured implants, industry-wide pricing pressure and foreign exchange translation. And we believe our revised guidance is appropriately conservative across all these points. We continue to expect non-GAAP gross margins for the full year to be 85% to 85.5% based on our product mix and LOE assumptions, including the impact of generic RESTASIS. Our non-GAAP SG&A and R&D expense remains unchanged as we continue to invest in growth drivers for our key businesses and in advancing our clinical programs in development. Should there be a sustained benefit of incremental RESTASIS revenues versus our expectations, we would look at opportunities to reinvest a portion of these proceeds back into the business, and this would be similar to what we executed in 2018. 
Besides revenue, the only other guidance item that's changing is performance net income per share, which we're increasing from greater than or equal to $16.36 to greater than $16.55. As with revenue, this increase reflects the assumption of additional RESTASIS exclusivity to mid-May on top of solid core business performance, which is soundly in line with our expectations at this point. 
Now for reference, each additional month of RESTASIS exclusivity is estimated to add an incremental $60 million to $70 million in sales. Also, please note that our guidance does not include the impact of any significant asset divestitures. If or when we complete these, we will provide an update on the impact to our key financial metrics, including to non-GAAP performance net income per share. Until such time as there is a generic RESTASIS, we expect to provide quarterly financial guidance, both top and bottom line. With our seasonally slowest quarter of the year in Q1 now behind us, we are forecasting sequentially stronger top line performance for the remainder of the year. For the second quarter of 2019, we expect total reported net revenue between $3.85 billion and $4 billion and non-GAAP performance net income per share between $4.20 and $4.40. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back to Brent."

Can you give us a sense of what would prompt maybe a different turn into -- than what you're doing? And then along those same lines, what are you hearing as you speak to your shareholders?

So look, I think that -- let me answer your questions perhaps in reverse order, if that's acceptable. In terms of the shareholder engagement both the management team and our Board did, which was significant over the last few months, I think there is a common theme from our shareholders, which is a frustration in the performance of the stock price. Let me be clear. I share that frustration. I understand that frustration. I'm a very large shareholder relative to my own personal holdings in Allergan, and most of the management team is likewise situated. And so that is something that was loud and clear, and we need to make sure that we do everything we can to unlock value and create a better shareholder return for our shareholders over the long term. And so that is clearly, I think, the top issue we heard, and we heard it loud and clear, and our Board heard it loud and clear. And I think that was a very constructive and positive experience for our Board members to hear from probably close to 50 different shareholders that they engaged with. So I think that's pretty straightforward. 
I think in terms of prompting us to do something different, the way I would come at it, I'd say, it's multifactorial. We have a very experienced and engaged Board. We also have a refreshed Board with several new members with lots of different experiences in this industry and in other businesses. And I would say that given the frustration on shareholder return, given the strength of the core business, given the pipeline that we have and then put that in the context of the operating environment, the political environment, the regulatory environment, the global environment, we continue to look at what are the ways that we can unlock value. And I would say that's something that we do regularly and continuously. And now I would say with a sense of urgency. And so the Board is on it. The Board is engaged and stay tuned."

So regarding Rapastinel and 241751, I can make a few comments about breast implants and perhaps Bill, from a commercial perspective, will talk about that mainly. So look, the -- with Rapastinel, we have the positive Phase II study and then we performed the Phase III programs in adjunctive MDD using once-a-week dosing. And we know that with ketamine, another NMDA receptor modulator, that such a regimen can be effective in depression. Now clearly, when we look at animal models of the depression or psychiatric disorders, Rapastinel and 751 are incredibly effective in those models. Having said that, some very recent data has shown that more frequent dosing or the more frequent the dosing in those animal models, the greater the efficacy. And that holds true both for Rapastinel and for AGN-241751. But clearly, I don't know the answer yet. But with 241751, because it's an oral compound, we can test and are testing more frequent dosing. So by analogy, with the animal data, that may give us a greater chance of showing efficacy with this mechanism of action because 751 has the same mechanism as Rapastinel. And we plan to have data with 751 by the end of 2019. 
Yes, regarding breast implants, I was present at the advisory -- the 2-day advisory committee that the FDA held recently. And recently, the FDA told us that based on that advisory committee and their other analyses that they -- that the textured breast implants, which was the main topic of discussion there, will remain on the market, although they are going to discuss labeling and enhancing communication with the various manufacturers. Of course, the majority of implants that are used in the U.S. are, in fact, smooth implants. There will be a discussion with the FDA about derma matrices, but that's a different topic. Of course, conversations around the world are taking place with various regulatory authorities about textured implants. And perhaps Bill could pick it up from here."

For the purposes of projections, the International business has been appropriately adjusted for our 2019 outlook and beyond. And as it relates to sales in the United States, even the context of the actions the FDA is contemplating, I expect that to be a stable business.

So look, you're exactly right, Chris. I do get the question quite a bit around split. And in fact, I think I very publicly and very clearly addressed this at a Leerink conference a couple of months ago. And let me just reiterate what I said there, which still holds true is I've always remained open-minded and the Board remains open-minded to that idea if we believe it's something that creates long-term value. There are a number of factors that go into looking at that. One you just said, which is the sustained valuation discount is something that's clearly important. We also tend to look at some of the other important issues, which I mentioned at Leerink and at many other times, like scale, particularly outside the U.S. And that's something that's improving as that business grows. We clearly need to protect BOTOX as a brand, which is both a aesthetic and therapeutic product and one of the most important brands in the Allergan family. So that's something that we would have to clearly be thoughtful and meticulous in terms of how we thought about that. And then scale of R&D as the science of Medical Aesthetics is clearly moving in the direction of biopharmaceutical R&D versus just medical device R&D. And so those are just a few of the things that we tend to look at outside of financial complexities and other things like that. But look, everything is on the table. I said everything was on the table. Our Board will regularly and actively evaluate these types of decisions. And I think I also made clear in my answer to Ken, they're going to do that with a sense of urgency. So stay tuned, and we'll see where we go."

As it relates to CoolSculpting, first, this is getting a lot of attention right now, as you can imagine. I'll tell you that the problem we're facing is not due to market saturation, it's not due to customer satisfaction and it's not due to competition. And I think that's important to recognize. We are managing, I think, 2 issues in addition to my earlier remarks. The first one is when we acquired ZELTIQ, we knew that we had what I would describe as an innovation or a new product cycle gap when we guided into this '18 to '19 period. In other words, if you go back between 2013 and 2017 over a 5-year period, there were 6 different applicators launched for CoolSculpting. And each applicator opened up a different area of the body and sustained a pretty robust growth rate over that period. It's been fairly quiet for the past 18 to 24 months, and I think we've fixed that right now. We're going to launch CoolTone at the end of '19, and then we're set up for 2 additional system upgrades over the next 2 to 3 years. Think iPhone 8, 9 and X. 
The second issue is that after several years on the market, we're dealing, to be fair, with a different type of consumer. We've essentially got to all of the early adopters. And now we're working on a group of late adopters, and they're -- they have more questions and they're somewhat more cautious. And so we've really shifted our focus from, as I mentioned, practices and system placements to a more consumer model. I think the outlook for the business is still very positive. You have to recognize that CoolSculpting has a long runway. And if we're successful with CoolTone, next-generation CoolSculpting and then with our skin-tightening technology over the next, let's call it, 2 to 3 years, and we're successful both domestically and internationally, this business should reach our initial expectations or come very close."

So look, let me start by saying that R&D and innovation is the lifeblood of Allergan as it is for any biopharmaceutical company. It's important for us, and I think just -- Bill just kind of explained it in the context of CoolSculpting to have continuous innovation to drive growth. That holds true across the entire portfolio. When we look at the therapeutics side of our business, which is important, clearly, we're focused on 4 therapeutic approvals and launches over the next 18 months that are really important for us, whether that be a bipolar depression for VRAYLAR, ubrogepant, abicipar, Bimatoprost SR. But as David mentioned, we also have 10 Phase III programs continuing to advance whether that be relamorelin or brazikumab or a variety of other things that are listed on the chart in the presentation. 
I think when we look in the earlier pipeline, we absolutely need to continue to look to enhance and increase our opportunities to bring real innovation to patients. Some of that will come through from some of the collaborations we've already established. So for example, we have an IND that was accepted or approved related to our partnership with Editas for Leber disease, and we'll -- we expect to enroll patients later this year. Our first IND with the microbiome in our assembly was also approved, and we'll start to enroll patients as well, but we are enrolling patients already in that one. And we have a variety of other partnerships like that as well that will continue to throw off development candidates. So there are a lot of activity, and we constantly look for new science and new partnerships and new collaborations. 
And in fact, to the second part of your question, upgrading skills is a continuous process. We are always looking to enhance our capabilities in R&D and in science. And in fact, we announced last quarter or right around the JPMorgan conference, I believe, that we were opening up our office in Boston and moving our Head of External Science and Innovation to Boston and building out and hiring and recruiting in the Kendall Square area new science and -- scientists and capabilities. And so that is actively underway, and we believe that's the right place to have an additional office for R&D organization. Now we are in Southern California. We're in South San Francisco. We're in New Jersey. We're in the U.K. and we're in Boston as well as a few other places. And so I think that we've got a good spread, and we're committed to recruiting the best scientists and the best minds that we can to supplement our thinking. Do you want to talk, Bill?"

I would just say that I think price discounting is tempting, but it can be a trap long term. It's a slippery slope. It lessens the perceived value of a product, it cuts into profits, cuts into customer service, cuts into R&D. The way we think about is, the value of our products and services right now exceed the prices that we charge. And if we don't believe that at some point in the future, we'd make an adjustment. I think the focus here has got to be on attracting new users to the category and introducing products that improve outcomes for those consumers. And that's where we stand right now.

Thanks, Jason. Look, yes, we're absolutely committed to the 5%. I think some reasons to feel confident about that are the nine consecutive quarters of core business growth, which is now 90% of Allergan, and I think will ultimately become most of Allergan over time; areas like facial injectables that grew 13% this quarter; looking at products like VRAYLAR and even ZENPEP and VIIBRYD that are growing above expectations; we saw Lo LO and OZURDEX strong at roughly 10% or better year-over-year. And so those are reasons to be confident in that core business. 
Clearly, as we look at the back part of that guidance, the pipeline needs to participate to enable us to reach that target. And Rapastinel was, frankly, not a big part of that guidance. It was further out. So it really doesn't impact our thinking there. ESMYA did. And we've already incorporated that into our thinking, but we've seen improvements in other parts of the pipeline, right? So they're all risk-adjusted when we made the comment. We know that the profile of ubrogepant looks very positive, and the risk-benefit there looks very positive. Obviously, we need an FDA approval, but that looks good. Bim SR had surprisingly positive results as well. And that is being filed in the first half of this year. Abicipar is the only true 12-week anti-VEGF. While we're improving the inflammation, we still believe that could be a very nice product in the forecast. And so that's moving forward. International growth continues to look solid and will be a big contributor. And so bear in mind, our outlook was adjusted for some of the asset sales, and so we continue to exceed expectations in the delivery of our quarters. And that, I think, all those reasons combined, both positive and negative, give us reason to be confident."

Now back to ubrogepant. The cases are primarily diagnosed based on creatine phosphokinase released from skeletal muscle plus patient history discussions. When we're talking about the incidence of rhabdomyolysis in the ubrogepant studies, you've got to look at, of course, the totality of evidence. And we do see cases of exercise-induced rhabdomyolysis in placebo standard-of-care cases as well as in the ubrogepant arms, rates differ in arms between studies.

Bill, CoolSculpting, I understand that the argument you're making around look, we're going to push the product. I guess the question is, is this part of delivering the expected results from patients who are already using it? And I was wondering if you might have some data about attrition rates and -- especially in comparison to attrition rates on fillers or on BOTOX. That is, are we seeing the same kind of repeat use rates from even the early adopters of CoolSculpting as we see from the more established products where benefit is established? And second, back to the General Medicine's business. It seems that the pricing you're obtaining, just looking year-over-year for the Eye Care products or the IBD products are a little bit lower than they were in 1Q '18. And just talking to the peers, it seems there is more of an effort to go ahead and press down some of those older category for discounts. So when we think about kind of like the pricing you obtained from those areas of older products going forward, should we assume kind of a small negative number in terms of pricing year-over-year? Or should we still expect flat to slightly up?"

As it relates to CoolSculpting, I think consumer satisfaction with the procedure is high. A couple of points about that. If you take a look at RealSelf and you look at the Worth It rating for CoolSculpting, it's roughly 78%. Now that trades a little bit lower than a facial injectable, but that's not surprising for a body contouring procedure. Satisfaction levels will trade lower if a patient does not receive an adequate number of treatment cycles. Right now, that number is at roughly 5. Ideally, if you talk to most plastic surgeons, it should be 6 to 8. And so with adequate treatments in a given area of the body, the satisfaction for CoolSculpting is right where it has been and where we expect it to be. As it relates to repeat visits, this is -- there isn't a reoccurring revenue stream. In other words, once someone receives their 6 to 8 cycles for a given problem area, then it's, in many respects, a permanent solution. And so I think that deals with the CoolSculpting question. I would also say that when you take a look at CoolTone and the next-generation CoolSculpting system as well as the skin-tightening solution, each one of those should enable plastic surgeons and derms and other providers to improve outcomes for patients. 
As it relates to the General Medicine business, I think you have it right. I think about price, whether it be for LINZESS or for RESTASIS or for our U.S. glaucoma business, as being neutral and there could be some downward pressure on it. I think that's the reality of the health care system right now. I think the positive in all this for us is that prescription demand for these businesses -- obviously, LINZESS is very solid and the product's on the market for 7 years now, and prescriptions were up 10% and units were up 14%. As it relates to the more established businesses like RESTASIS or glaucoma, demand is relatively stable. And so you'll see a little bit more price pressure read through to the sales line on those businesses. But I think your outlook is right."

I mentioned in my remarks, Brilliant Distinctions is a real asset for us. I would describe it as the moat around BOTOX. We added 250,000 members in one quarter, which is the best quarter we've had in the history of the program. The digital venture spotlight, which is an online destination for all things beauty, we had 1.5 million visitors to it in the first year. That number will approach 2 million very, very shortly. We're running a Mother's Day promotion, which I mentioned. And there was a sign-up opportunity for a sweepstakes. I won't get into the details, but we had roughly 50,000 women sign up in roughly a week. And so I think all of the digital and consumer advertising work that we're doing is attracting new consumers into practices for plastic surgeons and dermatologist, which is ultimately what our aim is."

Good morning and thank you for joining us on our call today. 
Our first quarter results reflected ongoing strength of our core business across our 4 key therapeutic areas: Medical Aesthetics, Eye Care, CNS and GI. This represented the ninth consecutive quarter of core business growth. The growth prospects of these businesses remain strong driven by product line depth, new product flow, commercial expertise and a robust pipeline with 5 potential FDA approvals and new product launches anticipated over the next 18 months. As a management team and Board, we are focused on strengthening and growing our business while executing disciplined capital allocation and returning capital to shareholders. At the same time, we are realistic about the challenges and risks facing the business and the work we need to continue to create value for our shareholders, customers, patients and colleagues. We understand that we need to continue to earn their trust for our performance commercially, operationally and in R&D. And we are committed to acting with urgency to do just that. 
Now let me turn to the quarter's results on Slide 5. We had a good start to the year with continued growth of our core business, which was up 4.4% year-over-year. Against the backdrop of continuing product LOEs, our total revenue was stable, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. We made progress on building several important brands, which we expect will be key drivers of long-term growth. There are many standouts in the first quarter such as BOTOX, JUVÉDERM and VRAYLAR as well as some brands, which we are working on further bolstering. Bill will address these in greater detail. In R&D, we believe we are well positioned with 5 anticipated FDA approvals over the next 18 months or so. They include: cariprazine for bipolar depression where we expect a regulatory decision later this month; ubrogepant for the acute treatment of migraine where we expect the regulatory decision in December; CoolTone, a new muscle-toning system as part of CoolSculpting family, which we expect to launch towards the end of the year; Bimatoprost SR, which is a dropless glaucoma therapy where we plan to make a regulatory submission in the first half of the year; and abicipar for wet age-related macular degeneration where we plan to make a regulatory submission also in the first half of this year. 
In the first quarter, we reported top line results from the Phase III Rapastinel program, and we were deeply disappointed that these studies were not successful. Our commitment to bring new medicines to patients in need remains unchanged, and our pipeline supports this commitment. Across our 4 key therapeutic areas, we now have 46 programs on the pharmaceutical side and 30 programs on the device side. I am happy to report that we achieved solid results in the first quarter while remaining disciplined and shareholder-friendly in terms of capital allocation. You will hear more about this from Matt. 
Slide 6 provides an overview of the key drivers of our financial results in the first quarter of 2019 and illustrates that our core business, accounting for about 90% of total revenues, reached $3.2 billion. This continued strength of our core business, together with our emerging pipeline, positions us well for 2019 and beyond. 
Slide 7 provides more focused look at our core business, which is comprised of promoted brands and brands with ongoing exclusivity. The first quarter of 2019 is the ninth consecutive quarter where our core business has delivered consistent year-over-year growth. Since 2016, our core business has grown by over $3 billion and currently accounts for 90% of our revenues. In 2017, our core business made up 79% of our revenues. And in 2018, it accounted for 87% of our revenues. 
Looking ahead, we expect to work our way through the impact of the LOEs and reach a place where our core business generates almost all of our revenues. Before I turn the call over to Bill, I wanted to take a moment to comment on the results of our recent Annual Shareholder Meeting and the extensive discussions we as Allergan's leadership team and Board of Directors have had with our shareholders in the weeks and months leading up to it. 
Let me start by saying that I take seriously the opinion of our shareholders, including David Tepper. We have benefited from the candid and constructive shareholder feedback, and I share their desire to create more value at Allergan. Our focus and interests are 100% aligned with those of our shareholders. We have been on this transformation journey for almost 3 years since the sale of our generics business. Since then, we have worked to grow our key products at depth and breadth to our pipeline and build scale to compete in 4 therapeutic areas. I share in the disappointment that the value creation has not materialized yet. But when I look at the strength of our core business, the potential of our pipeline and the dedication of our team and Board, I have great confidence that it will. 
So how are we going to do that? First, we will continue to focus on growing our core business and realizing value through the pipeline. That means keeping our teams focused, delivering excellent service to our customers and driving key R&D milestones. The sense of urgency to create value is high, and the Board is actively and continuously reviewing alternative avenues that could unlock value in the nearer term. I assure you that the Board, management team and I recognize the urgency, and we will take decisive action to drive value-enhancing opportunities. 
Now let me turn the call over to Bill."

Slide 9 is a product-level sales analysis for the first quarter ranked in terms of sales growth versus prior year.

Slide 9 is a product-level sales analysis for the first quarter ranked in terms of sales growth versus prior year. We had a strong start to the year posting double-digit growth rates for several of our major products. BOTOX Cosmetic, VRAYLAR, VIIBRYD, ZENPEP, JUVÉDERM, OZURDEX and Lo LOESTRIN were standouts in the quarter. Other key brands, Natrelle implants, ALLODERM and CoolSculpting, were down versus prior year, which I'll discuss shortly. 
Overall, our core business performance was solid, and we anticipate growth strengthening throughout the year. At the bottom of the graph and as expected, total sales growth was impacted by products already facing loss of exclusivity as well as the RESTASIS sales decline ahead of anticipated generic competition. 
Now I'll touch on our key therapeutic areas starting with our largest, Medical Aesthetics. Globally, sales for our facial injectable line, BOTOX and JUVÉDERM, were up 13% versus prior year. Demand was strong domestically and internationally, and demand was broad-based across both the aesthetic dermatology and plastic surgery segments. 
Turning to BOTOX. I'll talk about our results, the outlook for the market and our toxin development programs. U.S. BOTOX sales were up 17% and international up 8%. Sales for BOTOX in the United States were powered by a significantly larger consumer activation program with advertising, digital and PR efforts, an expanded sales force to reach more practices and achieving higher levels of customer service and a first quarter promotional offer for top customers. 
Additionally, we added 0.25 million people to our Brilliant Distinctions loyalty program in the first quarter, which is the best quarter in the history of the program. We've added 1 million in the last 12 months for a total of 6 million members. This is relevant because 67% of our BOTOX consumers are BD members, and they visit their practices 23% more often and spend 36% more per year than nonmembers. It's an important asset for customers and for Allergan. 
Now for a few comments about the aesthetics market. The prospects for growth here are excellent. There is both a youth movement and a prevention movement underway, and Allergan has launched 3 digital ventures in partnership with aesthetic practices to attract new consumers, including Allergan Data Labs, which is a data science and digital marketing group now fully operational in Irvine. They're launching the largest digital marketing campaign ever for BOTOX on Mother's Day, which we expect will attract tens of thousands of new users and loyalty members. 
In terms of competition, it's the reality of a growing market. Aesthetics has never been a 1-product market and never will be, but it is an efficient market, which means in the end, it will likely support 3 products, not 4, 5 or 6. Our strategy, like that of our customers, is to compete on quality, innovation and customer service, not on price. That is the only sustainable strategy in our view. When it comes to neurotoxins, customers and patients are more outcomes- and service-sensitive than price-sensitive. We are well positioned to defend this business. 
Finally, on the product development front, we're developing 1 of 2 types of products, products that either help providers deliver even better aesthetic outcomes or products that attract new consumers. Right now, we're advancing new indications for BOTOX, masseter and platysma, a new prefilled syringe for BOTOX and 3 completely novel toxins, including a liquid, a rapid-acting short duration and a long-acting, which are in various stages of development. 
Turning to JUVÉDERM. Fillers have been a step change in aesthetics. They have given providers the ability to volumize, lift and shape. JUVÉDERM is the #1 filler in the world. Sales internationally increased 18% with exceptional performance in Asia Pacific, Middle East, Africa and Europe. New product launches, including VOLUX last month in Europe and new consumer programs, are fueling demand around the world. 
In the U.S., sales were up 6% versus prior year. We expect sales growth for the year to be higher than the first quarter, which was impacted by strong buying in the prior fourth quarter of 2018. For reference, fourth quarter sales in '18 were up 14% last year. 
Turning to Slide 11, CoolSculpting. Our first quarter sales, of course, were below expectations, off 4% versus prior year, due to consumer demand and a reduction in system sales in the United States. We have a lot of work to do in this business in the short term, especially in the U.S., which I'll talk about shortly. Long term, the outlook for CoolSculpting is still positive for 2 reasons. First, we're set up to launch 3 new CoolSculpting systems in the next 2 to 3 years, which will improve outcomes for the procedure and underlying demand. And second, we've only scratched the surface of the body contouring market with an estimated penetration rate of less than 10%. There's still a large untapped pool of consumers to reach and convert, and we expect sales for the year to be up 5% to 10% globally despite our first quarter performance. 
We had several priorities when we acquired CoolSculpting. They were: expand the U.S. installed base, which is now 50% larger than it was 2 years ago; reorganize the international business; accelerate the development of new CoolSculpting technologies; and drive consumer demand. In roughly 2 years, we've achieved 3 of the 4. Right now, more focus is needed on consumer marketing and activation. We have exceptionally high-awareness levels. We have 7 million consumers visiting our website, an installed base totaling 4,000 accounts and 6,000 systems. So the foundation here is solid, but our consumer conversion rate is low. We're taking a number of measures to fix that, including Allergan Data Labs is launching a new digital initiative to drive website traffic conversion with the first-ever freecycle promotion. We're also partnering with high-end health clubs around the country and conducting marketing events at luxury malls and wellness centers to move consumers from awareness to usage. We're changing the approach here from a focus on not only practices and systems, but also consumers. Two other important sources of future growth for this business in '19 are International and CoolTone. In International, we've restructured the business transitioning from a distributor model to a direct promotion model. We're now doing business directly in 69 countries and have 3,000 systems placed around the world. Next, CoolTone will launch in late 2019. This is a muscle-toning system that is complementary and will be marketed alongside CoolSculpting. We'll be taking orders for CoolTone by midyear and shipping equipment in early Q4. Now with any launch, current capital sales slow as providers want to see new package offers -- what new package offers might look like. We expect capital sales to rebound upon the launch of CoolTone. 
ALLODERM sales in the first quarter were impacted by a supply constraint for donor material. The supply situation has stabilized and is expected to improve throughout the year. Sales growth of this business should trade in the mid-single digits. Sales for our Natrelle line of breast implants have been impacted by regulatory changes related to our textured implants internationally. Our 2019 sales outlook anticipated these changes. In the U.S., FDA conducted a public hearing on breast implant safety. David will talk more about this shortly. Note that in the U.S., over 90% of our business is smooth implants.
Turning to Slide 12 and CNS. Sales for BOTOX were at expectations, up 6% for the first quarter. The year-over-year comparison was impacted by the fact that the first quarter of '19 had 2 fewer selling days than the first quarter of '18. Adjusting for quarterly selling days, BOTOX growth was in the high single digits. In terms of the market, the migraine prevention market is 10% to 15% larger than it was a year ago. Our share of new chronic migraine patients is 47%, remains stable. We estimate that only 2% of CGRP patients were switched from BOTOX and combination use is limited. As we have said before, we expect the growth rate in 2019 will be in the mid- to high single digits. 
Sales for VRAYLAR in Q1 '19 totaled $144 million, up 70%. This product continues to exceed expectations on almost all metrics, including prescribers, prescription levels and formulary coverage rates. The growth catalyst for VRAYLAR in 2019 is the anticipated new indication for bipolar depression, which is currently under review at the FDA. The target audience and detailing levels for VRAYLAR will be almost doubled in May to cover not only psychiatrists but also primary care physicians. 
Turning to Slide 13 on GI. Underlying prescription demand growth for LINZESS in the first quarter was in the double digits. This was offset by a lower average selling price and trade buying patterns resulting in a net revenue gain of 1% versus prior year. Sales for ZENPEP were strong, up 19%. 
Turning now to Eye Care. Our glaucoma business was impacted by pricing headwinds in the United States and the impact of trade buying patterns internationally. We expect this franchise to be stable for the year. OZURDEX sales increased 10%. Our supply situation has improved significantly, and we expect all markets to be fully restocked in the second quarter. RESTASIS prescription ban -- demand was relatively stable year-over-year. This was offset by a lower average selling price. Sales orders for RESTASIS MDPF have been replaced by the RESTASIS single-unit vial as we work through a backorder situation, which we expect to resolve by the second half. 
Finally, turning to Slide 14. Our International sales totaled $802 million, up 1% versus prior year. Excluding the impact of Natrelle implants, sales were up 5.2%. The growth drivers were JUVÉDERM, CoolSculpting, BOTOX Cosmetic and BOTOX Therapeutic. The Asia Pacific/Middle East/Africa region continues to be the most important growth driver in our International business. In the quarter, LACAN sales were further impacted by trade buying patterns for our Eye Care business and lower Fibristal sales and generic RESTASIS in Canada. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to David."

We made significant pipeline progress in the first quarter of the year. Before I talk about progress, I will begin with the readout from our Phase III program Rapastinel as an adjunctive treatment in major depressive disorder. I was very disappointed by these results. Despite this setback, our commitment to bringing innovative medicines to patients with unmet needs in mental health remains unchanged. We expect to present detailed data from the Rapastinel program at an upcoming medical conference. We still have 2 studies with Rapastinel ongoing, one in suicidality and the other in monotherapy. We will perform an interim analysis of these studies to check for futility, and we will see these data later this year. 
Turning to Slide 16, which highlights the major upcoming catalysts for the year. As you heard from Brent, we expect approval of 5 major programs over the course of the next 18 months. Most near term is the anticipated approval of cariprazine for bipolar depression where we have an FDA action date later this month. As recently announced, our NDA has been filed for ubrogepant, our oral CGRP inhibitor for the acute treatment of migraine, and we have an action date in December. Also within CNS, we expect to report in the second half of the year top line results from the ongoing Phase II study of AGN-241751, our oral NMDA modulator. This agent has the same mechanism of action as Rapastinel. The oral formulation allows us to evaluate the safety and efficacy of more frequent dosing. 
Turning to Eye Care. we recently reported safety data from the MAPLE Study for abicipar in neurovascular age-related macular degeneration. Data from this study showed a decrease in the rates of inflammation compared to that previously reported in the Phase III CEDAR and SEQUOIA studies. We view this decrease in inflammation rates as step in the right direction, and we will continue to work on improving the formulation. We expect to make a regulatory submission in the U.S. in the first half of the year, followed by a submission in the EU in the second half of the year. We also expect to make a regulatory submission of bimatoprost sustained-release in the U.S. for the treatment of glaucoma in the first half of 2019. In Medical Aesthetics, we are excited to be launching CoolTone, a muscle-toning system utilizing high-frequency electromagnetic stimulation aimed at fast-twitch skeletal muscle. In addition, versions 3.0 and 4.0 of CoolSculpting are expected within the next 2 to 3 years. 
Slide 17 provides a summary of the key events we anticipate over the next 18 months. We continue to advance the rest of our mid- to late-stage pipeline according to our targets and expectations. 
Turning to Slide 18. Our pharmaceutical pipeline has 46 programs in various stages of development with 2 that are currently under regulatory review and 10 programs in Phase III development. Our development programs continue to remain aligned with our time lines with the exception of brazikumab. This IL-23 monoclonal antibody is being developed in a competitive space with a large number of competing trials. 
Similarly, as outlined on Slide 19, we continue to develop our device pipeline with 30 programs in development. This will continue to drive innovation within Medical Aesthetics. This is a rich development portfolio in line with our leadership in this area. And as such, we have more than doubled our R&D investments in devices in Medical Aesthetics over the last 2 years. In the quarter, the FDA held a 2-day advisory committee to discuss the benefits and risks of breast implants and dermal matrices. The agency recently announced that textured breast implants will remain on the market and are considering actions to be taken to improve product labeling and communication. We're excited about the future of our R&D organization. As always, I thank my colleagues in R&D for their hard work as well as the investigators and particularly, the patients who are participating in our clinical trials. 
And now I will turn the call over to Matt."
36478,609716141,1732129,"Allergan plc, Q1 2019 Earnings Call, May 07, 2019",2019-05-07,"Earnings Calls","Allergan plc","Executives","Thank you, David. Looking now at the key financial highlights on Page 21. As Brent mentioned earlier, our core business continues to be strong, and we're delivering on our key financial commitments through the first quarter of 2019. So starting at the t",1576,"Thank you, David. 
Looking now at the key financial highlights on Page 21. As Brent mentioned earlier, our core business continues to be strong, and we're delivering on our key financial commitments through the first quarter of 2019. So starting at the top of the page, net revenues in the quarter were $3.6 billion, flat year-over-year on a constant currency basis, which means the 2% decline in reported revenues was due solely to foreign exchange translation. The highlight of the quarter was the solid performance of the promoted brands with ongoing exclusivity, which was up 5.3%. This entirely offset the 27% decline in LOEs and divestitures, which now includes the generic entry of Canasa. Our core business, which comprises 90% of total revenues, grew 4.4% at constant currency and was actually over 1 percentage point higher at 5.5% excluding the impact of regulatory changes in the international textured implant market. 
A few things to bear in mind as we think about 2019 revenues. First, from a phasing perspective, our first quarter tends to be our seasonally slowest quarter revenue-wise historically. And second, as we stated when we issued 2019 guidance, we expect revenue growth rates to accelerate in the remaining quarters of 2019 as we annualize the back half 2018 issues related to the OZURDEX recall and ALLODERM donor supply. 
Now turning to margins. Non-GAAP gross margin grew 50 basis points to 86.7% primarily driven by favorable product mix. Operating margins, however, declined 270 basis points to 45.2%, which was driven by 2 key factors. First, in sales and marketing, we increased expenditures in our Facial Aesthetics business, and we bolstered our commercial footprint internationally, especially in Asia Pacific. And second, we increased R&D spending to support ongoing late-stage clinical development programs. 
Now turning to the lower section of the slide. Non-GAAP performance net income per share was $3.79, representing 1% growth year-on-year versus the first quarter of 2018, which reflects the impact of share buybacks during 2018 and the first quarter of this year. 
Slide 22 provides an overview of our P&L line items for the quarter, most of which I've already discussed. I would, however, like to highlight 2 important line items, our net interest expense and our tax rate, both of which are meaningfully favorable to prior year, and this was contemplated in our 2019 guidance. 
Now I'd like to discuss the significant GAAP accounting matter and provide the appropriate context. Each quarter, we monitor goodwill and intangibles for indicators of impairment. In the first quarter, we recorded a $2.5 billion goodwill impairment in our General Medicine Reporting Unit primarily related to the failure of Rapastinel in Phase III clinical trials and, to a lesser extent, timing true-ups of other R&D programs. Bear in mind that this goodwill impairment in our Gen Med reporting unit is not related to the acquisition price of Naurex as this was 100% expensed as IT R&D at the time of the acquisition in 2015. So rather, this impairment is a consequence of the removal of future anticipated cash flows related to Rapastinel and the timing true-ups of other programs from our long-term financial projections. This, in turn, lowered the fair value of the Gen Med reporting unit as of March 31 below book value. While the strong performance we've seen across other parts of Allergan support increased fair values, those increases are in other reporting units, which under GAAP did not impact the goodwill impairment test of the Gen Med business. 
Turning to Slide 23 now and returning to the quarter's results. Here we see an overview of our financial results by reporting segment. U.S. Specialized Therapeutics experienced a decline of 2.3% in revenues, which was driven by lower RESTASIS sales as well as the sale of our Med Derm business in 2018. Contribution margin was down 290 basis points driven by the revenue decline coupled with the increase in promotional spending in our Facial Aesthetics business. 
Looking at U.S. General Medicine. The segment grew 2.1% year-over-year. This was driven by double-digit growth across key brands, including VRAYLAR, VIIBRYD, Lo LOESTRIN and ZENPEP. This growth was offset by the continued impact of products facing LOEs, which, in this quarter, also includes the generic entry of Canasa. Contribution margin increased 90 basis points due to higher revenues and the benefit from lower promotional selling expenses resulting from the restructuring initiatives. 
And lastly, on International revenues. These grew 1% on a constant currency basis and was significantly impacted by foreign exchange translation. On a constant-currency basis and excluding the impact of the regulatory changes in the textured implant market, International revenues increased 5.2% year-over-year. Contribution margin declined 40 basis points due in part to the textured implant issue as well as increased investment into high-growth regions, especially Asia Pacific. 
Now turning to Slide 24. You can see our operating cash flow in the first quarter was strong at $1.2 billion, and this supports our 2019 guidance of $5 billion to $5.5 billion. Our priorities on capital allocation remain unchanged. First, reinvestment in our business for growth in our 4 key therapeutics areas. During the quarter, we acquired Envy Medical, which increases the breadth of our Medical Aesthetics offerings to now include skin resurfacing and dermal infusion; second, debt reduction, which is important in the context of the anticipated RESTASIS LOE; third, funding and prudently growing our dividend; and fourth, share buybacks as a means to manage earnings dilution that would result from asset sales or from long-term equity-based incentive plans. 
And as you can see on our capitalization table, we continue to work towards our capital allocation goals. We ended the quarter with $23.5 billion in total debt and $1.8 billion in cash and equivalents, which brings our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio to 2.8x as of March 31. Coming up in the second quarter, we have a scheduled debt maturity of approximately $800 million that we intend to retire using cash on hand and operating cash flow. We remain committed and on track to achieve our target net leverage ratio of 2.5x by the end of 2020, which would, of course, enable us to sustain our commitment to an investment-grade credit rating. 
With regard to share buybacks, we said on the last call that as part of our 2019 guidance, we intended to repurchase $800 million of shares during the year. We accomplished this entire amount in the first quarter, which completely utilizes the 2018 $2 billion share repurchase authorization. We have the 2019 $2 billion share authorization available to us. However, it's important to note that our revised guidance contemplates no further share repurchases during 2019. As previously mentioned, this assumption may change depending upon the progression of asset sales. 
Moving now to guidance on Page 25. We're revising guidance upward for 2019. So starting with net revenues, we're raising our full year outlook and now expect 2019 net revenues to be between $15.1 billion and $15.4 billion, $100 million higher and the low -- on the low and high end from the previously provided guidance of $15 billion to $15.3 billion. We now assume a mid-May LOE for RESTASIS, and the increase in revenue guidance is driven by the additional RESTASIS exclusivity. 
Our updated revenue guidance continues to contemplate strength in the core business, which is expected to grow at a rate similar to last year, in the mid- to high single-digit range. 
Additionally, we continue to incorporate headwinds previously discussed related to OZURDEX, textured implants, industry-wide pricing pressure and foreign exchange translation. And we believe our revised guidance is appropriately conservative across all these points. We continue to expect non-GAAP gross margins for the full year to be 85% to 85.5% based on our product mix and LOE assumptions, including the impact of generic RESTASIS. Our non-GAAP SG&A and R&D expense remains unchanged as we continue to invest in growth drivers for our key businesses and in advancing our clinical programs in development. Should there be a sustained benefit of incremental RESTASIS revenues versus our expectations, we would look at opportunities to reinvest a portion of these proceeds back into the business, and this would be similar to what we executed in 2018. 
Besides revenue, the only other guidance item that's changing is performance net income per share, which we're increasing from greater than or equal to $16.36 to greater than $16.55. As with revenue, this increase reflects the assumption of additional RESTASIS exclusivity to mid-May on top of solid core business performance, which is soundly in line with our expectations at this point. 
Now for reference, each additional month of RESTASIS exclusivity is estimated to add an incremental $60 million to $70 million in sales. Also, please note that our guidance does not include the impact of any significant asset divestitures. If or when we complete these, we will provide an update on the impact to our key financial metrics, including to non-GAAP performance net income per share. Until such time as there is a generic RESTASIS, we expect to provide quarterly financial guidance, both top and bottom line. With our seasonally slowest quarter of the year in Q1 now behind us, we are forecasting sequentially stronger top line performance for the remainder of the year. For the second quarter of 2019, we expect total reported net revenue between $3.85 billion and $4 billion and non-GAAP performance net income per share between $4.20 and $4.40. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back to Brent."

Can you give us a sense of what would prompt maybe a different turn into -- than what you're doing? And then along those same lines, what are you hearing as you speak to your shareholders?

So look, I think that -- let me answer your questions perhaps in reverse order, if that's acceptable. In terms of the shareholder engagement both the management team and our Board did, which was significant over the last few months, I think there is a common theme from our shareholders, which is a frustration in the performance of the stock price. Let me be clear. I share that frustration. I understand that frustration. I'm a very large shareholder relative to my own personal holdings in Allergan, and most of the management team is likewise situated. And so that is something that was loud and clear, and we need to make sure that we do everything we can to unlock value and create a better shareholder return for our shareholders over the long term. And so that is clearly, I think, the top issue we heard, and we heard it loud and clear, and our Board heard it loud and clear. And I think that was a very constructive and positive experience for our Board members to hear from probably close to 50 different shareholders that they engaged with. So I think that's pretty straightforward. 
I think in terms of prompting us to do something different, the way I would come at it, I'd say, it's multifactorial. We have a very experienced and engaged Board. We also have a refreshed Board with several new members with lots of different experiences in this industry and in other businesses. And I would say that given the frustration on shareholder return, given the strength of the core business, given the pipeline that we have and then put that in the context of the operating environment, the political environment, the regulatory environment, the global environment, we continue to look at what are the ways that we can unlock value. And I would say that's something that we do regularly and continuously. And now I would say with a sense of urgency. And so the Board is on it. The Board is engaged and stay tuned."

So regarding Rapastinel and 241751, I can make a few comments about breast implants and perhaps Bill, from a commercial perspective, will talk about that mainly. So look, the -- with Rapastinel, we have the positive Phase II study and then we performed the Phase III programs in adjunctive MDD using once-a-week dosing. And we know that with ketamine, another NMDA receptor modulator, that such a regimen can be effective in depression. Now clearly, when we look at animal models of the depression or psychiatric disorders, Rapastinel and 751 are incredibly effective in those models. Having said that, some very recent data has shown that more frequent dosing or the more frequent the dosing in those animal models, the greater the efficacy. And that holds true both for Rapastinel and for AGN-241751. But clearly, I don't know the answer yet. But with 241751, because it's an oral compound, we can test and are testing more frequent dosing. So by analogy, with the animal data, that may give us a greater chance of showing efficacy with this mechanism of action because 751 has the same mechanism as Rapastinel. And we plan to have data with 751 by the end of 2019. 
Yes, regarding breast implants, I was present at the advisory -- the 2-day advisory committee that the FDA held recently. And recently, the FDA told us that based on that advisory committee and their other analyses that they -- that the textured breast implants, which was the main topic of discussion there, will remain on the market, although they are going to discuss labeling and enhancing communication with the various manufacturers. Of course, the majority of implants that are used in the U.S. are, in fact, smooth implants. There will be a discussion with the FDA about derma matrices, but that's a different topic. Of course, conversations around the world are taking place with various regulatory authorities about textured implants. And perhaps Bill could pick it up from here."

And let me just reiterate what I said there, which still holds true is I've always remained open-minded and the Board remains open-minded to that idea if we believe it's something that creates long-term value. There are a number of factors that go into looking at that. One you just said, which is the sustained valuation discount is something that's clearly important. We also tend to look at some of the other important issues, which I mentioned at Leerink and at many other times, like scale, particularly outside the U.S. And that's something that's improving as that business grows. We clearly need to protect BOTOX as a brand, which is both a aesthetic and therapeutic product and one of the most important brands in the Allergan family. So that's something that we would have to clearly be thoughtful and meticulous in terms of how we thought about that. And then scale of R&D as the science of Medical Aesthetics is clearly moving in the direction of biopharmaceutical R&D versus just medical device R&D. And so those are just a few of the things that we tend to look at outside of financial complexities and other things like that. But look, everything is on the table. I said everything was on the table. Our Board will regularly and actively evaluate these types of decisions. And I think I also made clear in my answer to Ken, they're going to do that with a sense of urgency. So stay tuned, and we'll see where we go."

As it relates to CoolSculpting, first, this is getting a lot of attention right now, as you can imagine. I'll tell you that the problem we're facing is not due to market saturation, it's not due to customer satisfaction and it's not due to competition. And I think that's important to recognize. We are managing, I think, 2 issues in addition to my earlier remarks. The first one is when we acquired ZELTIQ, we knew that we had what I would describe as an innovation or a new product cycle gap when we guided into this '18 to '19 period. In other words, if you go back between 2013 and 2017 over a 5-year period, there were 6 different applicators launched for CoolSculpting. And each applicator opened up a different area of the body and sustained a pretty robust growth rate over that period. It's been fairly quiet for the past 18 to 24 months, and I think we've fixed that right now. We're going to launch CoolTone at the end of '19, and then we're set up for 2 additional system upgrades over the next 2 to 3 years. Think iPhone 8, 9 and X. 
The second issue is that after several years on the market, we're dealing, to be fair, with a different type of consumer. We've essentially got to all of the early adopters. And now we're working on a group of late adopters, and they're -- they have more questions and they're somewhat more cautious. And so we've really shifted our focus from, as I mentioned, practices and system placements to a more consumer model. I think the outlook for the business is still very positive. You have to recognize that CoolSculpting has a long runway. And if we're successful with CoolTone, next-generation CoolSculpting and then with our skin-tightening technology over the next, let's call it, 2 to 3 years, and we're successful both domestically and internationally, this business should reach our initial expectations or come very close."

So look, let me start by saying that R&D and innovation is the lifeblood of Allergan as it is for any biopharmaceutical company. It's important for us, and I think just -- Bill just kind of explained it in the context of CoolSculpting to have continuous innovation to drive growth. That holds true across the entire portfolio. When we look at the therapeutics side of our business, which is important, clearly, we're focused on 4 therapeutic approvals and launches over the next 18 months that are really important for us, whether that be a bipolar depression for VRAYLAR, ubrogepant, abicipar, Bimatoprost SR. But as David mentioned, we also have 10 Phase III programs continuing to advance whether that be relamorelin or brazikumab or a variety of other things that are listed on the chart in the presentation. 
I think when we look in the earlier pipeline, we absolutely need to continue to look to enhance and increase our opportunities to bring real innovation to patients. Some of that will come through from some of the collaborations we've already established. So for example, we have an IND that was accepted or approved related to our partnership with Editas for Leber disease, and we'll -- we expect to enroll patients later this year. Our first IND with the microbiome in our assembly was also approved, and we'll start to enroll patients as well, but we are enrolling patients already in that one. And we have a variety of other partnerships like that as well that will continue to throw off development candidates. So there are a lot of activity, and we constantly look for new science and new partnerships and new collaborations. 
And in fact, to the second part of your question, upgrading skills is a continuous process. We are always looking to enhance our capabilities in R&D and in science. And in fact, we announced last quarter or right around the JPMorgan conference, I believe, that we were opening up our office in Boston and moving our Head of External Science and Innovation to Boston and building out and hiring and recruiting in the Kendall Square area new science and -- scientists and capabilities. And so that is actively underway, and we believe that's the right place to have an additional office for R&D organization. Now we are in Southern California. We're in South San Francisco. We're in New Jersey. We're in the U.K. and we're in Boston as well as a few other places. And so I think that we've got a good spread, and we're committed to recruiting the best scientists and the best minds that we can to supplement our thinking. Do you want to talk, Bill?"

I think that as it relates to the aesthetics market and pricing, I think it's a good question. This market has and I think will continue to trade on innovation and customer service. As you know, it's on a very, very solid growth trajectory. It's hard to predict what some of the other companies might do. I would just say that I think price discounting is tempting, but it can be a trap long term. It's a slippery slope. It lessens the perceived value of a product, it cuts into profits, cuts into customer service, cuts into R&D. The way we think about is, the value of our products and services right now exceed the prices that we charge. And if we don't believe that at some point in the future, we'd make an adjustment. I think the focus here has got to be on attracting new users to the category and introducing products that improve outcomes for those consumers. And that's where we stand right now. I think the business is in great shape as we head into the next several quarters of 2019."

Thanks, Jason. Look, yes, we're absolutely committed to the 5%. I think some reasons to feel confident about that are the nine consecutive quarters of core business growth, which is now 90% of Allergan, and I think will ultimately become most of Allergan over time; areas like facial injectables that grew 13% this quarter; looking at products like VRAYLAR and even ZENPEP and VIIBRYD that are growing above expectations; we saw Lo LO and OZURDEX strong at roughly 10% or better year-over-year. And so those are reasons to be confident in that core business. 
Clearly, as we look at the back part of that guidance, the pipeline needs to participate to enable us to reach that target. And Rapastinel was, frankly, not a big part of that guidance. It was further out. So it really doesn't impact our thinking there. ESMYA did. And we've already incorporated that into our thinking, but we've seen improvements in other parts of the pipeline, right? So they're all risk-adjusted when we made the comment. We know that the profile of ubrogepant looks very positive, and the risk-benefit there looks very positive. Obviously, we need an FDA approval, but that looks good. Bim SR had surprisingly positive results as well. And that is being filed in the first half of this year. Abicipar is the only true 12-week anti-VEGF. While we're improving the inflammation, we still believe that could be a very nice product in the forecast. And so that's moving forward. International growth continues to look solid and will be a big contributor. And so bear in mind, our outlook was adjusted for some of the asset sales, and so we continue to exceed expectations in the delivery of our quarters. And that, I think, all those reasons combined, both positive and negative, give us reason to be confident."

We increasingly see cases of exercise-induced rhabdomyolysis in our Phase I studies these days across-the-board, across multiple projects. I personally believe that's because people are doing more intense workout these days. And when I discuss with my colleagues, heads of R&D from other pharmaceutical companies, they see it as well. Now back to ubrogepant. The cases are primarily diagnosed based on creatine phosphokinase released from skeletal muscle plus patient history discussions. When we're talking about the incidence of rhabdomyolysis in the ubrogepant studies, you've got to look at, of course, the totality of evidence. And we do see cases of exercise-induced rhabdomyolysis in placebo standard-of-care cases as well as in the ubrogepant arms, rates differ in arms between studies. But across the whole ubrogepant database, the rates were 0.2% in placebo standard-of-care-treated individuals and 0.2% in ubrogepant-treated individuals."

Bill, CoolSculpting, I understand that the argument you're making around look, we're going to push the product. I guess the question is, is this part of delivering the expected results from patients who are already using it? And I was wondering if you might have some data about attrition rates and -- especially in comparison to attrition rates on fillers or on BOTOX. That is, are we seeing the same kind of repeat use rates from even the early adopters of CoolSculpting as we see from the more established products where benefit is established? And second, back to the General Medicine's business. It seems that the pricing you're obtaining, just looking year-over-year for the Eye Care products or the IBD products are a little bit lower than they were in 1Q '18. And just talking to the peers, it seems there is more of an effort to go ahead and press down some of those older category for discounts. So when we think about kind of like the pricing you obtained from those areas of older products going forward, should we assume kind of a small negative number in terms of pricing year-over-year? Or should we still expect flat to slightly up?"

As it relates to CoolSculpting, I think consumer satisfaction with the procedure is high. A couple of points about that. If you take a look at RealSelf and you look at the Worth It rating for CoolSculpting, it's roughly 78%. Now that trades a little bit lower than a facial injectable, but that's not surprising for a body contouring procedure. Satisfaction levels will trade lower if a patient does not receive an adequate number of treatment cycles. Right now, that number is at roughly 5. Ideally, if you talk to most plastic surgeons, it should be 6 to 8. And so with adequate treatments in a given area of the body, the satisfaction for CoolSculpting is right where it has been and where we expect it to be. As it relates to repeat visits, this is -- there isn't a reoccurring revenue stream. In other words, once someone receives their 6 to 8 cycles for a given problem area, then it's, in many respects, a permanent solution. And so I think that deals with the CoolSculpting question. I would also say that when you take a look at CoolTone and the next-generation CoolSculpting system as well as the skin-tightening solution, each one of those should enable plastic surgeons and derms and other providers to improve outcomes for patients. 
As it relates to the General Medicine business, I think you have it right. I think about price, whether it be for LINZESS or for RESTASIS or for our U.S. glaucoma business, as being neutral and there could be some downward pressure on it. I think that's the reality of the health care system right now. I think the positive in all this for us is that prescription demand for these businesses -- obviously, LINZESS is very solid and the product's on the market for 7 years now, and prescriptions were up 10% and units were up 14%. As it relates to the more established businesses like RESTASIS or glaucoma, demand is relatively stable. And so you'll see a little bit more price pressure read through to the sales line on those businesses. But I think your outlook is right."

I mentioned in my remarks, Brilliant Distinctions is a real asset for us. I would describe it as the moat around BOTOX. We added 250,000 members in one quarter, which is the best quarter we've had in the history of the program. The digital venture spotlight, which is an online destination for all things beauty, we had 1.5 million visitors to it in the first year. That number will approach 2 million very, very shortly. We're running a Mother's Day promotion, which I mentioned. And there was a sign-up opportunity for a sweepstakes.

Good morning and thank you for joining us on our call today. 
Our first quarter results reflected ongoing strength of our core business across our 4 key therapeutic areas: Medical Aesthetics, Eye Care, CNS and GI. This represented the ninth consecutive quarter of core business growth. The growth prospects of these businesses remain strong driven by product line depth, new product flow, commercial expertise and a robust pipeline with 5 potential FDA approvals and new product launches anticipated over the next 18 months. As a management team and Board, we are focused on strengthening and growing our business while executing disciplined capital allocation and returning capital to shareholders. At the same time, we are realistic about the challenges and risks facing the business and the work we need to continue to create value for our shareholders, customers, patients and colleagues. We understand that we need to continue to earn their trust for our performance commercially, operationally and in R&D. And we are committed to acting with urgency to do just that. 
Now let me turn to the quarter's results on Slide 5. We had a good start to the year with continued growth of our core business, which was up 4.4% year-over-year. Against the backdrop of continuing product LOEs, our total revenue was stable, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. We made progress on building several important brands, which we expect will be key drivers of long-term growth. There are many standouts in the first quarter such as BOTOX, JUVÉDERM and VRAYLAR as well as some brands, which we are working on further bolstering. Bill will address these in greater detail. In R&D, we believe we are well positioned with 5 anticipated FDA approvals over the next 18 months or so. They include: cariprazine for bipolar depression where we expect a regulatory decision later this month; ubrogepant for the acute treatment of migraine where we expect the regulatory decision in December; CoolTone, a new muscle-toning system as part of CoolSculpting family, which we expect to launch towards the end of the year; Bimatoprost SR, which is a dropless glaucoma therapy where we plan to make a regulatory submission in the first half of the year; and abicipar for wet age-related macular degeneration where we plan to make a regulatory submission also in the first half of this year. 
In the first quarter, we reported top line results from the Phase III Rapastinel program, and we were deeply disappointed that these studies were not successful. Our commitment to bring new medicines to patients in need remains unchanged, and our pipeline supports this commitment. Across our 4 key therapeutic areas, we now have 46 programs on the pharmaceutical side and 30 programs on the device side. I am happy to report that we achieved solid results in the first quarter while remaining disciplined and shareholder-friendly in terms of capital allocation. You will hear more about this from Matt. 
Slide 6 provides an overview of the key drivers of our financial results in the first quarter of 2019 and illustrates that our core business, accounting for about 90% of total revenues, reached $3.2 billion. This continued strength of our core business, together with our emerging pipeline, positions us well for 2019 and beyond. 
Slide 7 provides more focused look at our core business, which is comprised of promoted brands and brands with ongoing exclusivity. The first quarter of 2019 is the ninth consecutive quarter where our core business has delivered consistent year-over-year growth. Since 2016, our core business has grown by over $3 billion and currently accounts for 90% of our revenues. In 2017, our core business made up 79% of our revenues. And in 2018, it accounted for 87% of our revenues. 
Looking ahead, we expect to work our way through the impact of the LOEs and reach a place where our core business generates almost all of our revenues. Before I turn the call over to Bill, I wanted to take a moment to comment on the results of our recent Annual Shareholder Meeting and the extensive discussions we as Allergan's leadership team and Board of Directors have had with our shareholders in the weeks and months leading up to it. 
Let me start by saying that I take seriously the opinion of our shareholders, including David Tepper. We have benefited from the candid and constructive shareholder feedback, and I share their desire to create more value at Allergan. Our focus and interests are 100% aligned with those of our shareholders. We have been on this transformation journey for almost 3 years since the sale of our generics business. Since then, we have worked to grow our key products at depth and breadth to our pipeline and build scale to compete in 4 therapeutic areas. I share in the disappointment that the value creation has not materialized yet. But when I look at the strength of our core business, the potential of our pipeline and the dedication of our team and Board, I have great confidence that it will. 
So how are we going to do that? First, we will continue to focus on growing our core business and realizing value through the pipeline. That means keeping our teams focused, delivering excellent service to our customers and driving key R&D milestones. The sense of urgency to create value is high, and the Board is actively and continuously reviewing alternative avenues that could unlock value in the nearer term. I assure you that the Board, management team and I recognize the urgency, and we will take decisive action to drive value-enhancing opportunities. 
Now let me turn the call over to Bill."

Slide 9 is a product-level sales analysis for the first quarter ranked in terms of sales growth versus prior year. We had a strong start to the year posting double-digit growth rates for several of our major products. BOTOX Cosmetic, VRAY",1671,"Thanks, Brent. 
Slide 9 is a product-level sales analysis for the first quarter ranked in terms of sales growth versus prior year. We had a strong start to the year posting double-digit growth rates for several of our major products. BOTOX Cosmetic, VRAYLAR, VIIBRYD, ZENPEP, JUVÉDERM, OZURDEX and Lo LOESTRIN were standouts in the quarter. Other key brands, Natrelle implants, ALLODERM and CoolSculpting, were down versus prior year, which I'll discuss shortly. 
Overall, our core business performance was solid, and we anticipate growth strengthening throughout the year. At the bottom of the graph and as expected, total sales growth was impacted by products already facing loss of exclusivity as well as the RESTASIS sales decline ahead of anticipated generic competition. 
Now I'll touch on our key therapeutic areas starting with our largest, Medical Aesthetics. Globally, sales for our facial injectable line, BOTOX and JUVÉDERM, were up 13% versus prior year. Demand was strong domestically and internationally, and demand was broad-based across both the aesthetic dermatology and plastic surgery segments. 
Turning to BOTOX. I'll talk about our results, the outlook for the market and our toxin development programs. U.S. BOTOX sales were up 17% and international up 8%. Sales for BOTOX in the United States were powered by a significantly larger consumer activation program with advertising, digital and PR efforts, an expanded sales force to reach more practices and achieving higher levels of customer service and a first quarter promotional offer for top customers. 
Additionally, we added 0.25 million people to our Brilliant Distinctions loyalty program in the first quarter, which is the best quarter in the history of the program. We've added 1 million in the last 12 months for a total of 6 million members. This is relevant because 67% of our BOTOX consumers are BD members, and they visit their practices 23% more often and spend 36% more per year than nonmembers. It's an important asset for customers and for Allergan. 
Now for a few comments about the aesthetics market. The prospects for growth here are excellent. There is both a youth movement and a prevention movement underway, and Allergan has launched 3 digital ventures in partnership with aesthetic practices to attract new consumers, including Allergan Data Labs, which is a data science and digital marketing group now fully operational in Irvine. They're launching the largest digital marketing campaign ever for BOTOX on Mother's Day, which we expect will attract tens of thousands of new users and loyalty members. 
In terms of competition, it's the reality of a growing market. Aesthetics has never been a 1-product market and never will be, but it is an efficient market, which means in the end, it will likely support 3 products, not 4, 5 or 6. Our strategy, like that of our customers, is to compete on quality, innovation and customer service, not on price. That is the only sustainable strategy in our view. When it comes to neurotoxins, customers and patients are more outcomes- and service-sensitive than price-sensitive. We are well positioned to defend this business. 
Finally, on the product development front, we're developing 1 of 2 types of products, products that either help providers deliver even better aesthetic outcomes or products that attract new consumers. Right now, we're advancing new indications for BOTOX, masseter and platysma, a new prefilled syringe for BOTOX and 3 completely novel toxins, including a liquid, a rapid-acting short duration and a long-acting, which are in various stages of development. 
Turning to JUVÉDERM. Fillers have been a step change in aesthetics. They have given providers the ability to volumize, lift and shape. JUVÉDERM is the #1 filler in the world. Sales internationally increased 18% with exceptional performance in Asia Pacific, Middle East, Africa and Europe. New product launches, including VOLUX last month in Europe and new consumer programs, are fueling demand around the world. 
In the U.S., sales were up 6% versus prior year. We expect sales growth for the year to be higher than the first quarter, which was impacted by strong buying in the prior fourth quarter of 2018. For reference, fourth quarter sales in '18 were up 14% last year. 
Turning to Slide 11, CoolSculpting. Our first quarter sales, of course, were below expectations, off 4% versus prior year, due to consumer demand and a reduction in system sales in the United States. We have a lot of work to do in this business in the short term, especially in the U.S., which I'll talk about shortly. Long term, the outlook for CoolSculpting is still positive for 2 reasons. First, we're set up to launch 3 new CoolSculpting systems in the next 2 to 3 years, which will improve outcomes for the procedure and underlying demand. And second, we've only scratched the surface of the body contouring market with an estimated penetration rate of less than 10%. There's still a large untapped pool of consumers to reach and convert, and we expect sales for the year to be up 5% to 10% globally despite our first quarter performance. 
We had several priorities when we acquired CoolSculpting. They were: expand the U.S. installed base, which is now 50% larger than it was 2 years ago; reorganize the international business; accelerate the development of new CoolSculpting technologies; and drive consumer demand. In roughly 2 years, we've achieved 3 of the 4. Right now, more focus is needed on consumer marketing and activation. We have exceptionally high-awareness levels. We have 7 million consumers visiting our website, an installed base totaling 4,000 accounts and 6,000 systems. So the foundation here is solid, but our consumer conversion rate is low. We're taking a number of measures to fix that, including Allergan Data Labs is launching a new digital initiative to drive website traffic conversion with the first-ever freecycle promotion. We're also partnering with high-end health clubs around the country and conducting marketing events at luxury malls and wellness centers to move consumers from awareness to usage. We're changing the approach here from a focus on not only practices and systems, but also consumers. Two other important sources of future growth for this business in '19 are International and CoolTone. In International, we've restructured the business transitioning from a distributor model to a direct promotion model. We're now doing business directly in 69 countries and have 3,000 systems placed around the world. Next, CoolTone will launch in late 2019. This is a muscle-toning system that is complementary and will be marketed alongside CoolSculpting. We'll be taking orders for CoolTone by midyear and shipping equipment in early Q4. Now with any launch, current capital sales slow as providers want to see new package offers -- what new package offers might look like. We expect capital sales to rebound upon the launch of CoolTone. 
ALLODERM sales in the first quarter were impacted by a supply constraint for donor material. The supply situation has stabilized and is expected to improve throughout the year. Sales growth of this business should trade in the mid-single digits. Sales for our Natrelle line of breast implants have been impacted by regulatory changes related to our textured implants internationally. Our 2019 sales outlook anticipated these changes. In the U.S., FDA conducted a public hearing on breast implant safety. David will talk more about this shortly. Note that in the U.S., over 90% of our business is smooth implants.
Turning to Slide 12 and CNS. Sales for BOTOX were at expectations, up 6% for the first quarter. The year-over-year comparison was impacted by the fact that the first quarter of '19 had 2 fewer selling days than the first quarter of '18. Adjusting for quarterly selling days, BOTOX growth was in the high single digits. In terms of the market, the migraine prevention market is 10% to 15% larger than it was a year ago. Our share of new chronic migraine patients is 47%, remains stable. We estimate that only 2% of CGRP patients were switched from BOTOX and combination use is limited. As we have said before, we expect the growth rate in 2019 will be in the mid- to high single digits. 
Sales for VRAYLAR in Q1 '19 totaled $144 million, up 70%. This product continues to exceed expectations on almost all metrics, including prescribers, prescription levels and formulary coverage rates. The growth catalyst for VRAYLAR in 2019 is the anticipated new indication for bipolar depression, which is currently under review at the FDA. The target audience and detailing levels for VRAYLAR will be almost doubled in May to cover not only psychiatrists but also primary care physicians. 
Turning to Slide 13 on GI. Underlying prescription demand growth for LINZESS in the first quarter was in the double digits. This was offset by a lower average selling price and trade buying patterns resulting in a net revenue gain of 1% versus prior year. Sales for ZENPEP were strong, up 19%. 
Turning now to Eye Care. Our glaucoma business was impacted by pricing headwinds in the United States and the impact of trade buying patterns internationally. We expect this franchise to be stable for the year. OZURDEX sales increased 10%. Our supply situation has improved significantly, and we expect all markets to be fully restocked in the second quarter. RESTASIS prescription ban -- demand was relatively stable year-over-year. This was offset by a lower average selling price. Sales orders for RESTASIS MDPF have been replaced by the RESTASIS single-unit vial as we work through a backorder situation, which we expect to resolve by the second half. 
Finally, turning to Slide 14. Our International sales totaled $802 million, up 1% versus prior year. Excluding the impact of Natrelle implants, sales were up 5.2%. The growth drivers were JUVÉDERM, CoolSculpting, BOTOX Cosmetic and BOTOX Therapeutic. The Asia Pacific/Middle East/Africa region continues to be the most important growth driver in our International business. In the quarter, LACAN sales were further impacted by trade buying patterns for our Eye Care business and lower Fibristal sales and generic RESTASIS in Canada. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to David."

We made significant pipeline progress in the first quarter of the year. Before I talk about progress, I will begin with the readout from our Phase III program Rapastinel as an adjunctive treatment in major depressive disorder. I was very disappointed by these results. Despite this setback, our commitment to bringing innovative medicines to patients with unmet needs in mental health remains unchanged. We expect to present detailed data from the Rapastinel program at an upcoming medical conference. We still have 2 studies with Rapastinel ongoing, one in suicidality and the other in monotherapy. We will perform an interim analysis of these studies to check for futility, and we will see these data later this year. 
Turning to Slide 16, which highlights the major upcoming catalysts for the year. As you heard from Brent, we expect approval of 5 major programs over the course of the next 18 months. Most near term is the anticipated approval of cariprazine for bipolar depression where we have an FDA action date later this month. As recently announced, our NDA has been filed for ubrogepant, our oral CGRP inhibitor for the acute treatment of migraine, and we have an action date in December. Also within CNS, we expect to report in the second half of the year top line results from the ongoing Phase II study of AGN-241751, our oral NMDA modulator. This agent has the same mechanism of action as Rapastinel. The oral formulation allows us to evaluate the safety and efficacy of more frequent dosing. 
Turning to Eye Care. we recently reported safety data from the MAPLE Study for abicipar in neurovascular age-related macular degeneration. Data from this study showed a decrease in the rates of inflammation compared to that previously reported in the Phase III CEDAR and SEQUOIA studies. We view this decrease in inflammation rates as step in the right direction, and we will continue to work on improving the formulation. We expect to make a regulatory submission in the U.S. in the first half of the year, followed by a submission in the EU in the second half of the year. We also expect to make a regulatory submission of bimatoprost sustained-release in the U.S. for the treatment of glaucoma in the first half of 2019. In Medical Aesthetics, we are excited to be launching CoolTone, a muscle-toning system utilizing high-frequency electromagnetic stimulation aimed at fast-twitch skeletal muscle. In addition, versions 3.0 and 4.0 of CoolSculpting are expected within the next 2 to 3 years. 
Slide 17 provides a summary of the key events we anticipate over the next 18 months. We continue to advance the rest of our mid- to late-stage pipeline according to our targets and expectations. 
Turning to Slide 18. Our pharmaceutical pipeline has 46 programs in various stages of development with 2 that are currently under regulatory review and 10 programs in Phase III development. Our development programs continue to remain aligned with our time lines with the exception of brazikumab. This IL-23 monoclonal antibody is being developed in a competitive space with a large number of competing trials. 
Similarly, as outlined on Slide 19, we continue to develop our device pipeline with 30 programs in development. This will continue to drive innovation within Medical Aesthetics. This is a rich development portfolio in line with our leadership in this area. And as such, we have more than doubled our R&D investments in devices in Medical Aesthetics over the last 2 years. In the quarter, the FDA held a 2-day advisory committee to discuss the benefits and risks of breast implants and dermal matrices. The agency recently announced that textured breast implants will remain on the market and are considering actions to be taken to improve product labeling and communication. We're excited about the future of our R&D organization. As always, I thank my colleagues in R&D for their hard work as well as the investigators and particularly, the patients who are participating in our clinical trials. 
And now I will turn the call over to Matt."
36478,609716141,1732131,"Allergan plc, Q1 2019 Earnings Call, May 07, 2019",2019-05-07,"Earnings Calls","Allergan plc","Executives","Thank you, David. Looking now at the key financial highlights on Page 21. As Brent mentioned earlier, our core business continues to be strong, and we're delivering on our key financial commitments through the first quarter of 2019. So starting at the t",1576,"Thank you, David. 
Looking now at the key financial highlights on Page 21. As Brent mentioned earlier, our core business continues to be strong, and we're delivering on our key financial commitments through the first quarter of 2019. So starting at the top of the page, net revenues in the quarter were $3.6 billion, flat year-over-year on a constant currency basis, which means the 2% decline in reported revenues was due solely to foreign exchange translation. The highlight of the quarter was the solid performance of the promoted brands with ongoing exclusivity, which was up 5.3%. This entirely offset the 27% decline in LOEs and divestitures, which now includes the generic entry of Canasa. Our core business, which comprises 90% of total revenues, grew 4.4% at constant currency and was actually over 1 percentage point higher at 5.5% excluding the impact of regulatory changes in the international textured implant market. 
A few things to bear in mind as we think about 2019 revenues. First, from a phasing perspective, our first quarter tends to be our seasonally slowest quarter revenue-wise historically. And second, as we stated when we issued 2019 guidance, we expect revenue growth rates to accelerate in the remaining quarters of 2019 as we annualize the back half 2018 issues related to the OZURDEX recall and ALLODERM donor supply. 
Now turning to margins. Non-GAAP gross margin grew 50 basis points to 86.7% primarily driven by favorable product mix. Operating margins, however, declined 270 basis points to 45.2%, which was driven by 2 key factors. First, in sales and marketing, we increased expenditures in our Facial Aesthetics business, and we bolstered our commercial footprint internationally, especially in Asia Pacific. And second, we increased R&D spending to support ongoing late-stage clinical development programs. 
Now turning to the lower section of the slide. Non-GAAP performance net income per share was $3.79, representing 1% growth year-on-year versus the first quarter of 2018, which reflects the impact of share buybacks during 2018 and the first quarter of this year. 
Slide 22 provides an overview of our P&L line items for the quarter, most of which I've already discussed. I would, however, like to highlight 2 important line items, our net interest expense and our tax rate, both of which are meaningfully favorable to prior year, and this was contemplated in our 2019 guidance. 
Now I'd like to discuss the significant GAAP accounting matter and provide the appropriate context. Each quarter, we monitor goodwill and intangibles for indicators of impairment. In the first quarter, we recorded a $2.5 billion goodwill impairment in our General Medicine Reporting Unit primarily related to the failure of Rapastinel in Phase III clinical trials and, to a lesser extent, timing true-ups of other R&D programs. Bear in mind that this goodwill impairment in our Gen Med reporting unit is not related to the acquisition price of Naurex as this was 100% expensed as IT R&D at the time of the acquisition in 2015. So rather, this impairment is a consequence of the removal of future anticipated cash flows related to Rapastinel and the timing true-ups of other programs from our long-term financial projections. This, in turn, lowered the fair value of the Gen Med reporting unit as of March 31 below book value. While the strong performance we've seen across other parts of Allergan support increased fair values, those increases are in other reporting units, which under GAAP did not impact the goodwill impairment test of the Gen Med business. 
Turning to Slide 23 now and returning to the quarter's results. Here we see an overview of our financial results by reporting segment. U.S. Specialized Therapeutics experienced a decline of 2.3% in revenues, which was driven by lower RESTASIS sales as well as the sale of our Med Derm business in 2018. Contribution margin was down 290 basis points driven by the revenue decline coupled with the increase in promotional spending in our Facial Aesthetics business. 
Looking at U.S. General Medicine. The segment grew 2.1% year-over-year. This was driven by double-digit growth across key brands, including VRAYLAR, VIIBRYD, Lo LOESTRIN and ZENPEP. This growth was offset by the continued impact of products facing LOEs, which, in this quarter, also includes the generic entry of Canasa. Contribution margin increased 90 basis points due to higher revenues and the benefit from lower promotional selling expenses resulting from the restructuring initiatives. 
And lastly, on International revenues. These grew 1% on a constant currency basis and was significantly impacted by foreign exchange translation. On a constant-currency basis and excluding the impact of the regulatory changes in the textured implant market, International revenues increased 5.2% year-over-year. Contribution margin declined 40 basis points due in part to the textured implant issue as well as increased investment into high-growth regions, especially Asia Pacific. 
Now turning to Slide 24. You can see our operating cash flow in the first quarter was strong at $1.2 billion, and this supports our 2019 guidance of $5 billion to $5.5 billion. Our priorities on capital allocation remain unchanged. First, reinvestment in our business for growth in our 4 key therapeutics areas. During the quarter, we acquired Envy Medical, which increases the breadth of our Medical Aesthetics offerings to now include skin resurfacing and dermal infusion; second, debt reduction, which is important in the context of the anticipated RESTASIS LOE; third, funding and prudently growing our dividend; and fourth, share buybacks as a means to manage earnings dilution that would result from asset sales or from long-term equity-based incentive plans. 
And as you can see on our capitalization table, we continue to work towards our capital allocation goals. We ended the quarter with $23.5 billion in total debt and $1.8 billion in cash and equivalents, which brings our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio to 2.8x as of March 31. Coming up in the second quarter, we have a scheduled debt maturity of approximately $800 million that we intend to retire using cash on hand and operating cash flow. We remain committed and on track to achieve our target net leverage ratio of 2.5x by the end of 2020, which would, of course, enable us to sustain our commitment to an investment-grade credit rating. 
With regard to share buybacks, we said on the last call that as part of our 2019 guidance, we intended to repurchase $800 million of shares during the year. We accomplished this entire amount in the first quarter, which completely utilizes the 2018 $2 billion share repurchase authorization. We have the 2019 $2 billion share authorization available to us. However, it's important to note that our revised guidance contemplates no further share repurchases during 2019. As previously mentioned, this assumption may change depending upon the progression of asset sales. 
Moving now to guidance on Page 25. We're revising guidance upward for 2019. So starting with net revenues, we're raising our full year outlook and now expect 2019 net revenues to be between $15.1 billion and $15.4 billion, $100 million higher and the low -- on the low and high end from the previously provided guidance of $15 billion to $15.3 billion. We now assume a mid-May LOE for RESTASIS, and the increase in revenue guidance is driven by the additional RESTASIS exclusivity. 
Our updated revenue guidance continues to contemplate strength in the core business, which is expected to grow at a rate similar to last year, in the mid- to high single-digit range. 
Additionally, we continue to incorporate headwinds previously discussed related to OZURDEX, textured implants, industry-wide pricing pressure and foreign exchange translation. And we believe our revised guidance is appropriately conservative across all these points. We continue to expect non-GAAP gross margins for the full year to be 85% to 85.5% based on our product mix and LOE assumptions, including the impact of generic RESTASIS. Our non-GAAP SG&A and R&D expense remains unchanged as we continue to invest in growth drivers for our key businesses and in advancing our clinical programs in development. Should there be a sustained benefit of incremental RESTASIS revenues versus our expectations, we would look at opportunities to reinvest a portion of these proceeds back into the business, and this would be similar to what we executed in 2018. 
Besides revenue, the only other guidance item that's changing is performance net income per share, which we're increasing from greater than or equal to $16.36 to greater than $16.55. As with revenue, this increase reflects the assumption of additional RESTASIS exclusivity to mid-May on top of solid core business performance, which is soundly in line with our expectations at this point. 
Now for reference, each additional month of RESTASIS exclusivity is estimated to add an incremental $60 million to $70 million in sales. Also, please note that our guidance does not include the impact of any significant asset divestitures. If or when we complete these, we will provide an update on the impact to our key financial metrics, including to non-GAAP performance net income per share. Until such time as there is a generic RESTASIS, we expect to provide quarterly financial guidance, both top and bottom line. With our seasonally slowest quarter of the year in Q1 now behind us, we are forecasting sequentially stronger top line performance for the remainder of the year. For the second quarter of 2019, we expect total reported net revenue between $3.85 billion and $4 billion and non-GAAP performance net income per share between $4.20 and $4.40. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back to Brent."

You mentioned in your prepared remarks that you talked about the recent shareholder vote that you and the Board continue to look at alternative avenues to unlock value. So my question is, what would push you and the Board to take these alternative avenues? Is there a certain metric? Or is it just nonperforming share price? Can you give us a sense of what would prompt maybe a different turn into -- than what you're doing? And then along those same lines, what are you hearing as you speak to your shareholders? Is there a common theme that you could discuss with us, maybe a common frustration they point to? And how do you address it?"

So look, I think that -- let me answer your questions perhaps in reverse order, if that's acceptable. In terms of the shareholder engagement both the management team and our Board did, which was significant over the last few months, I think there is a common theme from our shareholders, which is a frustration in the performance of the stock price. Let me be clear. I share that frustration. I understand that frustration. I'm a very large shareholder relative to my own personal holdings in Allergan, and most of the management team is likewise situated. And so that is something that was loud and clear, and we need to make sure that we do everything we can to unlock value and create a better shareholder return for our shareholders over the long term. And so that is clearly, I think, the top issue we heard, and we heard it loud and clear, and our Board heard it loud and clear. And I think that was a very constructive and positive experience for our Board members to hear from probably close to 50 different shareholders that they engaged with. So I think that's pretty straightforward. 
I think in terms of prompting us to do something different, the way I would come at it, I'd say, it's multifactorial. We have a very experienced and engaged Board. We also have a refreshed Board with several new members with lots of different experiences in this industry and in other businesses.

And I would say that's something that we do regularly and continuously. And now I would say with a sense of urgency. And so the Board is on it. The Board is engaged and stay tuned."

So regarding Rapastinel and 241751, I can make a few comments about breast implants and perhaps Bill, from a commercial perspective, will talk about that mainly. So look, the -- with Rapastinel, we have the positive Phase II study and then we performed the Phase III programs in adjunctive MDD using once-a-week dosing. And we know that with ketamine, another NMDA receptor modulator, that such a regimen can be effective in depression. Now clearly, when we look at animal models of the depression or psychiatric disorders, Rapastinel and 751 are incredibly effective in those models. Having said that, some very recent data has shown that more frequent dosing or the more frequent the dosing in those animal models, the greater the efficacy. And that holds true both for Rapastinel and for AGN-241751. But clearly, I don't know the answer yet. But with 241751, because it's an oral compound, we can test and are testing more frequent dosing. So by analogy, with the animal data, that may give us a greater chance of showing efficacy with this mechanism of action because 751 has the same mechanism as Rapastinel. And we plan to have data with 751 by the end of 2019. 
Yes, regarding breast implants, I was present at the advisory -- the 2-day advisory committee that the FDA held recently. And recently, the FDA told us that based on that advisory committee and their other analyses that they -- that the textured breast implants, which was the main topic of discussion there, will remain on the market, although they are going to discuss labeling and enhancing communication with the various manufacturers. Of course, the majority of implants that are used in the U.S. are, in fact, smooth implants. There will be a discussion with the FDA about derma matrices, but that's a different topic. Of course, conversations around the world are taking place with various regulatory authorities about textured implants. And perhaps Bill could pick it up from here."

For the purposes of projections, the International business has been appropriately adjusted for our 2019 outlook and beyond. And as it relates to sales in the United States, even the context of the actions the FDA is contemplating, I expect that to be a stable business.

So look, you're exactly right, Chris. I do get the question quite a bit around split. And in fact, I think I very publicly and very clearly addressed this at a Leerink conference a couple of months ago. And let me just reiterate what I said there, which still holds true is I've always remained open-minded and the Board remains open-minded to that idea if we believe it's something that creates long-term value. There are a number of factors that go into looking at that. One you just said, which is the sustained valuation discount is something that's clearly important. We also tend to look at some of the other important issues, which I mentioned at Leerink and at many other times, like scale, particularly outside the U.S. And that's something that's improving as that business grows. We clearly need to protect BOTOX as a brand, which is both a aesthetic and therapeutic product and one of the most important brands in the Allergan family. So that's something that we would have to clearly be thoughtful and meticulous in terms of how we thought about that. And then scale of R&D as the science of Medical Aesthetics is clearly moving in the direction of biopharmaceutical R&D versus just medical device R&D. And so those are just a few of the things that we tend to look at outside of financial complexities and other things like that. But look, everything is on the table. I said everything was on the table. Our Board will regularly and actively evaluate these types of decisions. And I think I also made clear in my answer to Ken, they're going to do that with a sense of urgency. So stay tuned, and we'll see where we go."

As it relates to CoolSculpting, first, this is getting a lot of attention right now, as you can imagine. I'll tell you that the problem we're facing is not due to market saturation, it's not due to customer satisfaction and it's not due to competition. And I think that's important to recognize. We are managing, I think, 2 issues in addition to my earlier remarks. The first one is when we acquired ZELTIQ, we knew that we had what I would describe as an innovation or a new product cycle gap when we guided into this '18 to '19 period. In other words, if you go back between 2013 and 2017 over a 5-year period, there were 6 different applicators launched for CoolSculpting. And each applicator opened up a different area of the body and sustained a pretty robust growth rate over that period. It's been fairly quiet for the past 18 to 24 months, and I think we've fixed that right now. We're going to launch CoolTone at the end of '19, and then we're set up for 2 additional system upgrades over the next 2 to 3 years. Think iPhone 8, 9 and X. 
The second issue is that after several years on the market, we're dealing, to be fair, with a different type of consumer. We've essentially got to all of the early adopters. And now we're working on a group of late adopters, and they're -- they have more questions and they're somewhat more cautious. And so we've really shifted our focus from, as I mentioned, practices and system placements to a more consumer model. I think the outlook for the business is still very positive. You have to recognize that CoolSculpting has a long runway. And if we're successful with CoolTone, next-generation CoolSculpting and then with our skin-tightening technology over the next, let's call it, 2 to 3 years, and we're successful both domestically and internationally, this business should reach our initial expectations or come very close."

So look, let me start by saying that R&D and innovation is the lifeblood of Allergan as it is for any biopharmaceutical company. It's important for us, and I think just -- Bill just kind of explained it in the context of CoolSculpting to have continuous innovation to drive growth. That holds true across the entire portfolio. When we look at the therapeutics side of our business, which is important, clearly, we're focused on 4 therapeutic approvals and launches over the next 18 months that are really important for us, whether that be a bipolar depression for VRAYLAR, ubrogepant, abicipar, Bimatoprost SR. But as David mentioned, we also have 10 Phase III programs continuing to advance whether that be relamorelin or brazikumab or a variety of other things that are listed on the chart in the presentation. 
I think when we look in the earlier pipeline, we absolutely need to continue to look to enhance and increase our opportunities to bring real innovation to patients. Some of that will come through from some of the collaborations we've already established. So for example, we have an IND that was accepted or approved related to our partnership with Editas for Leber disease, and we'll -- we expect to enroll patients later this year. Our first IND with the microbiome in our assembly was also approved, and we'll start to enroll patients as well, but we are enrolling patients already in that one. And we have a variety of other partnerships like that as well that will continue to throw off development candidates. So there are a lot of activity, and we constantly look for new science and new partnerships and new collaborations. 
And in fact, to the second part of your question, upgrading skills is a continuous process. We are always looking to enhance our capabilities in R&D and in science. And in fact, we announced last quarter or right around the JPMorgan conference, I believe, that we were opening up our office in Boston and moving our Head of External Science and Innovation to Boston and building out and hiring and recruiting in the Kendall Square area new science and -- scientists and capabilities. And so that is actively underway, and we believe that's the right place to have an additional office for R&D organization. Now we are in Southern California. We're in South San Francisco. We're in New Jersey. We're in the U.K. and we're in Boston as well as a few other places. And so I think that we've got a good spread, and we're committed to recruiting the best scientists and the best minds that we can to supplement our thinking. Do you want to talk, Bill?"

I would just say that I think price discounting is tempting, but it can be a trap long term. It's a slippery slope. It lessens the perceived value of a product, it cuts into profits, cuts into customer service, cuts into R&D. The way we think about is, the value of our products and services right now exceed the prices that we charge. And if we don't believe that at some point in the future, we'd make an adjustment. I think the focus here has got to be on attracting new users to the category and introducing products that improve outcomes for those consumers. And that's where we stand right now.

Thanks, Jason. Look, yes, we're absolutely committed to the 5%. I think some reasons to feel confident about that are the nine consecutive quarters of core business growth, which is now 90% of Allergan, and I think will ultimately become most of Allergan over time; areas like facial injectables that grew 13% this quarter; looking at products like VRAYLAR and even ZENPEP and VIIBRYD that are growing above expectations; we saw Lo LO and OZURDEX strong at roughly 10% or better year-over-year. And so those are reasons to be confident in that core business. 
Clearly, as we look at the back part of that guidance, the pipeline needs to participate to enable us to reach that target. And Rapastinel was, frankly, not a big part of that guidance. It was further out. So it really doesn't impact our thinking there. ESMYA did. And we've already incorporated that into our thinking, but we've seen improvements in other parts of the pipeline, right? So they're all risk-adjusted when we made the comment. We know that the profile of ubrogepant looks very positive, and the risk-benefit there looks very positive. Obviously, we need an FDA approval, but that looks good. Bim SR had surprisingly positive results as well. And that is being filed in the first half of this year. Abicipar is the only true 12-week anti-VEGF. While we're improving the inflammation, we still believe that could be a very nice product in the forecast. And so that's moving forward. International growth continues to look solid and will be a big contributor. And so bear in mind, our outlook was adjusted for some of the asset sales, and so we continue to exceed expectations in the delivery of our quarters. And that, I think, all those reasons combined, both positive and negative, give us reason to be confident."

Now back to ubrogepant. The cases are primarily diagnosed based on creatine phosphokinase released from skeletal muscle plus patient history discussions. When we're talking about the incidence of rhabdomyolysis in the ubrogepant studies, you've got to look at, of course, the totality of evidence. And we do see cases of exercise-induced rhabdomyolysis in placebo standard-of-care cases as well as in the ubrogepant arms, rates differ in arms between studies.

And second, back to the General Medicine's business. It seems that the pricing you're obtaining, just looking year-over-year for the Eye Care products or the IBD products are a little bit lower than they were in 1Q '18. And just talking to the peers, it seems there is more of an effort to go ahead and press down some of those older category for discounts. So when we think about kind of like the pricing you obtained from those areas of older products going forward, should we assume kind of a small negative number in terms of pricing year-over-year?

As it relates to CoolSculpting, I think consumer satisfaction with the procedure is high. A couple of points about that. If you take a look at RealSelf and you look at the Worth It rating for CoolSculpting, it's roughly 78%. Now that trades a little bit lower than a facial injectable, but that's not surprising for a body contouring procedure. Satisfaction levels will trade lower if a patient does not receive an adequate number of treatment cycles. Right now, that number is at roughly 5. Ideally, if you talk to most plastic surgeons, it should be 6 to 8. And so with adequate treatments in a given area of the body, the satisfaction for CoolSculpting is right where it has been and where we expect it to be. As it relates to repeat visits, this is -- there isn't a reoccurring revenue stream. In other words, once someone receives their 6 to 8 cycles for a given problem area, then it's, in many respects, a permanent solution. And so I think that deals with the CoolSculpting question. I would also say that when you take a look at CoolTone and the next-generation CoolSculpting system as well as the skin-tightening solution, each one of those should enable plastic surgeons and derms and other providers to improve outcomes for patients. 
As it relates to the General Medicine business, I think you have it right. I think about price, whether it be for LINZESS or for RESTASIS or for our U.S. glaucoma business, as being neutral and there could be some downward pressure on it. I think that's the reality of the health care system right now. I think the positive in all this for us is that prescription demand for these businesses -- obviously, LINZESS is very solid and the product's on the market for 7 years now, and prescriptions were up 10% and units were up 14%. As it relates to the more established businesses like RESTASIS or glaucoma, demand is relatively stable. And so you'll see a little bit more price pressure read through to the sales line on those businesses. But I think your outlook is right."

I mentioned in my remarks, Brilliant Distinctions is a real asset for us. I would describe it as the moat around BOTOX. We added 250,000 members in one quarter, which is the best quarter we've had in the history of the program. The digital venture spotlight, which is an online destination for all things beauty, we had 1.5 million visitors to it in the first year. That number will approach 2 million very, very shortly. We're running a Mother's Day promotion, which I mentioned. And there was a sign-up opportunity for a sweepstakes. I won't get into the details, but we had roughly 50,000 women sign up in roughly a week. And so I think all of the digital and consumer advertising work that we're doing is attracting new consumers into practices for plastic surgeons and dermatologist, which is ultimately what our aim is."

Good morning and thank you for joining us on our call today. 
Our first quarter results reflected ongoing strength of our core business across our 4 key therapeutic areas: Medical Aesthetics, Eye Care, CNS and GI. This represented the ninth consecutive quarter of core business growth. The growth prospects of these businesses remain strong driven by product line depth, new product flow, commercial expertise and a robust pipeline with 5 potential FDA approvals and new product launches anticipated over the next 18 months. As a management team and Board, we are focused on strengthening and growing our business while executing disciplined capital allocation and returning capital to shareholders. At the same time, we are realistic about the challenges and risks facing the business and the work we need to continue to create value for our shareholders, customers, patients and colleagues. We understand that we need to continue to earn their trust for our performance commercially, operationally and in R&D. And we are committed to acting with urgency to do just that. 
Now let me turn to the quarter's results on Slide 5. We had a good start to the year with continued growth of our core business, which was up 4.4% year-over-year. Against the backdrop of continuing product LOEs, our total revenue was stable, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. We made progress on building several important brands, which we expect will be key drivers of long-term growth. There are many standouts in the first quarter such as BOTOX, JUVÉDERM and VRAYLAR as well as some brands, which we are working on further bolstering. Bill will address these in greater detail. In R&D, we believe we are well positioned with 5 anticipated FDA approvals over the next 18 months or so. They include: cariprazine for bipolar depression where we expect a regulatory decision later this month; ubrogepant for the acute treatment of migraine where we expect the regulatory decision in December; CoolTone, a new muscle-toning system as part of CoolSculpting family, which we expect to launch towards the end of the year; Bimatoprost SR, which is a dropless glaucoma therapy where we plan to make a regulatory submission in the first half of the year; and abicipar for wet age-related macular degeneration where we plan to make a regulatory submission also in the first half of this year. 
In the first quarter, we reported top line results from the Phase III Rapastinel program, and we were deeply disappointed that these studies were not successful. Our commitment to bring new medicines to patients in need remains unchanged, and our pipeline supports this commitment. Across our 4 key therapeutic areas, we now have 46 programs on the pharmaceutical side and 30 programs on the device side. I am happy to report that we achieved solid results in the first quarter while remaining disciplined and shareholder-friendly in terms of capital allocation. You will hear more about this from Matt. 
Slide 6 provides an overview of the key drivers of our financial results in the first quarter of 2019 and illustrates that our core business, accounting for about 90% of total revenues, reached $3.2 billion. This continued strength of our core business, together with our emerging pipeline, positions us well for 2019 and beyond. 
Slide 7 provides more focused look at our core business, which is comprised of promoted brands and brands with ongoing exclusivity. The first quarter of 2019 is the ninth consecutive quarter where our core business has delivered consistent year-over-year growth. Since 2016, our core business has grown by over $3 billion and currently accounts for 90% of our revenues. In 2017, our core business made up 79% of our revenues. And in 2018, it accounted for 87% of our revenues. 
Looking ahead, we expect to work our way through the impact of the LOEs and reach a place where our core business generates almost all of our revenues. Before I turn the call over to Bill, I wanted to take a moment to comment on the results of our recent Annual Shareholder Meeting and the extensive discussions we as Allergan's leadership team and Board of Directors have had with our shareholders in the weeks and months leading up to it. 
Let me start by saying that I take seriously the opinion of our shareholders, including David Tepper. We have benefited from the candid and constructive shareholder feedback, and I share their desire to create more value at Allergan. Our focus and interests are 100% aligned with those of our shareholders. We have been on this transformation journey for almost 3 years since the sale of our generics business. Since then, we have worked to grow our key products at depth and breadth to our pipeline and build scale to compete in 4 therapeutic areas. I share in the disappointment that the value creation has not materialized yet. But when I look at the strength of our core business, the potential of our pipeline and the dedication of our team and Board, I have great confidence that it will. 
So how are we going to do that? First, we will continue to focus on growing our core business and realizing value through the pipeline. That means keeping our teams focused, delivering excellent service to our customers and driving key R&D milestones. The sense of urgency to create value is high, and the Board is actively and continuously reviewing alternative avenues that could unlock value in the nearer term. I assure you that the Board, management team and I recognize the urgency, and we will take decisive action to drive value-enhancing opportunities. 
Now let me turn the call over to Bill."

Slide 9 is a product-level sales analysis for the first quarter ranked in terms of sales growth versus prior year.

Slide 9 is a product-level sales analysis for the first quarter ranked in terms of sales growth versus prior year. We had a strong start to the year posting double-digit growth rates for several of our major products. BOTOX Cosmetic, VRAYLAR, VIIBRYD, ZENPEP, JUVÉDERM, OZURDEX and Lo LOESTRIN were standouts in the quarter. Other key brands, Natrelle implants, ALLODERM and CoolSculpting, were down versus prior year, which I'll discuss shortly. 
Overall, our core business performance was solid, and we anticipate growth strengthening throughout the year. At the bottom of the graph and as expected, total sales growth was impacted by products already facing loss of exclusivity as well as the RESTASIS sales decline ahead of anticipated generic competition. 
Now I'll touch on our key therapeutic areas starting with our largest, Medical Aesthetics. Globally, sales for our facial injectable line, BOTOX and JUVÉDERM, were up 13% versus prior year. Demand was strong domestically and internationally, and demand was broad-based across both the aesthetic dermatology and plastic surgery segments. 
Turning to BOTOX. I'll talk about our results, the outlook for the market and our toxin development programs. U.S. BOTOX sales were up 17% and international up 8%. Sales for BOTOX in the United States were powered by a significantly larger consumer activation program with advertising, digital and PR efforts, an expanded sales force to reach more practices and achieving higher levels of customer service and a first quarter promotional offer for top customers. 
Additionally, we added 0.25 million people to our Brilliant Distinctions loyalty program in the first quarter, which is the best quarter in the history of the program. We've added 1 million in the last 12 months for a total of 6 million members. This is relevant because 67% of our BOTOX consumers are BD members, and they visit their practices 23% more often and spend 36% more per year than nonmembers. It's an important asset for customers and for Allergan. 
Now for a few comments about the aesthetics market. The prospects for growth here are excellent. There is both a youth movement and a prevention movement underway, and Allergan has launched 3 digital ventures in partnership with aesthetic practices to attract new consumers, including Allergan Data Labs, which is a data science and digital marketing group now fully operational in Irvine. They're launching the largest digital marketing campaign ever for BOTOX on Mother's Day, which we expect will attract tens of thousands of new users and loyalty members. 
In terms of competition, it's the reality of a growing market. Aesthetics has never been a 1-product market and never will be, but it is an efficient market, which means in the end, it will likely support 3 products, not 4, 5 or 6. Our strategy, like that of our customers, is to compete on quality, innovation and customer service, not on price. That is the only sustainable strategy in our view. When it comes to neurotoxins, customers and patients are more outcomes- and service-sensitive than price-sensitive. We are well positioned to defend this business. 
Finally, on the product development front, we're developing 1 of 2 types of products, products that either help providers deliver even better aesthetic outcomes or products that attract new consumers. Right now, we're advancing new indications for BOTOX, masseter and platysma, a new prefilled syringe for BOTOX and 3 completely novel toxins, including a liquid, a rapid-acting short duration and a long-acting, which are in various stages of development. 
Turning to JUVÉDERM. Fillers have been a step change in aesthetics. They have given providers the ability to volumize, lift and shape. JUVÉDERM is the #1 filler in the world. Sales internationally increased 18% with exceptional performance in Asia Pacific, Middle East, Africa and Europe. New product launches, including VOLUX last month in Europe and new consumer programs, are fueling demand around the world. 
In the U.S., sales were up 6% versus prior year. We expect sales growth for the year to be higher than the first quarter, which was impacted by strong buying in the prior fourth quarter of 2018. For reference, fourth quarter sales in '18 were up 14% last year. 
Turning to Slide 11, CoolSculpting. Our first quarter sales, of course, were below expectations, off 4% versus prior year, due to consumer demand and a reduction in system sales in the United States. We have a lot of work to do in this business in the short term, especially in the U.S., which I'll talk about shortly. Long term, the outlook for CoolSculpting is still positive for 2 reasons. First, we're set up to launch 3 new CoolSculpting systems in the next 2 to 3 years, which will improve outcomes for the procedure and underlying demand. And second, we've only scratched the surface of the body contouring market with an estimated penetration rate of less than 10%. There's still a large untapped pool of consumers to reach and convert, and we expect sales for the year to be up 5% to 10% globally despite our first quarter performance. 
We had several priorities when we acquired CoolSculpting. They were: expand the U.S. installed base, which is now 50% larger than it was 2 years ago; reorganize the international business; accelerate the development of new CoolSculpting technologies; and drive consumer demand. In roughly 2 years, we've achieved 3 of the 4. Right now, more focus is needed on consumer marketing and activation. We have exceptionally high-awareness levels. We have 7 million consumers visiting our website, an installed base totaling 4,000 accounts and 6,000 systems. So the foundation here is solid, but our consumer conversion rate is low. We're taking a number of measures to fix that, including Allergan Data Labs is launching a new digital initiative to drive website traffic conversion with the first-ever freecycle promotion. We're also partnering with high-end health clubs around the country and conducting marketing events at luxury malls and wellness centers to move consumers from awareness to usage. We're changing the approach here from a focus on not only practices and systems, but also consumers. Two other important sources of future growth for this business in '19 are International and CoolTone. In International, we've restructured the business transitioning from a distributor model to a direct promotion model. We're now doing business directly in 69 countries and have 3,000 systems placed around the world. Next, CoolTone will launch in late 2019. This is a muscle-toning system that is complementary and will be marketed alongside CoolSculpting. We'll be taking orders for CoolTone by midyear and shipping equipment in early Q4. Now with any launch, current capital sales slow as providers want to see new package offers -- what new package offers might look like. We expect capital sales to rebound upon the launch of CoolTone. 
ALLODERM sales in the first quarter were impacted by a supply constraint for donor material. The supply situation has stabilized and is expected to improve throughout the year. Sales growth of this business should trade in the mid-single digits. Sales for our Natrelle line of breast implants have been impacted by regulatory changes related to our textured implants internationally. Our 2019 sales outlook anticipated these changes. In the U.S., FDA conducted a public hearing on breast implant safety. David will talk more about this shortly. Note that in the U.S., over 90% of our business is smooth implants.
Turning to Slide 12 and CNS. Sales for BOTOX were at expectations, up 6% for the first quarter. The year-over-year comparison was impacted by the fact that the first quarter of '19 had 2 fewer selling days than the first quarter of '18. Adjusting for quarterly selling days, BOTOX growth was in the high single digits. In terms of the market, the migraine prevention market is 10% to 15% larger than it was a year ago. Our share of new chronic migraine patients is 47%, remains stable. We estimate that only 2% of CGRP patients were switched from BOTOX and combination use is limited. As we have said before, we expect the growth rate in 2019 will be in the mid- to high single digits. 
Sales for VRAYLAR in Q1 '19 totaled $144 million, up 70%. This product continues to exceed expectations on almost all metrics, including prescribers, prescription levels and formulary coverage rates. The growth catalyst for VRAYLAR in 2019 is the anticipated new indication for bipolar depression, which is currently under review at the FDA. The target audience and detailing levels for VRAYLAR will be almost doubled in May to cover not only psychiatrists but also primary care physicians. 
Turning to Slide 13 on GI. Underlying prescription demand growth for LINZESS in the first quarter was in the double digits. This was offset by a lower average selling price and trade buying patterns resulting in a net revenue gain of 1% versus prior year. Sales for ZENPEP were strong, up 19%. 
Turning now to Eye Care. Our glaucoma business was impacted by pricing headwinds in the United States and the impact of trade buying patterns internationally. We expect this franchise to be stable for the year. OZURDEX sales increased 10%. Our supply situation has improved significantly, and we expect all markets to be fully restocked in the second quarter. RESTASIS prescription ban -- demand was relatively stable year-over-year. This was offset by a lower average selling price. Sales orders for RESTASIS MDPF have been replaced by the RESTASIS single-unit vial as we work through a backorder situation, which we expect to resolve by the second half. 
Finally, turning to Slide 14. Our International sales totaled $802 million, up 1% versus prior year. Excluding the impact of Natrelle implants, sales were up 5.2%. The growth drivers were JUVÉDERM, CoolSculpting, BOTOX Cosmetic and BOTOX Therapeutic. The Asia Pacific/Middle East/Africa region continues to be the most important growth driver in our International business. In the quarter, LACAN sales were further impacted by trade buying patterns for our Eye Care business and lower Fibristal sales and generic RESTASIS in Canada. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to David."

We made significant pipeline progress in the first quarter of the year. Before I talk about progress, I will begin with the readout from our Phase III program Rapastinel as an adjunctive treatment in major depressive disorder. I was very disappointed by these results. Despite this setback, our commitment to bringing innovative medicines to patients with unmet needs in mental health remains unchanged. We expect to present detailed data from the Rapastinel program at an upcoming medical conference. We still have 2 studies with Rapastinel ongoing, one in suicidality and the other in monotherapy. We will perform an interim analysis of these studies to check for futility, and we will see these data later this year. 
Turning to Slide 16, which highlights the major upcoming catalysts for the year. As you heard from Brent, we expect approval of 5 major programs over the course of the next 18 months. Most near term is the anticipated approval of cariprazine for bipolar depression where we have an FDA action date later this month. As recently announced, our NDA has been filed for ubrogepant, our oral CGRP inhibitor for the acute treatment of migraine, and we have an action date in December. Also within CNS, we expect to report in the second half of the year top line results from the ongoing Phase II study of AGN-241751, our oral NMDA modulator. This agent has the same mechanism of action as Rapastinel. The oral formulation allows us to evaluate the safety and efficacy of more frequent dosing. 
Turning to Eye Care. we recently reported safety data from the MAPLE Study for abicipar in neurovascular age-related macular degeneration. Data from this study showed a decrease in the rates of inflammation compared to that previously reported in the Phase III CEDAR and SEQUOIA studies. We view this decrease in inflammation rates as step in the right direction, and we will continue to work on improving the formulation. We expect to make a regulatory submission in the U.S. in the first half of the year, followed by a submission in the EU in the second half of the year. We also expect to make a regulatory submission of bimatoprost sustained-release in the U.S. for the treatment of glaucoma in the first half of 2019. In Medical Aesthetics, we are excited to be launching CoolTone, a muscle-toning system utilizing high-frequency electromagnetic stimulation aimed at fast-twitch skeletal muscle. In addition, versions 3.0 and 4.0 of CoolSculpting are expected within the next 2 to 3 years. 
Slide 17 provides a summary of the key events we anticipate over the next 18 months. We continue to advance the rest of our mid- to late-stage pipeline according to our targets and expectations. 
Turning to Slide 18. Our pharmaceutical pipeline has 46 programs in various stages of development with 2 that are currently under regulatory review and 10 programs in Phase III development. Our development programs continue to remain aligned with our time lines with the exception of brazikumab. This IL-23 monoclonal antibody is being developed in a competitive space with a large number of competing trials. 
Similarly, as outlined on Slide 19, we continue to develop our device pipeline with 30 programs in development. This will continue to drive innovation within Medical Aesthetics. This is a rich development portfolio in line with our leadership in this area. And as such, we have more than doubled our R&D investments in devices in Medical Aesthetics over the last 2 years. In the quarter, the FDA held a 2-day advisory committee to discuss the benefits and risks of breast implants and dermal matrices. The agency recently announced that textured breast implants will remain on the market and are considering actions to be taken to improve product labeling and communication. We're excited about the future of our R&D organization. As always, I thank my colleagues in R&D for their hard work as well as the investigators and particularly, the patients who are participating in our clinical trials. 
And now I will turn the call over to Matt."

So starting at the top of the page, net revenues in the quarter were $3.6 billion, flat year-over-year on a constant currency basis, which means the 2% decline in reported revenues was due solely to foreign exchange translation. The highlight of the quarter was the solid performance of the promoted brands with ongoing exclusivity, which was up 5.3%. This entirely offset the 27% decline in LOEs and divestitures, which now includes the generic entry of Canasa. Our core business, which comprises 90% of total revenues, grew 4.4% at constant currency and was actually over 1 percentage point higher at 5.5% excluding the impact of regulatory changes in the international textured implant market. 
A few things to bear in mind as we think about 2019 revenues. First, from a phasing perspective, our first quarter tends to be our seasonally slowest quarter revenue-wise historically. And second, as we stated when we issued 2019 guidance, we expect revenue growth rates to accelerate in the remaining quarters of 2019 as we annualize the back half 2018 issues related to the OZURDEX recall and ALLODERM donor supply. 
Now turning to margins. Non-GAAP gross margin grew 50 basis points to 86.7% primarily driven by favorable product mix. Operating margins, however, declined 270 basis points to 45.2%, which was driven by 2 key factors. First, in sales and marketing, we increased expenditures in our Facial Aesthetics business, and we bolstered our commercial footprint internationally, especially in Asia Pacific. And second, we increased R&D spending to support ongoing late-stage clinical development programs. 
Now turning to the lower section of the slide. Non-GAAP performance net income per share was $3.79, representing 1% growth year-on-year versus the first quarter of 2018, which reflects the impact of share buybacks during 2018 and the first quarter of this year. 
Slide 22 provides an overview of our P&L line items for the quarter, most of which I've already discussed. I would, however, like to highlight 2 important line items, our net interest expense and our tax rate, both of which are meaningfully favorable to prior year, and this was contemplated in our 2019 guidance. 
Now I'd like to discuss the significant GAAP accounting matter and provide the appropriate context. Each quarter, we monitor goodwill and intangibles for indicators of impairment. In the first quarter, we recorded a $2.5 billion goodwill impairment in our General Medicine Reporting Unit primarily related to the failure of Rapastinel in Phase III clinical trials and, to a lesser extent, timing true-ups of other R&D programs. Bear in mind that this goodwill impairment in our Gen Med reporting unit is not related to the acquisition price of Naurex as this was 100% expensed as IPR&D at the time of the acquisition in 2015. So rather, this impairment is a consequence of the removal of future anticipated cash flows related to Rapastinel and the timing true-ups of other programs from our long-term financial projections. This, in turn, lowered the fair value of the Gen Med reporting unit as of March 31 below book value. While the strong performance we've seen across other parts of Allergan support increased fair values, those increases are in other reporting units, which under GAAP did not impact the goodwill impairment test of the Gen Med business. 
Turning to Slide 23 now and returning to the quarter's results. Here we see an overview of our financial results by reporting segment. U.S. Specialized Therapeutics experienced a decline of 2.3% in revenues, which was driven by lower RESTASIS sales as well as the sale of our Med Derm business in 2018. Contribution margin was down 290 basis points driven by the revenue decline coupled with the increase in promotional spending in our Facial Aesthetics business. 
Looking at U.S. General Medicine. The segment grew 2.1% year-over-year. This was driven by double-digit growth across key brands, including VRAYLAR, VIIBRYD, Lo LOESTRIN and ZENPEP. This growth was offset by the continued impact of products facing LOEs, which, in this quarter, also includes the generic entry of Canasa. Contribution margin increased 90 basis points due to higher revenues and the benefit from lower promotional selling expenses resulting from the restructuring initiatives. 
And lastly, on International revenues. These grew 1% on a constant currency basis and was significantly impacted by foreign exchange translation. On a constant-currency basis and excluding the impact of the regulatory changes in the textured implant market, International revenues increased 5.2% year-over-year. Contribution margin declined 40 basis points due in part to the textured implant issue as well as increased investment into high-growth regions, especially Asia Pacific. 
Now turning to Slide 24. You can see our operating cash flow in the first quarter was strong at $1.2 billion, and this supports our 2019 guidance of $5 billion to $5.5 billion. Our priorities on capital allocation remain unchanged. First, reinvestment in our business for growth in our 4 key therapeutics areas. During the quarter, we acquired Envy Medical, which increases the breadth of our Medical Aesthetics offerings to now include skin resurfacing and dermal infusion; second, debt reduction, which is important in the context of the anticipated RESTASIS LOE; third, funding and prudently growing our dividend; and fourth, share buybacks as a means to manage earnings dilution that would result from asset sales or from long-term equity-based incentive plans. 
And as you can see on our capitalization table, we continue to work towards our capital allocation goals. We ended the quarter with $23.5 billion in total debt and $1.8 billion in cash and equivalents, which brings our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio to 2.8x as of March 31. Coming up in the second quarter, we have a scheduled debt maturity of approximately $800 million that we intend to retire using cash on hand and operating cash flow. We remain committed and on track to achieve our target net leverage ratio of 2.5x by the end of 2020, which would, of course, enable us to sustain our commitment to an investment-grade credit rating. 
With regard to share buybacks, we said on the last call that as part of our 2019 guidance, we intended to repurchase $800 million of shares during the year. We accomplished this entire amount in the first quarter, which completely utilizes the 2018 $2 billion share repurchase authorization. We have the 2019 $2 billion share authorization available to us. However, it's important to note that our revised guidance contemplates no further share repurchases during 2019. As previously mentioned, this assumption may change depending upon the progression of asset sales. 
Moving now to guidance on Page 25. We're revising guidance upward for 2019. So starting with net revenues, we're raising our full year outlook and now expect 2019 net revenues to be between $15.1 billion and $15.4 billion, $100 million higher and the low -- on the low and high end from the previously provided guidance of $15 billion to $15.3 billion. We now assume a mid-May LOE for RESTASIS, and the increase in revenue guidance is driven by the additional RESTASIS exclusivity. 
Our updated revenue guidance continues to contemplate strength in the core business, which is expected to grow at a rate similar to last year, in the mid- to high single-digit range. 
Additionally, we continue to incorporate headwinds previously discussed related to OZURDEX, textured implants, industry-wide pricing pressure and foreign exchange translation. And we believe our revised guidance is appropriately conservative across all these points. We continue to expect non-GAAP gross margins for the full year to be 85% to 85.5% based on our product mix and LOE assumptions, including the impact of generic RESTASIS. Our non-GAAP SG&A and R&D expense remains unchanged as we continue to invest in growth drivers for our key businesses and in advancing our clinical programs in development. Should there be a sustained benefit of incremental RESTASIS revenues versus our expectations, we would look at opportunities to reinvest a portion of these proceeds back into the business, and this would be similar to what we executed in 2018. 
Besides revenue, the only other guidance item that's changing is performance net income per share, which we're increasing from greater than or equal to $16.36 to greater than $16.55. As with revenue, this increase reflects the assumption of additional RESTASIS exclusivity to mid-May on top of solid core business performance, which is soundly in line with our expectations at this point. 
Now for reference, each additional month of RESTASIS exclusivity is estimated to add an incremental $60 million to $70 million in sales. Also, please note that our guidance does not include the impact of any significant asset divestitures. If or when we complete these, we will provide an update on the impact to our key financial metrics, including to non-GAAP performance net income per share. Until such time as there is a generic RESTASIS, we expect to provide quarterly financial guidance, both top and bottom line. With our seasonally slowest quarter of the year in Q1 now behind us, we are forecasting sequentially stronger top line performance for the remainder of the year. For the second quarter of 2019, we expect total reported net revenue between $3.85 billion and $4 billion and non-GAAP performance net income per share between $4.20 and $4.40. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back to Brent."

Can you give us a sense of what would prompt maybe a different turn into -- than what you're doing? And then along those same lines, what are you hearing as you speak to your shareholders?

So look, I think that -- let me answer your questions perhaps in reverse order, if that's acceptable. In terms of the shareholder engagement both the management team and our Board did, which was significant over the last few months, I think there is a common theme from our shareholders, which is a frustration in the performance of the stock price. Let me be clear. I share that frustration. I understand that frustration. I'm a very large shareholder relative to my own personal holdings in Allergan, and most of the management team is likewise situated. And so that is something that was loud and clear, and we need to make sure that we do everything we can to unlock value and create a better shareholder return for our shareholders over the long term. And so that is clearly, I think, the top issue we heard, and we heard it loud and clear, and our Board heard it loud and clear. And I think that was a very constructive and positive experience for our Board members to hear from probably close to 50 different shareholders that they engaged with. So I think that's pretty straightforward. 
I think in terms of prompting us to do something different, the way I would come at it, I'd say, it's multifactorial. We have a very experienced and engaged Board. We also have a refreshed Board with several new members with lots of different experiences in this industry and in other businesses. And I would say that given the frustration on shareholder return, given the strength of the core business, given the pipeline that we have and then put that in the context of the operating environment, the political environment, the regulatory environment, the global environment, we continue to look at what are the ways that we can unlock value. And I would say that's something that we do regularly and continuously. And now I would say with a sense of urgency. And so the Board is on it. The Board is engaged and stay tuned."

So regarding Rapastinel and 241751, I can make a few comments about breast implants and perhaps Bill, from a commercial perspective, will talk about that mainly. So look, the -- with Rapastinel, we have the positive Phase II study and then we performed the Phase III programs in adjunctive MDD using once-a-week dosing. And we know that with ketamine, another NMDA receptor modulator, that such a regimen can be effective in depression. Now clearly, when we look at animal models of the depression or psychiatric disorders, Rapastinel and 751 are incredibly effective in those models. Having said that, some very recent data has shown that more frequent dosing or the more frequent the dosing in those animal models, the greater the efficacy. And that holds true both for Rapastinel and for AGN-241751. But clearly, I don't know the answer yet. But with 241751, because it's an oral compound, we can test and are testing more frequent dosing. So by analogy, with the animal data, that may give us a greater chance of showing efficacy with this mechanism of action because 751 has the same mechanism as Rapastinel. And we plan to have data with 751 by the end of 2019. 
Yes, regarding breast implants, I was present at the advisory -- the 2-day advisory committee that the FDA held recently. And recently, the FDA told us that based on that advisory committee and their other analyses that they -- that the textured breast implants, which was the main topic of discussion there, will remain on the market, although they are going to discuss labeling and enhancing communication with the various manufacturers. Of course, the majority of implants that are used in the U.S. are, in fact, smooth implants. There will be a discussion with the FDA about derma matrices, but that's a different topic. Of course, conversations around the world are taking place with various regulatory authorities about textured implants. And perhaps Bill could pick it up from here."

And as it relates to sales in the United States, even the context of the actions the FDA is contemplating, I expect that to be a stable business.

And let me just reiterate what I said there, which still holds true is I've always remained open-minded and the Board remains open-minded to that idea if we believe it's something that creates long-term value. There are a number of factors that go into looking at that. One you just said, which is the sustained valuation discount is something that's clearly important. We also tend to look at some of the other important issues, which I mentioned at Leerink and at many other times, like scale, particularly outside the U.S. And that's something that's improving as that business grows. We clearly need to protect BOTOX as a brand, which is both a aesthetic and therapeutic product and one of the most important brands in the Allergan family. So that's something that we would have to clearly be thoughtful and meticulous in terms of how we thought about that. And then scale of R&D as the science of Medical Aesthetics is clearly moving in the direction of biopharmaceutical R&D versus just medical device R&D. And so those are just a few of the things that we tend to look at outside of financial complexities and other things like that. But look, everything is on the table. I said everything was on the table. Our Board will regularly and actively evaluate these types of decisions. And I think I also made clear in my answer to Ken, they're going to do that with a sense of urgency. So stay tuned, and we'll see where we go."

As it relates to CoolSculpting, first, this is getting a lot of attention right now, as you can imagine. I'll tell you that the problem we're facing is not due to market saturation, it's not due to customer satisfaction and it's not due to competition. And I think that's important to recognize. We are managing, I think, 2 issues in addition to my earlier remarks. The first one is when we acquired ZELTIQ, we knew that we had what I would describe as an innovation or a new product cycle gap when we guided into this '18 to '19 period. In other words, if you go back between 2013 and 2017 over a 5-year period, there were 6 different applicators launched for CoolSculpting. And each applicator opened up a different area of the body and sustained a pretty robust growth rate over that period. It's been fairly quiet for the past 18 to 24 months, and I think we've fixed that right now. We're going to launch CoolTone at the end of '19, and then we're set up for 2 additional system upgrades over the next 2 to 3 years. Think iPhone 8, 9 and X. 
The second issue is that after several years on the market, we're dealing, to be fair, with a different type of consumer. We've essentially got to all of the early adopters. And now we're working on a group of late adopters, and they're -- they have more questions and they're somewhat more cautious. And so we've really shifted our focus from, as I mentioned, practices and system placements to a more consumer model. I think the outlook for the business is still very positive. You have to recognize that CoolSculpting has a long runway. And if we're successful with CoolTone, next-generation CoolSculpting and then with our skin-tightening technology over the next, let's call it, 2 to 3 years, and we're successful both domestically and internationally, this business should reach our initial expectations or come very close."

It's important for us, and I think just -- Bill just kind of explained it in the context of CoolSculpting to have continuous innovation to drive growth. That holds true across the entire portfolio. When we look at the therapeutics side of our business, which is important, clearly, we're focused on 4 therapeutic approvals and launches over the next 18 months that are really important for us, whether that be a bipolar depression for VRAYLAR, ubrogepant, abicipar, Bimatoprost SR. But as David mentioned, we also have 10 Phase III programs continuing to advance whether that be relamorelin or brazikumab or a variety of other things that are listed on the chart in the presentation. 
I think when we look in the earlier pipeline, we absolutely need to continue to look to enhance and increase our opportunities to bring real innovation to patients. Some of that will come through from some of the collaborations we've already established. So for example, we have an IND that was accepted or approved related to our partnership with Editas for Leber disease, and we'll -- we expect to enroll patients later this year. Our first IND with the microbiome in our assembly was also approved, and we'll start to enroll patients as well, but we are enrolling patients already in that one. And we have a variety of other partnerships like that as well that will continue to throw off development candidates. So there are a lot of activity, and we constantly look for new science and new partnerships and new collaborations. 
And in fact, to the second part of your question, upgrading skills is a continuous process. We are always looking to enhance our capabilities in R&D and in science. And in fact, we announced last quarter or right around the JPMorgan conference, I believe, that we were opening up our office in Boston and moving our Head of External Science and Innovation to Boston and building out and hiring and recruiting in the Kendall Square area new science and -- scientists and capabilities. And so that is actively underway, and we believe that's the right place to have an additional office for R&D organization. Now we are in Southern California. We're in South San Francisco. We're in New Jersey. We're in the U.K. and we're in Boston as well as a few other places. And so I think that we've got a good spread, and we're committed to recruiting the best scientists and the best minds that we can to supplement our thinking. Do you want to talk, Bill?"

It lessens the perceived value of a product, it cuts into profits, cuts into customer service, cuts into R&D. The way we think about is, the value of our products and services right now exceed the prices that we charge. And if we don't believe that at some point in the future, we'd make an adjustment.

Can you just comment -- I know you commented a lot about '19, but just sort of curious, your 5% revenue CAGR and how that stands in the aftermath of the Rapastinel failure and the MAPLE trial, the tolerability perhaps not hitting the target of some of your competitors on the market. So can you talk a little bit about, in lieu of those things, are there some positive offsets that have occurred in your mind that could pick up the slack there? Just your overall level of confidence in the 5% revenue CAGR would be great."

Thanks, Jason. Look, yes, we're absolutely committed to the 5%. I think some reasons to feel confident about that are the nine consecutive quarters of core business growth, which is now 90% of Allergan, and I think will ultimately become most of Allergan over time; areas like facial injectables that grew 13% this quarter; looking at products like VRAYLAR and even ZENPEP and VIIBRYD that are growing above expectations; we saw Lo LO and OZURDEX strong at roughly 10% or better year-over-year. And so those are reasons to be confident in that core business. 
Clearly, as we look at the back part of that guidance, the pipeline needs to participate to enable us to reach that target. And Rapastinel was, frankly, not a big part of that guidance. It was further out. So it really doesn't impact our thinking there. ESMYA did. And we've already incorporated that into our thinking, but we've seen improvements in other parts of the pipeline, right? So they're all risk-adjusted when we made the comment. We know that the profile of ubrogepant looks very positive, and the risk-benefit there looks very positive. Obviously, we need an FDA approval, but that looks good. Bim SR had surprisingly positive results as well. And that is being filed in the first half of this year. Abicipar is the only true 12-week anti-VEGF. While we're improving the inflammation, we still believe that could be a very nice product in the forecast. And so that's moving forward. International growth continues to look solid and will be a big contributor. And so bear in mind, our outlook was adjusted for some of the asset sales, and so we continue to exceed expectations in the delivery of our quarters. And that, I think, all those reasons combined, both positive and negative, give us reason to be confident."

David, from AAN, we saw ubrogepant safety data presented yesterday, and there were 5 cases of rhabdomyolysis mentioned in there, of which 4 happened at the higher dose. My question to you is, this wasn't broken out in the proper safety table, but it was more like inpatient history comment. So the question is, how was that term, rhabdomyolysis, defined in those patient histories? Was it just CK elevation or was it CK elevation plus organ manifestation?"

So our Board has regularly and continuously evaluated the strategy of this company. They are actively engaged in those discussions, and they feel a sense of urgency.

We increasingly see cases of exercise-induced rhabdomyolysis in our Phase I studies these days across-the-board, across multiple projects. I personally believe that's because people are doing more intense workout these days. And when I discuss with my colleagues, heads of R&D from other pharmaceutical companies, they see it as well. Now back to ubrogepant. The cases are primarily diagnosed based on creatine phosphokinase released from skeletal muscle plus patient history discussions. When we're talking about the incidence of rhabdomyolysis in the ubrogepant studies, you've got to look at, of course, the totality of evidence. And we do see cases of exercise-induced rhabdomyolysis in placebo standard-of-care cases as well as in the ubrogepant arms, rates differ in arms between studies. But across the whole ubrogepant database, the rates were 0.2% in placebo standard-of-care-treated individuals and 0.2% in ubrogepant-treated individuals."

Bill, CoolSculpting, I understand that the argument you're making around look, we're going to push the product. I guess the question is, is this part of delivering the expected results from patients who are already using it? And I was wondering if you might have some data about attrition rates and -- especially in comparison to attrition rates on fillers or on BOTOX. That is, are we seeing the same kind of repeat use rates from even the early adopters of CoolSculpting as we see from the more established products where benefit is established? And second, back to the General Medicine's business. It seems that the pricing you're obtaining, just looking year-over-year for the Eye Care products or the IBD products are a little bit lower than they were in 1Q '18. And just talking to the peers, it seems there is more of an effort to go ahead and press down some of those older category for discounts. So when we think about kind of like the pricing you obtained from those areas of older products going forward, should we assume kind of a small negative number in terms of pricing year-over-year? Or should we still expect flat to slightly up?"

As it relates to CoolSculpting, I think consumer satisfaction with the procedure is high. A couple of points about that. If you take a look at RealSelf and you look at the Worth It rating for CoolSculpting, it's roughly 78%. Now that trades a little bit lower than a facial injectable, but that's not surprising for a body contouring procedure. Satisfaction levels will trade lower if a patient does not receive an adequate number of treatment cycles. Right now, that number is at roughly 5. Ideally, if you talk to most plastic surgeons, it should be 6 to 8. And so with adequate treatments in a given area of the body, the satisfaction for CoolSculpting is right where it has been and where we expect it to be. As it relates to repeat visits, this is -- there isn't a reoccurring revenue stream. In other words, once someone receives their 6 to 8 cycles for a given problem area, then it's, in many respects, a permanent solution. And so I think that deals with the CoolSculpting question. I would also say that when you take a look at CoolTone and the next-generation CoolSculpting system as well as the skin-tightening solution, each one of those should enable plastic surgeons and derms and other providers to improve outcomes for patients. 
As it relates to the General Medicine business, I think you have it right. I think about price, whether it be for LINZESS or for RESTASIS or for our U.S. glaucoma business, as being neutral and there could be some downward pressure on it. I think that's the reality of the health care system right now. I think the positive in all this for us is that prescription demand for these businesses -- obviously, LINZESS is very solid and the product's on the market for 7 years now, and prescriptions were up 10% and units were up 14%. As it relates to the more established businesses like RESTASIS or glaucoma, demand is relatively stable. And so you'll see a little bit more price pressure read through to the sales line on those businesses. But I think your outlook is right."

In fact, the BOTOX cosmetic growth rate in the first quarter of 17%, while part of that was due to a onetime promotional offer, the underlying demand for the product in the quarter was in the double digits. I mentioned in my remarks, Brilliant Distinctions is a real asset for us. I would describe it as the moat around BOTOX. We added 250,000 members in one quarter, which is the best quarter we've had in the history of the program. The digital venture spotlight, which is an online destination for all things beauty, we had 1.5 million visitors to it in the first year. That number will approach 2 million very, very shortly. We're running a Mother's Day promotion, which I mentioned. And there was a sign-up opportunity for a sweepstakes. I won't get into the details, but we had roughly 50,000 women sign up in roughly a week.
