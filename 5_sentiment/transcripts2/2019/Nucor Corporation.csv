Other members of Nucor's executive team are also on the call today, including Jim Frias, our Chief Financial Officer; Joe Stratman, our Chief",1268,"Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for our Fourth Quarter Earnings Call and for your interest in Nucor.

Before we review our 2018 financial results, let me make a few comments about safety. Safety continues to be job #1 for every Nucor teammate. Nucor's safety incident rates are consistently below the national averages for comparable operations, almost always less than half of the nationwide figure. But we are not satisfied with that. Our goal is 0 incidents in all Nucor facilities. Our teammates remind each other regularly that they must work safely so that each of us returns home to our families at the end of every shift. 
So let me just take a few moment to repeat what I say every time I visit a Nucor facility. Nothing is more important than safety. Absolutely nothing. I want to thank all of our teammates for working safely and identifying and mitigating the risks in your operations. I appreciate your continued focus on driving our incident rates towards our ultimate goal, which always must be 0. 
Now I'll review some highlights from the year, then Jim Frias will discuss our financial performance for the fourth quarter and for the year. 
The best way for me to sum up 2018 is this. It was a record year for Nucor. We posted record earnings per share, and we shipped a record amount of steel. Strong economic growth fueled our record year. Tax reform and the ongoing efforts to reform the federal regulatory system took a good economy at the end of 2017 and made it even better. The Section 232 steel tabs provided another tailwind for Nucor between the tariffs and the cumulative impact of the trade cases the industry has won in recent years on fairly traded imports to the U.S. market have declined significantly. Increased demand levels and lower imports generated approximately 6 million tons of added volume for the U.S. steel industry last year. Over the past decade, we have been positioning Nucor to take full advantage of an upturn in the steel market. During that time, we invested more than $9 billion to increase the company's peak earnings power. These investments enhanced our competitive strengths by building on our product diversity and market leadership positions. Our financial results demonstrate that Nucor's disciplined strategy of investing for profitable growth is working. 
Here are just a few examples of how those investments are growing our company's earnings power and driving shareholder value creation. 
Our Sheet Mill Group's 2018 pretax contribution was more than 80% greater than the group's prior record performance achieved during the previous steel industry's up-cycle. During the economic downturn, our sheet mill investments included the acquisition of Gallatin Steel, [ Takeda's ] galvanizing line, Berkeley's castor and hot mill upgrade and Hickman's vacuum degasser. 
Our engineered bar products group also delivered record earnings last year, driven by strategic investments that expended value-added product capabilities at our mills in Nebraska, Tennessee and South Carolina.
The plate mill group realized attractive returns because of the investments we made to add heat treating and normalizing capabilities at our Nucor Steel Hertford and to add accelerated cooling capabilities at Tuscaloosa. The structural steel mill group is capitalizing on Nucor model's expanded product portfolios that now includes high-strength, low-alloy beams and wider, lighter sheet pilings. Shipments of high-strength, low-alloy beams more than doubled in 2018 from the prior year level. This has been achieved at the making of our first shipments in late 2016 into this product market previously served exclusively by imports.
Our downstream steel product segment delivered record earnings in 2018, powered by the impressive performance of the HSS and Electrical Conduit products acquisitions we completed in late 2016 and early 2017. 
Finally, significant earning gains were achieved by our David J. Joseph scrap business in both of our DRI plants. The Louisiana DRI facility established new annual records of plant uptime, production and shipments in 2018. David J. Joseph's profitability was just shy of its record performance achieved during 2008's unprecedented raw materials market. Successful execution of DJJ's mill alignment and efficiency initiatives is enhancing the returns delivered by both our scrap recycling and steelmaking businesses.
We continue to invest in Nucor's future in order to build on Nucor's long track record of delivering superior returns for investors. Over the course of 2018, we announced approximately $1 billion of value-enhancing investments to build new mills, expand production capacity at existing mills and advance Nucor's technological capabilities. In 2019, we have already announced another $1.3 billion investment to build a modern, state-of-the-art plate mill in the U.S. Midwest, which I'll discuss in greater detail shortly.
In the coming year, we expect to complete many of these high-return initiatives, which will grow our steelmaking capabilities in both long and flat products. Six projects will begin operations this year that represent approximately $1 billion in capital investment and will create approximately 700 new full-time jobs at Nucor. We are excited to begin realizing the benefits of these value-enhancing investments. 
Many of you joined us early this month for the announcement of our newest growth initiative, a state-of-the-art plate mill to be located in the Midwest. The mill will have an annual capacity of 1.2 million tons and is expected to be operational in 2022. This investment will position us right in the heart of America's largest plate-consuming region, which will give us logistical advantages over our competitors. It is also a region with excellent scrap availability. The new mill will allow us to produce 97% of the plate products demanded in the domestic market, including the highest-margin products, enabling us to build a clear market leadership position in the U.S. plate market. 
With these investments, Nucor will be well positioned to capitalize on regional market opportunities and drive continued, profitable growth. We will post the status update on our major investment initiatives on the Investor Relations page of our website later today.
As we begin 2019, we are encouraged about the outlook for our domestic end-use market. In fact, we see improving market conditions in 20 of the 24 end-use markets we participate in today. We believe the remaining 4 are stable, and 1 is declining as we head into 2019. 
2019 is expected to be another solid year for automotive sales, and Nucor plans to continue growing our share of this important market. 
In construction, we expect low single-digit growth this year, and we have a strong presence in this market from highways to HVAC. Despite recent volatility in the energy market, market demand for line pipe will continue to grow as longer mileage projects get underway. We look forward to expanding our Gallatin mill in order to produce the API grades required by this market. And in the heavy equipment and agricultural markets, we continue to experience healthy demand in high replacement needs.
2018 was an extraordinary year, and while we are proud of Nucor's continued success, we remain focused on taking care of our customers, executing our growth strategy and delivering even higher returns on our invested capital. 
Jim Frias will now provide more specific detail about our fourth quarter performance and financial position. Jim?"
184945,598048159,1642070,"Nucor Corporation, Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2019",2019-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Nucor Corporation","Executives","Thanks, John. Nucor reported fourth quarter 2018 earnings of $2.07 per diluted share and full year 2018 record earnings of $7.42 per diluted share. Fourth quarter results exceeded the top end of our guidance range by about $0.12 per diluted share due to s",708,"Thanks, John. Nucor reported fourth quarter 2018 earnings of $2.07 per diluted share and full year 2018 record earnings of $7.42 per diluted share. Fourth quarter results exceeded the top end of our guidance range by about $0.12 per diluted share due to stronger-than-expected performance by our sheet structural and raw materials businesses. 2018 record annual earnings represent an increase of 24% compared to our previous earnings record of $5.98 per diluted share reported in 2008. 
Our strategy for profitable growth is working. Nucor continues to benefit from our long-standing position of investing opportunistically through economic cycles to grow long-term earnings power. 
Nucor also generated exceptionally strong cash flow over the course of 2018. For the year, cash provided by operating activities totaled approximately $2.4 billion as compared with 2017's operating cash flow of approximately $1.1 billion. These results, combined with our disciplined approach to capital allocation, enabled us to return more than $1.3 billion to shareholders via dividends of $485 million and share repurchases of $854 million. After repurchasing 13.7 million shares last year, Nucor ended 2018 with approximately 306 million shares outstanding. $1.5 billion remains available under Nucor's existing share repurchase authorization. And in addition, in December, Nucor's board increased our regular quarterly cash dividend by more than 5% to $0.40 per share. Our company has increased its base dividend for 46 consecutive years, every year since we first began paying dividends in 1973. Nucor's long-term success in rewarding our shareholders has been and will continue to be driven by effective and balanced capital allocation. Our ongoing investments to deliver future profitable growth are the vital foundation to that work. 
For 2019, we estimate capital expenditures of approximately $1.8 billion. That represents a significant increase from 2018 capital spending of approximately $1 billion. Approximately 70% of planned 2019 capital expenditures are for expansion, product improvement and cost-savings projects, with the remaining 30% for replacement or maintenance purposes.
As John has already noted, Nucor has announced 10 significant growth projects that represent total capital investment of approximately $3.5 billion that will begin operations between 2019 and 2022. Of these capital outlays, approximately $600 million has been spent through 2018. An estimated $900 million will be spent in 2019, and the remaining investments of about $2 billion will occur through the end of 2022. 
We are excited about the impact that these investments will have for Nucor and all its stakeholders. We are directing our capital very strategically towards clear market opportunities and expect these projects to provide incremental EBITDA exceeding $600 million during normal market conditions. Nucor is already among the most diversified steel producers in the world with leadership positions in numerous products, regions and end-use markets. These investments will enhance those leadership positions and position Nucor to outperform the industry for many years to come. 
We intend to fund these investments with internally generated cash flow and plan to continue returning a minimum of 40% of our earnings to our shareholders while maintaining our strong financial condition. 
With respect to our balance sheet. At year-end, our total debt outstanding was $4.3 billion, and our gross debt-to-capital ratio was 30%. Our year-end cash and short-term investments totaled approximately $1.4 billion. 
Now turning to our outlook. John has already mentioned the positive trends we are observing in our major end-use markets. We do think that 2019 will be another strong year with earnings performance among the best in Nucor's history.
For the first quarter of 2019, although sheet pricing and margins are expected to decrease compared to the fourth quarter of 2018, we expect that this will be partially offset by increases in profitability in our bar and structural mills. 
The performance of the raw materials segment is expected to decrease in the first quarter of 2019 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 due to the decreased performance of our DRI businesses. 
We expect the profitability of our steel products segment in the first quarter of 2019 to be similar to the fourth quarter of 2018. 
Overall, we do expect that the first quarter 2019 will be much stronger for Nucor than the first quarter of 2018. 
Thank you for your interest in our company. Now I'll turn the call back over to John. John?"

But firstly, when you look at your long products portfolio, you've seen pretty significant change in metal spread across most all your long product categories as well as plate. So I had just some quick numbers looking at 1Q '18 versus 4Q '18, and it's about $1.6 billion of incremental EBITDA run rate just on metal spread change. So first question is, do you think that fundamentals for these products in terms of consolidation of the bar market, tariffs -- is everything you're seeing on the demand side, would that suggest, you think, margins would stay elevated relative to where you were this year? And then second question, similarly just on the downstream businesses. Obviously, HSS had a very good performance this year.

That includes our long products. So we see another good year for that. I'm not going to comment on what's happening with any of our competitors. I'll just refer to the demand and say the demand looks good looking forward. Now we continue to work with some projects that will actually help us in 2019 lower our cost structure in some of the capital projects that we're bringing online. We're excited about that. So with demand strong, plus bringing on some capacity that we think will be very competitive in the marketplace, we think this will be a good strong year. For our long products, and plate looks really good. I don't see anything changing there. Slipping just a little bit as we start the year, but the end demand remains strong. So I think it's going to be a good year for that also. Now to address your question on HSS. Now that has been just an outstanding business for us, both HSS and the Conduit business. Certainly, we'll see pricing dip a little bit with HR -- with hot band dipping a little bit, but the margins should stay pretty constant. And so we think -- and demand is certainly good. And as you might have heard, we just announced a price increase of $40 on HR and on our level products and also on the HSS. So we see that market picking up in terms of pricing."

But let me address the first question. When you look at what's come online today, particularly in the sheet markets, exclusively in the sheet market, you're looking at about 2.5 million tons of new capacity coming online. Imports are down about 1 million tons. So you have a net of about 1.5 million tons in a market that's 60 million tons over the long haul sheet market. So it's not that great of a change. At the end of the day, the most cost competitive, most efficient, best operating company will be though one that does the best regardless for what happens with capacity coming online. And we think we do pretty well in all those areas. So there'll be some shake-out probably. We see a major impact today, some. I don't believe that the current restructuring situation that you see today is a result of that additional capacity. I believe that some of it is a result of the service that took place at the end of last year. And it's going to be a period of time when you're looking to unload. Some of those times, when you look at the [ much ] on hand for sheet products, you can kind of see where we -- what happens over the months between October and December. So there's some of that going forward. But the key thing here is demand continues to be strong, and we think that demand will continue to grow. Our best estimate today on sheet is probably about 1.5% to 2% growth over the course of this year. So between the demand growth, as we work our way out of this inventory situation that's short lived, I think you're going to see things return  to a more normalized state. We announced the price increase the other day, and we would not do it if we weren't confident that we'd be able to collect on it."

Before we review our 2018 financial results, let me make a few comments about safety. Safety continues to be job #1 for every Nucor teammate. Nucor's safety incident rates are consistently below the national averages for comparable operations, almost always less than half of the nationwide figure. But we're not satisfied with that. Our goal is 0 incidents in all Nucor facilities. Our teammates remind each other regularly that they must work safely, so that each of us returns home to our families at the end of every shift. 
So let me just take a moment to repeat what I say every time I visit a Nucor facility. Nothing is more important than safety. Absolutely nothing. I want to thank all of our teammates for working safely and identifying and mitigating the risks in your operations. I appreciate your continued focus on driving our incident rates towards our ultimate goal, which always must be 0. 
Now I'll review some highlights from the year, then Jim Frias will discuss our financial performance for the fourth quarter and for the year. 
The best way for me to sum up 2018 is this. It was a record year for Nucor. We posted record earnings per share, and we shipped a record amount of steel. Strong economic growth fueled our record year. Tax reform and the ongoing efforts to reform the federal regulatory system took a good economy at the end of 2017 and made it even better. The Section 232 steel tabs provided another tailwind for Nucor between the tariffs, and the cumulative impact of the trade cases the industry has won in recent years on fairly traded imports to the U.S. market have declined significantly. Increased demand levels and lower imports generated approximately 6 million tons of added volume for the U.S. steel industry last year. Over the past decade, we have been positioning Nucor to take full advantage of an upturn in the steel market. During that time, we invested more than $9 billion to increase the company's peak earnings power. These investments enhanced our competitive strengths by building on our product diversity and market leadership positions. Our financial results demonstrate that Nucor's disciplined strategy of investing for profitable growth is working. 
Here are just a few examples of how those investments are growing our company's earnings power and driving shareholder value creation. 
Our Sheet Mill Group's 2018 pretax contribution was more than 80% greater than the group's prior record performance achieved during the previous steel industry's up-cycle. During the economic downturn, our sheet mill investments included the acquisition of Gallatin Steel, Decatur's galvanizing line, Berkeley's castor and hot mill upgrade and Hickman's vacuum degasser. 
Our engineered bar products group also delivered record earnings last year, driven by strategic investments that expanded value-added product capabilities at our mills in Nebraska, Tennessee and South Carolina.
The plate mill group realized attractive returns because of the investments we made to add heat treating and normalizing capabilities at our Nucor Steel Hertford and to add accelerated cooling capabilities at Tuscaloosa. The structural steel mill group is capitalizing on Nucor-Yamato's expanded product portfolio that now includes high-strength, low-alloy beams and wider, lighter sheet pilings. Shipments of high-strength, low-alloy beams more than doubled in 2018 from the prior year level. This has been achieved after making of our first shipments in late 2016 into this product market previously served exclusively by imports.
Our downstream steel product segment delivered record earnings in 2018, powered by the impressive performance of the HSS and electrical conduit products acquisitions we completed in late 2016 and early 2017. 
Finally, significant earning gains were achieved by our David J. Joseph scrap business in both of our DRI plants. The Louisiana DRI facility established new annual records of plant uptime, production and shipments in 2018. David J. Joseph's profitability was just shy of its record performance achieved during 2008's unprecedented raw materials market. Successful execution of DJJ's mill alignment and efficiency initiatives is enhancing the returns delivered by both our scrap recycling and steelmaking businesses.
We continue to invest in Nucor's future in order to build on Nucor's long track record of delivering superior returns for investors. Over the course of 2018, we announced approximately $1 billion of value-enhancing investments to build new mills, expand production capacity at existing mills and advance Nucor's technological capabilities. In 2019, we have already announced another $1.3 billion investment to build a modern, state-of-the-art plate mill in the U.S. Midwest, which I'll discuss in greater detail shortly.
In the coming year, we expect to complete many of these high-return initiatives, which will grow our steelmaking capabilities in both long and flat products. Six projects will begin operations this year that represent approximately $1 billion in capital investment and will create approximately 700 new full-time jobs at Nucor. We are excited to begin realizing the benefits of these value-enhancing investments. 
Many of you joined us earlier this month for the announcement of our newest growth initiative, a state-of-the-art plate mill, to be located in the Midwest. The mill will have an annual capacity of 1.2 million tons and is expected to be operational in 2022. This investment will position us right in the heart of America's largest plate-consuming region, which will give us logistical advantages over our competitors. It is also a region with excellent scrap availability. The new mill will allow us to produce 97% of the plate products demanded in the domestic market, including the highest-margin products, enabling us to build a clear market leadership position in the U.S. plate market. 
With these investments, Nucor will be well positioned to capitalize on regional market opportunities and drive continued, profitable growth. We will post the status update on our major investment initiatives on the Investor Relations page of our website later today.
As we begin 2019, we are encouraged about the outlook for our domestic end-use market. In fact, we see improving market conditions in 20 of the 24 end-use markets we participate in today. 3 of the remaining 4 are stable, and 1 is declining as we head into 2019. 
2019 is expected to be another solid year for automotive sales, and Nucor plans to continue growing our share of this important market. 
In construction, we expect low single-digit growth this year, and we have a strong presence in this market from highways to HVAC. Despite recent volatility in the energy market, market demand for line pipe will continue to grow as longer mileage projects get underway. We look forward to expanding our Gallatin mill in order to produce the API grades required by this market. And in the heavy equipment and agricultural markets, we continue to experience healthy demand in high replacement needs.
2018 was an extraordinary year. And while we are proud of Nucor's continued success, we remain focused on taking care of our customers, executing our growth strategy and delivering even higher returns on our invested capital. 
Jim Frias will now provide more specific detail about our fourth quarter performance and financial position. Jim?"

Nucor reported fourth quarter 2018 earnings of $2.07 per diluted share and full year 2018 record earnings of $7.42 per diluted share. Fourth quarter results exceeded the top end of our guidance range by about $0.12 per diluted share due to s",709,"Thanks, John. Nucor reported fourth quarter 2018 earnings of $2.07 per diluted share and full year 2018 record earnings of $7.42 per diluted share. Fourth quarter results exceeded the top end of our guidance range by about $0.12 per diluted share due to stronger-than-expected performance by our sheet structural and raw materials businesses. 2018 record annual earnings represent an increase of 24% compared to our previous earnings record of $5.98 per diluted share reported in 2008. 
Our strategy for profitable growth is working. Nucor continues to benefit from our long-standing tradition of investing opportunistically through economic cycles to grow long-term earnings power. 
Nucor also generated exceptionally strong cash flow over the course of 2018. For the year, cash provided by operating activities totaled approximately $2.4 billion as compared with 2017's operating cash flow of approximately $1.1 billion. These results, combined with our disciplined approach to capital allocation, enabled us to return more than $1.3 billion to shareholders via dividends of $485 million and share repurchases of $854 million. After repurchasing 13.7 million shares last year, Nucor ended 2018 with approximately 306 million shares outstanding. $1.5 billion remains available under Nucor's existing share repurchase authorization. And in addition, in December, Nucor's board increased our regular quarterly cash dividend by more than 5% to $0.40 per share. Our company has increased its base dividend for 46 consecutive years, every year since we first began paying dividends in 1973. Nucor's long-term success in rewarding our shareholders has been and will continue to be driven by effective and balanced capital allocation. Our ongoing investments to deliver future profitable growth are the vital foundation to that work. 
For 2019, we estimate capital expenditures of approximately $1.8 billion. That represents a significant increase from 2018 capital spending of approximately $1 billion. Approximately 70% of planned 2019 capital expenditures are for expansion, product improvement and cost-savings projects, with the remaining 30% for replacement or maintenance purposes.
As John has already noted, Nucor has announced 10 significant growth projects to represent total capital investment of approximately $3.5 billion that will begin operations between 2019 and 2022. Of these capital outlays, approximately $600 million has been spent through 2018. An estimated $900 million will be spent in 2019, and the remaining investments of about $2 billion will occur through the end of 2022. 
We are excited about the impact that these investments will have for Nucor and all its stakeholders. We are directing our capital very strategically towards clear market opportunities and expect these projects to provide incremental EBITDA exceeding $600 million during normal market conditions. Nucor is already among the most diversified steel producers in the world with leadership positions in numerous products, regions and end-use markets. These investments will enhance those leadership positions and position Nucor to outperform the industry for many years to come. 
We intend to fund these investments with internally generated cash flow and plan to continue returning a minimum of 40% of our earnings to our shareholders while maintaining our strong financial condition. 
With respect to our balance sheet. At year-end, our total debt outstanding was $4.3 billion, and our gross debt-to-capital ratio was 30%. Our year-end cash and short-term investments totaled approximately $1.4 billion. 
Now turning to our outlook. John has already mentioned the positive trends we are observing in our major end-use markets. We do think that 2019 will be another strong year with earnings performance among the best in Nucor's history.
For the first quarter of 2019, although sheet pricing and margins are expected to decrease compared to the fourth quarter of 2018, we expect that this will be partially offset by increases in profitability at our bar and structural mills. 
The performance of the raw materials segment is expected to decrease in the first quarter of 2019 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 due to the decreased performance of our DRI businesses. 
We expect the profitability of our steel products segment in the first quarter of 2019 to be similar to the fourth quarter of 2018. 
Overall, we do expect that the first quarter of 2019 will be much stronger for Nucor than the first quarter of 2018. 
Thank you for your interest in our company. Now I'll turn the call back over to John. John?"

Let me conclude by thanking our more than 25,000 teammates across Nucor for making 2018 a record year for our company. Your efforts, not just in 2018, but as we pursued our growth strategy over the last decade, enabled us to obtain this milestone. I am proud that we could recognize your hard work with an extraordinary bonus last year. You certainly deserved it. The team at Charlotte appreciates the work you do every day to build a safer and more profitable Nucor. 
I'd also like to say thank you to our customers. We appreciate the trust you place in Nucor, and we'll continue to do our very best to earn it with every order. 
We would now be happy to answer your questions. Operator?"

But firstly, when you look at your long products portfolio, you've seen pretty significant change in metal spread across most -- all your long product categories as well as plate. So I had just some quick numbers looking at 1Q '18 versus 4Q '18, and it's about $1.6 billion of incremental EBITDA run rate just on metal spread change. So first question is, do you think that fundamentals for those products in terms of consolidation of the bar market, tariffs, is everything you're seeing on the demand side? Would that suggest, do you think, margins would stay elevated relative to where you were this year? And then second question, similarly just on the downstream businesses. Obviously, HSS had a very good performance this year. Do you think that hollow structural pricing can stay relatively solid, even though we've seen clearly a big step-down in HRC, and just talk to how we should model that business?"

That includes our long products. So we see another good year for that. I'm not going to comment on what's happening with any of our competitors. I'll just refer to the demand and say the demand looks good going forward. We continue to work with some projects that will actually help us in 2019 lower our cost structure in some of the capital projects that we're bringing online. We're excited about that. So with demand strong, plus bringing on some capacity that we think will be very competitive in the marketplace, we think it's going to be a good strong year for our long products. And plate looks really good going into the year also. I don't see anything changing there, slipping just a little bit as we start the year, but the end demand remains strong. So I think it's going to be a good year for that also. Now to address your question on HSS, that has been just an outstanding business for us, both the HSS and the conduit business. Certainly, we'll see pricing dip a little bit with HR -- with hot band dipping a little bit, but the margins should stay pretty constant. And so we think -- and demand is certainly good. And as you might have heard, we just announced a price increase of $40 on HR and on our -- or on our flat-rolled products and also on the HSS. So we see that market picking up in terms of pricing."

And we're looking forward to 2019 as we expect some expansion in margins with steel prices having come down slightly. In regards to your second part of the question, which was rebar fab, that is one of the still challenging markets that we have. That's no secret. That market has been challenged, especially in the U.S., for the last 12 to 18 months. Demand is solid, imports have declined, and rebar steel costs have risen. However, the marketplace fabrication pricing has not yet fully reacted to that. We are encouraged, however, recently by the pricing dynamics that we're starting to see. We do have a backlog. However, we have to work through it. But we do expect improved performance as we enter the second half of the year in rebar fabrication."

But I'll -- let me address the first question. When you look at what's come online today, particularly in the sheet markets, exclusively in the sheet market, you're looking at about 2.5 million tons of new capacity coming online. Imports are down about 1 million tons. So you have a net of about 1.5 million tons in a market that's 60 million tons overall the whole sheet market. So it's not that great of a change. At the end of the day, the most cost competitive, most efficient, best operating company will be one that does the best regardless of what happens with capacity coming online. And we think we do pretty well in all of those areas. So there'll be some shake-out probably. We see a major impact today -- some. I don't believe that the current pricing situation that you see today is a result of that additional capacity. I believe that some of it is a result of the service center buildup that took place at the end of last year. And there's going to be a period of time when they're looking to unload some of those tons. When you look at the months on hand for sheet products, you can kind of see where we -- what happens over the months between October and December. So there's some of that going forward. But the key thing here is demand continues to be strong, and we think that demand will continue to grow. Our best estimate today on sheet is probably about 1.5% to 2% growth over the course of this year. So between the demand growth, as we work our way out of this inventory situation that's short-lived, I think you're going to see things start to return  to a more normalized state. We announced the price increase the other day, and we would not do it if we weren't confident that we'd be able to collect on it."

Before we review our 2018 financial results, let me make a few comments about safety. Safety continues to be job #1 for every Nucor teammate. Nucor's safety incident rates are consistently below the national averages for comparable operations, almost always less than half of the nationwide figure. But we're not satisfied with that. Our goal is 0 incidents in all Nucor facilities. Our teammates remind each other regularly that they must work safely, so that each of us returns home to our families at the end of every shift. 
So let me just take a moment to repeat what I say every time I visit a Nucor facility. Nothing is more important than safety. Absolutely nothing. I want to thank all of our teammates for working safely and identifying and mitigating the risks in your operations. I appreciate your continued focus on driving our incident rates towards our ultimate goal, which always must be 0. 
Now I'll review some highlights from the year, then Jim Frias will discuss our financial performance for the fourth quarter and for the year. 
The best way for me to sum up 2018 is this. It was a record year for Nucor. We posted record earnings per share, and we shipped a record amount of steel. Strong economic growth fueled our record year. Tax reform and the ongoing efforts to reform the federal regulatory system took a good economy at the end of 2017 and made it even better. The Section 232 steel tabs provided another tailwind for Nucor between the tariffs, and the cumulative impact of the trade cases the industry has won in recent years on fairly traded imports to the U.S. market have declined significantly. Increased demand levels and lower imports generated approximately 6 million tons of added volume for the U.S. steel industry last year. Over the past decade, we have been positioning Nucor to take full advantage of an upturn in the steel market. During that time, we invested more than $9 billion to increase the company's peak earnings power. These investments enhanced our competitive strengths by building on our product diversity and market leadership positions. Our financial results demonstrate that Nucor's disciplined strategy of investing for profitable growth is working. 
Here are just a few examples of how those investments are growing our company's earnings power and driving shareholder value creation. 
Our Sheet Mill Group's 2018 pretax contribution was more than 80% greater than the group's prior record performance achieved during the previous steel industry's up-cycle. During the economic downturn, our sheet mill investments included the acquisition of Gallatin Steel, Decatur's galvanizing line, Berkeley's castor and hot mill upgrade and Hickman's vacuum degasser. 
Our engineered bar products group also delivered record earnings last year, driven by strategic investments that expanded value-added product capabilities at our mills in Nebraska, Tennessee and South Carolina.
The plate mill group realized attractive returns because of the investments we made to add heat treating and normalizing capabilities at our Nucor Steel Hertford and to add accelerated cooling capabilities at Tuscaloosa. The structural steel mill group is capitalizing on Nucor-Yamato's expanded product portfolio that now includes high-strength, low-alloy beams and wider, lighter sheet pilings. Shipments of high-strength, low-alloy beams more than doubled in 2018 from the prior year level. This has been achieved after making of our first shipments in late 2016 into this product market previously served exclusively by imports.
Our downstream steel product segment delivered record earnings in 2018, powered by the impressive performance of the HSS and electrical conduit products acquisitions we completed in late 2016 and early 2017. 
Finally, significant earning gains were achieved by our David J. Joseph scrap business in both of our DRI plants. The Louisiana DRI facility established new annual records of plant uptime, production and shipments in 2018. David J. Joseph's profitability was just shy of its record performance achieved during 2008's unprecedented raw materials market. Successful execution of DJJ's mill alignment and efficiency initiatives is enhancing the returns delivered by both our scrap recycling and steelmaking businesses.
We continue to invest in Nucor's future in order to build on Nucor's long track record of delivering superior returns for investors. Over the course of 2018, we announced approximately $1 billion of value-enhancing investments to build new mills, expand production capacity at existing mills and advance Nucor's technological capabilities. In 2019, we have already announced another $1.3 billion investment to build a modern, state-of-the-art plate mill in the U.S. Midwest, which I'll discuss in greater detail shortly.
In the coming year, we expect to complete many of these high-return initiatives, which will grow our steelmaking capabilities in both long and flat products. Six projects will begin operations this year that represent approximately $1 billion in capital investment and will create approximately 700 new full-time jobs at Nucor. We are excited to begin realizing the benefits of these value-enhancing investments. 
Many of you joined us earlier this month for the announcement of our newest growth initiative, a state-of-the-art plate mill, to be located in the Midwest. The mill will have an annual capacity of 1.2 million tons and is expected to be operational in 2022. This investment will position us right in the heart of America's largest plate-consuming region, which will give us logistical advantages over our competitors. It is also a region with excellent scrap availability. The new mill will allow us to produce 97% of the plate products demanded in the domestic market, including the highest-margin products, enabling us to build a clear market leadership position in the U.S. plate market. 
With these investments, Nucor will be well positioned to capitalize on regional market opportunities and drive continued, profitable growth. We will post the status update on our major investment initiatives on the Investor Relations page of our website later today.
As we begin 2019, we are encouraged about the outlook for our domestic end-use market. In fact, we see improving market conditions in 20 of the 24 end-use markets we participate in today. 3 of the remaining 4 are stable, and 1 is declining as we head into 2019. 
2019 is expected to be another solid year for automotive sales, and Nucor plans to continue growing our share of this important market. 
In construction, we expect low single-digit growth this year, and we have a strong presence in this market from highways to HVAC. Despite recent volatility in the energy market, market demand for line pipe will continue to grow as longer mileage projects get underway. We look forward to expanding our Gallatin mill in order to produce the API grades required by this market. And in the heavy equipment and agricultural markets, we continue to experience healthy demand in high replacement needs.
2018 was an extraordinary year. And while we are proud of Nucor's continued success, we remain focused on taking care of our customers, executing our growth strategy and delivering even higher returns on our invested capital. 
Jim Frias will now provide more specific detail about our fourth quarter performance and financial position. Jim?"
184945,598048159,1642161,"Nucor Corporation, Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2019",2019-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Nucor Corporation","Executives","Thanks, John. Nucor reported fourth quarter 2018 earnings of $2.07 per diluted share and full year 2018 record earnings of $7.42 per diluted share. Fourth quarter results exceeded the top end of our guidance range by about $0.12 per diluted share due to s",709,"Thanks, John. Nucor reported fourth quarter 2018 earnings of $2.07 per diluted share and full year 2018 record earnings of $7.42 per diluted share. Fourth quarter results exceeded the top end of our guidance range by about $0.12 per diluted share due to stronger-than-expected performance by our sheet structural and raw materials businesses. 2018 record annual earnings represent an increase of 24% compared to our previous earnings record of $5.98 per diluted share reported in 2008. 
Our strategy for profitable growth is working. Nucor continues to benefit from our long-standing tradition of investing opportunistically through economic cycles to grow long-term earnings power. 
Nucor also generated exceptionally strong cash flow over the course of 2018. For the year, cash provided by operating activities totaled approximately $2.4 billion as compared with 2017's operating cash flow of approximately $1.1 billion. These results, combined with our disciplined approach to capital allocation, enabled us to return more than $1.3 billion to shareholders via dividends of $485 million and share repurchases of $854 million. After repurchasing 13.7 million shares last year, Nucor ended 2018 with approximately 306 million shares outstanding. $1.5 billion remains available under Nucor's existing share repurchase authorization. And in addition, in December, Nucor's board increased our regular quarterly cash dividend by more than 5% to $0.40 per share. Our company has increased its base dividend for 46 consecutive years, every year since we first began paying dividends in 1973. Nucor's long-term success in rewarding our shareholders has been and will continue to be driven by effective and balanced capital allocation. Our ongoing investments to deliver future profitable growth are the vital foundation to that work. 
For 2019, we estimate capital expenditures of approximately $1.8 billion. That represents a significant increase from 2018 capital spending of approximately $1 billion. Approximately 70% of planned 2019 capital expenditures are for expansion, product improvement and cost-savings projects, with the remaining 30% for replacement or maintenance purposes.
As John has already noted, Nucor has announced 10 significant growth projects to represent total capital investment of approximately $3.5 billion that will begin operations between 2019 and 2022. Of these capital outlays, approximately $600 million has been spent through 2018. An estimated $900 million will be spent in 2019, and the remaining investments of about $2 billion will occur through the end of 2022. 
We are excited about the impact that these investments will have for Nucor and all its stakeholders. We are directing our capital very strategically towards clear market opportunities and expect these projects to provide incremental EBITDA exceeding $600 million during normal market conditions. Nucor is already among the most diversified steel producers in the world with leadership positions in numerous products, regions and end-use markets. These investments will enhance those leadership positions and position Nucor to outperform the industry for many years to come. 
We intend to fund these investments with internally generated cash flow and plan to continue returning a minimum of 40% of our earnings to our shareholders while maintaining our strong financial condition. 
With respect to our balance sheet. At year-end, our total debt outstanding was $4.3 billion, and our gross debt-to-capital ratio was 30%. Our year-end cash and short-term investments totaled approximately $1.4 billion. 
Now turning to our outlook. John has already mentioned the positive trends we are observing in our major end-use markets. We do think that 2019 will be another strong year with earnings performance among the best in Nucor's history.
For the first quarter of 2019, although sheet pricing and margins are expected to decrease compared to the fourth quarter of 2018, we expect that this will be partially offset by increases in profitability at our bar and structural mills. 
The performance of the raw materials segment is expected to decrease in the first quarter of 2019 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 due to the decreased performance of our DRI businesses. 
We expect the profitability of our steel products segment in the first quarter of 2019 to be similar to the fourth quarter of 2018. 
Overall, we do expect that the first quarter of 2019 will be much stronger for Nucor than the first quarter of 2018. 
Thank you for your interest in our company. Now I'll turn the call back over to John. John?"

But firstly, when you look at your long products portfolio, you've seen pretty significant change in metal spread across most all your long product categories as well as plate. So I just did some quick numbers looking at 1Q '18 versus 4Q '18, and it's about $1.6 billion of incremental EBITDA run rate just on metal spread change. So first question is, do you think that fundamentals for those products in terms of consolidation of the bar market, tariffs, is everything you're seeing on the demand side, would that suggest, do you think, margins would stay elevated relative to where you were this year? And then second question, similarly just on the downstream businesses. Obviously, HSS had a very good performance this year. Do you think that hollow structural pricing can stay relatively solid, even though we've seen clearly a big step-down in HRC, and just talk to how we should model that business?"

That includes our long products. So we see another good year for that. I'm not going to comment on what's happening with any of our competitors. I'll just refer to the demand and say the demand looks good going forward. We continue to work with some projects that will actually help us in 2019 lower our cost structure in some of the capital projects that we're bringing online. We're excited about that. So with demand strong, plus bringing on some capacity that we think will be very competitive in the marketplace, we think it's going to be a good strong year for our long products. And plate looks really good going into the year also. I don't see anything changing there, slipping just a little bit as we start the year, but the end demand remains strong. So I think it's going to be a good year for that also. Now to address your question on HSS, that has been just an outstanding business for us, both the HSS and the conduit business. Certainly, we'll see pricing dip a little bit with HR -- with hot band dipping a little bit, but the margins should stay pretty constant. And so we think -- and demand is certainly good. And as you might have heard, we just announced a price increase of $40 on HR and on our -- or on our flat-rolled products and also on the HSS. So we see that market picking up in terms of pricing."

But I'll -- let me address the first question. When you look at what's come online today, particularly in the sheet markets, exclusively in the sheet market, you're looking at about 2.5 million tons of new capacity coming online. Imports are down about 1 million tons. So you have a net of about 1.5 million tons in a market that's 60 million tons overall the whole sheet market. So it's not that great of a change. At the end of the day, the most cost competitive, most efficient, best operating company will be one that does the best regardless of what happens with capacity coming online. And we think we do pretty well in all of those areas. So will there be some shake-out? Probably. Are we seeing a major impact today? Some. I don't believe that the current pricing situation that you see today is a result of that additional capacity. I believe that some of it is a result of the service center buildup that took place at the end of last year. And there's going to be a period of time when they're looking to unload some of those tons. When you look at the months on hand for sheet products, you can kind of see where we -- what happens over the months between October and December. So there's some of that going forward. But the key thing here is demand continues to be strong, and we think that demand will continue to grow. Our best estimate today on sheet is probably about 1.5% to 2% growth over the course of this year. So between the demand growth, as we work our way out of this inventory situation that's short-lived, I think you're going to see things start to return  to a more normalized state. We announced the price increase the other day, and we would not do it if we weren't confident that we'd be able to collect on it."

Before we review our 2018 financial results, let me make a few comments about safety. Safety continues to be job #1 for every Nucor teammate. Nucor's safety incident rates are consistently below the national averages for comparable operations, almost always less than half of the nationwide figure. But we're not satisfied with that. Our goal is 0 incidents in all Nucor facilities. Our teammates remind each other regularly that they must work safely, so that each of us returns home to our families at the end of every shift. 
So let me just take a moment to repeat what I say every time I visit a Nucor facility. Nothing is more important than safety. Absolutely nothing. I want to thank all of our teammates for working safely and identifying and mitigating the risks in your operations. I appreciate your continued focus on driving our incident rates towards our ultimate goal, which always must be 0. 
Now I'll review some highlights from the year, then Jim Frias will discuss our financial performance for the fourth quarter and for the year. 
The best way for me to sum up 2018 is this. It was a record year for Nucor. We posted record earnings per share, and we shipped a record amount of steel. Strong economic growth fueled our record year. Tax reform and the ongoing efforts to reform the federal regulatory system took a good economy at the end of 2017 and made it even better. The Section 232 steel tabs provided another tailwind for Nucor between the tariffs, and the cumulative impact of the trade cases the industry has won in recent years on fairly traded imports to the U.S. market have declined significantly. Increased demand levels and lower imports generated approximately 6 million tons of added volume for the U.S. steel industry last year. Over the past decade, we have been positioning Nucor to take full advantage of an upturn in the steel market. During that time, we invested more than $9 billion to increase the company's peak earnings power. These investments enhanced our competitive strengths by building on our product diversity and market leadership positions. Our financial results demonstrate that Nucor's disciplined strategy of investing for profitable growth is working. 
Here are just a few examples of how those investments are growing our company's earnings power and driving shareholder value creation. 
Our Sheet Mill Group's 2018 pretax contribution was more than 80% greater than the group's prior record performance achieved during the previous steel industry's up-cycle. During the economic downturn, our sheet mill investments included the acquisition of Gallatin Steel, Decatur's galvanizing line, Berkeley's castor and hot mill upgrade and Hickman's vacuum degasser. 
Our engineered bar products group also delivered record earnings last year, driven by strategic investments that expanded value-added product capabilities at our mills in Nebraska, Tennessee and South Carolina.
The plate mill group realized attractive returns because of the investments we made to add heat-treating and normalizing capabilities at our Nucor Steel Hertford and to add accelerated cooling capabilities at Tuscaloosa. The structural steel mill group is capitalizing on Nucor-Yamato's expanded product portfolio that now includes high-strength, low-alloy beams and wider, lighter sheet pilings. Shipments of high-strength, low-alloy beams more than doubled in 2018 from the prior year level. This has been achieved after making of our first shipments in late 2016 into this product market previously served exclusively by imports.
Our downstream steel product segment delivered record earnings in 2018, powered by the impressive performance of the HSS and electrical conduit products acquisitions we completed in late 2016 and early 2017. 
Finally, significant earning gains were achieved by our David J. Joseph scrap business in both of our DRI plants. The Louisiana DRI facility established new annual records of plant uptime, production and shipments in 2018. David J. Joseph's profitability was just shy of its record performance achieved during 2008's unprecedented raw materials market. Successful execution of DJJ's mill alignment and efficiency initiatives is enhancing the returns delivered by both our scrap recycling and steelmaking businesses.
We continue to invest in Nucor's future in order to build on Nucor's long track record of delivering superior returns for investors. Over the course of 2018, we announced approximately $1 billion of value-enhancing investments to build new mills, expand production capacity at existing mills and advance Nucor's technological capabilities. In 2019, we have already announced another $1.3 billion investment to build a modern, state-of-the-art plate mill in the U.S. Midwest, which I'll discuss in greater detail shortly.
In the coming year, we expect to complete many of these high-return initiatives, which will grow our steelmaking capabilities in both long and flat products. Six projects will begin operations this year that represent approximately $1 billion in capital investment and will create approximately 700 new full-time jobs at Nucor. We are excited to begin realizing the benefits of these value-enhancing investments. 
Many of you joined us earlier this month for the announcement of our newest growth initiative, a state-of-the-art plate mill, to be located in the Midwest. The mill will have an annual capacity of 1.2 million tons and is expected to be operational in 2022. This investment will position us right in the heart of America's largest plate-consuming region, which will give us logistical advantages over our competitors. It is also a region with excellent scrap availability. The new mill will allow us to produce 97% of the plate products demanded in the domestic market, including the highest-margin products, enabling us to build a clear market leadership position in the U.S. plate market. 
With these investments, Nucor will be well positioned to capitalize on regional market opportunities and drive continued, profitable growth. We will post the status update on our major investment initiatives on the Investor Relations page of our website later today.
As we begin 2019, we are encouraged about the outlook for our domestic end-use market. In fact, we see improving market conditions in 20 of the 24 end-use markets we participate in today. 3 of the remaining 4 are stable, and 1 is declining as we head into 2019. 
2019 is expected to be another solid year for automotive sales, and Nucor plans to continue growing our share of this important market. 
In construction, we expect low single-digit growth this year, and we have a strong presence in this market from highways to HVAC. Despite recent volatility in the energy market, market demand for line pipe will continue to grow as longer mileage projects get underway. We look forward to expanding our Gallatin mill in order to produce the API grades required by this market. And in the heavy equipment and agricultural markets, we continue to experience healthy demand in high replacement needs.
2018 was an extraordinary year. And while we are proud of Nucor's continued success, we remain focused on taking care of our customers, executing our growth strategy and delivering even higher returns on our invested capital. 
Jim Frias will now provide more specific detail about our fourth quarter performance and financial position. Jim?"

Nucor reported fourth quarter 2018 earnings of $2.07 per diluted share and full year 2018 record earnings of $7.42 per diluted share. Fourth quarter results exceeded the top end of our guidance range by about $0.12 per diluted share due to s",709,"Thanks, John. Nucor reported fourth quarter 2018 earnings of $2.07 per diluted share and full year 2018 record earnings of $7.42 per diluted share. Fourth quarter results exceeded the top end of our guidance range by about $0.12 per diluted share due to stronger-than-expected performance by our sheet structural and raw materials businesses. 2018 record annual earnings represent an increase of 24% compared to our previous earnings record of $5.98 per diluted share reported in 2008. 
Our strategy for profitable growth is working. Nucor continues to benefit from our long-standing tradition of investing opportunistically through economic cycles to grow long-term earnings power. 
Nucor also generated exceptionally strong cash flow over the course of 2018. For the year, cash provided by operating activities totaled approximately $2.4 billion as compared with 2017's operating cash flow of approximately $1.1 billion. These results, combined with our disciplined approach to capital allocation, enabled us to return more than $1.3 billion to shareholders via dividends of $485 million and share repurchases of $854 million. After repurchasing 13.7 million shares last year, Nucor ended 2018 with approximately 306 million shares outstanding. $1.5 billion remains available under Nucor's existing share repurchase authorization. And in addition, in December, Nucor's board increased our regular quarterly cash dividend by more than 5% to $0.40 per share. Our company has increased its base dividend for 46 consecutive years, every year since we first began paying dividends in 1973. Nucor's long-term success in rewarding our shareholders has been and will continue to be driven by effective and balanced capital allocation. Our ongoing investments to deliver future profitable growth are the vital foundation to that work. 
For 2019, we estimate capital expenditures of approximately $1.8 billion. That represents a significant increase from 2018 capital spending of approximately $1 billion. Approximately 70% of planned 2019 capital expenditures are for expansion, product improvement and cost-savings projects, with the remaining 30% for replacement or maintenance purposes.
As John has already noted, Nucor has announced 10 significant growth projects to represent total capital investment of approximately $3.5 billion that will begin operations between 2019 and 2022. Of these capital outlays, approximately $600 million has been spent through 2018. An estimated $900 million will be spent in 2019, and the remaining investments of about $2 billion will occur through the end of 2022. 
We are excited about the impact that these investments will have for Nucor and all its stakeholders. We are directing our capital very strategically towards clear market opportunities and expect these projects to provide incremental EBITDA exceeding $600 million during normal market conditions. Nucor is already among the most diversified steel producers in the world with leadership positions in numerous products, regions and end-use markets. These investments will enhance those leadership positions and position Nucor to outperform the industry for many years to come. 
We intend to fund these investments with internally generated cash flow and plan to continue returning a minimum of 40% of our earnings to our shareholders while maintaining our strong financial condition. 
With respect to our balance sheet. At year-end, our total debt outstanding was $4.3 billion, and our gross debt-to-capital ratio was 30%. Our year-end cash and short-term investments totaled approximately $1.4 billion. 
Now turning to our outlook. John has already mentioned the positive trends we are observing in our major end-use markets. We do think that 2019 will be another strong year with earnings performance among the best in Nucor's history.
For the first quarter of 2019, although sheet pricing and margins are expected to decrease compared to the fourth quarter of 2018, we expect that this will be partially offset by increases in profitability at our bar and structural mills. 
The performance of the raw materials segment is expected to decrease in the first quarter of 2019 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 due to the decreased performance of our DRI businesses. 
We expect the profitability of our steel products segment in the first quarter of 2019 to be similar to the fourth quarter of 2018. 
Overall, we do expect that the first quarter of 2019 will be much stronger for Nucor than the first quarter of 2018. 
Thank you for your interest in our company. Now I'll turn the call back over to John. John?"

Let me conclude by thanking our more than 25,000 teammates across Nucor for making 2018 a record year for our company. Your efforts, not just in 2018, but as we pursued our growth strategy over the last decade, enabled us to obtain this milestone. I am proud that we could recognize your hard work with an extraordinary bonus last year. You certainly deserved it. The team at Charlotte appreciates the work you do every day to build a safer and more profitable Nucor.

But firstly, when you look at your long products portfolio, you've seen pretty significant change in metal spread across most all your long product categories as well as plate. So I just did some quick numbers looking at 1Q '18 versus 4Q '18, and it's about $1.6 billion of incremental EBITDA run rate just on metal spread change. So first question is, do you think that fundamentals for those products in terms of consolidation of the bar market, tariffs, is everything you're seeing on the demand side, would that suggest, do you think, margins would stay elevated relative to where you were this year? And then second question, similarly just on the downstream businesses. Obviously, HSS had a very good performance this year. Do you think that hollow structural pricing can stay relatively solid, even though we've seen clearly a big step-down in HRC, and just talk to how we should model that business?"

That includes our long products. So we see another good year for that. I'm not going to comment on what's happening with any of our competitors. I'll just refer to the demand and say the demand looks good going forward. We continue to work with some projects that will actually help us in 2019 lower our cost structure in some of the capital projects that we're bringing online. We're excited about that. So with demand strong, plus bringing on some capacity that we think will be very competitive in the marketplace, we think it's going to be a good strong year for our long products. And plate looks really good going into the year also. I don't see anything changing there, slipping just a little bit as we start the year, but the end demand remains strong. So I think it's going to be a good year for that also. Now to address your question on HSS, that has been just an outstanding business for us, both the HSS and the conduit business. Certainly, we'll see pricing dip a little bit with HR -- with hot band dipping a little bit, but the margins should stay pretty constant. And so we think -- and demand is certainly good. And as you might have heard, we just announced a price increase of $40 on HR and on our -- or on our flat-rolled products and also on the HSS. So we see that market picking up in terms of pricing."

And we're looking forward to 2019 as we expect some expansion in margins with steel prices having come down slightly. In regards to your second part of the question, which was rebar fab, that is one of the still challenging markets that we have. That's no secret. That market has been challenged, especially in the U.S., for the last 12 to 18 months. Demand is solid, imports have declined, and rebar steel costs have risen. However, the marketplace fabrication pricing has not yet fully reacted to that. We are encouraged, however, recently by the pricing dynamics that we're starting to see. We do have a backlog.

But I'll -- let me address the first question. When you look at what's come online today, particularly in the sheet markets, exclusively in the sheet market, you're looking at about 2.5 million tons of new capacity coming online. Imports are down about 1 million tons. So you have a net of about 1.5 million tons in a market that's 60 million tons overall the whole sheet market. So it's not that great of a change. At the end of the day, the most cost competitive, most efficient, best operating company will be one that does the best regardless of what happens with capacity coming online. And we think we do pretty well in all of those areas. So will there be some shake-out? Probably. Are we seeing a major impact today? Some. I don't believe that the current pricing situation that you see today is a result of that additional capacity. I believe that some of it is a result of the service center buildup that took place at the end of last year. And there's going to be a period of time when they're looking to unload some of those tons. When you look at the months on hand for sheet products, you can kind of see where we -- what happens over the months between October and December. So there's some of that going forward. But the key thing here is demand continues to be strong, and we think that demand will continue to grow. Our best estimate today on sheet is probably about 1.5% to 2% growth over the course of this year. So between the demand growth, as we work our way out of this inventory situation that's short-lived, I think you're going to see things start to return  to a more normalized state. We announced the price increase the other day, and we would not do it if we weren't confident that we'd be able to collect on it."

Thank you for joining us for our first quarter earnings call, and thank you for your interest in Nucor.

Thank you for joining us for our first quarter earnings call, and thank you for your interest in Nucor. Other members of Nucor's executive team are also on the call today including Jim Frias, our Chief Financial Officer; Joe Stratman, our Chief Digital Officer; Craig Feldman, responsible for raw materials; Ladd Hall, responsible for sheet and tubular products; Ray Napolitan, responsible for engineered bar products; Dave Sumoski, responsible for merchant bar and rebar products; Leon Topalian, responsible for beam and plate products; and Chad Utermark, responsible for fabricated construction products. 
Last week, Joe Stratman announced his plans to retire from Nucor on June 8 after more than 29 years of dedicated service to Nucor. Joe has been an exceptional and resourceful leader who has made outstanding contributions throughout his career with Nucor, which has included key roles in our steel, raw materials and steel products businesses. Joe also served as our Executive Vice President of Business Development and most recently as our Chief Digital Officer. Joe, thank you for your leadership. You have played a key role in positioning Nucor for continued success in the years to come. Speaking personally and on behalf of our 26,000 teammates, we want you to know that you will be missed and that we wish you and Jill the very best as you begin this new chapter in your life. 
Effective May 19, MaryEmily Slate rate will be promoted to Executive Vice President and will assume responsibilities for the tubular products group, logistics and certain joint ventures. MaryEmily is a dynamic leader with 19 years of experience at Nucor in senior sales and operational management roles. We look forward to her building on the success that Ladd Hall and his team have achieved in tubular products. 
Ladd Hall will continue to serve as Executive Vice President of sheet products. Ray Napolitan will assume responsibility with Nucor's digital initiatives while also continuing in his role as EVP of engineered bar products. 
Before we discuss our strong first quarter results, I want to emphasize that safety is the #1 priority for everyone on the Nucor team. While we consistently lead the industry in safety outcomes, our goal remains 0 incidents at every Nucor facility. We will keep working to achieve this goal by continuously identifying and mitigating safety risks. That is the mindset that will drive our success. By working together the Nucor way, I have no doubt that we can achieve our goal of 0 incidents. 
And while I'm on the subject of a safety, I'd also like to congratulate and thank our teammates at Nucor Gallatin for being recognized as a VPP star site by Kentucky's division of education and training. Nucor Gallatin is only the 13th site to be awarded this designation by the Commonwealth of Kentucky. To those of you who are not familiar, Kentucky's VPP, or the Voluntary Protection Partnership program, is similar to the federal government's OSHA VPP program. These programs are the gold standard by implementing and maintaining safety and health management systems. To achieve VPP status, the company's must meet rigorous qualifying criteria and undergo an extensive on-site evaluation. After a 2-year process, Gallatin is the 24th Nucor division to achieve this impressive recognition. Each of our VPP starred divisions must demonstrate continuous improvement in safety and health in order to maintain the designation going forward. Congratulations again to my teammates at Gallatin on this outstanding achievement, and my continued thanks to all Nucor teammates who put safety first every day. Let's continue to set the bar higher for all manufacturers and lead the way towards better safety outcomes for all. 
Moving on to our first quarter results. Nucor achieved significant year-over-year improvement in our first quarter earnings, again demonstrating the value of our position as North America's most diversified producer of steel and steel products. The steelmaking operations that contributed most significantly to the improvement over the prior year include our plate, rebar, merchant bar, engineered bar and beam mills. Several of our downstream businesses also achieved earnings gains compared to the first quarter of 2018 including our metal buildings, joist and deck products and piling products. Jim Frias will discuss these results and outlook in more detail shortly. 
There's been a lot of commentary about capacity expansion plans announced by the U.S. steel industry. While we will not speak to the plans of other participants in our industry, Nucor's long-term strategy for profitable growth is both disciplined and sustainable. Sustainability is achieved by making strategic investments that position Nucor to deliver a superior value proposition in cost, quality and service to our customers. Discipline is driven by Nucor's laser focus on being effective stewards of the capital that our shareholders entrust to us. We only deploy capital on growth projects when we identify high return opportunities that will create value for our shareholders. 
Importantly, our senior management incentive compensation plans are directly tied to Nucor's return on equity and return on capital performance, aligning pay with performance and value creation. 
We have announced 10 significant growth projects. We anticipate that 6 of these projects will begin operating this year including the new specialty cold rolling mill at Nucor Steel Arkansas which came online during the first quarter. We expect all 10 of these projects to be in operation by 2022. These projects will create approximately 1,500 direct jobs and we believe at least 7,500 indirect jobs. 
With respect to the 6 projects set to begin operations this year, 3 projects expand the value-added capabilities of our flat-rolled steel operations and the other 3 projects improve the competitive position of our rebar and merchant bar long products businesses.  
Let me provide more detail about the new specialty cold rolling mill at Nucor Steel Arkansas and 2 others that will start up this summer. First, our new specialty cold rolling mill at Nucor Steel Arkansas had a successful startup in March. We have already delivered to customers prime product, both pickled and oiled as well as fully processed cold-rolled product, and production continues to ramp up. This flexible cold reduction mill expands our capability to produce lamination, high strength low alloy and advance high-strength steel products. Congratulations to the entire Nucor Steel Arkansas team on a very successful start-up. 
The second project, Nucor Steel Marion's new in-line rolling mill, is scheduled to start up in the third quarter. A newly installed reheat furnace is running well and delivering the anticipated reductions in energy use. These upgrades will significantly improve Marion's cost structure and position the million as the leader in the regional rebar market that it serves. 
And third, we expect our sheet mill in Kentucky, Nucor Steel Gallatin, to begin producing pickled and oiled coils in July and galvanized coils in August. The mill's new 72-inch galvanizing line will be the widest hot-rolled galvanizing facility in North America. It expands our capability to serve the automotive and other value-added markets. 
Three other projects, our joint venture galvanizing line with JFE Steel in Mexico, the merchant bar mill expansion in Illinois and the new rebar micro mill in Missouri are all on track to start up later in 2019. I also should mention that we have recently received or commenced -- and commenced construction on our Florida rebar micro mill. We are targeting start-up there in mid-2020. 
In March, we announced our plans to build a new state-of-the-art plate mill in Brandenberg, Kentucky. This is a strategic move to solidify Nucor's position as the leader in the U.S. plate market not just in terms of volume but also quality, reliability and cost. The new mill will give us the ability to produce 97% of the plate products consumed in the United States including specialty high-margin grades. 
Our site on the Ohio River is located in the center of the country's largest plate-consuming market strengthening our ability to serve our customers with lower freight costs and superior on-time delivery. Further, we will be in a region with abundant low-cost scrap that is well covered by our David J. Joseph scrap business. We are excited about this investment and an entire pipeline of value-enhancing growth projects. 
Nucor has achieved success over the past 5 decades by building market leadership positions and we have done this by providing our customers with unmatched performance in quality, cost, product range and on-time delivery. At Nucor, we build powerful partnerships that deliver powerful results. The more successful we can make our customers, the greater success we will have as Nucor shareholders and teammates. Jim Frias will now provide more specific detail about our first quarter performance as well as our outlook for the remainder of this year. Jim?"

Nucor reported first quarter of 2019 earnings of $1.63 per diluted share. Included in these results was a benefit of $0.08 per diluted share related to the gain on the sale of an investment in our raw materials segment. Excluding this nonrecurring gain, first quarter performance exceeded our guidance range of $1.45 to $1.50 per diluted share. As John discussed, Nucor continues to benefit from our diversified business model. 
Another key strength at Nucor's business model is strong through-the-cycle cash flow generation. First quarter 2019 cash provided from operations was $651 million even after funding just over $300 million in profit sharing by Nucor teammates in 2018. Inventory was a source of about $108 million in the quarter even as net sales were approximately 10% higher year-on-year. 
Consistent with Nucor's disciplined approach to capital allocation, other major uses of cash during the quarter were capital expenditures of $289 million, dividends of $123 million and stock repurchases of $73 million. We returned almost 40% of net income for the quarter to our shareholders while also investing for long-term profitable growth. We ended the quarter with $1.6 billion in cash on hand. 
Nucor teammates are executing the current stages of our long-term growth strategy, and we therefore expire to expect our capital spending as the year progresses. For the full year of 2019, we continue to estimate that our capital expenditures will total approximately $1.8 billion. 
Nucor's financial condition remains strong. With total debt outstanding of $4.3 billion, our gross debt-to-capital ratio was 29% at the end of the first quarter. Our $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility remains undrawn and does not mature until April of 2023. It is worth noting that our first quarter results included $19.6 million of pre-operating start-up costs related to strategic investment projects. That is an increase from $17.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 and $2.3 million in the year ago first quarter. 
Now turning to the outlook. We expect 2019 to be another robust earnings year for Nucor. We continue to be encouraged by the overall strength of our domestic end-use markets. In fact, we see stable or improving demand in 21 of the 24 end-use markets we monitor. One market, power transmission, is seeing meaningful decline due to the completion of major grid extension projects in 2018. Automotive OEMs and automotive suppliers comprise the other 2 markets that we expect to decline for the year. However, we anticipate that the decline in automotive unit volumes will be moderate and that Nucor will actually grow its shipments to these customers in 2019. Of course, the largest source of demand for our products are applications in nonresidential construction which appears set for another solid year in 2019. 
Earnings in the second quarter of 2019 are expected to be similar to the first quarter excluding the gain on the sale of the investment. We expect similar linked-quarter performance in the steel mill segment as improvement in margins for structural and bar mill products offset weakening margins in our sheet and plate mills. The steel product segment is expected to achieve significant improvement in the second quarter over the first quarter as typical seasonal patterns and improved weather conditions benefit construction activity. The performance of the raw materials segment is expected to decline in the second quarter compared to the first quarter due to further margin pressure at our direct reduced iron or plants. Thank you for your interest in our company. I will now turn the call over to John."

Before we take questions, I wanted to make a few remarks about trade. Nucor has long maintained and, more importantly, consistently demonstrated that when operating on a level playing field, we can successfully compete with any steel producer in the world. Free and fair trade is a critical underpinning to the continued success of both Nucor and our customers. While much of the focus has been on Section 232 steel tariffs, prosecuting trade cases remains vital to ensuring a level playing field. For that reason, Nucor applauds the recent determination by the U.S. international trade commission that there is reasonable indication of material injury from imports of fabricated structural steel from China, Canada and Mexico that are subsidized and sold into the United States at less than fair value. More effective enforcement of rules-based trade has made a significant contribution to the improved performance of the U.S. economy in recent years, benefiting the steel industry and the entire domestic manufacturing sector. 
2019 is going to be another exciting year for our company as we continue to bring new projects online. We will continue to pursue profitable growth opportunities and we remain confident that Nucor's diversified business model will enable us to continue to outperform the industry over the course of the economic cycle. 
Thank you to our more than 26,000 teammates for the way you execute our strategy, and thank you for the work that you do every day to build a safe and more profitable Nucor.

Now we've mentioned that we see demand pretty consistent, in fact, maybe a little bit growing on the sheet side, on the side. When you look at order entry over the last couple of weeks, marginal growth, small growth but a good sign. So as we go into the second quarter, we expect the volumes to be about the same, particularly in those products that you mentioned. Our downstream businesses might see a little bit better volume based on the weather conditions that are improving. We had a long winter. We have a very wet spring. It seems to be correcting now, so we might see a bit of a pickup in our downstream businesses. But overall, I think going into the quarter, I would say volumes are going to be pretty consistent. In terms of the second question, remember, first of all, that this is a preliminary position, so we don't have a final ruling on this yet. We are optimistic that we will get a positive outcome in the final determination. I will tell you that this could be very good news for us. We've been seeing a lot of -- we sell about 50% of our beam structural products into our fabricating businesses. That's about 1 million tons a year that we sell into fabricated steel construction, and it hurt. It hurt on demand. It hurt on pricing. And we think that, that is a result of truly dumped and with the illegally and unfairly traded products coming in, Canada, Mexico and China being as violators of our trade laws in this product. So we see that as a big plus and we get a positive outcome. We're confident we're going to get positive outcome and we'll just wait and see what happens."

We're still collecting just over 30 days to collect our receivables. So there's not an opportunity to shorten the collection of receivables, but you're right. As prices would fall, we can benefit. And in fact, if you think back to 2015, we had a pretty weak earnings year despite dramatically but we had a year of very strong cash from operations because of working capital liquidation. And then the inventory side of course, when steel prices fall down, scrap prices fall down, so the overall cost of all of our inventories get lower, and of course, we do lower our volumes inventories a little bit when business activity is at a lower level. So yes, there's -- in a severe downturn, there's an opportunity for some shrinking working capital. Now if look what just happened in the first quarter, working capital is fairly neutral, whereas last year, it was a drag on earnings of several hundred million dollars, maybe $600 million. So what we're seeing right now is more of a stable environment for working capital whereas last year was building with the expansion of margins."

A lot of the investments that we're making will continue to allow us to grow our market share in those areas, and specifically, I would mention the cold mill project at. I would mention the Gallatin expansion project. That's another one that is going to get us to the automotive product. So going forward, we see our market share continue to grow in automotive. You asked specifically about where do we see us currently, and we'll do about 1.6 million tons this year, and by the end of the year, I think we'll be operating at the pace of about 2 million tons per year at an annual rate of about 2 million tons a year by the end of this year.

The first one your last one is exactly correct. There's a lot of things going on in the market today. The demand remains strong but we see a lot of things happening. one example I will give you is that a lot of the service center inventories are coming down quickly and they are getting them. It's pretty low levels. It's still a good amount of sales between service centers as they continue the workflow numbers at the end of last year. So you see some of that activity taking place. The weather, as I said, impacted the first half of the year. We see that going up now as we go forward. The other issue that I would give you is we scrap coming down. Our customers tend to hold off. We need to see what's going to happen with the scrap. So there's I believe -- I personally believe there's a lot of pent-up demand. People are waiting to see what's going to happen on scrap and in other areas, but remember the basics. Demand continues to be good. Imports continue to be lower than they were last year and they continue to be down, okay, year-over-year for certain. So at some point, we do believe that we're going to see the volumes start to pick up as we go through the second half of the year. We're talking about the overall volume being consistent year-to-year but it's over the course of the year with the pickup in the second half. At the end of the day, I can tell you that as we said in the opening statement, we look at 24 end markets. We talk with these customers all the time and they are very optimistic -- our customers are very optimistic about what's going on in the marketplace. And a final -- with me is customers to last year, they got a little bit heavy in their inventories because of hedged volume and they got ahead of the 232. They got some heavy loads that they're still working their way through. So a lot of things going on, Timna. But at the end of the day, I look at markets. I look at what the customers are saying and frankly one of the things that I would point out that I think is often missed in the market and some analysts is we participate in so many of the downstream markets that we sell into that we get a really good feel for what's happening in those markets, obviously, in fabrication and metal buildings and tubular. So we think in those markets have a good sense of what's happening in those markets and we still feel optimistic about the demand that we see it in those markets as well as in the other markets. I don't know if that will help you connect the dots."

I'm not going to speak specifically to any competitor. But when you have new people coming back into the market, they've got to earn their way into the market sometimes say they've got to buy their way into the market. So we see some of that going on with new entries into the marketplace. Obviously, when you start up a mill or restart a mill, there's issues with some quality and deliveries and so forth that cause you to be a little bit lower priced to gain the market share you're looking to gain. So that puts a drag on to the market. Obviously, it was mentioned in the first part of my answer, scrap pricing going down. Based on expectation by buyers, there'll be a better price tomorrow than there is today, and they hold back. That forces us to be more responsive on pricing. So it's not always the case of pricing following exactly what's happening on volumes and demand. But I will tell you that when you look at that relative to the fact that demand is strong, scrap pricing is going down and even if the steel pricing is going down, the metal margins we think are going to be good, maybe slightly improving as we go forward. so again, still pretty optimistic about the market. One of the things I'm asked often is how our competitors -- to last year, and I answer by saying this is a pretty good year. We're going to have a really good year. Will it be as good as last year? Maybe not. I'll tell you what, it's been a lot better than most of the year than we've ever had in the 5, the last 10 years. That's for sure. It's a good year."

And the DRI plant in Louisiana, just set it once, this has been running very, very well. There's not been an issue with our operations there. The issue on performance is the fact that we sell our DRI to our home mills with the pig iron pricing is -- pig iron pricing has been coming down, so for us, our selling price of the DRI and adjusted for value and use must be going down also. So that's been the biggest impact in the first half. We did have a short outage. I think it was about 12 days where we had a valve fail. It was not a major issue. We did not have to take it offline and do all the things that we do to cause weeks of service. We did have a small outage of about 12 days but that was not a significant impact. It was basically the fact that pig iron pricing is going down, so DRI pricing is going down. Now that's bad news on our DRI side. Bear in mind that we produce about 3.5 million tons of DRI. We buy about 3.5 million to 4 million tons of pig iron. So what we lose on the bananas, we kind of make up on the tomatoes a little bit. So it's a nice hedging situation where we do lose it on the DRI, but it's nice to get the better price on the pig iron. But one more point, you did mention the second half and I do want to give everyone an update on that. We did mention that there will be a 60-day average. It is going to be probably towards the end of August, middle to end of August and it will be down for 60 days. It's going to make major repairs to our furnace vessel, to the control systems and to the refractory to deal with the reliability issues that we've had in the past in those areas. And it was one more major work that we have to do which will be towards the -- probably early next year and I would be on the material handling side. But right now, it's the -- as you know, the big problem that we've always had was with the process gas heater and that's the major repair that we're making. A second issue we've had in the past probably the #2 issue with reliability was on refractory and we'll also be doing that during the 60-day outage. And at the beginning of next year, we will not have a major impact to the operation but we will be doing another large project on our material handling side to improve efficiencies."

Over the years, you've had some positives there. Some, we had negatives and I know you're working to rectify that. But should we be thinking that over the course of the cycle given there will be times when iron ore is expensive and the pig iron isn't like it is now, that this asset will be essentially just a cost center for you through the cycle?"

Thank you for joining us for our first quarter earnings call, and thank you for your interest in Nucor. Other members of Nucor's executive team are also on the call today including Jim Frias, our Chief Financial Officer; Joe Stratman, our Chief Digital Officer; Craig Feldman, responsible for raw materials; Ladd Hall, responsible for sheet and tubular products; Ray Napolitan, responsible for engineered bar products; Dave Sumoski, responsible for merchant bar and rebar products; Leon Topalian, responsible for beam and plate products; and Chad Utermark, responsible for fabricated construction products.
Last week, Joe Stratman announced his plans to retire from Nucor on June 8 after more than 29 years of dedicated service to Nucor. Joe has been an exceptional and resourceful leader who has made outstanding contributions throughout his career with Nucor, which has included key roles in our steel, raw materials and steel products businesses. Joe also served as our Executive Vice President of Business Development and most recently as our Chief Digital Officer. Joe, thank you for your leadership. You have played a key role in positioning Nucor for continued success in the years to come. Speaking personally and on behalf of our 26,000 teammates, we want you to know that you will be missed and that we wish you and Jill the very best as you begin this new chapter in your life.
Effective May 19, MaryEmily Slate will be promoted to Executive Vice President and will assume responsibilities for the tubular products group, logistics and certain joint ventures. MaryEmily is a dynamic leader with 19 years of experience at Nucor in senior sales and operational management roles. We look forward to her building on the success that Ladd Hall and his team have achieved in tubular products.
Ladd Hall will continue to serve as Executive Vice President of Sheet Products. Ray Napolitan will assume responsibility with Nucor's digital initiatives while also continuing in his role as EVP of Engineered Bar Products.
Before we discuss our strong first quarter results, I want to emphasize that safety is the #1 priority for everyone on the Nucor team. While we consistently lead the industry in safety outcomes, our goal remains 0 incidents at every Nucor facility. We will keep working to achieve this goal by continuously identifying and mitigating safety risks. That is the mindset that will drive our success. By working together the Nucor way, I have no doubt that we can achieve our goal of 0 incidents.
And while I'm on the subject of a safety, I would also like to congratulate and thank our teammates at Nucor Gallatin for being recognized as a VPP Star site by Kentucky's division of education and training. Nucor Gallatin is only the 13th site to be awarded this designation by the Commonwealth of Kentucky. For those of you who are not familiar, Kentucky's VPP, or the Voluntary Protection Partnership program, is similar to the federal government's OSHA VPP program. These programs are the gold standard by implementing and maintaining safety and health management systems. To achieve VPP status, companies must meet rigorous qualifying criteria and undergo an extensive on-site evaluation. After a 2-year process, Gallatin is the 24th Nucor division to achieve this impressive recognition. Each of our VPP starred divisions must demonstrate continuous improvement in safety and health in order to maintain the designation going forward. 
Congratulations again to my teammates at Gallatin on this outstanding achievement, and my continued thanks to all Nucor teammates who put safety first every day. Let's continue to set the bar higher for all manufacturers and lead the way towards better safety outcomes for all.
Moving on to our first quarter results. Nucor achieved significant year-over-year improvement in our first quarter earnings, again demonstrating the value of our position as North America's most diversified producer of steel and steel products. The steelmaking operations that contributed most significantly to the improvement over the prior year include our plate, rebar, merchant bar, engineered bar and beam mills. Several of our downstream businesses also achieved earnings gains compared to the first quarter of 2018 including our metal buildings, joist and deck products and piling products. Jim Frias will discuss these results and outlook in more detail shortly.
There's been a lot of commentary about capacity expansion plans announced by the U.S. steel industry. While we will not speak to the plans of other participants in our industry, Nucor's long-term strategy for profitable growth is both disciplined and sustainable. Sustainability is achieved by making strategic investments that position Nucor to deliver a superior value proposition in cost, quality and service to our customers. Discipline is driven by Nucor's laser focus on being effective stewards of the capital that our shareholders entrust to us. We only deploy capital on growth projects when we identify high return opportunities that will create value for our shareholders.
Importantly, our senior management incentive compensation plans are directly tied to Nucor's return on equity and return on capital performance, aligning pay with performance and value creation.
We have announced 10 significant growth projects. We anticipate that 6 of these projects will begin operating this year including the new specialty cold rolling mill at Nucor Steel Arkansas which came online during the first quarter. We expect all 10 of these projects to be in operation by 2022. These projects will create approximately 1,500 direct jobs and we believe at least 7,500 indirect jobs.
With respect to the 6 projects set to begin operations this year, 3 projects expand the value-added capabilities of our flat-rolled steel operations and the other 3 projects improve the competitive position of our rebar and merchant bar long products businesses.
Let me provide more detail about the new specialty cold rolling mill at Nucor Steel Arkansas and 2 others that will start up this summer. First, our new specialty cold rolling mill at Nucor Steel Arkansas had a successful startup in March. We have already delivered to customers prime product, both pickled and oiled as well as fully processed cold-rolled product, and production continues to ramp up. This flexible cold reduction mill expands our capability to produce motor lamination, high strength low alloy and advance high-strength steel products. Congratulations to the entire Nucor Steel Arkansas team on a very successful start-up.
The second project, Nucor Steel Marion's new in-line rolling mill, is scheduled to start up in the third quarter. The newly installed reheat furnace is running well and delivering the anticipated reductions in energy use. These upgrades will significantly improve Marion's cost structure and position the mill as the leader in the regional rebar market that it serves.
And third, we expect our sheet mill in Kentucky, Nucor Steel Gallatin, to begin producing pickled and oiled coils in July and galvanized coils in August. The mill's new 72-inch galvanizing line will be the widest hot-rolled galvanizing facility in North America. It expands our capability to serve the automotive and other value-added markets.
Three other projects, our joint venture galvanizing line with JFE Steel in Mexico, the merchant bar mill expansion in Illinois and the new rebar micro mill in Missouri are all on track for start-ups later in 2019. I also should mention that we have recently received our permits and commenced construction on our Frostproof, Florida rebar micro mill. We are targeting start-up there in mid-2020.
In March, we announced our plans to build a new state-of-the-art plate mill in Brandenberg, Kentucky. This is a strategic move to solidify Nucor's position as the leader in the U.S. plate market not just in terms of volume but also quality, reliability and cost. The new mill will give us the ability to produce 97% of the plate products consumed in the United States including specialty high-margin grades.
Our site on the Ohio River is located in the center of the country's largest plate-consuming market, strengthening our ability to serve our customers with lower freight costs and superior on-time delivery. Further, we will be in a region with abundant low-cost scrap that is well covered by our David J. Joseph scrap business. We are excited about this investment and our entire pipeline of value-enhancing growth projects.
Nucor has achieved success over the past 5 decades by building market leadership positions and we have done this by providing our customers with unmatched performance in quality, cost, product range and on-time delivery. At Nucor, we build powerful partnerships that deliver powerful results. The more successful we can make our customers, the greater success we will have as Nucor shareholders and teammates. 
Jim Frias will now provide more specific detail about our first quarter performance as well as our outlook for the remainder of this year. Jim?"

Included in these results was a benefit of $0.08 per diluted share related to the gain on the sale of an investment in our raw materials segment. Excluding this nonrec",591,"Thanks, John. Nucor reported first quarter of 2019 earnings of $1.63 per diluted share. Included in these results was a benefit of $0.08 per diluted share related to the gain on the sale of an investment in our raw materials segment. Excluding this nonrecurring gain, first quarter performance exceeded our guidance range of $1.45 to $1.50 per diluted share. As John discussed, Nucor continues to benefit from our diversified business model.
Another key strength at Nucor's business model is strong through-the-cycle cash flow generation. First quarter 2019 cash provided from operations was $651 million even after funding just over $300 million in profit sharing earned by Nucor teammates in 2018. Inventory was a source of about $108 million in the quarter even as net sales were approximately 10% higher year-on-year.
Consistent with Nucor's disciplined approach to capital allocation, other major uses of cash during the quarter were capital expenditures of $289 million, dividends of $123 million and stock repurchases of $73 million. We returned almost 40% of net income for the quarter to our shareholders while also investing for long-term profitable growth. We ended the quarter with $1.6 billion in cash on hand.
Nucor teammates are executing the current stages of our long-term growth strategy, and we therefore expect to accelerate our capital spending as the year progresses. For the full year of 2019, we continue to estimate that our capital expenditures will total approximately $1.8 billion.
Nucor's financial condition remains strong. With total debt outstanding of $4.3 billion, our gross debt-to-capital ratio was 29% at the end of the first quarter. Our $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility remains undrawn and does not mature until April of 2023. It is worth noting that our first quarter results included $19.6 million of pre-operating start-up costs related to strategic investment projects. That is an increase from $17.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 and $2.3 million in the year ago first quarter.
Now turning to the outlook. We expect 2019 to be another robust earnings year for Nucor. We continue to be encouraged by the overall strength of our domestic end-use markets. In fact, we see stable or improving demand in 21 of the 24 end-use markets we monitor. One market, power transmission, is seeing a meaningful decline due to the completion of major grid extension projects in 2018. Automotive OEMs and automotive suppliers comprise the other 2 markets that we expect to decline for the year. However, we anticipate that the decline in automotive unit volumes will be moderate and then Nucor will actually grow its shipments to these customers in 2019. Of course, the largest source of demand for our products are applications in nonresidential construction which appears set for another solid year in 2019. 
Earnings in the second quarter of 2019 are expected to be similar to the first quarter excluding the gain on the sale of the investment. We expect similar linked-quarter performance in the steel mill segment as improvement in margins for structural and bar mill products offset weakening margins at our sheet and plate mills. The steel product segment is expected to achieve significant improvement in the second quarter over the first quarter as typical seasonal patterns and improved weather conditions benefit construction activity. The performance of the raw materials segment is expected to decline in the second quarter compared to the first quarter due to further margin pressure at our direct reduced iron or DRI plants. 
Thank you for your interest in our company. I will now turn the call back over to John."

Before we take questions, I wanted to make a few remarks about trade. Nucor has long maintained and more importantly, consistently demonstrated that when operating on a level playing field, we can successfully compete with any steel producer in the world. Free and fair trade is a critical underpinning to the continued success of both Nucor and our customers. While much of the focus has been on Section 232 steel tariffs, prosecuting trade cases remains vital to ensuring a level playing field. For that reason, Nucor applauds the recent determination by the U.S. international trade commission that there is reasonable indication of material injury from imports of fabricated structural steel of China, Canada and Mexico that are subsidized and sold into the United States at less than fair value. More effective enforcement of rules-based trade has made a significant contribution to the improved performance of the U.S. economy in recent years, benefiting the steel industry and the entire domestic manufacturing sector.
2019 is going to be another exciting year for our company as we continue to bring new projects online. We will continue to pursue profitable growth opportunities and we remain confident that Nucor's diversified business model will enable us to continue to outperform the industry over the course of the economic cycle.
Thank you to our more than 26,000 teammates for the way you execute our strategy, and thank you for the work that you do every day to build a safe and more profitable Nucor. I'd also like to say thank you to our customers. We appreciate the trust you place in Nucor and we will continue to do our very best to earn it with every order. And finally, thank you to our investors for entrusting us with your valuable capital. We would now be happy to answer your questions. Operator?"

I'll tackle the first question first and heads on volumes going into the second quarter. We've mentioned that we see demand pretty consistent, in fact, maybe a little bit growing on the sheet side, on the hot end side. When we look at our order entry over the last couple of weeks, marginal growth, small growth but a good sign. So as we go into the second quarter, we expect the volumes to be about the same, particularly in those products that you mentioned. Our downstream businesses might see a little bit better volume based on the weather conditions that are improving. We had a long winter. We have a very wet spring. It seems to be correcting now, so we might see a bit of a pickup in our downstream businesses. But overall, I think going into the quarter, I would say our volumes are going to be pretty consistent. In terms of the second question, remember, first of all, that this is a preliminary position, so we don't have a final ruling on this yet. We are optimistic that we will get a positive outcome in the final determination. I will tell you that this could be very good news for us. We've been seeing a lot of -- we sell about 50% of our beam structural products into fabricating businesses. That's about 1 million tons a year that we sell into fabricated steel construction, and it hurt. It hurt on demand. It hurt on pricing. And we think that, that's a result of truly dumped and illegally and unfairly traded products coming in, Canada, Mexico and China being the 3 biggest violators of our trade laws in this product. So we see that as a big plus and we get a positive outcome. We're confident we're going to get a positive outcome and we'll just wait to see what happens."

They went up commensurate with the volume of business that we're conducting. So to the extent receivables went up, average prices were up. We're still collecting just over 30 days to collect our receivables. So there's not an opportunity to shorten the collection of receivables, but you're right. If prices were to fall further, we get benefit. And in fact, if you think back to 2015, we had a pretty weak earnings year as prices fell dramatically but we had a very strong cash from operations because of working capital liquidation. And then the inventory side of course, when steel prices fall down, scrap prices fall down, so the overall cost of all of our inventories gets lower, and of course, we do lower our volumes inventories a little bit when business activity is at lower level. So yes, there's -- in a severe downturn, there's an opportunity for some shrinking working capital. Now if we look at what just happened in the first quarter, working capital is fairly neutral, whereas last year, it was a drag on earnings of several hundred million dollars, maybe $600 million. So what we're seeing right now is more of a stable environment for working capital whereas last year was building with expansion of margins."

There's a lot of things going on in the market today. Demand remains strong but we see a lot of things happening. One example I would give you is that a lot of the service center inventories are coming down quickly and they are getting them. It's pretty low levels. It's still a good amount of inter sales between service centers as they continue to work off the numbers on the end of last year. So you see some of that activity taking place. The weather, as I said, impacted the first half of the year. We see that going up now as we go forward. The other issue that I would give you is as we see scrap coming down, our customers tend to hold off. We need to see what's going to happen with the scrap. So there's -- I believe -- I personally believe there's a lot of pent-up demand. People are waiting to see what's going to happen on scrap and in other areas, but remember the basics. Demand continues to be good. Imports continue to be lower than they were last year and they continue to be down, okay, year-over-year for certain. So at some point, we do believe that we're going to see the volumes start to pick up as we go through the second half of the year. When we're talking about the overall volume being consistent year-to-year, that's over the course of the year when they go pickup in the second half. At the end of the day, I can tell you that, as we said in the opening statement, we look at 24 end markets. We talk to these customers all the time and they are very optimistic -- our customers are very optimistic about what's going on in the marketplace. And a final point I would make is that some of our customers last year, they got a little bit heavy in their inventories because of hedged volume, they thought they'd get ahead of the 232. They got some heavy loads there that they're still working their way through. So a lot of things going on, Timna. But at the end of the day, I look at markets. I look at what our customers are saying and frankly, one of the things that I would point out that I think is often missed by the market and some analysts is we participate in so many of the downstream markets that we sell into that we get a really good feel for what's happening in those markets; obviously, in rebar fabrication and metal buildings and in tubular. So we being in those markets have a good sense of what's happening in those markets and we still feel optimistic about the demand that we see it in those markets as well as in our scale lots. I don't know if that will help you connect the dots."

I'm still a little confused and I'm confused about the next area, maybe that same answer but on price. So we've talked about volume but on price, I'm not going to hopefully put down the spot, but prices have been going down despite demand going up and more in the flat-rolled side, I recognize, and some of it's scrap. But why are domestic mills -- and I have to repeat myself here, but why are domestic mills charging at or below landed import prices if demand is so good and imports are down?"

I'm not going to speak specifically to any competitor. But when you have new people coming back into the market, they've got to earn their way into the market, sometimes you might even say they've got to buy their way into the market. So we see some of that going on with new entries into the marketplace. Obviously, when you start up a mill or restart a mill, there's issues with some quality and deliveries and so forth that cause you to be a little bit lower priced to gain the market share you're looking to gain. So that puts a drag onto the market. Obviously, and it wasn't mentioned in the first part of my answer, scrap pricing going down leads to an expectation by buyers that there'll be a better price tomorrow than there is today, so they hold back. That forces us to be a little bit more responsive on pricing. So it's not always the case of pricing following exactly what's happening on volumes and demand. But I will tell you that when you look at that relative to the fact that demand is strong, scrap pricing is going down and even if steel pricing is going down, the metal margins we think are going to be good, maybe slightly improving as we go forward. So again, still pretty optimistic about the market. One of the things that I'm asked often is how do I compare this year to last year, and I answer by saying this is a good year. We're going to have a really good year. Will it be as good as last year? Maybe not. I'll tell you what, it's been -- going to be a lot better than most of the years we've ever had in the 10 years. That's for sure. It's going to be a good year."

And the DRI plant Louisiana, just to set everyone's mind, that it has been running very, very well. There's not been an issue with our operations there. The issue on performance is the fact that we sell our DRI to our home mills at what the pig iron pricing is. Pig iron pricing has been coming down, so for us, our selling price of the DRI, adjusted for value and use, must be going down also. So that's been the biggest impact in the first half. We did have a short outage. I think it was about 12 days where we had a valve fail. It was not a major issue. We did not have to take it offline and do all the things that we do to cause weeks of service. We did have a small outage of about 12 days but that was not a significant impact. It was basically the fact that pig iron pricing is going down, so DRI pricing is going down. Now that's bad news on our DRI side. But bear in mind that we produce about 3.5 million tons of DRI. We buy about 3.5 million to 4 million tons of pig iron. So what we lose on the bananas, we kind of make up on the tomatoes a little bit. So it's a nice hedging situation where we do lose it on the DRI, but it's nice to get the better price on the pig iron. But one more point, you did mention the second half and I do want to give everyone an update on that. We did mention that there will be a 60-day outage. It is going to be -- we're going to be down probably towards the end of August, middle to end of August and we'll be down for 60 days. It's going to make major repairs to our furnace vessel, to the control systems and to the refractory to deal with the reliability issues that we've had in the past in those areas. And there's one more major work that we have to do which will be towards the -- probably early next year and I would be on the material handling side. But right now, it's the -- as you know, the big problem that we've always had was with the process gas heater and that's the major repair that we're making. A second issue we've had in the past probably the #2 issue with reliability was on refractory and we'll also going to be doing that during the 60-day outage. And at the beginning of next year, we will not have a major impact to the operation but we will be doing another large project on our material handling side to improve efficiencies."

Over the years, you've had some positives there. Some, we had negatives and I know you're working to rectify that. But should we be thinking that over the course of the cycle, given there will be times when iron ore is expensive and pig iron isn't, like it is now, that this asset will be essentially just a cost center for you through the cycle?"

Thank you for joining us for our first quarter earnings call, and thank you for your interest in Nucor. Other members of Nucor's executive team are also on the call today, including Jim Frias, our Chief Financial Officer; Joe Stratman, our Chief Digital Officer; Craig Feldman, responsible for raw materials; Ladd Hall, responsible for sheet and tubular products; Ray Napolitan, responsible for engineered bar products; Dave Sumoski, responsible for merchant bar and rebar products; Leon Topalian, responsible for beam and plate products; and Chad Utermark, responsible for fabricated construction products.
Last week, Joe Stratman announced his plans to retire from Nucor on June 8 after more than 29 years of dedicated service to Nucor. Joe has been an exceptional and resourceful leader who has made outstanding contributions throughout his career with Nucor, which has included key roles in our steel, raw materials and steel products businesses. Joe also served as our Executive Vice President of Business Development and most recently as our Chief Digital Officer. Joe, thank you for your leadership. You have played a key role in positioning Nucor for continued success in the years to come. Speaking personally and on behalf of our 26,000 teammates, we want you to know that you will be missed and that we wish you and Jill the very best as you begin this new chapter in your life.
Effective May 19, MaryEmily Slate will be promoted to Executive Vice President and will assume responsibilities for the tubular products group, logistics and certain joint ventures. MaryEmily is a dynamic leader with 19 years of experience at Nucor in senior sales and operational management roles. We look forward to her building on the success that Ladd Hall and his team have achieved in tubular products.
Ladd Hall will continue to serve as Executive Vice President of Sheet Products. Ray Napolitan will assume responsibility with Nucor's digital initiatives while also continuing in his role as EVP of Engineered Bar Products.
Before we discuss our strong first quarter results, I want to emphasize that safety is #1 priority for everyone on the Nucor team. While we consistently lead the industry in safety outcomes, our goal remains 0 incidents at every Nucor facility. We will keep working to achieve this goal by continuously identifying and mitigating safety risks. That is the mindset that will drive our success. By working together the Nucor way, I have no doubt that we can achieve our goal of 0 incidents.
And while I'm on the subject of safety, I would also like to congratulate and thank our teammates at Nucor Gallatin for being recognized as a VPP Star site by Kentucky's Division of Education and Training. Nucor Gallatin is only the 13th site to be awarded this designation by the Commonwealth of Kentucky. For those of you who are not familiar, Kentucky's VPP, or Voluntary Protection Partnership program, is similar to the federal government's OSHA VPP program. These programs are the gold standard for implementing and maintaining safety and health management systems. To achieve VPP status, companies must meet rigorous qualifying criteria and undergo an extensive on-site evaluation. After a 2-year process, Gallatin is the 24th Nucor division to achieve this impressive recognition. Each of our VPP Star divisions must demonstrate continuous improvement in safety and health in order to maintain the designation going forward. 
Congratulations again to my teammates at Gallatin on this outstanding achievement, and my continued thanks to all Nucor teammates who put safety first every day. Let's continue to set the bar higher for all manufacturers and lead the way towards better safety outcomes for all.
Moving on to our first quarter results. Nucor achieved significant year-over-year improvement in our first quarter earnings, again demonstrating the value of our position as North America's most diversified producer of steel and steel products. The steelmaking operations that contributed most significantly to the improvement over the prior year include our plate, rebar, merchant bar, engineered bar and beam mills. Several of our downstream businesses also achieved earnings gains compared to the first quarter of 2018, including our metal buildings, joist and deck products and piling products. Jim Frias will discuss these results and outlook in more detail shortly.
There's been a lot of commentary about capacity expansion plans announced by the U.S. steel industry. While we will not speak to the plans of other participants in our industry, Nucor's long-term strategy for profitable growth is both disciplined and sustainable. Sustainability is achieved by making strategic investments that position Nucor to deliver a superior value proposition in cost, quality and service to our customers. Discipline is driven by Nucor's laser focus on being effective stewards of the capital that our shareholders entrust to us. We only deploy capital on growth projects when we identify high-return opportunities that will create value for our shareholders.
Importantly, our senior management incentive compensation plans are directly tied to Nucor's return on equity and return on capital performance, aligning pay with performance and value creation.
We have announced 10 significant growth projects. We anticipate that 6 of these projects will begin operating this year, including the new specialty cold rolling mill at Nucor Steel Arkansas, which came online during the first quarter. We expect all 10 of these projects to be in operation by 2022. These projects will create approximately 1,500 direct jobs and we believe at least 7,500 indirect jobs.
With respect to the 6 projects set to begin operations this year, 3 projects expand the value-added capabilities of our flat-rolled steel operations and the other 3 projects improve the competitive position of our rebar and merchant bar long products businesses.
Let me provide more detail about the new specialty cold rolling mill at Nucor Steel Arkansas and 2 others that will start up this summer. First, our new specialty cold rolling mill at Nucor Steel Arkansas had a successful startup in March. We have already delivered to customers prime product, both pickled and oiled as well as fully processed cold-rolled product, and production continues to ramp up. This flexible cold reduction mill expands our capability to produce motor lamination, high-strength low alloy and advanced high-strength steel products. Congratulations to the entire Nucor Steel Arkansas team on a very successful start-up.
The second project, Nucor Steel Marion's new in-line rolling mill, is scheduled to start up in the third quarter. The newly installed reheat furnace is running well and delivering the anticipated reductions in energy use. These upgrades will significantly improve Marion's cost structure and position the mill as the leader in the regional rebar market that it serves.
And third, we expect our sheet mill in Kentucky, Nucor Steel Gallatin, to begin producing pickled and oiled coils in July and galvanized coils in August. The mill's new 72-inch galvanizing line will be the widest hot-rolled galvanizing facility in North America. It expands our capability to serve the automotive and other value-added markets.
Three other projects, our joint venture galvanizing line with JFE Steel in Mexico, the merchant bar mill expansion in Illinois and the new rebar micro mill in Missouri, are all on track for start-ups later in 2019. I also should mention that we have recently received our permits and commenced construction on our Frostproof, Florida rebar micro mill. We are targeting start-up there in mid-2020.
In March, we announced our plans to build a new state-of-the-art plate mill in Brandenburg, Kentucky. This is a strategic move to solidify Nucor's position as the leader in the U.S. plate market, not just in terms of volume but also quality, reliability and cost. The new mill will give us the ability to produce 97% of the plate products consumed in the United States, including specialty high-margin grades.
Our site on the Ohio River is located in the center of the country's largest plate-consuming market, strengthening our ability to serve our customers with lower freight costs and superior on-time delivery. Further, we will be in a region with abundant low-cost scrap that is well covered by our David J. Joseph scrap business. We are excited about this investment and our entire pipeline of value-enhancing growth projects.
Nucor has achieved success over the past 5 decades by building market leadership positions and we have done this by providing our customers with unmatched performance in quality, cost, product range and on-time delivery. At Nucor, we build powerful partnerships that deliver powerful results. The more successful we can make our customers, the greater success we will have as Nucor shareholders and teammates. 
Jim Frias will now provide more specific detail about our first quarter performance as well as our outlook for the remainder of this year. Jim?"

Nucor reported first quarter of 2019 earnings of $1.63 per diluted share. Included in these results was a benefit of $0.08 per diluted share related to the gain on the sale of an investment in our raw materials segment. Excluding this nonrecurring gain, first quarter performance exceeded our guidance range of $1.45 to $1.50 per diluted share. As John discussed, Nucor continues to benefit from our diversified business model.
Another key strength of Nucor's business model is strong, through-the-cycle cash flow generation. First quarter 2019 cash provided from operations was $651 million, even after funding just over $300 million in profit sharing earned by Nucor teammates in 2018. Inventory was a source of about $108 million in the quarter, even as net sales were approximately 10% higher year-on-year.
Consistent with Nucor's disciplined approach to capital allocation, other major uses of cash during the quarter were capital expenditures of $289 million, dividends of $123 million and stock repurchases of $73 million. We returned almost 40% of net income for the quarter to our shareholders while also investing for long-term profitable growth. We ended the quarter with $1.6 billion in cash on hand.
Nucor teammates are executing the current stages of our long-term growth strategy, and we therefore expect to accelerate our capital spending as the year progresses. For the full year of 2019, we continue to estimate that our capital expenditures will total approximately $1.8 billion.
Nucor's financial condition remains strong. With total debt outstanding of $4.3 billion, our gross debt-to-capital ratio was 29% at the end of the first quarter. Our $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility remains undrawn and does not mature until April of 2023. It is worth noting that our first quarter results included $19.6 million of pre-operating start-up costs related to strategic investment projects. That is an increase from $17.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 and $2.3 million in the year ago first quarter.
Now turning to the outlook. We expect 2019 to be another robust earnings year for Nucor. We continue to be encouraged by the overall strength of our domestic end-use markets. In fact, we see stable or improving demand in 21 of the 24 end-use markets we monitor. One market, power transmission, is seeing a meaningful decline due to the completion of major grid extension projects in 2018. Automotive OEMs and automotive suppliers comprise the other 2 markets that we expect to decline for the year. However, we anticipate that the decline in automotive unit volumes will be moderate and then Nucor will actually grow its shipments to these customers in 2019. Of course, the largest source of demand for our products are applications in nonresidential construction, which appears set for another solid year in 2019. 
Earnings in the second quarter of 2019 are expected to be similar to the first quarter, excluding the gain on the sale of the investment. We expect similar linked-quarter performance in the steel mill segment as improvement in margins for structural and bar mill products offset weakening margins at our sheet and plate mills. The steel product segment is expected to achieve significant improvement in the second quarter over the first quarter as typical seasonal patterns and improved weather conditions benefit construction activity. The performance of the raw materials segment is expected to decline in the second quarter compared to the first quarter due to further margin pressure at our direct reduced iron or DRI plants. 
Thank you for your interest in our company. I will now turn the call back over to John."

Before we take questions, I wanted to make a few remarks about trade. Nucor has long maintained and more importantly, consistently demonstrated, that when operating on a level playing field, we can successfully compete with any steel producer in the world. Free and fair trade is a critical underpinning to the continued success of both Nucor and our customers. While much of the focus has been on Section 232 steel tariffs, prosecuting trade cases remains vital to ensuring a level playing field. For that reason, Nucor applauds the recent determination by the U.S. International Trade Commission that there is reasonable indication of material injury from imports of fabricated structural steel from China, Canada and Mexico that are subsidized and sold into the United States at less than fair value. More effective enforcement of rules-based trade has made a significant contribution to the improved performance of the U.S. economy in recent years, benefiting the steel industry and the entire domestic manufacturing sector.
2019 is going to be another exciting year for our company as we continue to bring new projects online. We will continue to pursue profitable growth opportunities and we remain confident that Nucor's diversified business model will enable us to continue to outperform the industry over the course of the economic cycle.
Thank you to our more than 26,000 teammates for the way you execute our strategy, and thank you for the work that you do every day to build a safe and more profitable Nucor.

We've mentioned that we see demand pretty consistent, in fact, maybe a little bit growing on the sheet side, on the hot end side, when we look at our order entry over the last couple of weeks, marginal growth, small growth, but a good sign. So as we go into the second quarter, we expect the volumes to be about the same, particularly in those products that you mentioned. Our downstream businesses might see a little bit better volume based on the weather conditions that are improving. We had a long winter. We had a very wet spring. It seems to be correcting now, so we might see a bit of a pickup in our downstream businesses. But overall, I think going into the second quarter, I would say our volumes are going to be pretty consistent. In terms of the second question, remember, first of all, that this is a preliminary position, so we don't have a final ruling on this yet. We are optimistic that we will get a positive outcome in the final determination. I will tell you that this could be very good news for us. We've been seeing a lot of -- we sell about 50% of our beams, structural products, into fabricating businesses. That's about 1 million tons a year that we sell into fabricated steel construction, and it hurt. It hurt on demand. It hurt on pricing. And we think that, that's a result of truly dumped and illegally and unfairly traded products coming in, Canada, Mexico and China being the 3 biggest violators of our trade laws in this product. So we see that as a big plus if we get a positive outcome. We're confident we're going to get a positive outcome and we'll just wait to see what happens."

They went up commensurate with the volume of business that we're conducting. So to the extent receivables went up, average prices were up. We're still collecting -- just over 30 days to collect our receivables. So there's not an opportunity to shorten the collection of receivables, but you're right. If prices were to fall further, we'd get a benefit. And in fact, if you think back to 2015, we had a pretty weak earnings year as prices fell dramatically, but we generated very strong cash from operations because of working capital liquidation. And then the inventory side of course, when steel prices fall down, scrap prices fall down, so the overall cost of all of our inventories gets lower, and of course, we do lower our volumes inventories a little bit when business activity is at a lower level. So yes, there's -- in a severe downturn, there's an opportunity for some shrinking working capital. Now if we look at what just happened in the first quarter, working capital is fairly neutral, whereas last year, it was a drag on earnings of several hundred million dollars, maybe $600 million. So what we're seeing right now is more of a stable environment for working capital, whereas last year it was building with expansion of margins."

There's a lot of things going on in the market today. Demand remains strong, but we see a lot of things happening. One example I would give you is that although the service center inventories are coming down quickly, they -- they are getting to pretty low levels, there's still a good amount of inter sales between service centers as they continue to work off the numbers from the end of last year. So you see some of that activity taking place. The weather, as I said, impacted the first half of the year. We see that clearing up now as we go forward. 
The other issue that I would give you is as we see scrap coming down, our customers tend to hold off waiting to see what's going to happen with the scrap. So there's -- I believe, I personally believe there's a lot of pent-up demand. People are waiting to see what's going to happen on scrap and in other areas, but remember the basics. Demand continues to be good. Imports continue to be lower than they were last year and they continue to be down, okay, year-over-year for certain. So at some point, we do believe that we're going to see the volumes start to pick up as we go through the second half of the year. When we were talking about the overall volume being consistent year-to-year, that's over the course of the year; we think it will pick up in the second half. At the end of the day, I can tell you that, as we said in the opening statement, we look at 24 end markets. We talk to these customers all the time and they are very optimistic -- our customers are very optimistic about what's going on in the marketplace. 
And a final point I would make is that some of our customers last year, they got a little bit heavy in their inventories because of hedged buying, they thought they'd get ahead of the 232. They got some heavy loads there that they're still working their way through. So a lot of things going on, Timna. But at the end of the day, I look at markets. I look at what our customers are saying and frankly, one of the things that I would point out that I think is often missed by the market and some analysts is we participate in so many of the downstream markets that we sell into that we get a really good feel for what's happening in those markets. Obviously, in rebar fabrication and metal buildings and in tubular, so we being in those markets have a good sense of what's happening in those markets. And we still feel optimistic about the demand that we see in those markets as well as in our steel markets. I don't know, did that help you connect the dots?"

I'm not going to speak specifically to any competitor. But when you have new people coming back into the market, they've got to earn their way into the market, sometimes you might even say they've got to buy their way into the market. So we see some of that going on with new entries into the marketplace. Obviously, when you start up a mill or restart a mill, there's issues with some quality and deliveries and so forth that force you to be a little bit lower priced to gain the market share you're looking to gain. So that puts a drag on to the market. 
Obviously, and it wasn't mentioned in the first part of my answer, scrap pricing going down leads to an expectation by buyers that there'll be a better price tomorrow than there is today, so they hold back. That forces us to be a little bit more responsive on pricing. So it's not always the case of pricing following exactly what's happening on volumes and demand. But I will tell you that when you look at that relative to the fact that demand is strong, scrap pricing is going down and even if steel pricing is going down, the metal margins, we think, are going to be good, maybe slightly improving as we go forward. So again, still pretty optimistic about the market. One of the things that I'm asked often is how I compare this year to last year? And I answer by saying this is a good year. We're going to have a really good year. Will it be as good as last year? Maybe not. I'll tell you what, it's been -- going to be a lot better than most of the years we've had in the last 10 years, that's for sure. It's going to be a good year."

And the DRI plant in Louisiana, just to set everyone's mind at ease, that has been running very, very well. There's not been an issue with our operations there. The issue on performance is the fact that we sell our DRI to our own mills at what the pig iron pricing is. Pig iron pricing has been coming down, so of course, our selling price for the DRI, adjusted for value and use, must be going down also. So that's been the biggest impact in the first half. We did have a short outage, I think it was about 12 days, where we had a valve fail. It was not a major issue. We did not have to take it offline and do all the things that we do to cause weeks out of service. We did have a small outage of about 12 days, but that was not a significant impact. It was basically the fact that pig iron pricing is going down, so DRI pricing is going down. Now that's bad news on our DRI side, but bear in mind that we produce about 3.5 million tons of DRI. We buy about 3.5 million to 4 million tons of pig iron. So what we lose on the bananas, we kind of make up on the tomatoes a little bit. So it's a nice hedging situation where we do lose it on the DRI, but it's nice to get the better price on the pig iron. 
But one more point, you did mention the second half and I do want to give everyone an update on that. We did mention that there will be a 60-day outage. It is going to be -- we're going to be down probably towards the end of August, middle to end of August and we'll be down for 60 days. It's going to make major repairs to our furnace vessel, to the control systems and to the refractory to deal with the reliability issues that we've had in the past in those areas. And there's one more major work that we have to do, which will be towards the -- probably early next year and that would be on the material handling side. But right now, it's the -- as you know, the big problem that we've always had was with the process gas heater and that's the major repair that we're making. A second issue we've had in the past, probably the #2 issue with reliability, was on refractory and we'll also going to be doing that during the 60-day outage. And at the beginning of next year, we will not have a major impact to the operation, but we will be doing another large project on our material handling side to improve efficiencies."

Thank you for joining us for our first quarter earnings call and thank you for your interest in Nucor.

Thank you for joining us for our first quarter earnings call and thank you for your interest in Nucor. Other members of Nucor's executive team are also on the call today, including Jim Frias, our Chief Financial Officer; Joe Stratman, our Chief Digital Officer; Craig Feldman, responsible for raw materials; Ladd Hall, responsible for sheet and tubular products; Ray Napolitan, responsible for engineered bar products; Dave Sumoski, responsible for merchant bar and rebar products; Leon Topalian, responsible for beam and plate products; and Chad Utermark, responsible for fabricated construction products.
Last week, Joe Stratman announced his plans to retire from Nucor on June 8 after more than 29 years of dedicated service to Nucor. Joe has been an exceptional and resourceful leader who has made outstanding contributions throughout his career with Nucor, which has included key roles in our steel, raw materials and steel products businesses. Joe also served as our Executive Vice President of Business Development and most recently as our Chief Digital Officer. Joe, thank you for your leadership. You have played a key role in positioning Nucor for continued success in the years to come. Speaking personally and on behalf of our 26,000 teammates, we want you to know that you will be missed and that we wish you and Jill the very best as you begin this new chapter in your life.
Effective May 19, MaryEmily Slate will be promoted to Executive Vice President and will assume responsibilities for the tubular products group, logistics and certain joint ventures. MaryEmily is a dynamic leader with 19 years of experience at Nucor in senior sales and operational management roles. We look forward to her building on the success that Ladd Hall and his team have achieved in tubular products.
Ladd Hall will continue to serve as Executive Vice President of Sheet Products. Ray Napolitan will assume responsibility with Nucor's digital initiatives while also continuing in his role as EVP of Engineered Bar Products.
Before we discuss our strong first quarter results, I want to emphasize that safety is #1 priority for everyone on the Nucor team. While we consistently lead the industry in safety outcomes, our goal remains 0 incidents at every Nucor facility. We will keep working to achieve this goal by continuously identifying and mitigating safety risks. That is the mindset that will drive our success. By working together the Nucor way, I have no doubt that we can achieve our goal of 0 incidents.
And while I'm on the subject of safety, I would also like to congratulate and thank our teammates at Nucor Gallatin for being recognized as a VPP Star site by Kentucky's Division of Education and Training. Nucor Gallatin is only the 13th site to be awarded this designation by the Commonwealth of Kentucky. For those of you who are not familiar, Kentucky's VPP, or Voluntary Protection Partnership program, is similar to the federal government's OSHA VPP program. These programs are the gold standard for implementing and maintaining safety and health management systems. To achieve VPP status, companies must meet rigorous qualifying criteria and undergo an extensive on-site evaluation. After a 2-year process, Gallatin is the 24th Nucor division to achieve this impressive recognition. Each of our VPP Star divisions must demonstrate continuous improvement in safety and health in order to maintain the designation going forward. 
Congratulations again to my teammates at Gallatin on this outstanding achievement, and my continued thanks to all Nucor teammates who put safety first every day. Let's continue to set the bar higher for all manufacturers and lead the way towards better safety outcomes for all.
Moving on to our first quarter results. Nucor achieved significant year-over-year improvement in our first quarter earnings, again demonstrating the value of our position as North America's most diversified producer of steel and steel products. The steelmaking operations that contributed most significantly to the improvement over the prior year include our plate, rebar, merchant bar, engineered bar and beam mills. Several of our downstream businesses also achieved earnings gains compared to the first quarter of 2018, including our metal buildings, joist and deck products and piling products. Jim Frias will discuss these results and outlook in more detail shortly.
There's been a lot of commentary about capacity expansion plans announced by the U.S. steel industry. While we will not speak to the plans of other participants in our industry, Nucor's long-term strategy for profitable growth is both disciplined and sustainable. Sustainability is achieved by making strategic investments that position Nucor to deliver a superior value proposition in cost, quality and service to our customers. Discipline is driven by Nucor's laser focus on being effective stewards of the capital that our shareholders entrust to us. We only deploy capital on growth projects when we identify high-return opportunities that will create value for our shareholders.
Importantly, our senior management incentive compensation plans are directly tied to Nucor's return on equity and return on capital performance, aligning pay with performance and value creation.
We have announced 10 significant growth projects. We anticipate that 6 of these projects will begin operating this year, including the new specialty cold rolling mill at Nucor Steel Arkansas, which came online during the first quarter. We expect all 10 of these projects to be in operation by 2022. These projects will create approximately 1,500 direct jobs and we believe at least 7,500 indirect jobs.
With respect to the 6 projects set to begin operations this year, 3 projects expand the value-added capabilities of our flat-rolled steel operations and the other 3 projects improve the competitive position of our rebar and merchant bar long products businesses.
Let me provide more detail about the new specialty cold rolling mill at Nucor Steel Arkansas and 2 others that will start up this summer. First, our new specialty cold rolling mill at Nucor Steel Arkansas had a successful startup in March. We have already delivered to customers prime product, both pickled and oiled as well as fully processed cold-rolled product, and production continues to ramp up. This flexible cold reduction mill expands our capability to produce motor lamination, high-strength low alloy and advanced high-strength steel products. Congratulations to the entire Nucor Steel Arkansas team on a very successful start-up.
The second project, Nucor Steel Marion's new in-line rolling mill, is scheduled to start up in the third quarter. The newly installed reheat furnace is running well and delivering the anticipated reductions in energy use. These upgrades will significantly improve Marion's cost structure and position the mill as the leader in the regional rebar market that it serves.
And third, we expect our sheet mill in Kentucky, Nucor Steel Gallatin, to begin producing pickled and oiled coils in July and galvanized coils in August. The mill's new 72-inch galvanizing line will be the widest hot-rolled galvanizing facility in North America. It expands our capability to serve the automotive and other value-added markets.
Three other projects, our joint venture galvanizing line with JFE Steel in Mexico, the merchant bar mill expansion in Illinois and the new rebar micro mill in Missouri, are all on track for start-ups later in 2019. I also should mention that we have recently received our permits and commenced construction on our Frostproof, Florida rebar micro mill. We are targeting start-up there in mid-2020.
In March, we announced our plans to build a new state-of-the-art plate mill in Brandenburg, Kentucky. This is a strategic move to solidify Nucor's position as the leader in the U.S. plate market, not just in terms of volume but also quality, reliability and cost. The new mill will give us the ability to produce 97% of the plate products consumed in the United States, including specialty high-margin grades.
Our site on the Ohio River is located in the center of the country's largest plate-consuming market, strengthening our ability to serve our customers with lower freight costs and superior on-time delivery. Further, we will be in a region with abundant low-cost scrap that is well covered by our David J. Joseph scrap business. We are excited about this investment and our entire pipeline of value-enhancing growth projects.
Nucor has achieved success over the past 5 decades by building market leadership positions and we have done this by providing our customers with unmatched performance in quality, cost, product range and on-time delivery. At Nucor, we build powerful partnerships that deliver powerful results. The more successful we can make our customers, the greater success we will have as Nucor shareholders and teammates. 
Jim Frias will now provide more specific detail about our first quarter performance as well as our outlook for the remainder of this year. Jim?"
184945,608869566,1704177,"Nucor Corporation, Q1 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2019",2019-04-23,"Earnings Calls","Nucor Corporation","Executives","Thanks, John.

Nucor reported first quarter of 2019 earnings of $1.63 per diluted share. Included in these results was a benefit of $0.08 per diluted share related to the gain on the sale of an investment in our raw materials segment. Excluding this nonrecurring gain, first quarter performance exceeded our guidance range of $1.45 to $1.50 per diluted share. As John discussed, Nucor continues to benefit from our diversified business model.
Another key strength of Nucor's business model is strong, through-the-cycle cash flow generation. First quarter 2019 cash provided from operations was $651 million, even after funding just over $300 million in profit sharing earned by Nucor teammates in 2018. Inventory was a source of about $108 million in the quarter, even as net sales were approximately 10% higher year-on-year.
Consistent with Nucor's disciplined approach to capital allocation, other major uses of cash during the quarter were capital expenditures of $289 million, dividends of $123 million and stock repurchases of $73 million. We returned almost 40% of net income for the quarter to our shareholders while also investing for long-term profitable growth. We ended the quarter with $1.6 billion in cash on hand.
Nucor teammates are executing the current stages of our long-term growth strategy, and we therefore expect to accelerate our capital spending as the year progresses. For the full year of 2019, we continue to estimate that our capital expenditures will total approximately $1.8 billion.
Nucor's financial condition remains strong. With total debt outstanding of $4.3 billion, our gross debt-to-capital ratio was 29% at the end of the first quarter. Our $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility remains undrawn and does not mature until April of 2023. It is worth noting that our first quarter results included $19.6 million of pre-operating start-up costs related to strategic investment projects. That is an increase from $17.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 and $2.3 million in the year ago first quarter.
Now turning to the outlook. We expect 2019 to be another robust earnings year for Nucor. We continue to be encouraged by the overall strength of our domestic end-use markets. In fact, we see stable or improving demand in 21 of the 24 end-use markets we monitor. One market, power transmission, is seeing a meaningful decline due to the completion of major grid extension projects in 2018. Automotive OEMs and automotive suppliers comprise the other 2 markets that we expect to decline for the year. However, we anticipate that the decline in automotive unit volumes will be moderate and then Nucor will actually grow its shipments to these customers in 2019. Of course, the largest source of demand for our products are applications in nonresidential construction, which appears set for another solid year in 2019. 
Earnings in the second quarter of 2019 are expected to be similar to the first quarter, excluding the gain on the sale of the investment. We expect similar linked-quarter performance in the steel mill segment as improvement in margins for structural and bar mill products offset weakening margins at our sheet and plate mills. The steel product segment is expected to achieve significant improvement in the second quarter over the first quarter as typical seasonal patterns and improved weather conditions benefit construction activity. The performance of the raw materials segment is expected to decline in the second quarter compared to the first quarter due to further margin pressure at our direct reduced iron or DRI plants. 
Thank you for your interest in our company. I will now turn the call back over to John."

Before we take questions, I wanted to make a few remarks about trade. Nucor has long maintained and more importantly, consistently demonstrated, that when operating on a level playing field, we can successfully compete with any steel producer in the world. Free and fair trade is a critical underpinning to the continued success of both Nucor and our customers. While much of the focus has been on Section 232 steel tariffs, prosecuting trade cases remains vital to ensuring a level playing field. For that reason, Nucor applauds the recent determination by the U.S. International Trade Commission that there is reasonable indication of material injury from imports of fabricated structural steel from China, Canada and Mexico that are subsidized and sold into the United States at less than fair value. More effective enforcement of rules-based trade has made a significant contribution to the improved performance of the U.S. economy in recent years, benefiting the steel industry and the entire domestic manufacturing sector.
2019 is going to be another exciting year for our company as we continue to bring new projects online. We will continue to pursue profitable growth opportunities and we remain confident that Nucor's diversified business model will enable us to continue to outperform the industry over the course of the economic cycle.
Thank you to our more than 26,000 teammates for the way you execute our strategy, and thank you for the work that you do every day to build a safe and more profitable Nucor.

We've mentioned that we see demand pretty consistent, in fact, maybe a little bit growing on the sheet side, on the hot end side, when we look at our order entry over the last couple of weeks, marginal growth, small growth, but a good sign. So as we go into the second quarter, we expect the volumes to be about the same, particularly in those products that you mentioned. Our downstream businesses might see a little bit better volume based on the weather conditions that are improving. We had a long winter. We had a very wet spring. It seems to be correcting now, so we might see a bit of a pickup in our downstream businesses. But overall, I think going into the second quarter, I would say our volumes are going to be pretty consistent. In terms of the second question, remember, first of all, that this is a preliminary position, so we don't have a final ruling on this yet. We are optimistic that we will get a positive outcome in the final determination. I will tell you that this could be very good news for us. We've been seeing a lot of -- we sell about 50% of our beams, structural products, into fabricating businesses. That's about 1 million tons a year that we sell into fabricated steel construction, and it hurt. It hurt on demand. It hurt on pricing. And we think that, that's a result of truly dumped and illegally and unfairly traded products coming in, Canada, Mexico and China being the 3 biggest violators of our trade laws in this product. So we see that as a big plus if we get a positive outcome. We're confident we're going to get a positive outcome and we'll just wait to see what happens."

But it would seem that there's a significant opportunity to get working capital back out of the company. I just wondered if you could address that given sheet pricing's back down basically to where it was a year ago."

They went up commensurate with the volume of business that we're conducting. So to the extent receivables went up, average prices were up. We're still collecting -- just over 30 days to collect our receivables. So there's not an opportunity to shorten the collection of receivables, but you're right. If prices were to fall further, we'd get a benefit. And in fact, if you think back to 2015, we had a pretty weak earnings year as prices fell dramatically, but we generated very strong cash from operations because of working capital liquidation. And then the inventory side of course, when steel prices fall down, scrap prices fall down, so the overall cost of all of our inventories gets lower, and of course, we do lower our volumes inventories a little bit when business activity is at a lower level. So yes, there's -- in a severe downturn, there's an opportunity for some shrinking working capital. Now if we look at what just happened in the first quarter, working capital is fairly neutral, whereas last year, it was a drag on earnings of several hundred million dollars, maybe $600 million. So what we're seeing right now is more of a stable environment for working capital, whereas last year it was building with expansion of margins."

So we have a larger piece of a smaller pie. You're right, a lot of the investments that we're making will continue to allow us to grow our market share in those areas. Specifically, I would mention the cold mill project at Hickman. I would mention the Gallatin expansion project. That's another one that's going to get us into automotive product. So going forward, we see our market share continuing to grow in automotive. You asked specifically about where do we see us currently, and we'll do about 1.6 million tons this year, and by the end of the year, I think we'll be operating at a pace of about 2 million tons per year, at an annual rate of about 2 million tons a year by the end of this year. So we're really excited about the penetration we've made into automotive. You asked about what companies we are participating with.

There's a lot of things going on in the market today. Demand remains strong, but we see a lot of things happening. One example I would give you is that although the service center inventories are coming down quickly, they -- they are getting to pretty low levels, there's still a good amount of inter sales between service centers as they continue to work off the numbers from the end of last year. So you see some of that activity taking place. The weather, as I said, impacted the first half of the year. We see that clearing up now as we go forward. 
The other issue that I would give you is as we see scrap coming down, our customers tend to hold off waiting to see what's going to happen with the scrap. So there's -- I believe, I personally believe there's a lot of pent-up demand. People are waiting to see what's going to happen on scrap and in other areas, but remember the basics. Demand continues to be good. Imports continue to be lower than they were last year and they continue to be down, okay, year-over-year for certain. So at some point, we do believe that we're going to see the volumes start to pick up as we go through the second half of the year. When we were talking about the overall volume being consistent year-to-year, that's over the course of the year; we think it will pick up in the second half. At the end of the day, I can tell you that, as we said in the opening statement, we look at 24 end markets. We talk to these customers all the time and they are very optimistic -- our customers are very optimistic about what's going on in the marketplace. 
And a final point I would make is that some of our customers last year, they got a little bit heavy in their inventories because of hedged buying, they thought they'd get ahead of the 232. They got some heavy loads there that they're still working their way through. So a lot of things going on, Timna. But at the end of the day, I look at markets. I look at what our customers are saying and frankly, one of the things that I would point out that I think is often missed by the market and some analysts is we participate in so many of the downstream markets that we sell into that we get a really good feel for what's happening in those markets. Obviously, in rebar fabrication and metal buildings and in tubular, so we being in those markets have a good sense of what's happening in those markets. And we still feel optimistic about the demand that we see in those markets as well as in our steel markets. I don't know, did that help you connect the dots?"

So we've talked about volume, but on price, I'm not going to hopefully put you on the spot, but prices have been going down despite demand going up and more in the flat-rolled side, I recognize, and some of it's scrap.

I'm not going to speak specifically to any competitor. But when you have new people coming back into the market, they've got to earn their way into the market, sometimes you might even say they've got to buy their way into the market. So we see some of that going on with new entries into the marketplace. Obviously, when you start up a mill or restart a mill, there's issues with some quality and deliveries and so forth that force you to be a little bit lower priced to gain the market share you're looking to gain. So that puts a drag on to the market. 
Obviously, and it wasn't mentioned in the first part of my answer, scrap pricing going down leads to an expectation by buyers that there'll be a better price tomorrow than there is today, so they hold back. That forces us to be a little bit more responsive on pricing. So it's not always the case of pricing following exactly what's happening on volumes and demand. But I will tell you that when you look at that relative to the fact that demand is strong, scrap pricing is going down and even if steel pricing is going down, the metal margins, we think, are going to be good, maybe slightly improving as we go forward. So again, still pretty optimistic about the market. One of the things that I'm asked often is how I compare this year to last year? And I answer by saying this is a good year. We're going to have a really good year. Will it be as good as last year? Maybe not. I'll tell you what, it's been -- going to be a lot better than most of the years we've had in the last 10 years, that's for sure. It's going to be a good year."

And the DRI plant in Louisiana, just to set everyone's mind at ease, that has been running very, very well. There's not been an issue with our operations there. The issue on performance is the fact that we sell our DRI to our own mills at what the pig iron pricing is. Pig iron pricing has been coming down, so of course, our selling price for the DRI, adjusted for value and use, must be going down also. So that's been the biggest impact in the first half. We did have a short outage, I think it was about 12 days, where we had a valve fail. It was not a major issue. We did not have to take it offline and do all the things that we do to cause weeks out of service. We did have a small outage of about 12 days, but that was not a significant impact. It was basically the fact that pig iron pricing is going down, so DRI pricing is going down. Now that's bad news on our DRI side, but bear in mind that we produce about 3.5 million tons of DRI. We buy about 3.5 million to 4 million tons of pig iron. So what we lose on the bananas, we kind of make up on the tomatoes a little bit. So it's a nice hedging situation where we do lose it on the DRI, but it's nice to get the better price on the pig iron. 
But one more point, you did mention the second half and I do want to give everyone an update on that. We did mention that there will be a 60-day outage. It is going to be -- we're going to be down probably towards the end of August, middle to end of August and we'll be down for 60 days. It's going to make major repairs to our furnace vessel, to the control systems and to the refractory to deal with the reliability issues that we've had in the past in those areas. And there's one more major work that we have to do, which will be towards the -- probably early next year and that would be on the material handling side. But right now, it's the -- as you know, the big problem that we've always had was with the process gas heater and that's the major repair that we're making. A second issue we've had in the past, probably the #2 issue with reliability, was on refractory and we'll also going to be doing that during the 60-day outage. And at the beginning of next year, we will not have a major impact to the operation, but we will be doing another large project on our material handling side to improve efficiencies."

And some of the quarters over the last several years, you've had some positives there; some we've had negatives and I know you're working to rectify that. But should we be thinking that over the course of the cycle, given there will be times when iron ore is expensive and pig iron isn't, like it is now, that this asset will be essentially just a cost center for you through the cycle?"

Before we discuss our second quarter earnings, I would like to thank our teammates for continued excellent safety performance. Safety is the #1 priority for everyone on the Nucor team, and we continue to work to improve at it, identifying and mitigating risks and changing behaviors to achieve our goal of 0 incidents at every Nucor facility. 
Turning now to our performance in this quarter. Our financial results were lower than our expectations at the start of the quarter. Unusually wet whether and aggressive supply chain destocking impacted mill order rates in the first half of 2019.
We have seen lower volumes during the first half of this year, resulting in a more challenging price environment. However, real demand for our products remained strong in key end-use markets. We see healthy conditions in end-use markets that typically account for more than 2/3 of our steel shipments. For this reason, we are cautiously optimistic that pricing has bottomed on most of our products and that volumes should be more closely aligned with real end-use demand in the second half of the year.
We all know that the steel industry is cyclical, and we have built our business model around that reality with our low and highly variable cost structure and our diversified product portfolio. 
Our performance in the first half of the year benefited from meaningful year-over-year earnings gains in our plate, [ NBQ ], rebar, joist and deck, metal buildings and pilings distribution businesses, once again, highlighting the benefits of our diversified product mix.
Our strategy to increase market share in automotive applications also continues to bear fruit. We are currently shipping into this market at an annual rate of about 1.6 million tons. 
Further, we were recently named the Supplier of the Year by General Motors. We are the first EAF-based steel producer to receive this recognition. It's a tremendous testament to our team and further evidence of our success moving up the value chain and gaining market share in many value-added applications.
As we have previously discussed, we have several investment projects coming online this year, and I want to update you on this status. In our sheet group, we continued to ramp-up production of our new specialty coal mill at Nucor Steel Arkansas, and we have been pleased with the performance. This project will allow us to produce higher valued products, especially in high-strength steels, and it will differentiate Nucor Steel Arkansas from its competitors. We are currently in trials for value-added applications, and customer acceptance has been excellent to this point.
We are targeting to have as much as 20% of the new mills capacity booked with contract customers by the year-end. We expect to continue adding contract volumes at the mill as 2020 progresses. 
In Kentucky, Nucor Steel Gallatin has begun commissioning its new galvanizing line and test running coils to verify the functionality of the line. Production of pickled and oiled coils have started this month and will be followed by production of galvanized coils in August. With 500,000 tons of annual capacity, this 72-inch galvanizing line will be the widest hot-rolled galvanizing facility in North America. Gallatin is now positioned to supply the underserved Midwest heavy gauge hot band galvanized market. The new line will enable us to grow our automotive applications to include frames, control arms, supports and brackets.
Our commercial teams are excited to have these new capabilities in our Sheet Mill Group to serve both new and existing customers. 
The last project in our sheet mill group I would like to mention is our joint venture with JFE Steel in Mexico. We are on track for start-up to a galvanizing line later this year, and we look forward to serving automotive customers in Mexico.
In the bar mill group, our Marion, Ohio bar mills new in-line rolling mill is starting up in the third quarter. Marion's new [indiscernible] furnace, which we installed last year, is reducing our natural gas consumption by about 1/4. In late 2019 or early 2020, Marion will also install [indiscernible] temporary equipment to reduce alloy costs at the mill shop. The upgrades significantly improved Marion's efficiency and strengthens its leadership position in the regional rebar market. 
Two other projects in our long products group are on track for start-ups later this year. The merchant bar product expansion at our mill in Illinois and the first of our new rebar micro mills, which is located in Sedalia, Missouri.
In all, we have 10 significant organic investments in various stages of development, representing a total capital investment of approximately $3.5 billion that will deliver long-term profitable growth to our shareholders. 
As I've made clear on several occasions, we are not simply adding tons to get bigger. These projects target to find market objectives and opportunities to generate higher profits and reduce volatility through the cycle. They also expand our product portfolio so that we will be able to offer our customers more solutions to meet their toughest challenges. 
The U.S. steel industry continues to benefit from effective trade enforcement. Through May of 2019, total and finished steel imports declined by 12% and 18% of last year's levels. In the last 12 months, approximately 6 million fewer tons of imported steel have come in to the U.S. market. The decrease in imports reflects the cost competitiveness of our domestic steel industry and the success of our industry's ongoing efforts to see that the rules of trade are enforced.
Recent findings by the U.S. Department of Commerce provide further evidence that our industry, our government and our customers understand the importance of acting to keep on fairly traded steel and steel products from distorting the U.S. market.
On July 2, the U.S. Department of Commerce issued its preliminary circumvention determination on imports of galvanizing coal-rolled sheet steel from Vietnam manufactured with hot-rolled or coal-rolled substraight from South Korea and Taiwan. Congress found that the steel went through minor modifications in Vietnam to avoid appropriate restrictions that have been imposed on imports from South Korea and Taiwan. The imports of these products from Vietnam must now pay duties of more than 400%. It is vitally important that our government stop these and similar illegal trend shipments meant to avoid trade duties, and we are glad that they have taken such a strong action. 
On July 8, the U.S. Department of Commerce also issued a preliminary countervailing duty determination on imports of fabricated structural steel from China and Mexico, and duties have been applied to imports from both countries. This ruling shows that the government is not only concerned about unfair trade practices in raw steel but also in downstream products. Rules-based trade is a critical underpinning to the continued success of our customers, Nucor and the U.S. economy, and we are pleased that the Department of Commerce continues to take action on individual trade cases. 
Jim Frias will now provide more specific detail about our second quarter performance as well as our outlook for the remainder of this year. Jim?"

Nucor reported second quarter of 2019 earnings of $1.26 per diluted share.

Nucor reported second quarter of 2019 earnings of $1.26 per diluted share. Earnings from our steel mills segment were lower due primarily to reduce shipments to our service center customers, reflecting their caution with respect to inventory levels and order rates in a weakening price environment. Earnings from our steel products segment improved in the second quarter in line with our expectations. Strong nonresidential construction markets, along with increased productivity from our rebar fabrication and metal buildings businesses, were the primary factors. Results from our raw materials segment were slightly better than we anticipated.
It is worth noting that our second quarter results included $20.5 million of pre-operating and start-up costs related to strategic investment projects compared with $19.6 million in the first quarter of 2019 and approximately $6 million in the year ago quarter. 
First half 2019 cash provided from operations was approximately $1.2 billion, up from about [ $870 ] million for the year ago period. Inventories and receivables were source of approximately $400 million in the first half, reflecting consistent working capital management in a declining pricing environment.
Our capital spending accelerated in the second quarter and totaled [ $650 ] million so far this year. We received our permits for the Gallatin expansion. So between that and other projects that we have in our pipeline, we expect to increased CapEx further in the second half and approach our budgeted amount of approximately $1.8 billion for the full year. 
With respect to cash return to shareholders during the second quarter, we paid dividends of $123 million and stock repurchases totaled $125 million. Thus far, in 2019, we returned 50% of our net income to our shareholders while also investing for long-term profitable growth. We ended the quarter with $1.4 billion of cash on hand. 
Nucor's financial condition remains strong with total debt outstanding of $4.2 billion. Our gross debt-to-capital ratio was 28% at the end of the second quarter. Our $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility remains undrawn and does not mature until April of 2023. Our next material debt maturity is in 2022 for approximately $600 million. 
Now turning to the outlook. Earnings for the third quarter of 2019 are expected to be lower than the second quarter. Inventory destocking, especially by service center customers, has led to declining results year-to-date and are muted expectations for the next quarter. While we are encouraged by recent upturns in the prices for flat-rolled steel products and as John mentioned, we do continue to see healthy demand for our major end-use markets. We finished the second quarter with much lower margins in sheet and plate steel and believe that margin recovery could take some time. We, therefore, expect weaker linked quarter performance in the steel mills segment again, primarily reflecting reduced margins for both sheet and plate steel.
However, we do expect that service center customers will resume more normal buying patterns in the third quarter. 
The steel products segment is expected to achieve further profitability improvement in the third quarter over the second quarter. Nonresidential construction activity remains strong, and we believe some incremental demand has likely shifted to later in the year due to difficult weather conditions during the first several months of 2019. Recent initiatives to improve the performance of our rebar fabrication and metal building businesses are also expected to continue to favorably impact results for the steel products segment. The performance of our raw materials segment is expected to decline in the third quarter compared to the second quarter due to further margin pressure at our reduced iron ore DRI plants.
In addition, later this quarter, we will begin our plan [ of 65-day ] outage at Nucor Steel Louisiana to complete major enhancements to the physical plant. 
Thank you for your interest in our company. I will now turn the call back over to John."

Before we take your questions, I would like to acknowledge a significant milestone that Nucor teammates at our Darlington, South Carolina bar mill recently celebrating. As many of you know, Darlington is the first steel mill Nucor built. Back in the mid-1960s, our Founder, Ken Iverson, decided that Nucor needed to be able to supply its own steel for its joist operations in [indiscernible], South Carolina.
Nucor selected EAF Technology for Darlington and took the first step in leading the transformation of the domestic steel industry that has occurred over the past 50 years. We celebrated this 50-year run at Darlington on June 26. 
Darlington continues to be a strong contributor to Nucor's profitability and a valued member of its community. We look forward to another 50 years of success at Darlington. 
In closing, I would like to say thank you to our more than 26,000 teammates for the way you execute our strategy, and thank you for the work that you do every day to build a safer and more profitable Nucor. I'd also like to say thank you to our customers. We appreciate the trust you place in Nucor, and we will continue to do our very best to earn it with every order.

But it's also true of our steel business as we talked about many times in the past. Inventories do not necessarily -- service center shipments do not necessarily indicate what's happening with true and use demand. We believe that end-use demand is still very strong. We see that in our order entry rate for OEMs versus our order entry rate for service centers. When you look at our order entry rate for OEMs, we're actually up in the first half by about 4% compared to the 3-year average. Whereas if you look at order entry for service centers, we're down 14% compared to the 3-year average. So that's a pretty good indicator to us that end demand is still pretty strong.

They talk about the need for making sure that they get their inventories completely down, which is what they are striving to accomplish. But one of the things that we're seeing also that should be a good indicator of moving in its early in the game, I don't want to be too overconfident here, but we are cautiously optimistic that we hit the bottom on pricing and on volumes. We see our lead times are beginning to stretch out a little bit. Whenever that's supposed to happen, that encourages the service centers to come back into the market. Now with the OEMs, it's more of a steady-state situation. So after the $40 a ton increase, we believe that, that represented the bottom of the market.

First of all, if you go all the way back in 2017, with tax reform and deregulation, that was really a shot in the arm for manufacturing. And frankly, the order rate picked up, demand for steel picked up, and it was growing all through 2017, towards the end of '17, but particularly in the beginning of '18, a lot of our customers were weeding about the fact that when the tariffs came into effect, they were not being able to get the steel that they needed to fill their customers arms. That created somewhat of a panic, both with OEM and with our service center customers. They were convinced that the domestic capacity would not end up to supply all the needs that they have to keep their customers happy. But as it played out, 232 came into effect, the imports did go down, and domestic capacity was enabled, was, in fact, able to start up again and fill the need. But during that time when they were afraid of getting not being able to get the steel, they put their inventories to a very high levels. And of course, domestic capacity came on and we're being settle down, the order rate and pricing returned to more normalized levels, but they maintain this high inventory. At the end of the year, they want to get rid of that overall inventory, they began to aggressively destock. So what happens then, they destock buying -- the volumes coming into the mills go down. Pricing results, as a result, goes down. And the next thing you know, beginning this spiral of, in fact, the aggressive destocking was so intense that towards the end of last year and into the first half of this year, we have service centers selling towards the service centers. So it became a very difficult situation. And as always it happens in our business, we always do things. Now we think that we're getting to the point where the inventories are down before normal levels, and we expect to see more normalized ordering rates in the next quarter."

So there's a lot of products are on the books, but we haven't been able to simply because of the extreme weather conditions. The other impact is, as you mentioned, aggressive destocking. Just as we said with the products earlier with tubular and with sheet products, the same occurred with plates. Inventories levels got way too high at the end of 2018, and we began the destocking program. A little bit of a time delay on that or simply because of plate tends to trail hot band by about 2 months, 3 months, in terms of buying the pricing mix. So it's a little bit of a time delay.

And for those who could not join us, the recording of the event and the slide presentation are available at nucor.com.
Before we discuss our second quarter earnings, I would like to thank our teammates for continued excellent safety performance. Safety is the #1 priority for everyone on the Nucor team, and we continue to work to improve at it, identifying and mitigating risks and changing behaviors to achieve our goal of 0 incidents at every Nucor facility. 
Turning now to our performance in this quarter. Our financial results were lower than our expectations at the start of the quarter. Unusually wet weather and aggressive supply chain destocking impacted mill order rates in the first half of 2019.
We have seen lower volumes during the first half of this year, resulting in a more challenging price environment. However, real demand for our products remained strong in key end-use markets. We see healthy conditions in end-use markets that typically account for more than 2/3 of our steel shipments. For this reason, we are cautiously optimistic that pricing has bottomed on most of our products and that volumes should be more closely aligned with real end-use demand in the second half of the year.
We all know that the steel industry is cyclical and we have built our business model around that reality with our low and highly variable cost structure and our diversified product portfolio. 
Our performance in the first half of the year benefited from meaningful year-over-year earnings gains in our plate, MBQ, rebar, joist and deck, metal buildings and pilings distribution businesses, once again highlighting the benefits of our diversified product mix.
Our strategy to increase market share in automotive applications also continues to bear fruit. We are currently shipping into this market at an annual rate of about 1.6 million tons. 
Further, we were recently named Supplier of the Year by General Motors. We are the first EAF-based steel producer to receive this recognition. It's a tremendous testament to our team and further evidence of our success, moving up the value chain and gaining market share in many value-added applications.
As we have previously discussed, we have several investment projects coming online this year, and I want to update you on this status. In our Sheet Group, we continued to ramp up production of our new Specialty Cold Mill at Nucor Steel Arkansas, and we have been pleased with the performance. This project will allow us to produce higher-valued products, especially in high-strength steels, and it will differentiate Nucor Steel Arkansas from its competitors. We are currently in trials for value-added applications, and customer acceptance has been excellent to this point.
We are targeting to have as much as 20% of the new mills capacity booked with contract customers by the year-end. We expect to continue adding contract volumes at the mill as 2020 progresses. 
In Kentucky, Nucor Steel Gallatin has begun commissioning its new galvanizing line and test running coils to verify the functionality of the line. Production of pickled and oiled coils have started this month and will be followed by production of galvanized coils in August. With 500,000 tons of annual capacity, this 72-inch galvanizing line will be the widest hot-rolled galvanizing facility in North America. Gallatin is now positioned to supply the underserved Midwest heavy gauge hot band galvanize market. The new line will enable us to grow our automotive applications, to include frames, control arms, supports and brackets. Our commercial teams are excited to have these new capabilities in our Sheet Mill Group, to serve both new and existing customers. 
The last project in our Sheet Mill Group I would like to mention is our joint venture with JFE Steel in Mexico. We are on track for a start-up of the galvanizing line later this year, and we look forward to serving automotive customers in Mexico.
In the Bar Mill Group, our Marion, Ohio bar mills new in-line rolling mill is starting up in the third quarter. Marion's new reheat furnace, which we installed last year, is reducing our natural gas consumption by about 1/4. In late 2019 or early 2020, Marion will also install Quench and Tempering equipment to reduce alloy costs at the melt shop. The upgrades significantly improved Marion's efficiency and strengthens its leadership position in the regional rebar market. 
2 other projects in our long products group are on track for start-ups later this year, the merchant bar product expansion at our mill in Illinois and the first of our new rebar micromills, which is located in Sedalia, Missouri. In all, we have 10 significant organic investments in various stages of development, representing a total capital investment of approximately $3.5 billion that will deliver long-term profitable growth to our shareholders. 
As I have made clear on several occasions, we are not simply adding tons to get bigger. These projects target to find market objectives and opportunities to generate higher profits and reduce volatility through the cycle. They also expand our product portfolio so that we will be able to offer our customers more solutions to meet their toughest challenges. 
The U.S. steel industry continues to benefit from effective trade enforcement. Through May of 2019, total and finished steel imports declined by 12% and 18% from last year's levels. In the last 12 months, approximately 6 million fewer tons of imported steel have come in to the U.S. market. The decrease in imports reflects the cost competitiveness of our domestic steel industry and the success of our industry's ongoing efforts to see that the rules of trade are enforced.
Recent findings by the U.S. Department of Commerce provide further evidence that our industry, our government and our customers understand the importance of acting to keep on fairly traded steel and steel products from distorting the U.S. market.
On July 2, the U.S. Department of Commerce issued its preliminary circumvention determination on imports of galvanized and coal-rolled sheet steel from Vietnam manufactured with hot-rolled or coal-rolled substrate from South Korea and Taiwan. Congress found that the steel went through minor modifications in Vietnam to avoid appropriate restrictions that have been imposed on imports from South Korea and Taiwan. The imports of these products from Vietnam must now pay duties of more than 400%. It is vitally important that our government stop these and similar illegal trend shipments meant to avoid trade duties, and we are glad that they have taken such a strong action. 
On July 8, the U.S. Department of Commerce also issued a preliminary countervailing duty determination on imports of fabricated structural steel from China and Mexico, and duties have been applied to imports from both countries. This ruling shows that the government is not only concerned about unfair trade practices in raw steel but also in downstream products. Rules-based trade is a critical underpinning to the continued success of our customers, Nucor and the U.S. economy, and we are pleased that the Department of Commerce continues to take action on individual trade cases. 
Jim Frias will now provide more specific detail about our second quarter performance as well as our outlook for the remainder of this year. Jim?"

Results from our raw materials segment were slightly better than we anticipated.
It is worth noting that our second quarter results included $20.5 million of pre-operating and start-up costs related to strategic investment projects compared with $19.6 million in the first quarter of 2019 and approximately $6 million in the year ago quarter. 
First half 2019 cash provided from operations was approximately $1.2 billion, up from about $870 million for the year ago period. Inventories and receivables were a source of approximately $400 million in the first half, reflecting consistent working capital management in a declining price environment.
Our capital spending accelerated in the second quarter and totaled $650 million so far this year. We have received our permits for the Gallatin expansion, so between that and other projects that we have in our pipeline, we expect to increase CapEx further in the second half and approach our budgeted amount of approximately $1.8 billion for the full year. 
With respect to cash returned to shareholders during the second quarter, we paid dividends of $123 million and stock repurchases totaled $125 million. Thus far, in 2019, we returned 50% of our net income to our shareholders while also investing for long-term profitable growth. We ended the quarter with $1.4 billion of cash on hand. 
Nucor's financial condition remains strong. With total debt outstanding of $4.2 billion, our gross debt-to-capital ratio was 28% at the end of the second quarter. Our $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility remains undrawn and does not mature until April of 2023. Our next material debt maturity is in 2022 for approximately $600 million. 
Now turning to the outlook. Earnings for the third quarter of 2019 are expected to be lower than the second quarter. Inventory destocking, especially by service center customers, has led to declining results year-to-date in our muted expectations for the next quarter. While we are encouraged by recent upturns in the prices for flat-rolled steel products and as John mentioned, we do continue to see healthy demand for our major end-use markets. We've finished the second quarter with much lower margins in sheet and plate steel and believe that margin recovery could take some time. We therefore expect weaker linked quarter performance in the steel mills segment again, primarily reflecting reduced margins for both sheet and plate steel. However, we do expect that service center customers will resume more normal buying patterns in the third quarter. 
The steel products segment is expected to achieve further profitability improvement in the third quarter over the second quarter. Nonresidential construction activity remains strong, and we believe some incremental demand has likely shifted to later in the year due to difficult weather conditions during the first several months of 2019. Recent initiatives to improve the performance of our rebar fabrication and metal building businesses are also expected to continue to favorably impact results for the steel products segment. The performance of our raw materials segment is expected to decline in the third quarter compared to the second quarter due to further margin pressure at our direct reduced iron ore DRI plants.
In addition, later this quarter, we will begin our planned 65-day outage at Nucor Steel Louisiana to complete major enhancements to the physical plant. 
Thank you for your interest in our company. I will now turn the call back over to John."

Before we take your questions, I would like to acknowledge a significant milestone that Nucor teammates at our Darlington, South Carolina bar mill recently celebrated. As many of you know, Darlington is the first steel mill Nucor built. Back in the mid-1960s, our Founder, Ken Iverson, decided that Nucor needed to be able to supply its own steel for its joist operations in Florence, South Carolina.
Nucor selected EAF technology for Darlington and took the first step in leading the transformation of the domestic steel industry that has occurred over the past 50 years. We celebrated this 50-year run at Darlington on June 26. 
Darlington continues to be a strong contributor to Nucor's profitability and a valued member of its community. We look forward to another 50 years of success at Darlington. 
In closing, I would like to say thank you to our more than 26,000 teammates for the way you execute our strategy, and thank you for the work that you do every day to build a safer and more profitable Nucor. I'd also like to say thank you to our customers. We appreciate the trust you place in Nucor, and we will continue to do our very best to earn it with every order. And finally, thank you to our investors for entrusting us with your valuable capital.

So this is a -- in our opinion, this is the result of too high of an inventory build during last year and the aggressive destocking that you see, not only in our steel products, but also in tubes.

Now overall, we believe that the issue is too much inventory in the system that has to work its way through and at the time that it goes through. You have to remember, when you talk about tubular, 80% of the tubulars are sold through service centers. So this really impacts -- this issue of inventory really impacts the tubular business. But it's also true of our steel business as we talked about many times in the past. The inventories do not necessarily -- service center shipments do not necessarily indicate what's happening with true end-use demand. We believe that end-use demand is still very strong. We see that in our order entry rate for OEMs versus our order entry rate for service centers. When you look at our order entry rate for OEMs, we're actually up in the first half by about 4% compared to the 3-year average. Whereas if you look at order entry for service centers, we're down 14% compared to the 3-year average. So that's a pretty good indicator to us that end demand is still pretty strong.

I mentioned earlier that after the first $40 a ton increase in sheet pricing, we did see a pickup in orders for our sheet products, and that came from both our OEM customers, but also from our service centers. When we meet with our service centers, we talk about what they'll think is going to happen in the second half, that the demand, the end demand for their products will be steady. It's still strong. They talk about the need for making sure that they get their inventories completely down, which is what they, too, were striving to accomplish. But one of the things that we're seeing also, that it should be a good indicator of moving in and it's early in the game. So I don't want to be too overconfident here, but we are cautiously optimistic that we've hit the bottom on pricing and on volumes. We see our lead times are beginning to stretch out a little bit. Whenever that starts to happen, that encourages the service centers to come back into the market. Now with the OEMs, it's more of a steady-state situation. So after the $40 a ton increase, we believe that, that represented the bottom of the market. Service centers, whenever you see pricing start to go up, they come back into the market. So we think that, that bodes well for the second half of the year, and we'll see how it plays out."

First of all, if you go all the way back to 2017, with tax reform and deregulation, that was really a shot in the arm for manufacturing. And frankly, the order entry rate picked up, demand for steel picked up, and it was growing all through 2017. Towards the end of '17, but particularly in the beginning of '18, a lot of our customers were reading about the fact that when the tariffs came into effect, we would not -- they would not be able to get the steel that they needed to fill their customers' orders. That created somewhat of a panic, both with the OEM and with our service center customers. They were convinced that the domestic capacity would not be enough to supply all the needs that they had to keep their customers happy. 
But as it played out, 232 came into effect, the imports did go down, and domestic capacity was enabled, was, in fact, able to start up again and fill the need. But during that time when they were afraid of getting -- not being able to get the steel, they put their inventories to very high levels. And of course, domestic capacity came on, everything settled down, the order rate and pricing returned to more normalized levels, but they've maintained this high inventory. At the end of the year, they'd want to get rid of that overblown inventory and they began to aggressively destock. So what happens then, okay, they destock volume. All the volumes coming into the mills go down. Pricing results, as a result, goes down. And the next thing you know, we get into this spiral of -- in fact, the aggressive destocking was so intense that towards the end of last year and into the first half of this year, we had service centers selling to other service centers. So it became a very difficult situation. And as always happens in our business, we overshoot things. Now we think that we're getting to the point where the inventories are down before normal levels, and we expect to see more normalized ordering rates in the next quarter."

So we made -- we took a little bit of the loophole away from that, that was existing. So in general, we'll see some impact. We do supply to the militaries, particularly out of our plate group and out of our SBQ group. So it's a positive impact to us, but it is not a major impact."

So there's a lot of projects out of that, that are on the books, but we haven't been able to move forward with them simply because of the extreme weather conditions. 
The other impact is, as you mentioned, aggressive destocking. Just as we said with the products earlier with tubular and with sheet products, the same occurred with plates. The inventory levels got way too high at the end of 2018 and we began the destocking program and at least a little bit of a time delay on that one simply because of -- the plate tends to trail hot band by about 2 months, 3 months, in terms of both volumes and pricing. So there was a little bit of a time delay, but basically, the same scenario played out in plate that we described earlier."

And for those who could not join us, the recording of the event and the slide presentation are available at nucor.com.
Before we discuss our second quarter earnings, I would like to thank our teammates for continued excellent safety performance. Safety is the #1 priority for everyone on the Nucor team, and we continue to work to improve at it, identifying and mitigating risks and changing behaviors to achieve our goal of 0 incidents at every Nucor facility. 
Turning now to our performance in this quarter. Our financial results were lower than our expectations at the start of the quarter. Unusually wet weather and aggressive supply chain destocking impacted mill order rates in the first half of 2019.
We have seen lower volumes during the first half of this year, resulting in a more challenging price environment. However, real demand for our products remains strong in key end-use markets. We see healthy conditions in end-use markets that typically account for more than 2/3 of our steel shipments. For this reason, we are cautiously optimistic that pricing has bottomed on most of our products and that volumes should be more closely aligned with real end-use demand in the second half of the year.
We all know that the steel industry is cyclical, and we have built our business model around that reality with our low and highly variable cost structure and our diversified product portfolio. 
Our performance in the first half of the year benefited from meaningful year-over-year earnings gains in our plate, MBQ, rebar, joist and deck, metal buildings and pilings distribution businesses, once again highlighting the benefits of our diversified product mix.
Our strategy to increase market share in automotive applications also continues to bear fruit. We are currently shipping into this market at an annual rate of about 1.6 million tons. 
Further, we were recently named Supplier of the Year by General Motors. We are the first EAF-based steel producer to receive this recognition. It's a tremendous testament to our team and further evidence of our success moving up the value chain and gaining market share in many value-added applications.
As we have previously discussed, we have several investment projects coming online this year, and I want to update you on their status. In our Sheet Group, we continued to ramp up production of our new Specialty Cold Mill at Nucor Steel Arkansas, and we have been pleased with the performance. This project will allow us to produce higher-valued products, especially in high-strength steels, and it will differentiate Nucor Steel Arkansas from its competitors. We are currently in trials for value-added applications, and customer acceptance has been excellent to this point.
We are targeting to have as much as 20% of the new mill's capacity booked with contract customers by the year-end. We expect to continue adding contract volumes at the mill as 2020 progresses. 
In Kentucky, Nucor Steel Gallatin has begun commissioning its new galvanizing line and test running coils to verify the functionality of the line. Production of pickled and oiled coils have started this month and will be followed by production of galvanized coils in August. With 500,000 tons of annual capacity, this 72-inch galvanizing line will be the widest hot-rolled galvanizing facility in North America. Gallatin is now positioned to supply the underserved Midwest heavy-gauge, hot-band galvanized market. The new line will enable us to grow our automotive applications to include frames, control arms, supports and brackets. Our commercial teams are excited to have these new capabilities in our Sheet Mill Group to serve both new and existing customers. 
The last project in our Sheet Mill Group I would like to mention is our joint venture with JFE Steel in Mexico. We are on track for a start-up of the galvanizing line later this year, and we look forward to serving automotive customers in Mexico.
In the Bar Mill Group, our Marion, Ohio bar mill's new in-line rolling mill is starting up in the third quarter. Marion's new reheat furnace, which we installed last year, is reducing our natural gas consumption by about 1/4. In late 2019 or early 2020, Marion will also install quench and temper equipment to reduce alloy costs at the melt shop. The upgrades significantly improve Marion's efficiency and strengthens its leadership position in the regional rebar market. 
Two other projects in our long products group are on track for start-ups later this year: the merchant bar product expansion at our mill in Illinois and the first of our new rebar micromills, which is located in Sedalia, Missouri. In all, we have 10 significant organic investments in various stages of development, representing a total capital investment of approximately $3.5 billion that will deliver long-term profitable growth to our shareholders. 
As I have made clear on several occasions, we are not simply adding tons to get bigger. These projects target defined market objectives and opportunities to generate higher profits and reduce volatility through the cycle. They also expand our product portfolio so that we will be able to offer our customers more solutions to meet their toughest challenges. 
The U.S. steel industry continues to benefit from effective trade enforcement. Through May of 2019, total and finished steel imports declined by 12% and 18% from last year's levels. In the last 12 months, approximately 6 million fewer tons of imported steel have come in to the U.S. market. The decrease in imports reflects the cost competitiveness of our domestic steel industry and the success of our industry's ongoing efforts to see that the rules of trade are enforced.
Recent findings by the U.S. Department of Commerce provide further evidence that our industry, our government and our customers understand the importance of acting to keep unfairly traded steel and steel products from distorting the U.S. market.
On July 2, the U.S. Department of Commerce issued its preliminary circumvention determination on imports of galvanized and cold-rolled sheet steel from Vietnam manufactured with hot-rolled or cold-rolled substrate from South Korea and Taiwan. Congress found that the steel went through minor modifications in Vietnam to avoid appropriate restrictions that have been imposed on imports from South Korea and Taiwan. The imports of these products from Vietnam must now pay duties of more than 400%. It is vitally important that our government stop these and similar illegal trans-shipments meant to avoid trade duties, and we are glad that they have taken such a strong action. 
On July 8, the U.S. Department of Commerce also issued a preliminary countervailing duty determination on imports of fabricated structural steel from China and Mexico, and duties have been applied to imports from both countries. This ruling shows that the government is not only concerned about unfair trade practices in raw steel but also in downstream products. Rules-based trade is a critical underpinning to the continued success of our customers, Nucor and the U.S. economy, and we are pleased that the Department of Commerce continues to take action on individual trade cases. 
Jim Frias will now provide more specific detail about our second quarter performance as well as our outlook for the remainder of this year. Jim?"
184945,626751718,1773459,"Nucor Corporation, Q2 2019 Earnings Call, Jul 18, 2019",2019-07-18,"Earnings Calls","Nucor Corporation","Executives","Thanks, John. Nucor reported second quarter of 2019 earnings of $1.26 per diluted share. Earnings from our steel mills segment were lower due primarily to reduced shipments to our service center customers, reflecting their caution with respect to inventor",639,"Thanks, John. Nucor reported second quarter of 2019 earnings of $1.26 per diluted share. Earnings from our steel mills segment were lower due primarily to reduced shipments to our service center customers, reflecting their caution with respect to inventory levels and order rates in a weakening price environment. Earnings from our steel products segment improved in the second quarter, in line with our expectations. Strong nonresidential construction markets, along with increased productivity from our rebar fabrication and metal buildings businesses, were the primary factors. Results from our raw materials segment were slightly better than we anticipated.
It is worth noting that our second quarter results included $20.5 million of pre-operating and start-up costs related to strategic investment projects compared with $19.6 million in the first quarter of 2019 and approximately $6 million in the year ago quarter. 
First half 2019 cash provided from operations was approximately $1.2 billion, up from about $870 million for the year ago period. Inventories and receivables were a source of approximately $400 million in the first half, reflecting consistent working capital management in a declining price environment.
Our capital spending accelerated in the second quarter and totaled $650 million so far this year. We have received our permits for the Gallatin expansion, so between that and other projects that we have in our pipeline, we expect to increase CapEx further in the second half and approach our budgeted amount of approximately $1.8 billion for the full year. 
With respect to cash returned to shareholders during the second quarter, we paid dividends of $123 million and stock repurchases totaled $125 million. Thus far, in 2019, we returned 50% of our net income to our shareholders while also investing for long-term profitable growth. We ended the quarter with $1.4 billion of cash on hand. 
Nucor's financial condition remains strong. With total debt outstanding of $4.2 billion, our gross debt-to-capital ratio was 28% at the end of the second quarter. Our $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility remains undrawn and does not mature until April of 2023. Our next material debt maturity is in 2022 for approximately $600 million. 
Now turning to the outlook. Earnings for the third quarter of 2019 are expected to be lower than the second quarter. Inventory destocking, especially by service center customers, has led to declining results year-to-date and our muted expectations for the next quarter. While we are encouraged by recent upturns in the prices for flat-rolled steel products and, as John mentioned, we do continue to see healthy demand for our major end-use markets, we finished the second quarter with much lower margins in sheet and plate steel and believe that margin recovery could take some time. We therefore expect weaker linked-quarter performance in the steel mills segment again, primarily reflecting reduced margins for both sheet and plate steel. However, we do expect that service center customers will resume more normal buying patterns in the third quarter. 
The steel products segment is expected to achieve further profitability improvement in the third quarter over the second quarter. Nonresidential construction activity remains strong, and we believe some incremental demand has likely shifted to later in the year due to difficult weather conditions during the first several months of 2019. Recent initiatives to improve the performance of our rebar fabrication and metal building businesses are also expected to continue to favorably impact results for the steel products segment. The performance of our raw materials segment is expected to decline in the third quarter compared to the second quarter due to further margin pressure at our direct reduced iron ore DRI plants.
In addition, later this quarter, we will begin our planned 65-day outage at Nucor Steel Louisiana to complete major enhancements to the physical plant. 
Thank you for your interest in our company. I will now turn the call back over to John."

Before we take your questions, I would like to acknowledge a significant milestone that Nucor teammates at our Darlington, South Carolina bar mill recently celebrated. As many of you know, Darlington is the first steel mill Nucor built. Back in the mid-1960s, our founder, Ken Iverson, decided that Nucor needed to be able to supply its own steel for its joist operations in Florence, South Carolina.
Nucor selected EAF technology for Darlington and took the first step in leading the transformation of the domestic steel industry that has occurred over the past 50 years. We celebrated this 50-year run at Darlington on June 26.

So this is a -- in our opinion, this is the result of too high of an inventory build during last year and the aggressive destocking that you see, not only in our steel products, but also in tubes. So that's probably the biggest impact on our downstream business not doing as well as we anticipated and not doing as well as we did last year."

I think that this is a question of what's really driving the buying reductions in tubular and in our steel. Now overall, we believe that the issue is too much inventory in the system that has to work its way through and at the time that it goes through. You have to remember, when you talk about tubular, 80% of the tubulars are sold through service centers. So this really impacts -- this issue of inventory really impacts the tubular business. But it's also true of our steel business, as we talked about many times in the past. The inventories do not necessarily -- service center shipments do not necessarily indicate what's happening with true end-use demand. We believe that end-use demand is still very strong. We see that in our order entry rate for OEMs versus our order entry rate for service centers. When you look at our order entry rate for OEMs, we're actually up in the first half by about 4% compared to the 3-year average. Whereas if you look at order entry for service centers, we're down 14% compared to the 3-year average. So that's a pretty good indicator to us that end demand is still pretty strong. Of course, we talk to our customers who are basically telling us the same thing, and I'm speaking in general now both of steel and our tubular products also."

I mentioned earlier that after the first $40-a-ton increase in sheet pricing, we did see a pickup in orders for our sheet products, and that came from both our OEM customers, but also from our service centers. When we meet with our service centers, we talk about what they think is going to happen in the second half. They feel that the demand, the end demand for their products will be steady. It's still strong. They talk about the need for making sure that they get their inventories completely down, which is what they are striving to accomplish. But one of the things that we're seeing also, that should be a good indicator of moving in -- and it's early in the game so I don't want to be too overconfident here, but we are cautiously optimistic that we've hit the bottom on pricing and on volumes. We see our lead times are beginning to stretch out a little bit. Whenever that starts to happen, that encourages the service centers to come back into the market. Now with the OEMs, it's more of a steady-state situation. So after the $40-a-ton increase, we believe that, that represented the bottom of the market. Service centers, whenever you see pricing start to go up, they come back into the market. So we think that, that bodes well for the second half of the year, and we'll see how it plays out."

First of all, if you go all the way back to 2017, with tax reform and deregulation, that was really a shot in the arm for manufacturing. And frankly, the order entry rate picked up, demand for steel picked up, and it was growing all through 2017. Towards the end of '17, but particularly in the beginning of '18, a lot of our customers were reading about the fact that when the tariffs came into effect, we would not -- they would not be able to get the steel that they needed to fill their customers' orders. That created somewhat of a panic, both with the OEM and with our service center customers. They were convinced that the domestic capacity would not be enough to supply all the needs that they had to keep their customers happy. 
But as it played out, 232 came into effect, the imports did go down, and domestic capacity was enabled, was, in fact, able to start up again and fill the need. But during that time when they were afraid of getting -- not being able to get the steel, they built their inventories to very high levels. And of course, domestic capacity came on, everything settled down, the order rate and pricing returned to more normalized levels, but they've maintained this high inventory. At the end of the year, they wanted to get rid of that overblown inventory and they began to aggressively destock. So what happens then, okay, they destock volume. All the volumes coming into the mills go down. Pricing results, as a result, goes down. And the next thing you know, we get into this spiral of -- in fact, the aggressive destocking was so intense that towards the end of last year and into the first half of this year, we had service centers selling to other service centers. So it became a very difficult situation. And as always happens in our business, we overshoot things. Now we think that we're getting to the point where the inventories are down to more normal levels, and we expect to see more normalized ordering rates in the next quarter."

The other impact is, as you mentioned, aggressive destocking. Just as we said with the products earlier with tubular and with sheet products, the same occurred with plates. The inventory levels got way too high at the end of 2018 and we began the destocking program. And a little bit of a time delay on that one simply because of -- the plate tends to trail hot band by about 2 months, 3 months, in terms of both volumes and pricing. So there was a little bit of a time delay, but basically, the same scenario played out in plate that we described earlier."

There was a run-up in electrodes over the last couple of years that was unsustainable, and we're seeing it start to work its way down. But in general, I'll respond to your question. First of all, Nucor is a high-integrity company, we honor all the contracts that we have, and we will not go out and demand any price reductions on contracts that we have signed, and the current numbers are in place. 
That said, if our suppliers do, in fact, offer our competitors better pricing, we will go and talk to them about that. We will not demand it, but we'll remind them that as the largest steel producer in the United States, we buy a whole lot more of everything than anyone else. And if they treat us any differently than our competition, we'll remember that when those contracts that we have come to an end and we go talk about who we're going to do business with in 2020. Does that answer your question?"

Before we discuss our second quarter earnings, I would like to thank our teammates for continued excellent safety performance. Safety is the #1 priority for everyone on the Nucor team, and we continue to work to improve at it, identifying and mitigating risks and changing behaviors to achieve our goal of 0 incidents at every Nucor facility. 
Turning now to our performance in this quarter. Our financial results were lower than our expectations at the start of the quarter. Unusually wet weather and aggressive supply chain destocking impacted mill order rates in the first half of 2019.
We have seen lower volumes during the first half of this year, resulting in a more challenging price environment. However, real demand for our products remains strong in key end-use markets. We see healthy conditions in end-use markets that typically account for more than 2/3 of our steel shipments. For this reason, we are cautiously optimistic that pricing has bottomed on most of our products and that volumes should be more closely aligned with real end-use demand in the second half of the year.
We all know that the steel industry is cyclical, and we have built our business model around that reality with our low and highly variable cost structure and our diversified product portfolio. 
Our performance in the first half of the year benefited from meaningful year-over-year earnings gains in our plate, MBQ, rebar, joist and deck, metal buildings and pilings distribution businesses, once again highlighting the benefits of our diversified product mix.
Our strategy to increase market share in automotive applications also continues to bear fruit. We are currently shipping into this market at an annual rate of about 1.6 million tons. 
Further, we were recently named Supplier of the Year by General Motors. We are the first EAF-based steel producer to receive this recognition. It's a tremendous testament to our team and further evidence of our success moving up the value chain and gaining market share in many value-added applications.
As we have previously discussed, we have several investment projects coming online this year, and I want to update you on their status. In our Sheet Group, we continued to ramp up production of our new Specialty Cold Mill at Nucor Steel Arkansas, and we have been pleased with the performance. This project will allow us to produce higher-valued products, especially in high-strength steels, and it will differentiate Nucor Steel Arkansas from its competitors. We are currently in trials for value-added applications, and customer acceptance has been excellent to this point.
We are targeting to have as much as 20% of the new mill's capacity booked with contract customers by the year-end. We expect to continue adding contract volumes at the mill as 2020 progresses. 
In Kentucky, Nucor Steel Gallatin has begun commissioning its new galvanizing line and test running coils to verify the functionality of the line. Production of pickled and oiled coils have started this month and will be followed by production of galvanized coils in August. With 500,000 tons of annual capacity, this 72-inch galvanizing line will be the widest hot-rolled galvanizing facility in North America. Gallatin is now positioned to supply the underserved Midwest heavy-gauge, hot-band galvanized market. The new line will enable us to grow our automotive applications to include frames, control arms, supports and brackets. Our commercial teams are excited to have these new capabilities in our Sheet Mill Group to serve both new and existing customers. 
The last project in our Sheet Mill Group I would like to mention is our joint venture with JFE Steel in Mexico. We are on track for a start-up of the galvanizing line later this year, and we look forward to serving automotive customers in Mexico.
In the Bar Mill Group, our Marion, Ohio bar mill's new in-line rolling mill is starting up in the third quarter. Marion's new reheat furnace, which we installed last year, is reducing our natural gas consumption by about 1/4. In late 2019 or early 2020, Marion will also install quench and temper equipment to reduce alloy costs at the melt shop. The upgrades significantly improve Marion's efficiency and strengthens its leadership position in the regional rebar market. 
Two other projects in our long products group are on track for start-ups later this year: the merchant bar product expansion at our mill in Illinois and the first of our new rebar micromills, which is located in Sedalia, Missouri. In all, we have 10 significant organic investments in various stages of development, representing a total capital investment of approximately $3.5 billion that will deliver long-term profitable growth to our shareholders. 
As I have made clear on several occasions, we are not simply adding tons to get bigger. These projects target defined market objectives and opportunities to generate higher profits and reduce volatility through the cycle. They also expand our product portfolio so that we will be able to offer our customers more solutions to meet their toughest challenges. 
The U.S. steel industry continues to benefit from effective trade enforcement. Through May of 2019, total and finished steel imports declined by 12% and 18% from last year's levels. In the last 12 months, approximately 6 million fewer tons of imported steel have come in to the U.S. market. The decrease in imports reflects the cost competitiveness of our domestic steel industry and the success of our industry's ongoing efforts to see that the rules of trade are enforced.
Recent findings by the U.S. Department of Commerce provide further evidence that our industry, our government and our customers understand the importance of acting to keep unfairly traded steel and steel products from distorting the U.S. market.
On July 2, the U.S. Department of Commerce issued its preliminary circumvention determination on imports of galvanized and cold-rolled sheet steel from Vietnam manufactured with hot-rolled or cold-rolled substrate from South Korea and Taiwan. Congress found that the steel went through minor modifications in Vietnam to avoid appropriate restrictions that have been imposed on imports from South Korea and Taiwan. The imports of these products from Vietnam must now pay duties of more than 400%. It is vitally important that our government stop these and similar illegal trans-shipments meant to avoid trade duties, and we are glad that they have taken such a strong action. 
On July 8, the U.S. Department of Commerce also issued a preliminary countervailing duty determination on imports of fabricated structural steel from China and Mexico, and duties have been applied to imports from both countries. This ruling shows that the government is not only concerned about unfair trade practices in raw steel but also in downstream products. Rules-based trade is a critical underpinning to the continued success of our customers, Nucor and the U.S. economy, and we are pleased that the Department of Commerce continues to take action on individual trade cases. 
Jim Frias will now provide more specific detail about our second quarter performance as well as our outlook for the remainder of this year. Jim?"
184945,626751718,1775316,"Nucor Corporation, Q2 2019 Earnings Call, Jul 18, 2019",2019-07-18,"Earnings Calls","Nucor Corporation","Executives","Thanks, John. Nucor reported second quarter of 2019 earnings of $1.26 per diluted share. Earnings from our steel mills segment were lower due primarily to reduced shipments to our service center customers, reflecting their caution with respect to inventor",639,"Thanks, John. Nucor reported second quarter of 2019 earnings of $1.26 per diluted share. Earnings from our steel mills segment were lower due primarily to reduced shipments to our service center customers, reflecting their caution with respect to inventory levels and order rates in a weakening price environment. Earnings from our steel products segment improved in the second quarter, in line with our expectations. Strong nonresidential construction markets, along with increased productivity from our rebar fabrication and metal buildings businesses, were the primary factors. Results from our raw materials segment were slightly better than we anticipated.
It is worth noting that our second quarter results included $20.5 million of pre-operating and start-up costs related to strategic investment projects compared with $19.6 million in the first quarter of 2019 and approximately $6 million in the year ago quarter. 
First half 2019 cash provided from operations was approximately $1.2 billion, up from about $870 million for the year ago period. Inventories and receivables were a source of approximately $400 million in the first half, reflecting consistent working capital management in a declining price environment.
Our capital spending accelerated in the second quarter and totaled $650 million so far this year. We have received our permits for the Gallatin expansion, so between that and other projects that we have in our pipeline, we expect to increase CapEx further in the second half and approach our budgeted amount of approximately $1.8 billion for the full year. 
With respect to cash returned to shareholders during the second quarter, we paid dividends of $123 million and stock repurchases totaled $125 million. Thus far, in 2019, we returned 50% of our net income to our shareholders while also investing for long-term profitable growth. We ended the quarter with $1.4 billion of cash on hand. 
Nucor's financial condition remains strong. With total debt outstanding of $4.2 billion, our gross debt-to-capital ratio was 28% at the end of the second quarter. Our $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility remains undrawn and does not mature until April of 2023. Our next material debt maturity is in 2022 for approximately $600 million. 
Now turning to the outlook. Earnings for the third quarter of 2019 are expected to be lower than the second quarter. Inventory destocking, especially by service center customers, has led to declining results year-to-date and our muted expectations for the next quarter. While we are encouraged by recent upturns in the prices for flat-rolled steel products and, as John mentioned, we do continue to see healthy demand for our major end-use markets, we finished the second quarter with much lower margins in sheet and plate steel and believe that margin recovery could take some time. We therefore expect weaker linked-quarter performance in the steel mills segment again, primarily reflecting reduced margins for both sheet and plate steel. However, we do expect that service center customers will resume more normal buying patterns in the third quarter. 
The steel products segment is expected to achieve further profitability improvement in the third quarter over the second quarter. Nonresidential construction activity remains strong, and we believe some incremental demand has likely shifted to later in the year due to difficult weather conditions during the first several months of 2019. Recent initiatives to improve the performance of our rebar fabrication and metal building businesses are also expected to continue to favorably impact results for the steel products segment. The performance of our raw materials segment is expected to decline in the third quarter compared to the second quarter due to further margin pressure at our direct reduced iron ore DRI plants.
In addition, later this quarter, we will begin our planned 65-day outage at Nucor Steel Louisiana to complete major enhancements to the physical plant. 
Thank you for your interest in our company. I will now turn the call back over to John."

I think that this is a question of what's really driving the buying reductions in tubular and in our steel. Now overall, we believe that the issue is too much inventory in the system that has to work its way through and at the time that it goes through. You have to remember, when you talk about tubular, 80% of the tubulars are sold through service centers. So this really impacts -- this issue of inventory really impacts the tubular business. But it's also true of our steel business, as we talked about many times in the past. The inventories do not necessarily -- service center shipments do not necessarily indicate what's happening with true end-use demand. We believe that end-use demand is still very strong. We see that in our order entry rate for OEMs versus our order entry rate for service centers. When you look at our order entry rate for OEMs, we're actually up in the first half by about 4% compared to the 3-year average. Whereas if you look at order entry for service centers, we're down 14% compared to the 3-year average. So that's a pretty good indicator to us that end demand is still pretty strong. Of course, we talk to our customers who are basically telling us the same thing, and I'm speaking in general now both of steel and our tubular products also."

I mentioned earlier that after the first $40-a-ton increase in sheet pricing, we did see a pickup in orders for our sheet products, and that came from both our OEM customers, but also from our service centers. When we meet with our service centers, we talk about what they think is going to happen in the second half. They feel that the demand, the end demand for their products will be steady. It's still strong. They talk about the need for making sure that they get their inventories completely down, which is what they are striving to accomplish. But one of the things that we're seeing also, that should be a good indicator of moving in -- and it's early in the game so I don't want to be too overconfident here, but we are cautiously optimistic that we've hit the bottom on pricing and on volumes. We see our lead times are beginning to stretch out a little bit. Whenever that starts to happen, that encourages the service centers to come back into the market. Now with the OEMs, it's more of a steady-state situation. So after the $40-a-ton increase, we believe that, that represented the bottom of the market. Service centers, whenever you see pricing start to go up, they come back into the market. So we think that, that bodes well for the second half of the year, and we'll see how it plays out."

First of all, if you go all the way back to 2017, with tax reform and deregulation, that was really a shot in the arm for manufacturing. And frankly, the order entry rate picked up, demand for steel picked up, and it was growing all through 2017. Towards the end of '17, but particularly in the beginning of '18, a lot of our customers were reading about the fact that when the tariffs came into effect, we would not -- they would not be able to get the steel that they needed to fill their customers' orders. That created somewhat of a panic, both with the OEM and with our service center customers. They were convinced that the domestic capacity would not be enough to supply all the needs that they had to keep their customers happy. 
But as it played out, 232 came into effect, the imports did go down, and domestic capacity was enabled, was, in fact, able to start up again and fill the need. But during that time when they were afraid of getting -- not being able to get the steel, they built their inventories to very high levels. And of course, domestic capacity came on, everything settled down, the order rate and pricing returned to more normalized levels, but they've maintained this high inventory. At the end of the year, they wanted to get rid of that overblown inventory and they began to aggressively destock. So what happens then, okay, they destock volume. All the volumes coming into the mills go down. Pricing results, as a result, goes down. And the next thing you know, we get into this spiral of -- in fact, the aggressive destocking was so intense that towards the end of last year and into the first half of this year, we had service centers selling to other service centers. So it became a very difficult situation. And as always happens in our business, we overshoot things. Now we think that we're getting to the point where the inventories are down to more normal levels, and we expect to see more normalized ordering rates in the next quarter."

So there's a lot of projects that are on the books, but we haven't been able to move forward with them simply because of the extreme weather conditions. 
The other impact is, as you mentioned, aggressive destocking. Just as we said with the products earlier with tubular and with sheet products, the same occurred with plates. The inventory levels got way too high at the end of 2018 and we began the destocking program. And a little bit of a time delay on that one simply because of -- the plate tends to trail hot band by about 2 months, 3 months, in terms of both volumes and pricing. So there was a little bit of a time delay, but basically, the same scenario played out in plate that we described earlier."

Thank you for joining us for our third quarter earnings call and for your interest in Nucor. Other members of Nucor's executive team are also on the call today, including Leon Topalian, our President and Chief Operating Officer; Jim Frias,",686,"Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us for our third quarter earnings call and for your interest in Nucor. Other members of Nucor's executive team are also on the call today, including Leon Topalian, our President and Chief Operating Officer; Jim Frias, our Chief Financial Officer; Craig Feldman, responsible for Raw Materials; Ladd Hall, responsible for sheet products; Ray Napolitan, responsible for Engineered Bar Products; Mary Emily Slate, responsible for plate, structural and tubular products; Dave Sumoski, responsible for Merchant Bar and Rebar Products; and Chad Utermark, responsible for Fabricated Construction Products.
Last month, I announced my retirement from Nucor effective at the end of this year. One of my priorities during my time as CEO has been to make certain that we have a deep bench of leadership talent and a robust management succession plan in place. I know we have succeeded on both fronts. Identifying the right leaders is a key component of our company's future success. 
I am delighted that the Nucor Board of Directors has elected Leon Topalian to succeed me as Nucor's next CEO. Leon has proven himself to be an exceptional leader throughout his 23-year career at Nucor.
Since 2017, he has served as Executive Vice President responsible for Nucor's plate and structural steel mills. Prior to joining our corporate senior leadership, Leon was General Manager at 2 facilities: at our Nucor Yamato structural steel mill and our Kankakee Illinois Bar Mill. With the support of our leadership team and all of our teammates, I am confident that Leon will guide Nucor towards continued success. 
I'm also confident that we have an executive leadership team that is second to none in our industry and I know Leon and the Board feel the same way.
Before I provide comments on our third quarter results, I want to say a few words about safety. One of my proudest accomplishments during my time as CEO is the way that our entire organization has improved our safety performance. I want to thank all of my teammates who have constant focus on working safely. We are having one of our best years ever for safety performance. Let's keep that focus as we move closer to our goal which will always be: Zero incidents at every Nucor facility. Any injury is one too many.
Now on to our third quarter results. We saw continued strong performance from our metal buildings, piling, joist and deck divisions as well as improved performance in our rebar fabrication divisions. The performance reflects excellent execution by our teammates and continued stable conditions in the nonresidential construction market. 
Overall spending in the nonresidential construction market, which typically accounts for approximately 1/2 of our company's shipments remain at healthy levels. 
After a brief summer rally, plate and sheet market conditions soften in the third quarter. Excess inventory throughout the supply chain has resulted in continued destocking by our customers. Service center industry data indicates that inventories remain low. 
In addition, our OEM customers have become cautious about buying as we head into the year-end. However, we do believe that both our service center and OEM customers will start restocking to meet demand as 2020 gets underway. 
Looking out further into next year, the pending 2020 elections and current trade issues, such as the unresolved status of the USMCA agreement for North America, are creating some more uncertainty in the market. And while it's difficult to predict steel markets that far into the future, we continue to have great confidence in Nucor's business fundamentals and our long-term strategy. 
Finally, let me remind you all that we have several more of our growth projects starting up in the fourth quarter that will give us the capability to produce more of the products that our customers are asking us to make. We have said many times: these investments position us for continued success by taking advantage of specific market opportunity. We expect they will further enhance Nucor's position as a steel market leader. 
I'm now going to turn the call over to Leon to provide comments and an update on several of our growth initiatives. Leon?"

I'd like to begin by saying how honored I am to have the opportunity to lead this amazing company. I look forward to continuing the proud traditions that have made Nucor the premier steel and steel products company for the last 50 years. A hallmark of our success has and will continue to be our culture, which begins with the nearly 27,000 team members who make up the Nucor family. 
Our culture drew me to this company 23 years ago and it inspires me daily. And the most important value in our culture is safety, taking care of our team is the most important responsibility we have. I take it very personally and will work tirelessly to continue Nucor's quest of becoming the safest steel company in the world.
Since the announcement, I've been visiting many of our divisions and have been humbled by the warm reception I received. In talking with our team, it's obvious they are deeply engaged in our mission and just as excited about Nucor's future as I am. That excitement is especially evident among our team members who are bringing new growth online. Let me just say thank you for your hard work, dedication, commitment and never losing sight of our most important value, safety.
I'd like now to provide you with an update on some of the projects we're bringing online. At Nucor Steel Arkansas, our Hickman team continues to increase production and improve yield performance in our new specialty. The mill's flexibility is a key feature with its dual configuration, Hickman's new cold mill can change from a high reduction mill for the advanced strength steels in the future to a very efficient for high mill in just 6 minutes. This flexibility separates us from our competition and allows us to efficiently offer a broader range of value-added products. There is no other carbon mill like this in North America. 
Nucor Steel Gallatin's new galvanizing iron team coded their first coils on September 27. With 500,000 tons of annual capacity, Gallatin 72-inch galvanizing line is the widest hot-rolled galvanizing facility in North America.
Gallatin is extremely well positioned to grow Nucor's share of the underserved Midwest heavy gauge galvanizing hotbed market. 
At our Ohio rebar mill, commissioning of the new in-line rolling mill was completed in August and the Marion team is currently ramping up production. Early next year, Marrion will also install quench and temper equipment to reduce alloy costs. 
These investments combined with a more energy-efficient reheat furnace installed last year will position Marion as the low cost producer in the region. Other projects on track for start-up by the end of the year include: Nucor Steel Kankakee MBQ rolling mill, our new rebar micro mill in Sedalia, Missouri and the galvanizing line we're building in Mexico with JFE steel. 
As we have said before, we are not adding capacity simply to get bigger. These projects target the fine market opportunities where we are confident that we will compete and win highly profitable market share. 
We are also responding to feedback from our customers regarding their product needs particularly for value-added products. Nucor is doing more than adding capacity. Nucor is increasing our capabilities to provide our customers with superior value.
we achieved that with unique product properties, matched product breath, industry-leading on-time delivery and unrivaled quality. Every growth project we are implementing builds on our competitive strengths to serve new product and geographic markets. We these investments, we are increasing Nucor's long-term earnings power. This is the same strategy Nucor has successfully executed through numerous market cycles over the past 5 decades. 
At this time, I will turn the call over to Jim Frias for a review of our financial results. Jim?"

Nucor reported third quarter of 2019 earnings of $0.90 per diluted share. These results exceeded our guidance range of $0.75 to $0.80 due to better-than-expected performance at our sheet and bar steel mills as well as from several steel prod",711,"Thanks, Leon. Nucor reported third quarter of 2019 earnings of $0.90 per diluted share. These results exceeded our guidance range of $0.75 to $0.80 due to better-than-expected performance at our sheet and bar steel mills as well as from several steel products businesses, most notably joist, deck and building systems.
It's worth noting that both our joist and deck business and our metal buildings business are on pace for record year in 2019. Both of these business groups are benefiting from lower steel prices and excellent commercial execution. The metal buildings business is also benefiting from a restructuring that has realigned capacity and reduced fixed costs. 
Earnings from our steel mill segment were lower than the second quarter due to declining metal margins. Sheet and plate products experienced the greatest pricing pressure as custom destocking continued in the third quarter. Total steel mill shipments in the third quarter were comparable to the second quarter. 
Steel mill shipments to internal customers represented 21% of total steel mill shipments in the third quarter, an increase from 19% in the second quarter. Nucor's downstream channels to market strategy remains a key competitive strength of our company.
Earnings from our steel products segment improved compared to the second quarter of this year and to the year ago third quarter. Nonresidential construction market conditions remained positive. Our businesses appear to have benefited from both recovery from weather-related disruptions earlier in the year and seasonally stronger construction months. 
Results from our raw materials segment decreased compared to the second quarter due to further margin compression at our direct reduced iron or DRI operations. In addition, our Louisiana DRI facility began its planned outage in early September and that is expected to continue until mid-November. 
Our third quarter results included roughly $28 million of preoperating and start-up costs related to strategic investment projects compared with approximately $21 million in the second quarter of 2019 and approximately $11 million in the year ago quarter.
First 9 months of 2019 cash provided from operations was approximately $2.1 billion, up from about $1.9 billion for the year ago period. Nucor continues to benefit from its highly variable cost structure. Accounts receivable, payables and inventory were a source of approximately $500 million during the first 9 months of 2019, reflecting consistent working capital management in a declining steel pricing environment. 
Capital expenditures totaled $985 million through the first 9 months of 2019. Our full year 2019 capital spending budget is now approximately $1.5 billion, a decrease from our prior forecast of $1.8 billion. This change reflects the timing of expected outlays over the balance of this year. 
Cash return to shareholders during the first 9 months of 2019 totaled $567 million. We paid dividends of $369 million and stock repurchases totaled $198 million.
Thus far in 2019, we have returned 49% of our net income to our shareholders while also investing for long-term profitable growth. Nucor's financial condition remains strong. We ended the quarter with $1.9 billion in cash and short-term investment. 
With total debt outstanding of approximately $4.3 billion, our gross debt-to-capital ratio was 28% at the end of the third quarter. Our $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility remains undrawn and does not mature until April of 2023.
Our next material debt maturity is in 2022 for approximately $600 million. Now turning to the outlook. Nucor's earnings in the fourth quarter of 2019 are expected to be lower than the third quarter. While nonresidential construction markets remain broadly stable and healthy, manufacturing sector activity has slowed down. 
We expect earnings in the steel mills segment to further decrease from the third quarter due to an impact of lower steel prices at the end of the third quarter, which will be realized in fourth quarter shipments. We believe steel prices have bottomed. 
The profitability of the steel products segment is expected to decrease slightly due to normal year-end seasonality. The performance of our raw material segment is expected to decline in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter due to the impact of our Louisiana DRI plants, outage continuing until mid-November as well as further margin pressure throughout our raw materials businesses. 
Thank you for your interest in our company. I will now turn the call over back to John."

Congratulations again to the Crawfordsville team for all they have accomplished over the past 30 years. With regard to trade policy, imports continued to supply a shrinking share of the U.S. demand, thanks to the cost competitiveness of our market-oriented domestic steel industry and effective trade enforcement. 
At Nucor, we will not take this progress for granted and we will continue to press for sensible legislation, regulation and enforcement.

Things that drive that are couple things: Number one, you're right. We see the scrap market starting to improve. We anticipate that the scrap pricing will go up about $20. May be next month, $20, $25, somewhere in that neighborhood. We think that trend will continue throughout the year. Our best guess on scrap pricing right now for the year is up $20 to $40 by the end of the year. 
The other thing that I would say that's driving our belief is that when we start to look at our bookings, particularly in our sheet area, over the last several weeks, bookings have improved. We see more energy and particularly in the hotbend. Coal oil and has always been fairly strong. We haven't seen much of a decline in those 2 products. Hot band, as you know, was really challenged for the first part of this year. We talk about this in the past. Overstocking of inventories last year. The tough weather conditions at the beginning of this year. Destocking this year. These are all things that have contributed to challenging steel market during this year. We see that ending. When we look at MSCI inventories, we see them at -- I mean, they are incredibly low levels and lower we seen in many, many years. And compared to last year, they are down and at this time -- t same's time last year, they are down fairly significantly. So these are all things that we see driving our comments that we think that the pricing as well as the will increase as we go forward. One more point that I will make is -- first, Leon, you want to say something?"

I would comment that we think that we've seen the bottom of that stocking, destocking now. It's coming to an end and we expect that to pick up a little bit.

We've got a very intentional process for how we think about returning capital to investors as well as investing in our business or capital allocation. Mindset begins with idea that we want to invest strategic long-term growth and of course, we do have a number of projects in our pipeline. And as you kind of noted, we're a little behind in terms of the spending on some of those capital projects. So that resulted in us temporarily having more cash in the balance sheet. That's going to catch up pretty quickly over the next 6 to 9 months and we're going to need some of that cash to fund a lot of the capital project that are in process. 
But aside from that, as to think about we've been dealing with this idea that we want to return a minimum of 40% of our earnings. And then we also want to maintain a debt-to-capital ratio that supports our strong investment grade credit rating. And at times when that debt-to-capital ratio becomes too low, we will return more like we did late last year when we have a view that we have depth of liquidity. 
And so it's possible we'll do more before the end of the year, but it depends on our forecast of cash going into 2020. Because working capital has benefited us to the tune of roughly $0.5 billion million this year. If steel prices reverse and scrap price is reversed, we're going to need -- we're going to have some need of cash in working capital next year. We definitely will see acceleration of capital spending. So we're being thoughtful about not just where we stand with cash today but where we expect cash to be through next year."

I'm going to answer 2 questions that you're not asking but is sort of related. As she and -- marketing has also been dramatically lower. So the piece that's reflected in both places is incentive compensation. Incentive compensation in the quarter is about $88 million less this year than last year year-to-date. It's about $104 million less and that's affecting both the [indiscernible] line and the marketing admin and underline. 
So that's just because we're making less money and profiteering, the biggest piece of that profit sharing is employees below the level of Vice President. And then additionally, we have the profit eliminate this year. In the third quarter, it was a benefit of about $34 million. Last year, it was an expense of about $67 million. So as margin and steel fall, we revalue that inventory. We sometimes get a benefit from their company eliminations. To get a benefit to the third quarter this year year-to-date they are benefit is about $91 million and last year, the expense was about $228 million. So that's been a pretty serious swing as well.

So it's down a little bit from last year for certain but still 16 8 to 16 9, those are pretty good numbers.

So clearly, the demand in our loan price is better. There was a less of a destocking issue with our loan products particularly when you talk about rebar, being less of an issue with rebar then we did in our sheet products on our plate products, a little bit in merchant and not significantly more. So demand was strong, overstory have imploded to the level that is in our products. Last year, lot of our loan products obviously going to construction. And construction has been relatively strong, lot of our loan products merchant and we are going to a downstream businesses. Jim mentioned in this comment internally, we're shipping about 20% of our steel products downstream. A lot of that is loan products going into our building systems in particular [indiscernible] operations. And they have been strong kicks all of those kind of lead into that. Now having said all of that, when you talk about the loan products and we talk about structural certainly the infrastructure build will continue to help with us with that -- continue to encourage the administration to get going on something that's badly needed in this country will bust infrastructure build.
So that's a little bit about the loan products. Now in terms of the comment or your question about micro mills regionally and the demand or the supply/demand ratio in the areas where we're building them, we still feel very good about that. We talked about in the past about the regional nature of these microbials. We're not going to comment on any of our competitors shutting down or anything like that. We believe that the 2 things that are going to really give us on advantage with the microbials our right in the heart of the marketplace. We've got great scrap availability for those mills.

But bear in mind that of course, all of our products, we saw this issue of over stalking at the end of 2018 also in the downstream business, downstream customers. 
You talk about some of the flat products and on the plate products. Some of our large equipment manufacturing customers. I don't want to name any specifically. But we know for a fact that they are inventory is up, there inventories are up at that plant site and the dealers and even in some stores location. So it's primarily -- we still feel very strongly. it's primarily an issue of stalking and destocking. We think that if you look at your domain, we think demand is somewhat down by 3% or 4%. Certainly, the volumes do not reflect that, more significant than that. So we still believe strongly that was looking at the issue of stalking and destocking that will continue to work our way through.

Just as a reminder, there was 2 major things that we're attacking all together 2 major ones. One is in the handling, how we manage the feeding of the raw material storage and feeding into the furnace. And that's gone particularly well. We think that can have a major impact on the productivity of that operation and we also think we placed the lining in the vessel. 
And as you might recall, we have had numerous major problems with the process and of course, we have basically replacing the entire process within the design that we have great feel of confidence. And all of these changes were done to increase the productivity, reduced our cost in that operation. It's called project 8,000 for a reason. Reason being that we want to be able to get out to 8,000 hours of operation. We believe that we'll be able to accomplish that next year. If we do -- and let me rephrase that, when we do, okay, we'll have the result of about 2.2 metric tons of production. 2.2 million metric tons our drove that operation, which will put in terms of hours of operation on par with our Trinidad facility, which suggest under 8,000 hours of operation last year.

It's been a pleasure to work together with my teammates to serve all of you during my 3 decades with Nucor. And speaking of my teammates, I always give -- I often give the following advice: Successful people surround themselves with great teams. 
If you want to be successful, you need to have the right people and the right positions on your team. I have been fortunate to always have the right people around me at Nucor, including the team on this call today. A strong leadership team we have built over the last decade will ensure that we have a deep bench of talent to draw upon for years to come. 
They have worked with me to achieve a number of accomplishments, which I am very proud of: A strong record of safety, the rollout of digital tools to better connect with and serve our customers, the execution on our 5 drivers of profitable growth, including our greater penetration of the automotive market, our significantly expanded channels to market and our new rebar micro mills, as well as Nucor's evolution into a company that is more intensely focused on commercial excellence and building powerful strategic partnerships with our customers. 
I want to thank all of our Nucor teammates for the hard work that they have done during my tenure to achieve tehse successes and for the hard work that I know they will continue to do each and every day into the future to build a safer and more profitable Nucor. 
2020 is going to be another exciting year for our company. When we asked Leon to join the executive team, I knew Nucor was bringing a strong leader to Charlotte. I have known Leon for years. I have been proud to call him a teammate. I've watched how he has met the challenges head-on, preparing him for the role into, which he now steps. And let me tell you something. I know that Leon and the great team around him will ensure that Nucor continues to be an industry leader well into the future. I'm excited to see where Leon and the team takes our company next.
At Nucor, we believe that we are never as good today as we're going to be tomorrow. There is always an opportunity to be better. I leave you all in the very capable hands, more confident than ever at Nucor's best years are still ahead of us. 
Thank you again for what you do for Nucor everyday. And to my teammate, thank you again particularly for doing it safely. Please never forget there is nothing more important than safety. Absolutely nothing. Thank you for your interest in our company. Have a great day."

Last month, I announced my retirement from Nucor, effective at the end of this year. One of my priorities during my time as CEO has been to make certain that we have a deep bench of leadership talent and a robust management succession plan in place. I know we have succeeded on both fronts. Identifying the right leaders is a key component of our company's future success. 
I am delighted that the Nucor Board of Directors has elected Leon Topalian to succeed me as Nucor's next CEO. Leon has proven himself to be an exceptional leader throughout his 23-year career at Nucor.
Since 2017, he has served as Executive Vice President responsible for Nucor's plate and structural steel mills. Prior to joining our corporate senior leadership, Leon was General Manager at 2 facilities: at our Nucor Yamato structural steel mill and our Kankakee Illinois bar mill. With the support of our leadership team and all of our teammates, I am confident that Leon will guide Nucor towards continued success. 
I'm also confident that we have an executive leadership team that is second to none in our industry, and I know Leon and the Board feel the same way.
Before I provide comments on our third quarter results, I want to say a few words about safety. One of my proudest accomplishments during my time as CEO is the way that our entire organization has improved our safety performance. I want to thank all of my teammates who have constant focus on working safely. We are having one of our best years ever for safety performance. Let's keep that focus as we move closer to our goal, which will always be: Zero incidents at every Nucor facility. Any injury is one too many. 
Now on to our third quarter results. We saw continued strong performance from our metal buildings, piling, joist and deck divisions as well as improved performance in our rebar fabrication divisions. The performance reflects excellent execution by our teammates and continued stable conditions in the nonresidential construction market. 
Overall spending in the nonresidential construction market, which typically accounts for approximately 1/2 of our company's shipments remain at healthy levels. 
After a brief summer rally, plate and sheet market conditions softened in the third quarter. Excess inventory throughout the supply chain has resulted in continued destocking by our customers. Service center industry data indicates that inventories remain low. 
In addition, our OEM customers have become cautious about buying as we head into the year-end. However, we do believe that both our service center and OEM customers will start restocking to meet demand as 2020 gets underway. 
Looking out further into next year, the pending 2020 elections and current trade issues, such as the unresolved status of the USMCA agreement for North America, are creating some more uncertainty in the market. And while it's difficult to predict steel markets that far into the future, we continue to have great confidence in Nucor's business fundamentals and our long-term strategy. 
Finally, let me remind you all that we have several more of our growth projects starting up in the fourth quarter that will give us the capability to produce more of the products that our customers are asking us to make. We have said many times, these investments position us for continued success by taking advantage of specific market opportunity. We expect they will further enhance Nucor's position as a steel market leader. 
I'm now going to turn the call over to Leon to provide comments and an update on several of our growth initiatives. Leon?"

I'd like to begin by saying how honored I am to have the opportunity to lead this amazing company. I look forward to continuing the proud traditions that have made Nucor the premier steel and steel products company for the last 50 years. A hallmark of our success has and will continue to be our culture, which begins with the nearly 27,000 team members who make up the Nucor family. 
Our culture drew me to this company 23 years ago and it inspires me daily. And the most important value in our culture is safety, taking care of our team is the most important responsibility we have. I take it very personally and we'll work tirelessly to continue Nucor's quest of becoming the safest steel company in the world.
Since the announcement, I've been visiting many of our divisions and have been humbled by the warm reception I've received. In talking with our team, it's obvious, they are deeply engaged in our mission and just as excited about Nucor's future as I am. That excitement is especially evident among our team members who are bringing new growth projects online. Let me just say thank you for your hard work, dedication, commitment and never losing sight of our most important value, safety.
I'd like now to provide you with an update on some of the projects we're bringing online. At Nucor Steel Arkansas, our Hickman team continues to increase production and improve yield performance on our new specialty cold mill. The mill's flexibility is a key feature. With its dual configuration, Hickman's new cold mill can change from a high reduction mill for the advanced strength steels in the future to a very efficient 4 high mill in just 6 minutes. This flexibility separates us from our competition and allows us to efficiently offer a broader range of value-added products. There is no other carbon mill like this in North America.  
Nucor Steel Gallatin's new galvanizing line team coated their first coils on September 27. With 500,000 tons of annual capacity, Gallatin's 72-inch galvanizing line is the widest hot-rolled galvanizing facility in North America.
Gallatin is extremely well positioned to grow Nucor's share of the underserved Midwest heavy gauge galvanizing hot-band market.  
At our Marion, Ohio rebar mill, commissioning of the new in-line rolling mill was completed in August and the Marion team is currently ramping up production. Early next year, Marrion will also install quench and temper equipment to reduce alloy costs. 
These investments, combined with a more energy-efficient reheat furnace installed last year, will position Marion as the low cost producer in the region. Other projects on track for start-up by the end of the year include: Nucor Steel Kankakee's MBQ rolling mill; our new rebar micro mill in Sedalia, Missouri; and the galvanizing line we're building in Mexico with JFE steel. 
As we have said before, we are not adding capacity simply to get bigger. These projects target defined market opportunities where we are confident that we will compete and win highly profitable market share. 
We are also responding to feedback from our customers regarding their product needs, particularly for value-added products. Nucor is doing more than adding capacity. Nucor is increasing our capabilities to provide our customers with superior value. We achieved that with unique product properties, unmatched product breadth, industry-leading on-time delivery and unrivaled quality. Every growth project we are implementing builds on our competitive strengths to serve new product and geographic markets. With these investments, we are increasing Nucor's long-term earnings power. This is the same strategy Nucor has successfully executed through numerous market cycles over the past 5 decades. 
At this time, I will turn the call over to Jim Frias for a review of our financial results. Jim?"
184945,638948069,1836147,"Nucor Corporation, Q3 2019 Earnings Call, Oct 22, 2019",2019-10-22,"Earnings Calls","Nucor Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Leon. Nucor reported third quarter of 2019 earnings of $0.90 per diluted share. These results exceeded our guidance range of $0.75 to $0.80 due to better-than-expected performance at our sheet and bar steel mills as well as from several steel prod",712,"Thanks, Leon. Nucor reported third quarter of 2019 earnings of $0.90 per diluted share. These results exceeded our guidance range of $0.75 to $0.80 due to better-than-expected performance at our sheet and bar steel mills as well as from several steel products businesses, most notably joist, deck and building systems.
It's worth noting that both our joist and deck business and our metal buildings business are on pace for a record year in 2019. Both of these business groups are benefiting from lower steel prices and excellent commercial execution. The metal buildings business is also benefiting from a restructuring that has realigned capacity and reduced fixed costs. 
Earnings from our steel mill segment were lower than the second quarter due to declining metal margins. Sheet and plate products experienced the greatest pricing pressure as custom destocking continued in the third quarter. Total steel mill shipments in the third quarter were comparable to the second quarter. 
Steel mill shipments to internal customers represented 21% of total steel mill shipments in the third quarter, an increase from 19% in the second quarter. Nucor's downstream channels to market strategy remains a key competitive strength of our company.
Earnings from our steel products segment improved compared to the second quarter of this year and to the year ago third quarter. Nonresidential construction market conditions remained positive. Our businesses appear to have benefited from both recovery from weather-related disruptions earlier in the year and seasonally stronger construction months. 
Results from our raw materials segment decreased compared to the second quarter due to further margin compression at our direct reduced iron or DRI operations. In addition, our Louisiana DRI facility began its planned outage in early September and that is expected to continue until mid-November. 
Our third quarter results included roughly $28 million of pre-operating and start-up costs related to strategic investment projects compared with approximately $21 million in the second quarter of 2019 and approximately $11 million in the year ago quarter.
First 9 months of 2019 cash provided from operations was approximately $2.1 billion, up from about $1.9 billion for the year ago period. Nucor continues to benefit from its highly variable cost structure. Accounts receivable, payables and inventory were a source of approximately $500 million during the first 9 months of 2019, reflecting consistent working capital management in a declining steel pricing environment. 
Capital expenditures totaled $985 million through the first 9 months of 2019. Our full year 2019 capital spending budget is now approximately $1.5 billion, a decrease from our prior forecast of $1.8 billion. This change reflects the timing of expected outlays over the balance of this year. 
Cash return to shareholders during the first 9 months of 2019 totaled $567 million. We paid dividends of $369 million and stock repurchases totaled $198 million.
Thus far in 2019, we have returned 49% of our net income to our shareholders while also investing for long-term profitable growth. Nucor's financial condition remains strong. We ended the quarter with $1.9 billion in cash and short-term investments. With total debt outstanding of approximately $4.3 billion, our gross debt-to-capital ratio was 28% at the end of the third quarter. Our $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility remains undrawn and does not mature until April of 2023. Our next material debt maturity is in 2022 for approximately $600 million. 
Now turning to the outlook. Nucor's earnings in the fourth quarter of 2019 are expected to be lower than the third quarter. While nonresidential construction markets remain broadly stable and healthy, manufacturing sector activity has slowed down. 
We expect earnings in the steel mills segment to further decrease from the third quarter due to an impact of lower steel prices at the end of the third quarter, which will be realized in fourth quarter shipments. We believe steel prices have bottomed. 
The profitability of the steel products segment is expected to decrease slightly due to normal year-end seasonality. The performance of our raw material segment is expected to decline in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter due to the impact of our Louisiana DRI plant's outage continuing until mid-November as well as further margin pressure throughout our raw materials businesses. 
Thank you for your interest in our company. I will now turn the call back over to John."

I recently had the privilege of joining the Nucor Steel Indiana team to celebrate 30 years of making steel in Crawfordsville. 
Three decades ago, our team revolutionized the American steel industry, becoming the first thin slab operation to produce sheet steel using an electric arc furnace. 600 people joined us for the celebration, including local officials, teammates, customers, suppliers and friends and family. 
Congratulations again to the Crawfordsville team for all they have accomplished over the past 30 years. With regard to trade policy, imports continued to supply a shrinking share of the U.S. demand, thanks to the cost competitiveness of our market-oriented domestic steel industry and effective trade enforcement. 
At Nucor, we will not take this progress for granted and we will continue to press for sensible legislation, regulation and enforcement. We also remain hopeful that Congress will approve the USMCA this year. We see it as a meaningful modernization of NAFTA that will benefit the U.S. economy and the domestic manufacturing sector in particular. 
We would now be happy to take your questions. Operator?"

The things that drive that are a couple of things: Number one, you're right, we see the scrap markets starting to improve. We anticipate that scrap pricing will go up about $20. Maybe next month, $20, $25, somewhere in that neighborhood. We think that, that trend will continue throughout the year. Our best guess on scrap pricing right now for the year is up $20 to $40 by the end of the year. 
The other thing that I would say that's driving our belief is that when we start to look at our bookings, particularly in our sheet area, over the last several weeks, bookings have improved. We see more energy, and particularly in the hot band. Now you know cold-rolled and galvanized has always been fairly strong. We haven't seen much of a decline in those 2 products. But hot band, as you know, was really challenged for the first part of this year. We talked about this in the past. Overstocking of inventories last year. The tough weather conditions at the beginning of this year. Destocking this year. These are all things that have contributed to a challenging steel market during this year. We see that ending. When we look at MSCI inventories, we see them at -- I mean, they're at incredibly low levels and lowest that we've seen in many, many years. And compared to last year, they're down at this time -- same time last year, they're down fairly significantly.

Structural business has been challenged this year. No doubt about it. A lot of it was a result of heavy stocking last year particularly in the last half of last year. We saw service centers stocking up pretty heavily. And then, of course, beginning of this year, as I mentioned earlier, weather conditions prohibited a lot of the construction from consuming some of that overstocking and we've been going through a destocking period now. I would comment that we think that we've seen the bottom of that stocking -- destocking now, it's coming to an end, and we expect that to pick up a little bit. 
We also expect to see some benefit from the recent determinations by commerce on fabricated structural steel. We had some very positive preliminary determinations.

We've got a very intentional process for how we think about returning capital to investors as well as investing in our business, also our capital allocation. Mindset begins with idea that we want to invest in strategic long-term growth, and of course, we do have a number of projects in our pipeline. And as you kind of noted, we're a little behind in terms of the spending on some of those capital projects. So that's resulted in us temporarily having more cash in the balance sheet. That's going to catch up pretty quickly over the next 6 to 9 months and we're going to need some of that cash to fund a lot of the capital project that are in process. 
Except from that, as we think about returning capital to investors, we begin with this idea that we want to return a minimum of 40% of our earnings. And then we also want to maintain a debt-to-capital ratio that supports our strong investment-grade credit rating. And in times when that debt-to-capital ratio becomes too low, we will return more like we did late last year when we have a view that we have depth of liquidity. 
And so it's possible we'll do more before the end of the year, but it depends on our forecast of cash going into 2020. Because working capital has benefited us to the tune of roughly $0.5 billion this year. If steel prices reverse and scrap prices reverse, we're going to need -- we're going to have some use of cash in working capital next year. We definitely will see an acceleration in capital spending. So we're being thoughtful about not just where we stand with cash today but where we expect cash to be through next year."

I'm going to answer 2 questions, one you're not asking but is sort of related. SG -- marketing and admin is also dramatically lower. So the piece that's reflected in both places is incentive compensation. Incentive compensation in the quarter is about $88 million less this year than last year year-to-date. It's about $104 million less, and that's affecting both the UM's line and the marketing, admin and other line. 
So -- and that's just because we're making less money, and profit sharing is the biggest piece of that. Profit sharing is what we set aside for employees below the level of Vice President. And then additionally, we have the profit elimination this year. In the third quarter, it was a benefit of about $34 million. Last year, it was an expense of about $67 million. So as margin and steel fall, we revalue that inventory. We sometimes get a benefit from company eliminations. So we got a benefit in the third quarter this year. Year-to-date, the benefit is about $91 million. And last year, the expense was about $228 million. So that's been a pretty serious swing as well. Those are the 2 biggest factors affecting the change in elims. And the incentive comp is the biggest factor affecting SG&A."

Your question about automotive. Now certainly, the automotive market has edged down, they're forecasting somewhere around 16.8, 16.9. I've heard just the other day almost 17. So it's down a little bit from last year for certain, but still, 16.8 to 16.9, those are pretty good numbers. And the important -- I think the important thing to note for us is that we continue to take a bigger share of that smaller pie. If you look at the tonnage that we sent into the automotive business this year compared to last year, we're up about 15% tons sent into automotive this year as compared to last year. So we continue to grow our market share. And although the pie use shrinking, we continue to get a bigger piece of that smaller pie. We feel real good about where we are in automotive.

So clearly, the demand in our long products is better. There was less of a destocking issue with our long products, particularly when you talk about rebar. We had less of an issue in rebar than we did in our sheet products and on our plate products. A little bit more in merchant but not significantly more. So demand was strong. Inventories hadn't bloated to the level that did in our flat products last year. A lot of our long products obviously going to construction. And construction has been relatively strong, a lot of our long products, merchant and rebar are going to our downstream businesses. 
Jim mentioned in his comment, internally, we're shipping about 20% of our steel products downstream. A lot of that is long products going into our building systems, in particular our Vulcraft and our Harris operations. And they have been strong. So all of those kind of lead into that. 
Now having said all of that, when talking about long products and talking about structural, certainly, an infrastructure build will continue to help with us with that. We continue to encourage the administration to get going on something that's badly needed in this country, a robust infrastructure bill.
So that's a little bit about the long products. Now in terms of the -- your comment or your question about our micro mills regionally and the demand or the supply/demand ratio in the areas where we're building them, we still feel very good about that. We've talked about in the past about the regional nature of these micro mills. We're not going to comment on any of our competitors shutting down or anything like that. We believe that the 2 things that are going to really give us an advantage with the micro mills are we're in right in the heart of the marketplace. We've got great scrap availability for those mills. The design of the mills provide for an extremely low cost structure, highly efficient, close to the supply of the raw material and close to the marketplace. Those are things that we feel make us very successful. Dave, do you want to add something?"

So until things are delivered, whether it's a service or a product, to the site, we can't actually count it as CapEx and pay for it. So some things kept falling behind what we'd hoped to accomplish this year. But by and large, we still expected the dates we've committed to in terms of starting the facilities. We're probably a little bit more conservative on our commitment for start-up dates than we are on the CapEx spending side. And yes, we will spend some money that we plan to spend this year and next year. So in January, we'll come out and give you a budget for 2020, but I would expect it to be notably higher than what we're actually going to spend in 2019, partly because of the carryover from 2019."

We've talked a lot about the stocking and destocking that we've gone through, and most of our discussions are focused on the service center industry. But bear in mind that, of course, all of our products, we saw this issue of overstocking at the end of 2018 also in the downstream businesses, the downstream customers. 
We talked about it on some of the flat products and on the plate products. Some of our large equipment manufacturing customers, I don't want to name any of them specifically, but we know for a fact that their inventories are up, their inventories are up at their plant sites and the dealers and even in some auxiliary stores location. So it's primarily -- we still feel very strongly. it's primarily an issue of stocking and destocking. We think that if you look at pure domain, we think demand is somewhat in the neighborhood of down by about 3% or 4%. Certainly, the volumes do not reflect that. They're more significant than that.

If you want to be successful, you need to have the right people and the right positions on your team. I have been fortunate to always have the right people around me at Nucor, including the team on this call today. 
A strong leadership team we have built over the last decade will ensure that we have a deep bench of talent to draw upon for years to come. They have worked with me to achieve a number of accomplishments, which I am very proud of. A strong record of safety, the rollout of digital tools to better connect with and serve our customers, the execution on our 5 drivers of profitable growth, including our greater penetration of the automotive market, our significantly expanded channels to market and our new rebar micro mills, as well as Nucor's evolution into a company that is more intensely focused on commercial excellence and building powerful strategic partnerships with our customers. 
I want to thank all of our Nucor teammates for the hard work that they have done during my tenure to achieve these successes, and for the hard work that I know they will continue to do each and every day into the future to build a safer and more profitable Nucor. 
2020 is going to be another exciting year for our company. When we asked Leon to join the executive team, I knew Nucor was bringing a strong leader to Charlotte. I have known Leon for years and I have been proud to call him a teammate. I've watched how he has met the challenges head-on, preparing him for the role into which he now steps. And let me tell you something, I know that Leon and the great team around him will ensure that Nucor continues to be an industry leader well into the future. I'm excited to see where Leon and the team takes our company next.
At Nucor, we believe that we are never as good today as we're going to be tomorrow. There is always an opportunity to be better. I leave you all in the very capable hands, more confident than ever that Nucor's best years are still ahead of us. 
Thank you again for what you do for Nucor everyday. And to my teammates, thank you again particularly for doing it safely. Please never forget, there is nothing more important than safety. Absolutely nothing. Thank you for your interest in our company. Have a great day."

Other members of Nucor's executive team are also on the call today, including Leon Topalian, our President and Chief Operating Officer; Jim Frias, our Chief Financial Officer; Craig Feldman, responsible for Raw Materials; Ladd Hall, responsible for sheet products; Ray Napolitan, responsible for Engineered Bar Products; MaryEmily Slate, responsible for plate, structural and tubular products; Dave Sumoski, responsible for Merchant Bar and Rebar Products; and Chad Utermark, responsible for Fabricated Construction Products.
Last month, I announced my retirement from Nucor, effective at the end of this year. One of my priorities during my time as CEO has been to make certain that we had a deep bench of leadership talent and a robust management succession plan in place. I know we have succeeded on both fronts. Identifying the right leaders is a key component of our company's future success. 
I am delighted that the Nucor Board of Directors has selected Leon Topalian to succeed me as Nucor's next CEO. Leon has proven himself to be an exceptional leader throughout his 23-year career at Nucor.
Since 2017, he has served as Executive Vice President responsible for Nucor's plate and structural steel mills. Prior to joining our corporate senior leadership, Leon was General Manager at 2 facilities: at our Nucor Yamato structural steel mill and our Kankakee Illinois bar mill. With the support of our leadership team and all of our teammates, I am confident that Leon will guide Nucor towards continued success. 
I'm also confident that we have an executive leadership team that is second to none in our industry, and I know Leon and the Board feel the same way.
Before I provide comments on our third quarter results, I want to say a few words about safety. One of my proudest accomplishments during my time as CEO is the way that our entire organization has improved our safety performance. I want to thank all of my teammates who for your constant focus on working safely. We are having one of our best years ever for safety performance. Let's keep that focus as we move closer to our goal, which will always be: Zero incidents at every Nucor facility. Any injury is one too many. 
Now on to our third quarter results. We saw continued strong performance from our metal buildings, piling, joist and deck divisions as well as improved performance in our rebar fabrication divisions. The performance reflects excellent execution by our teammates and continued stable conditions in the nonresidential construction market. 
Overall spending in a nonresidential construction market, which typically accounts for approximately 1/2 of our company's shipments remains at healthy levels. 
After a brief summer rally, plate and sheet market conditions softened in the third quarter. Excess inventory throughout the supply chain has resulted in continued destocking by our customers. Service center industry data indicates that inventories remain low. 
In addition, our OEM customers have become cautious about buying as we head into the year-end. However, we do believe that both our service center and OEM customers will start restocking to meet demand as 2020 gets underway. 
Looking out further into next year, the pending 2020 elections and current trade issues, such as the unresolved status of the USMCA agreement for North America, are creating some more uncertainty in the market. And while it's difficult to predict steel markets that far into the future, we continue to have great confidence in Nucor's business fundamentals and our long-term strategy. 
Finally, let me remind you all that we have several more of our growth projects starting up in the fourth quarter that will give us the capability to produce more of the products that our customers are asking us to make. We have said many times, these investments position us for continued success by taking advantage of specific market opportunities. We expect they will further enhance Nucor's position as a steel market leader. 
I'm now going to turn the call over to Leon to provide comments and an update on several of our growth initiatives. Leon?"

I'd like to begin by saying how honored I am to have the opportunity to lead this amazing company. I look forward to continuing the proud traditions that have made Nucor the premier steel and steel products company for the last 50 years. A hallmark of our success has and will continue to be our culture, which begins with the nearly 27,000 team members who make up the Nucor family. 
Our culture drew me to this company 23 years ago and it inspires me daily. And the most important value in our culture is safety, taking care of our team is the most important responsibility we have. I take it very personally and will work tirelessly to continue Nucor's quest of becoming the safest steel company in the world.
Since the announcement, I've been visiting many of our divisions and have been humbled by the warm reception I've received. In talking with our team, it's obvious, they are deeply engaged in our mission and just as excited about Nucor's future as I am. That excitement is especially evident among our team members who are bringing new growth projects online. Let me just say thank you for your hard work, dedication, commitment and never losing sight of our most important value, safety.
I'd like now to provide you with an update on some of the projects we're bringing online. At Nucor Steel Arkansas, our Hickman team continues to increase production and improve yield performance on our new specialty cold mill. The mill's flexibility is a key feature. With its dual configuration, Hickman's new cold mill can change from a high reduction mill for the advanced strength steels of the future to a very efficient 4 high mill in just 6 minutes. This flexibility separates us from our competition and allows us to efficiently offer a broader range of value-added products. There is no other carbon mill like this in North America.  
Nucor Steel Gallatin's new galvanizing line team coated their first coils on September 27. With 500,000 tons of annual capacity, Gallatin's 72-inch galvanizing line is the widest hot-rolled galvanizing facility in North America.
Gallatin is extremely well positioned to grow Nucor's share of the underserved Midwest heavy gauge galvanizing hot-band market.  
At our Marion, Ohio rebar mill, commissioning of the new in-line rolling mill was completed in August and the Marion team is currently ramping up production. Early next year, Marion will also install quench and temper equipment to reduce alloy costs. 
These investments, combined with a more energy-efficient reheat furnace installed last year, will position Marion as the low cost producer in the region. Other projects on track for start-up by the end of the year include: Nucor Steel Kankakee's MBQ rolling mill; our new rebar micro mill in Sedalia, Missouri; and the galvanizing line we're building in Mexico with JFE steel. 
As we have said before, we are not adding capacity simply to get bigger. These projects target defined market opportunities where we are confident that we will compete and win highly profitable market share. 
We are also responding to feedback from our customers regarding their product needs, particularly for value-added products. Nucor is doing more than adding capacity. Nucor is increasing our capabilities to provide our customers with superior value. We achieved that with unique product properties, unmatched product breadth, industry-leading on-time delivery and unrivaled quality. Every growth project we are implementing builds on our competitive strengths to serve new product and geographic markets. With these investments, we are increasing Nucor's long-term earnings power. This is the same strategy Nucor has successfully executed through numerous market cycles over the past 5 decades. 
At this time, I will turn the call over to Jim Frias for a review of our financial results. Jim?"
184945,638948069,1837089,"Nucor Corporation, Q3 2019 Earnings Call, Oct 22, 2019",2019-10-22,"Earnings Calls","Nucor Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Leon. Nucor reported third quarter of 2019 earnings of $0.90 per diluted share. These results exceeded our guidance range of $0.75 to $0.80 due to better-than-expected performance at our sheet and bar steel mills as well as from several steel prod",713,"Thanks, Leon. Nucor reported third quarter of 2019 earnings of $0.90 per diluted share. These results exceeded our guidance range of $0.75 to $0.80 due to better-than-expected performance at our sheet and bar steel mills as well as from several steel products businesses, most notably joist, deck and building systems.
It's worth noting that both our joist and deck business and our metal buildings business are on pace for a record year in 2019. Both of these business groups are benefiting from lower steel prices and excellent commercial execution. The metal buildings business is also benefiting from a restructuring that has realigned capacity and reduced fixed costs. 
Earnings from our steel mill segment were lower than the second quarter due to declining metal margins. Sheet and plate products experienced the greatest pricing pressure as customer destocking continued in the third quarter. Total steel mill shipments in third quarter were comparable to the second quarter. 
Steel mill shipments to internal customers represented 21% of total steel mill shipments in the third quarter, an increase from 19% in the second quarter. Nucor's downstream channels to market strategy remains a key competitive strength of our company.
Earnings from our steel products segment improved compared to the second quarter of this year and to the year ago third quarter. Nonresidential construction market conditions remained positive. Our businesses appear to have benefited from both recovery from weather-related disruptions earlier in the year and seasonally stronger construction months. 
Results from our raw materials segment decreased compared to the second quarter due to further margin compression at our direct reduced iron [ or ] DRI operations. In addition, our Louisiana DRI facility began its planned outage in early September and that is expected to continue until mid-November. 
Our third quarter results included roughly $28 million of pre-operating and start-up costs related to strategic investment projects compared with approximately $21 million in the second quarter of 2019 and approximately $11 million in the year ago quarter.
First 9 months of 2019 cash provided from operations was approximately $2.1 billion, up from about $1.9 billion for the year ago period. Nucor continues to benefit from its highly variable cost structure. Accounts receivable, payables and inventory were a source of approximately $500 million during the first 9 months of 2019, reflecting consistent working capital management in a declining steel pricing environment. 
Capital expenditures totaled $985 million through the first 9 months of 2019. Our full year 2019 capital spending budget is now approximately $1.5 billion, a decrease from our prior forecast of $1.8 billion. This change reflects the timing of expected outlays over the balance of this year. 
Cash returned to shareholders during the first 9 months of 2019 totaled $567 million. We paid dividends of $369 million and stock repurchases totaled $198 million.
Thus far in 2019, we have returned 49% of our net income to our shareholders while also investing for long-term profitable growth. Nucor's financial condition remains strong. We ended the quarter with $1.9 billion in cash and short-term investments. With total debt outstanding of approximately $4.3 billion, our gross debt-to-capital ratio was 28% at the end of the third quarter. Our $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility remains undrawn and does not mature until April of 2023. Our next material debt maturity is in 2022 for approximately $600 million. 
Now turning to the outlook. Nucor's earnings in the fourth quarter of 2019 are expected to be lower than the third quarter. While nonresidential construction markets remain broadly stable and healthy, manufacturing sector activity has slowed down. 
We expect earnings in the steel mills segment to further decrease from the third quarter due to the impact of lower steel prices at the end of the third quarter, which will be realized in fourth quarter shipments. We believe steel prices have bottomed. 
The profitability of the steel products segment is expected to decrease slightly due to normal year-end seasonality. The performance of our raw material segment is expected to decline in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter due to the impact of our Louisiana DRI plant's outage continuing until mid-November as well as further margin pressure throughout our raw materials businesses. 
Thank you for your interest in our company. I will now turn the call back over to John."

I recently had the privilege of joining the Nucor Steel Indiana team to celebrate 30 years of making steel in Crawfordsville. 
Three decades ago, our team revolutionized the American steel industry, becoming the first thin slab operation to produce sheet steel using an electric arc furnace. 600 people joined us for the celebration, including local officials, teammates, customers, suppliers and friends and family. 
Congratulations again to the Crawfordsville team for all they have accomplished over the past 30 years. With regard to trade policy, imports continued to supply a shrinking share of the U.S. demand, thanks to the cost competitiveness of our market-oriented domestic steel industry and effective trade enforcement. 
At Nucor, we will not take this progress for granted and we will continue to press for sensible legislation, regulation and enforcement. We also remain hopeful that Congress will approve the USMCA this year. We see it as a meaningful modernization of NAFTA that will benefit the U.S. economy and the domestic manufacturing sector in particular.

The things that drive that are a couple of things: Number one, you're right, we see the scrap market starting to improve. We anticipate that scrap pricing will go up about $20. Maybe next month, $20, $25, somewhere in that neighborhood. We think that, that trend will continue throughout the year. Our best guess on scrap pricing right now for the year is up $20 to $40 by the end of the year. 
The other thing that I would say that's driving our belief is that when we start to look at our bookings, particularly in our sheet area, over the last several weeks, bookings have improved. We see more energy, and particularly in the hot band. Now you know cold-rolled and galvanized has always been fairly strong. We haven't seen much of a decline in those 2 products. But hot band, as you know, was really challenged for the first part of this year. We talked about this in the past. Overstocking of inventories last year. The tough weather conditions at the beginning of this year. Destocking this year. These are all things that have contributed to a challenging steel market during this year. We see that ending. When we look at MSCI inventories, we see them at -- I mean, they're at incredibly low levels and lowest that we've seen in many, many years. And compared to last year, they're down at this time -- same time last year, they're down fairly significantly. So these are all things that we see driving our comments that we think that the pricing as well as the volumes will increase as we go forward.

We saw service centers stocking up pretty heavily. And then, of course, beginning of this year, as I mentioned earlier, weather conditions prohibited a lot of the construction from consuming some of that overstocking and we've been going through a destocking period now. I would comment that we think that we're seeing the bottom of that stocking -- destocking now, it's coming to an end, and we expect that to pick up a little bit.

We've got a very intentional process for how we think about returning capital to investors as well as investing in our business, [ also ] our capital allocation. Mindset begins with the idea that we want to invest in strategic long-term growth, and of course, we do have a number of projects in our pipeline. And as you kind of noted, we're a little behind in terms of the spending on some of those capital projects. So that's resulted in us temporarily having more cash in the balance sheet. That's going to catch up pretty quickly over the next 6 to 9 months and we're going to need some of that cash to fund a lot of the capital project that are in process. 
Except from that, as we think about returning capital to investors, we begin with this idea that we want to return a minimum of 40% of our earnings. And then we also want to maintain a debt-to-capital ratio that supports our strong investment-grade credit rating. And at times when that debt-to-capital ratio becomes too low, we will return more like we did late last year when we have a view that we have depth of liquidity. 
And so it's possible we'll do more before the end of the year, but it depends on our forecast of cash going into 2020. Because working capital has benefited us to the tune of roughly $0.5 billion this year. If steel prices reverse and scrap prices reverse, we're going to need -- we're going to have some use of cash in working capital next year. We definitely will see an acceleration in capital spending. So we're being thoughtful about not just where we stand with cash today but where we expect cash to be through next year."

I'm going to answer 2 questions, one you're not asking but is sort of related. SG -- marketing and admin is also dramatically lower. So the piece that's reflected in both places is incentive compensation. Incentive compensation in the quarter is about $88 million less this year than last year. Year-to-date, it's about $104 million less, and that's affecting both the UM's line and the marketing, admin and other line. 
So -- and that's just because we're making less money, and profit sharing is the biggest piece of that. Profit sharing is what we set aside for employees below the level of Vice President. And then additionally, we have the profit elimination this year. In the third quarter, it was a benefit of about $34 million. Last year, it was an expense of about $67 million. So as margins on steel fall, we revalue that inventory. We can sometimes get a benefit from company eliminations. So we got a benefit in the third quarter this year. Year-to-date, the benefit is about $91 million. And last year, the expense was about $228 million. So that's been a pretty severe swing as well. Those are the 2 biggest factors affecting the change in elims. And the incentive comp is the biggest factor affecting SG&A."

Your question about automotive. Now certainly, the automotive market has edged down, they're forecasting somewhere around 16.8, 16.9. I heard a number just the other day of almost 17. So it's down a little bit from last year for certain, but still, 16.8, 16.9, those are pretty good numbers. And the important -- I think the important thing to note for us is that we continue to take a bigger share of that smaller pie. If you look at the tonnage that we sent into the automotive business this year compared to last year, we're up about 15% tons sent into automotive this year as compared to last year. So we continue to grow our market share. And although the pie is shrinking, we continue to get a bigger piece of that smaller pie. We feel real good about where we are in automotive.

So clearly, the demand in our long products is better. There was less of a destocking issue with our long products, particularly when you talk about rebar. We have less of an issue in rebar than we did in our sheet products or on our plate products. A little bit more in merchant but not significantly more. So demand was strong. Inventories hadn't bloated to the level that date in our flat products last year. A lot of our long products obviously go into construction. And construction has been relatively strong, a lot of our long products, merchant and rebar go into our downstream businesses. 
Jim mentioned in his comment, internally, we're shipping about 20% of our steel products downstream. A lot of that is long products going into our building systems, in particular our Vulcraft and our Harris operations. And they have been strong. So all of those kind of lead into that. 
Now having said all of that, when talking about long products and talking about structural, certainly, an infrastructure build will continue to help with us with that. We continue to encourage the administration to get going on something that's badly needed in this country, a robust infrastructure bill.
So that's a little bit about the long products. Now in terms of the -- your comment or your question about our micro mills regionally and the demand or the supply/demand ratio in the areas where we're building them, we still feel very good about that. We've talked about in the past about the regional nature of these micro mills. We're not going to comment on any of our competitors shutting down or anything like that. We believe that the 2 things that are going to really give us an advantage with the micro mills are we're in right in the heart of the marketplace. We've got great scrap availability for those mills. The design of the mills provide for an extremely low cost structure, highly efficient, close to the supply of the raw material and close to the marketplace.

I also want to offer my appreciation to our investors for entrusting Nucor with your valuable capital, and to our customers for entrusting us with your business. We truly appreciate the business you give to us. It's been a pleasure to work together with my teammates to serve all of you during my 3 decades with Nucor. And speaking of my teammates, I always give -- I often give the following advice: Successful people surround themselves with great teams. If you want to be successful, you need to have the right people in the right positions on your team. I have been fortunate to always have the right people around me at Nucor, including the team on this call today. 
A strong leadership team we have built over the last decade will ensure that we have a deep bench of talent to draw upon for years to come. They have worked with me to achieve a number of accomplishments, which I am very proud of. A strong record of safety, the rollout of digital tools to better connect with and serve our customers, the execution on our 5 drivers of profitable growth, including our greater penetration of the automotive market, our significantly expanded channels to market and our new rebar micro mills, as well as Nucor's evolution into a company that is more intensely focused on commercial excellence and building powerful strategic partnerships with our customers. 
I want to thank all of our Nucor teammates for the hard work that they have done during my tenure to achieve these successes, and for the hard work that I know they will continue to do each and every day into the future to build a safer and more profitable Nucor. 
2020 is going to be another exciting year for our company. When we asked Leon to join the executive team, I knew Nucor was bringing a strong leader to Charlotte. I have known Leon for years and I have been proud to call him a teammate. I've watched how he has met the challenges head-on, preparing him for the role into which he now steps. And let me tell you something, I know that Leon and the great team around him will ensure that Nucor continues to be an industry leader well into the future. I'm excited to see where Leon and the team takes our company next.
At Nucor, we believe that we are never as good today as we're going to be tomorrow. There is always an opportunity to be better. I leave you all in the very capable hands, more confident than ever that Nucor's best years are still ahead of us. 
Thank you again for what you do for Nucor every day. And to my teammates, thank you again particularly for doing it safely. Please never forget, there is nothing more important than safety. Absolutely nothing. Thank you for your interest in our company. Have a great day."

Thank you for joining us for our third quarter earnings call and for your interest in Nucor. Other members of Nucor's executive team are also on the call today, including Leon Topalian, our President and Chief Operating Officer; Jim Frias,",686,"Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us for our third quarter earnings call and for your interest in Nucor. Other members of Nucor's executive team are also on the call today, including Leon Topalian, our President and Chief Operating Officer; Jim Frias, our Chief Financial Officer; Craig Feldman, responsible for Raw Materials; Ladd Hall, responsible for sheet products; Ray Napolitan, responsible for Engineered Bar Products; MaryEmily Slate, responsible for plate, structural and tubular products; Dave Sumoski, responsible for Merchant Bar and Rebar Products; and Chad Utermark, responsible for Fabricated Construction Products.
Last month, I announced my retirement from Nucor, effective at the end of this year. One of my priorities during my time as CEO has been to make certain that we had a deep bench of leadership talent and a robust management succession plan in place. I know we have succeeded on both fronts. Identifying the right leaders is a key component of our company's future success. I am delighted that the Nucor Board of Directors has selected Leon Topalian to succeed me as Nucor's next CEO. Leon has proven himself to be an exceptional leader throughout his 23-year career at Nucor.
Since 2017, he has served as Executive Vice President responsible for Nucor's plate and structural steel mills. Prior to joining our corporate senior leadership, Leon was General Manager at 2 facilities: at our Nucor Yamato structural steel mill and our Kankakee Illinois bar mill. With the support of our leadership team and all of our teammates, I am confident that Leon will guide Nucor towards continued success. I'm also confident that we have an executive leadership team that is second to none in our industry, and I know Leon and the Board feel the same way.
Before I provide comments on our third quarter results, I want to say a few words about safety. One of my proudest accomplishments during my time as CEO is the way that our entire organization has improved our safety performance. I want to thank all of my teammates who for your constant focus on working safely. We are having one of our best years ever for safety performance. Let's keep that focus as we move closer to our goal, which will always be: Zero incidents at every Nucor facility. Any injury is one too many. 
Now on to our third quarter results. We saw continued strong performance from our metal buildings, piling, joist and deck divisions as well as improved performance in our rebar fabrication divisions. The performance reflects excellent execution by our teammates and continued stable conditions in the nonresidential construction market. Overall spending in a nonresidential construction market, which typically accounts for approximately 1/2 of our company's shipments remains at healthy levels. 
After a brief summer rally, plate and sheet market conditions softened in the third quarter. Excess inventory throughout the supply chain has resulted in continued destocking by our customers. Service center industry data indicates that inventories remain low. In addition, our OEM customers have become cautious about buying as we head into the year-end. However, we do believe that both our service center and OEM customers will start restocking to meet demand as 2020 gets underway. 
Looking out further into next year, the pending 2020 elections and current trade issues, such as the unresolved status of the USMCA agreement for North America, are creating some more uncertainty in the market. And while it's difficult to predict steel markets that far into the future, we continue to have great confidence in Nucor's business fundamentals and our long-term strategy. 
Finally, let me remind you all that we have several more of our growth projects starting up in the fourth quarter that will give us the capability to produce more of the products that our customers are asking us to make. We have said many times, these investments position us for continued success by taking advantage of specific market opportunities. We expect they will further enhance Nucor's position as a steel market leader. 
I'm now going to turn the call over to Leon to provide comments and an update on several of our growth initiatives. Leon?"

I'd like to begin by saying how honored I am to have the opportunity to lead this amazing company. I look forward to continuing the proud traditions that have made Nucor the premier steel and steel products company for the last 50 years. A hallmark of our success has and will continue to be our culture, which begins with the nearly 27,000 team members who make up the Nucor family. 
Our culture drew me to this company 23 years ago and it inspires me daily. And the most important value in our culture is safety, taking care of our team is the most important responsibility we have. I take it very personally and will work tirelessly to continue Nucor's quest of becoming the safest steel company in the world.
Since the announcement, I've been visiting many of our divisions and have been humbled by the warm reception I've received. In talking with our team, it's obvious, they are deeply engaged in our mission and just as excited about Nucor's future as I am. That excitement is especially evident among our team members who are bringing new growth projects online. Let me just say thank you for your hard work, dedication, commitment and never losing sight of our most important value, safety.
I'd like now to provide you with an update on some of the projects we're bringing online. At Nucor Steel Arkansas, our Hickman team continues to increase production and improve yield performance on our new specialty cold mill. The mill's flexibility is a key feature. With its dual configuration, Hickman's new cold mill can change from a high reduction mill for the advanced strength steels of the future to a very efficient 4 high mill in just 6 minutes. This flexibility separates us from our competition and allows us to efficiently offer a broader range of value-added products. There is no other carbon mill like this in North America. 
Nucor Steel Gallatin's new galvanizing line team coated their first coils on September 27. With 500,000 tons of annual capacity, Gallatin's 72-inch galvanizing line is the widest hot-rolled galvanizing facility in North America. Gallatin is extremely well positioned to grow Nucor's share of the underserved Midwest heavy gauge galvanizing hot-band market. At our Marion, Ohio rebar mill, commissioning of the new in-line rolling mill was completed in August and the Marion team is currently ramping up production. Early next year, Marion will also install quench and temper equipment to reduce alloy costs. 
These investments, combined with a more energy-efficient reheat furnace installed last year, will position Marion as the low cost producer in the region. Other projects on track for start-up by the end of the year include: Nucor Steel Kankakee's MBQ rolling mill; our new rebar micro mill in Sedalia, Missouri; and the galvanizing line we're building in Mexico with JFE steel. As we have said before, we are not adding capacity simply to get bigger. These projects target defined market opportunities where we are confident that we will compete and win highly profitable market share. 
We are also responding to feedback from our customers regarding their product needs, particularly for value-added products. Nucor is doing more than adding capacity. Nucor is increasing our capabilities to provide our customers with superior value. We achieved that with unique product properties, unmatched product breadth, industry-leading on-time delivery and unrivaled quality. Every growth project we are implementing builds on our competitive strengths to serve new product and geographic markets. With these investments, we are increasing Nucor's long-term earnings power. This is the same strategy Nucor has successfully executed through numerous market cycles over the past 5 decades. 
At this time, I will turn the call over to Jim Frias for a review of our financial results. Jim?"
184945,638948069,1837581,"Nucor Corporation, Q3 2019 Earnings Call, Oct 22, 2019",2019-10-22,"Earnings Calls","Nucor Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Leon. Nucor reported third quarter of 2019 earnings of $0.90 per diluted share. These results exceeded our guidance range of $0.75 to $0.80 due to better-than-expected performance at our sheet and bar steel mills as well as from several steel prod",713,"Thanks, Leon. Nucor reported third quarter of 2019 earnings of $0.90 per diluted share. These results exceeded our guidance range of $0.75 to $0.80 due to better-than-expected performance at our sheet and bar steel mills as well as from several steel products businesses, most notably joist, deck and building systems.
It's worth noting that both our joist and deck business and our metal buildings business are on pace for a record year in 2019. Both of these business groups are benefiting from lower steel prices and excellent commercial execution. The metal buildings business is also benefiting from a restructuring that has realigned capacity and reduced fixed costs. 
Earnings from our steel mill segment were lower than the second quarter due to declining metal margins. Sheet and plate products experienced the greatest pricing pressure as customer destocking continued in the third quarter. Total steel mill shipments in third quarter were comparable to the second quarter. 
Steel mill shipments to internal customers represented 21% of total steel mill shipments in the third quarter, an increase from 19% in the second quarter. Nucor's downstream channels to market strategy remains a key competitive strength of our company.
Earnings from our steel products segment improved compared to the second quarter of this year and to the year ago third quarter. Nonresidential construction market conditions remained positive. Our businesses appear to have benefited from both recovery from weather-related disruptions earlier in the year and seasonally stronger construction months. 
Results from our raw materials segment decreased compared to the second quarter due to further margin compression at our direct reduced iron [ or ] DRI operations. In addition, our Louisiana DRI facility began its planned outage in early September and that is expected to continue until mid-November. 
Our third quarter results included roughly $28 million of pre-operating and start-up costs related to strategic investment projects compared with approximately $21 million in the second quarter of 2019 and approximately $11 million in the year ago quarter.
First 9 months of 2019 cash provided from operations was approximately $2.1 billion, up from about $1.9 billion for the year ago period. Nucor continues to benefit from its highly variable cost structure. Accounts receivable, payables and inventory were a source of approximately $500 million during the first 9 months of 2019, reflecting consistent working capital management in a declining steel pricing environment. 
Capital expenditures totaled $985 million through the first 9 months of 2019. Our full year 2019 capital spending budget is now approximately $1.5 billion, a decrease from our prior forecast of $1.8 billion. This change reflects the timing of expected outlays over the balance of this year. Cash returned to shareholders during the first 9 months of 2019 totaled $567 million. We paid dividends of $369 million and stock repurchases totaled $198 million.
Thus far in 2019, we have returned 49% of our net income to our shareholders while also investing for long-term profitable growth. Nucor's financial condition remains strong. We ended the quarter with $1.9 billion in cash and short-term investments. With total debt outstanding of approximately $4.3 billion, our gross debt-to-capital ratio was 28% at the end of the third quarter. Our $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility remains undrawn and does not mature until April of 2023. Our next material debt maturity is in 2022 for approximately $600 million. 
Now turning to the outlook. Nucor's earnings in the fourth quarter of 2019 are expected to be lower than the third quarter. While nonresidential construction markets remain broadly stable and healthy, manufacturing sector activity has slowed down. We expect earnings in the steel mills segment to further decrease from the third quarter due to the impact of lower steel prices at the end of the third quarter, which will be realized in fourth quarter shipments. We believe steel prices have bottomed. 
The profitability of the steel products segment is expected to decrease slightly due to normal year-end seasonality. The performance of our raw material segment is expected to decline in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter due to the impact of our Louisiana DRI plant's outage continuing until mid-November as well as further margin pressure throughout our raw materials businesses. Thank you for your interest in our company. 
I will now turn the call back over to John."

Congratulations again to the Crawfordsville team for all they have accomplished over the past 30 years. With regard to trade policy, imports continued to supply a shrinking share of the U.S. demand, thanks to the cost competitiveness of our market-oriented domestic steel industry and effective trade enforcement. 
At Nucor, we will not take this progress for granted and we will continue to press for sensible legislation, regulation and enforcement.

The things that drive that are a couple of things: Number one, you're right, we see the scrap market starting to improve. We anticipate that scrap pricing will go up about $20. Maybe next month, $20, $25, somewhere in that neighborhood. We think that, that trend will continue throughout the year. Our best guess on scrap pricing right now for the year is up $20 to $40 by the end of the year. 
The other thing that I would say that's driving our belief is that when we start to look at our bookings, particularly in our sheet area, over the last several weeks, bookings have improved. We see more energy, and particularly in the hot band. Now you know cold-rolled and galvanized has always been fairly strong. We haven't seen much of a decline in those 2 products. But hot band, as you know, was really challenged for the first part of this year. We talked about this in the past. Overstocking of inventories last year. The tough weather conditions at the beginning of this year. Destocking this year. These are all things that have contributed to a challenging steel market during this year. We see that ending. When we look at MSCI inventories, we see them at -- I mean, they're at incredibly low levels and lowest that we've seen in many, many years. And compared to last year, they're down at this time -- same time last year, they're down fairly significantly. So these are all things that we see driving our comments that we think that the pricing as well as the volumes will increase as we go forward. One more point that I would make is -- well, first, Leon, you wanted to say something?"

Structural business has been challenged this year. No doubt about it. A lot of it was a result of heavy stocking last year particularly in the last half of last year. We saw service centers stocking up pretty heavily. And then, of course, beginning of this year, as I mentioned earlier, weather conditions prohibited a lot of the construction from consuming some of that overstocking and we've been going through a destocking period now. I would comment that we think that we're seeing the bottom of that stocking -- destocking now, it's coming to an end, and we expect that to pick up a little bit. 
We also expect to see some benefit from the recent determinations by commerce on fabricated structural steel. We had some very positive preliminary determinations.

We've got a very intentional process for how we think about returning capital to investors as well as investing in our business, [ also ] our capital allocation. Mindset begins with the idea that we want to invest in strategic long-term growth, and of course, we do have a number of projects in our pipeline. And as you kind of noted, we're a little behind in terms of the spending on some of those capital projects. So that's resulted in us temporarily having more cash in the balance sheet. That's going to catch up pretty quickly over the next 6 to 9 months and we're going to need some of that cash to fund a lot of the capital project that are in process. 
Except from that, as we think about returning capital to investors, we begin with this idea that we want to return a minimum of 40% of our earnings. And then we also want to maintain a debt-to-capital ratio that supports our strong investment-grade credit rating. And at times when that debt-to-capital ratio becomes too low, we will return more like we did late last year when we have a view that we have depth of liquidity. 
And so it's possible we'll do more before the end of the year, but it depends on our forecast of cash going into 2020. Because working capital has benefited us to the tune of roughly $0.5 billion this year. If steel prices reverse and scrap prices reverse, we're going to need -- we're going to have some use of cash in working capital next year. We definitely will see an acceleration in capital spending. So we're being thoughtful about not just where we stand with cash today but where we expect cash to be through next year."

I'm going to answer 2 questions, one you're not asking but is sort of related. SG -- marketing and admin is also dramatically lower. So the piece that's reflected in both places is incentive compensation. Incentive compensation in the quarter is about $88 million less this year than last year. Year-to-date, it's about $104 million less, and that's affecting both the UM's line and the marketing, admin and other line. 
So -- and that's just because we're making less money, and profit sharing is the biggest piece of that. Profit sharing is what we set aside for employees below the level of Vice President. And then additionally, we have the profit elimination this year. In the third quarter, it was a benefit of about $34 million. Last year, it was an expense of about $67 million. So as margins on steel fall, we revalue that inventory. We can sometimes get a benefit from company eliminations. So we got a benefit in the third quarter this year. Year-to-date, the benefit is about $91 million. And last year, the expense was about $228 million. So that's been a pretty severe swing as well. Those are the 2 biggest factors affecting the change in elims. And the incentive comp is the biggest factor affecting SG&A."

Your question about automotive. Now certainly, the automotive market has edged down, they're forecasting somewhere around 16.8, 16.9. I heard a number just the other day of almost 17. So it's down a little bit from last year for certain, but still, 16.8, 16.9, those are pretty good numbers. And the important -- I think the important thing to note for us is that we continue to take a bigger share of that smaller pie. If you look at the tonnage that we sent into the automotive business this year compared to last year, we're up about 15% tons sent into automotive this year as compared to last year. So we continue to grow our market share. And although the pie is shrinking, we continue to get a bigger piece of that smaller pie. We feel real good about where we are in automotive.

So clearly, the demand in our long products is better. There was less of a destocking issue with our long products, particularly when you talk about rebar. We have less of an issue in rebar than we did in our sheet products or on our plate products. A little bit more in merchant but not significantly more. So demand was strong. Inventories hadn't bloated to the level that date in our flat products last year. A lot of our long products obviously go into construction. And construction has been relatively strong, a lot of our long products, merchant and rebar go into our downstream businesses. 
Jim mentioned in his comment, internally, we're shipping about 20% of our steel products downstream. A lot of that is long products going into our building systems, in particular our Vulcraft and our Harris operations. And they have been strong. So all of those kind of lead into that. 
Now having said all of that, when talking about long products and talking about structural, certainly, an infrastructure build will continue to help with us with that. We continue to encourage the administration to get going on something that's badly needed in this country, a robust infrastructure bill.
So that's a little bit about the long products. Now in terms of the -- your comment or your question about our micro mills regionally and the demand or the supply/demand ratio in the areas where we're building them, we still feel very good about that. We've talked about in the past about the regional nature of these micro mills. We're not going to comment on any of our competitors shutting down or anything like that. We believe that the 2 things that are going to really give us an advantage with the micro mills are we're in right in the heart of the marketplace. We've got great scrap availability for those mills.

In fact, if anything, we will -- it's just the opposite of what you say. We tend to invest more and grow our focus on growing our company during the downturns. That's always been our philosophy. We invest during the downturns to come back into the upturn stronger. We always talk about having higher highs and higher lows. So I want to be really clear about this. It had nothing to do with the change in the market dynamics at this time. We don't react. Our strategic plan is built for the long term. We don't react. Short-term changes in the market do not impact our strategic initiatives."

We've talked a lot about the stocking and destocking that we've gone through, and most of our discussions are focused on the service center industry. But bear in mind that, of course, all of our products, we saw this issue of overstocking at the end of 2018 also in the downstream businesses, the downstream customers. 
You talk about it on some of the flat products and on the plate products. Some of our large equipment manufacturing customers, I don't want to name any of them specifically, but we know for a fact that their inventories are up, their inventories are up at their plant sites and the dealers and even in some auxiliary stores location. So it's primarily -- we still feel very strongly. It's primarily an issue of stocking and destocking. We think that if you look at pure demand, we think demand is somewhat in the neighborhood of down by about 3% or 4%. Certainly, the volumes do not reflect that. They're more significant than that. So we still believe strongly that it was looking at an issue of stocking and destocking and we'll continue to work our way through. We will come through this and we'll get back to more normalized inventory levels and more normalized booking and shipping levels."

Just as a reminder, there was 2 major things that we're attacking, 3 all together with 2 major ones. One is in the handling yard, how we manage the feeding of the raw material storage and feeding into the furnace. And that's gone particularly well. We think that's going to have a major impact on the productivity of that operation and we also think we placed the lining in the vessel. 
And as you might recall, we had numerous major problems with the process gas heater. And of course, we are basically replacing the entire process gas heater with a design that we have a great deal of confidence in. All of these changes were done to increase the productivity, reduce our cost in that operation. It's called project 8,000 for a reason. The reason being that we wanted to be able to get up to 8,000 hours of operation. We believe that we'll be able to accomplish that next year.

If you want to be successful, you need to have the right people in the right positions on your team. I have been fortunate to always have the right people around me at Nucor, including the team on this call today. 
A strong leadership team we have built over the last decade will ensure that we have a deep bench of talent to draw upon for years to come. They have worked with me to achieve a number of accomplishments, which I am very proud of. A strong record of safety, the rollout of digital tools to better connect with and serve our customers, the execution on our 5 drivers of profitable growth, including our greater penetration of the automotive market, our significantly expanded channels to market and our new rebar micro mills as well as Nucor's evolution into a company that is more intensely focused on commercial excellence and building powerful strategic partnerships with our customers. 
I want to thank all of our Nucor teammates for the hard work that they have done during my tenure to achieve these successes, and for the hard work that I know they will continue to do each and every day into the future to build a safer and more profitable Nucor. 
2020 is going to be another exciting year for our company. When we asked Leon to join the executive team, I knew Nucor was bringing a strong leader to Charlotte. I have known Leon for years and I have been proud to call him a teammate. I've watched how he has met the challenges head-on, preparing him for the role into which he now steps. And let me tell you something, I know that Leon and the great team around him will ensure that Nucor continues to be an industry leader well into the future. I'm excited to see where Leon and the team takes our company next.
At Nucor, we believe that we are never as good today as we're going to be tomorrow. There is always an opportunity to be better. I leave you all in the very capable hands, more confident than ever that Nucor's best years are still ahead of us. 
Thank you again for what you do for Nucor every day. And to my teammates, thank you again particularly for doing it safely. Please never forget, there is nothing more important than safety. Absolutely nothing. Thank you for your interest in our company. Have a great day."
