For the fourth quarter, sales were $3.1 billion, up 15% year-over-year. Net income was $539 million, up 18% year-over-year. And EPS was $0.59",2117,"Thank you, Ann, and good morning, everyone.
This morning, we reported a very strong finish to an excellent 2018. For the fourth quarter, sales were $3.1 billion, up 15% year-over-year. Net income was $539 million, up 18% year-over-year. And EPS was $0.59, up 28% year-over-year. For the full year, sales were $11.4 billion, and EPS was $1.78, both up 11% from 2017. We also delivered on our goal to improve gross margin to 42% in the second half, a significant increase over last year and the first half of 2018.
All of our businesses produced year-over-year sales growth in 2018. Highlights include: Optical Communications sales up 18% for the second consecutive year; Environmental sales up 17%, as the adoption of gasoline particulate filters accelerated; Specialty Materials sales up 5% following an exceptional 2017 growth of 25%; Display sales up 4% as we ramp our new Gen 10.5 facility, and annual price declines reached the important milestone of mid-single digits in the second half. And full year pricing was the best in more than a decade; Life Science sales up 8% as we continue to outpace market growth.
Through the past 3 years, we have invested for growth through our Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework. The significant benefits of these investments are evident in our financial performance. In 2018, we built the capacity, launched new products, grew sales by more than $1 billion and extended our leadership position in all businesses. We exited the year with strong execution, expanded margins and great momentum. We expect our momentum to continue into 2019 and beyond, strong year-over-year growth in the first half and additional growth in subsequent quarters. In total, we anticipate another strong year for Corning.
We also feel confident that we're well positioned for long-term growth. Important trends, such as 5G, smart cars, connected homes and augmented reality are converging around Corning's unique capabilities. These interconnected ecosystems require technology that have been our fundamental strengths for a decade. Our proprietary manufacturing processes and deep expertise in glass, ceramics and optical physics are more relevant than ever. Overall, we're excited about 2019 and our future opportunities, as Tony will describe in more detail in just a few minutes.
Now let's turn to the Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework. Under the framework, we target generating $26 billion to $30 billion in cash through 2019. We plan to return more than $12.5 billion to our shareholders through repurchases and dividends and to invest $10 billion to extend our leadership and deliver growth. As we've discussed in numerous times, we have continued to make great progress for the framework goals we announced in October 2015. As we enter the final year of our plan, we expect to meet our stated goals. Our cash generation is on target. And through the end of 2018, we have returned $11.8 billion to shareholders. We increased dividends per share by 50% since the framework began. Investments in RD&E, capital expenditures and acquisitions also remain on track to our 4-year plan totaling $8.2 billion to the end of 2018.
As outlined in our Framework, Corning is best in the world in 3 core technologies, 4 manufacturing and engineering platforms and 5 market access platforms. Our capabilities are interrelated and reinforcing. We focused 80% of our resources on opportunities that use capabilities in at least 2 of these 3 categories. This increases our probability of success, reduces the cost of innovation, creates stronger competitive advantages and most importantly, delights our customers.
Now I'll turn to progress in each of our market access platforms, starting with Optical Communications. Our performance in Optical Communications continues to be outstanding, and we expect to surpass our goal of $5 billion and 2020 sales with further growth beyond. We remain the world leader in passive optical solutions and the only true end-to-end supplier of integrated solutions. 2018 was an excellent year for our Optical Communications business. Recognition of the value created by our solution and co-innovation approach continues to grow. We secured additional multiyear contracts with industry leaders in the carrier and data center segments, which will add significant sales and profit in 2019 and beyond. This committed demand supports our additional investments in manufacturing capacity.
Another highlight of the year was completing the acquisition of 3M's Communications Markets Division. In addition to bringing us a talented group of employees, it extends our market reach and access to global customers, while expanding our portfolio in rapidly growing optical solutions markets.
Next, we achieved product milestones that demonstrate our long track record of innovation and industry expertise. Our connectorized, fiber to the home solution have passed more than 45 million homes around the world. We introduced products in 2018, such as extreme density cable tailored for next-generation hyperscale data center architectures as well as a fiber that offers significant advantages for high throughput transmission. Our products continue to reduce network costs and increase the speed of installations. And we are in an industry that operates in multiple customer segments, including data centers and access networks.
Interestingly, beyond the hardware solutions, we also developed software tools that speed up installation. For example, fiber glass helped accelerate typical installations from weeks to just days. Bruce Furlong, Bell's Vice President of Deployment and Access, described the benefits this way: ""The efficiency and accuracy of the fiber pass solution has contributed to the rapid expansion of Bell's broadband network and our fast-growing 5 TV and Internet services.""
Our investments in capacity clearly paid off in the second half of 2018, with strong sales growth and even greater growth and profitability. As we turn to 2019, committed demand support additional investments and will lead to additional growth. Overall, we expect to continue to grow more than twice as fast as the communication infrastructure market.
Now let's turn to Mobile Consumer Electronics, where we are the world leader in glass for smartphones, tablets and emerging categories in augmented reality devices. Our goal has been to double Mobile Consumer Electronics sales over the next several years despite a maturing smartphone market, and we've been making significant progress to that goal. Here's how. First, we're capturing more value per device. We extended our leadership in the fiberglass market with the launch of Gorilla Glass 6 in July. Leading OEMs are continuing to design our premium glasses into their devices. We expect more than 10 new models with Gorilla Glass 6 to launch throughout this year.
We're not only benefiting from adoption of our premium glasses but also from more glass on each phone. Glass back penetration on smartphones doubled, from 15% in 2017 to 30% in 2018. And we expect continued growth in 2019.
We're also significantly expanding our presence in the aftermarket. As announced this month, we will collaborate with OtterBox, the #1 selling smartphone case brand in the U.S. to introduce the Amplify line of glass screen protectors. This will offer extra protection for consumers and add a third piece of our glass to devices.
Second, we are winning in new and emerging device categories. We launched Corning Gorilla Glass DX and DX+ in July, which provide enhanced antireflective optics and scratch resistance for wearables. These new glass composites are continuing to gain traction in the wearable market, with several launches slated during the first half. We're also partnering with leading consumer electronics makers on augmented reality devices and precise 3D-sensing technology. For example, at CES, we announced an agreement with WaveOptics to help enable fleek augmented reality wearables. The ultra-flat, high-index class that Corning supplies, coupled with our proprietary laser process and characterization tools, enable optimizing this quality and fleek device factors. So overall, we're off to a great start to meet our goal: to double sales in Mobile Consumer Electronics.
A quick fun fact, since 2016, smartphone unit sales have been relatively flat. We, however, grew our sales in the space 30% due to our innovations. We'll continue to innovate for our customers, and you'll continue to see more Corning in your devices.
Turning to Automotive market access platforms. Our materials expertise is helping to propel the auto industry into a new era of cleaner with enhanced cockpit functionality, connectivity and design. Our objectives are to build on our base business with the gasoline particulate filter opportunity and to launch an automotive glass business. 2018 was an exciting year for both objectives. Our gasoline particulate filter technology makes cars significantly cleaner. We exceeded $50 million in GPF sales in 2018 as your opinion regulations took effect. And we expect more than $150 million in 2019 GPF sales. China will be the next to introduce GPFs, with initial filter sales this year as OEMs prepare for the first phase of China 6 regulations in mid-2020. We are ramping dedicated capacity in China to support a robust pipeline of business resulting from upcoming Chinese regulations.
Next, we experienced strong call for Gorilla Glass for automotive in 2018. We are capitalizing on long-term industry trends to the driving demand for technical glass. At CES, automakers confirmed the trend towards larger, longer, shaped and more integrated displays. We also saw strong call for Corning's industry first auto grade glass solutions for automotive interiors, launched exclusively with the customers at CES. These new solutions are making it easier and more affordable for automakers to bring curved and flat displays to market. In total, we have been awarded more than 55 platforms to-date globally, demand is materializing faster than we expected and we are accelerating our investments accordingly.
In our Life Sciences Vessels platform, we continue to make strong progress on the path to a new long-term multi-billion franchise. Valor Glass substantially reduces particle contamination breaks and cracks while significantly increasing throughput. Valor Glass protects patients and improve pharmaceutical manufacturing. Key customers are advancing towards the FDA certification required for the use of Valor. We continue to make progress with our development partners, Merck and Pfizer, and shipments are increasing to other major pharmaceutical manufacturers to support their individual drug regulatory filings. Total shipments of Valor Glass increased fourfold compared to 2017, indicating growing progress towards certification across more pharmaceutical companies.
In parallel, we're supporting customers by scaling up our production capabilities on case with market adoption. We brought new capacity online in 2018 and extended our range of products. We're also progressing with the construction of the new high-volume manufacturing facility in North Carolina that we announced in April.
Finally, industry poll remains favorable. Regulatory concerns about the need for approved glass packaging were highlighted in the lead story of the January PDA letter, reinforcing the need for new solution such as Valor Glass. In addition, Valor Glass was named one of the top 6 pharmaceutical and medical packaging developments in 2018 by Packaging Digest. We continue to believe Valor has the potential to power Corning's growth to the next decade and beyond. We remain closely engaged with the FDA and support its efforts to address this important public health issue. We look forward to being able to share additional updates soon.
In Display, we're delivering stable returns. During 2018, we extended our global leadership by successfully ramping the world's first Gen 10.5 glass point. This accomplishment allow us to grow volume faster than the overall market. Also, the Display glass pricing environment continues to improve. We reached the important milestone of mid-single-digit year-over-year price declines in the second half of 2018. In fact, 2018 was the best pricing environment in more than a decade. We expect the pricing environment to improve further in 2019 and reach mid-single-digit declines for the full year. We're off to a great start, with first quarter price declines expected to be significantly better within quarter 1 2018 and the best quarter 1 in a decade. Display will continue to execute its proven strategy to deliver stable returns.
So we continue to make significant progress across all our market access platforms. Ultimately, we remain on track to fully achieve our Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework goals. For 2018, we've leverage our investments to meet increased demand from our customers, growth sales and significantly improve profitability in the second half, just as we said we would. Looking ahead, we are confident in our ability to deliver sustained performance. We have multiple businesses driving our growth. Our capabilities are becoming increasingly vital to important trends. Our relationships with industry-leading customers are opening new opportunities. And our strategic investments are paying off. We're not only succeeding at building a bigger company. We're building a stronger, more resilient one. We look forward to outlining the next phase of our strategic framework in the coming months.
Now let me turn the call over to Tony for a review of our results and outlook."
173840,597009556,1641724,"Corning Incorporated, Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2019",2019-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Corning Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Wendell, and good morning. We had another outstanding quarter, and our portfolio results exceeded our expectations. In 2018, we get what we said we were going to do, which was to expand our manufacturing capacity in the first half and begin lev",2007,"Thank you, Wendell, and good morning. We had another outstanding quarter, and our portfolio results exceeded our expectations. In 2018, we get what we said we were going to do, which was to expand our manufacturing capacity in the first half and begin leveraging those growth investments in the second half. In 2019, we expect to build on this momentum and keep growing across all of our businesses.
Before I get into the details of our performance and results, I want to note that the primary difference between our GAAP and core results is, again, a noncash marked-to-market adjustment for our currency hedge contracts. As we discussed before, GAAP accounting requires earning translation hedge contracts settling in future periods to be marked-to-market and recorded in a card value at the end of each quarter even though those contracts will not be sold in the current quarter. For us, this resulted in an after-tax GAAP loss of $180 million for the fourth quarter. To be clear, this marked-to-market accounting has no impact on our cash flow. Our currency hedges protect us economically from foreign exchange rate fluctuations and provide higher certainty for our earnings and cash flow, our ability to invest for growth and our future shareholder distributions. Our non-GAAP, or core results, provide additional transparency into operations by using a constant currency rate aligned with the economics of our underlying transactions. We're very pleased with our hedging program and the economic certainty it provides. We have received $1.7 billion in cash under our hedge contracts since their inception slightly over 5 years ago.
Well, that brings me to our results and outlook. For the fourth quarter, sales were up 15% year-over-year to $3.1 billion, net income rose 18% to $539 million and EPS is $0.59, up 28%. For the full year, sales were $11.4 billion, and EPS was $1.78, both up 11%. As Wendell noted, this strong growth resulted from customers adopting our innovations and from us factoring the benefits of our capacity investments. As a reminder, our capacity expansion projects in 2018 supported strong committed customer demand across all businesses. These investments include capacity expansion for optical fiber and cable, Gen 10.5 Display glass, gasoline particulate filters and multiple development projects, such as Gorilla Glass for mobile devices and automotive. 2018 capital spending totaled $2.2 billion. As our new capacity ramp towards full production levels, our sales were runway climbed and our gross margin expanded at 42% in the second half of the year.
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $2.4 billion of cash. Adjusted operating cash flow for the year was $3.2 billion and on track for the accumulative target in the 4-year capital allocation plan.
Now let's look at the detailed segment results and outlook. In Display Technologies, we're delivering stable returns. Our full year sales were $3.3 billion, up 4% year-over-year. Fourth quarter performance was in line with our expectations. Sales were $899 million, and net income was $240 million. 2018 was the best pricing environment in more than a decade. As expected, fourth quarter price declines were very moderate, at a mid-single-digit percentage year-over-year, and even more moderate than Q3. With over 90% of our volume under contract, we expect our full year 2019 price declines to improve further through a mid-single-digit percentage and to be even better than they were in 2018. For the first quarter of 2019, we expect sequential price declines to be significantly better than the first quarter of 2018 and be the most favorable first quarter price change in over a decade. Now 3 factors continue to drive our view that this favorable pricing environment will continue: first, we expect glass supply to continue to be balanced or . Our new Gen 10.5 plant supports the expected growth of large-sized TVs. It is co-located with, and dedicated to, our customer BOE. We pay for the line capacity in tandem with BOE to ensure a Gen 10.5 glass supply is balanced with demand. The ramp is on schedule. We expect the glass supply-demand balance below Gen 10.5 to continue to be tight, as public information indicates there's low capacity growth planned in this segment; second, our competitors continue to face profitability challenges pricing levels. Therefore, we expect their price declines will slow further as they try to remain profitable; and third, display glass manufacturing requires ongoing investment in current capacity to maintain our operations. To generate settable returns on investments, glass pricing will need to improve even further. For Corning, we will only add capacity if we can get an attractive return for our shareholders.
In the fourth quarter, Display glass market volume grew low-single digits sequentially and our volume grew faster, as expected, due to the ramp of our Gen 10.5 plant. For the full year, the Display glass market volume increased mid-single digits as expected, driven by growth in TV screen size. We expect mid-single-digit growth again in 2019, also driven by growth in TV screen size. We also expect our volume to grow more than the market once again, resulting from the ramp of our Gen 10.5 plant during that 2018. In the first quarter of 2019, we expect the Display glass market to be at mid-single digits year-over-year and our volume to be up significantly more. Sequentially, we expect the market and our volume to decline by a mid-single-digit percentage, consistent with normal seasonality.
In summary, we remain very pleased with the current dynamics in our Display business, including our ability to cash the higher productivity and margin through fleet optimization and the Gen 10.5 ramp. And most importantly, the fact that we are now delivering stable returns.
Let's move to our fastest-growing segment, Optical Communications. Full year sales were $4.2 billion, up 18% for the second consecutive year. The business is on track to surpass its goal of $5 billion in 2020 sales. Net income was up 26% year-over-year. In the fourth quarter, sales exceeded $1 billion for the third consecutive quarter, and we were up 26% over 2017. Net income for the quarter, was up 60% year-over-year. Sales growth for the year and the quarter were driven by multiyear data center and carrier projects, availability of new manufacturing capacity as well as sales from the recently acquired 3M Communication Markets Division. As planned, we are leveraging our capacity investments to drive higher volume and earnings.
Our midyear acquisition of 3M's Communications Market Division contributed about $200 million to 2018 sales. We are pleased with our progress on integrating this acquisition and continue to expect it to be accretive to EPS in 2019. Looking forward, we expect first quarter sales to be up in the low-20% range year-over-year. We expect another year of growth, with full year 2019 sales up low teens. Key growth drivers to include customer projects and the full year of sales from the 3M acquisition. Our customers, the world's leading network and cloud operators, continue to deploy Corning's optical solutions to densify their 4G, 5G and data center networks. We continue to be very excited about the growth ahead of us.
Environmental Technologies 2018 sales were $1.3 billion, up 17% year-over-year, driven by growth in all product categories and accelerated by emerging sales of GPFs. Net income grew faster than sales at 26% year-over-year. 2018 GPF sales were more than $50 million, as demand ramp strongly in the second half of the year, primarily in Europe. We are now starting to sell into China with early adoption of China 6 regulations. Dedicated capacity and engineering investments support the ramp of this business. Fourth quarter Environmental sales grew 10% year-over-year. Looking to 2019, we expect [ first quarter ] growth of mid-single digits and full year sales to be up high-single digits year-over-year. We expect $150 million of GPF sales in 2019. And we continue to add capacity to meet the additional demand.
In Specialty Materials, 2018 results were strong after an exceptional year of 25% sales growth in 2017. Full year sales rose 5% as OEMs adopted our portfolio of premium glass products. And the use of glass backs double to about 30% of smartphones in 2018. Fourth quarter sales were $399 million, in line with our expectations, and up 2% versus a very strong fourth quarter in 2017, when customers built aggressively to support launch cycles. Overall, we are pleased with our performance in Specialty Materials. Our results demonstrate the value of our premium glasses, the strength of our innovation portfolio and the continued adoption of glass smartphones backs. For the first quarter, we expect sales to grow mid- to high-single digits year-over-year. We also expect to grow again for the full year despite a mature market. Exactly how much will depend on the adoption rate of our innovations.
In Life Sciences, 2018 sales were $946 million, up 8% year-over-year, with strong fourth quarter sales, as we continue to outpace market growth. Net income was up 23% year-over-year, driven by higher sales volume and manufacturing efficiencies. We expect sales growth to be a low- to mid-single-digit percentage year-over-year for the first quarter and full year.
In summary, 2018 was a terrific year. All of our businesses had strong momentum. And we expect another year of sales, gross margin, net income and EPS growth in 2019. We expect 2019 gross margin dollars, in percent, to expand due to the manufacturing capacity that came online in 2018, our improved utilization of that capacity and the strength of our sales growth. The percentage increase will be somewhat muted due to our continuing investments in 2019 to meet committed demand for Optical Communications, GPFs and automotive glass. We expect to see the sales and margin benefit that means additional investments starting Q2 and build throughout the remainder of the year. In the first quarter, we expect double-digit year-over-year sales, gross margin dollars and net income growth. We expect gross margin percent to improve slightly from Q1 2018. Sequentially, we expect Q1 gross margin dollars and percent to be down due to seasonality in Display and Specialty, as is typical. We expect both to improve in Q2 and to continue climbing throughout the year.
Annual operating expenses should remain consistent with last year as a percentage of sales. For the full year, SG&A is expected to be about 14% of sales, and RD&E between 8% and 8.5%. We expect other income, other operating expenses to be approximately $250 million for the year. Full year of gross equity earnings are expected to be approximately $210 million, predominantly from Hemlock Semiconductor, with the first quarter at approximately $20 million, consistent with typical seasonality. Fourth quarter 2018 gross equity earnings were $152 million.
Our tax rate should be between 21% and 22% for the year and for the quarter. The slide we posted gives you additional modeling details for the first quarter and the full year. In 2019, we expect to spend just over $2 billion of capital expenditures with programs in every market access platform. How much more will depend on how quickly we ramp some of our investments. We'll provide more detail as the year progresses.
Finally, I would like to make a couple of comments on the economic environment, in particular, China. First, as we said previously, we do not expect the material impact from the enacted tariffs. Second, we incorporated consecutive estimates for China end market demand for TVs and autos and our strong guidance and outlook for 2019. If Chinese demand is better, there's an opportunity for upside.
In closing, 2018 demonstrates that we are delivering on our priorities to grow and extend our leadership. Results were outstanding, with 11% sales growth and second half margin expansion. Our strong guidance reflects the rich set of opportunities ahead of us in 2019 and beyond as we continue to grow faster than the market across all of our businesses. We are also rewarding investors by returning more than $12.5 billion to shareholders, which compounds the benefit our future growth for long-term shareholders.
With that, let's move to Q&A. Ann?"

So the primary reason we're growing faster in the market really has 2 layers to it. First of all, you've just seen new networks being put in place that used to be fiber-poor and because of the requirement in our innovations",408,"Thanks for the question, Steve. So the primary reason we're growing faster in the market really has 2 layers to it. First of all, you've just seen new networks being put in place that used to be fiber-poor and because of the requirement in our innovations are going to be fiber-rich. So in a way, for us you can think about is it's not just more networks right but basically it's more us in the network. And that's why you're going to -- you start to see us begin to differentiate from the industry growth. Take something like wireless, as everybody's heard a lot about 4G densification or 5G. Wireless, today, is a relatively fiber lean architecture. As you move to the wireless of the future, you end up adding a lot of glass. So as they talk about wireless networks densifying, right, what that really means is they're glassifying. And so if you compare us to others who already in the wireless market, we were pretty small, but now we're getting pretty big because of our innovations and the requirements a unique fiberoptics expertise offers. You see a similar dynamic happening in data centers, with continued strong growth really at the percent of the load that's cloud-based, which then 10 allows do things like public cloud very large private clouds. You concentrate much more processing power, right, that is shared across many. What then makes it more economical, since you have all of that you have that bandwidth all in one place, to start using fiber where you used to use copper. So once again, a substitution of that. Now all of these things are further fiber dynamic we have a set of unique innovations in all of those areas it will give us an additional advantage versus other players. So that's why you tend to see the difference. Now that you asked another question just where do we expect to see the growth here in these coming years. We expect to see it being driven in access networks, especially with an accent on wireless densification. And then, we do expect to see a hyperscale data center business to continue to grow strongly and has now a new concept of sort of what adds compute and more EDGE cloud to that also opening up some opportunities for us. So sorry for the long answer. Stephen, does that get it at the core of what you're talking about?"

As it does is it increases both the size of our business and the number of different areas that we're doing. The number of different customers that were doing it with and the number of different locations we're building at. So by increasing the number of projects, in a way, it becomes a little smoother not because individual projects are lumpy, because they are, but they end up being in slightly different stages at different times. But I am quite sure, at some point, we'll hit a time where -- we'll hit a time where things will go a little lumpier because number of the projects were together."

And what we saw in the second half of the year was the benefit of those things to occur. And you saw in the fourth quarter results where profits were up more than our -- the sales were on a year-over-year basis. And so when we've always talked about stabilization, what we talked about is getting to a certain profit level and continuing that on a going-forward basis.

And we expect, going forward, continued strong margin performance, both in dollars and percentages, but get somewhat really by investments that we're making. And the good news is those investments are for committed growth in Optical Communications, GPF and auto glass. And we're going to start seeing those investments starting in Q2. The benefits of those investment and it's going to expand from there. And in any given quarter, trends are going to impacted by seasonality of our businesses, like it is in the first quarter, by the various mixes that we have in the business. But we're happy with our each of our businesses performance is there the best in the industries. And also, just like the total impact of these investments.

Now most people looking at the market print, the TV unit themselves are going to be a flat to down a little bit. A lot of that being driven in China now. And we've factored that into our projections. But what really drives the market is the screen size growth, and we expect that once again to be in the about mid-single digits and I will grow faster than that because of the Gen 10.5 ramp up but you know generally speaking took out the mid-single digits. Relative to Specialty Materials. Again, what really drives the growth there is the technology adoption of our products, as Wendell would say, having more Corning in those products. Last year, I think most people believed smartphones were down a little bit. That's what they're protecting again for this year in China. But the reason that we're confident we can be up is because of the adoption of the technologies. How much we're going to be up will depend on the actual timing of that adoption, but we can pretty good about that."

This morning, we reported a very strong finish to an excellent 2018. For the fourth quarter, sales were $3.1 billion, up 15% year-over-year. Net income was $539 million, up 18% year-over-year. And EPS was $0.59, up 28% year-over-year. For the full year, sales were $11.4 billion, and EPS was $1.78, both up 11% from 2017. We also delivered on our goal to improve gross margin to 42% in the second half, a significant increase over last year and the first half of 2018.
All of our businesses produced year-over-year sales growth in 2018. Highlights include: Optical Communications sales up 18% for the second consecutive year; Environmental sales up 17%, as the adoption of gasoline particulate filters accelerated; Specialty Materials sales up 5% following an exceptional 2017 growth of 25%; Display sales up 4% as we ramp our new Gen 10.5 facility, and annual price declines reached the important milestone of mid-single digits in the second half. And full year pricing was the best in more than a decade; Life Science sales up 8% as we continue to outpace market growth.
For the past 3 years, we have invested for growth through our Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework. The significant benefits of these investments are evident in our financial performance. In 2018, we built the capacity, launched new products, grew sales by more than $1 billion and extended our leadership position in all businesses. We exited the year with strong execution, expanded margins and great momentum. We expect our momentum to continue into 2019 and beyond, and we expect strong year-over-year growth in the first quarter and additional growth in subsequent quarters. In total, we anticipate another strong year for Corning.
We also feel confident that we're well positioned for long-term growth. Important trends, such as 5G, smart cars, connected homes and augmented reality are converging around Corning's unique capabilities. These interconnected ecosystems require technology that have been our fundamental strengths for a decade. Our proprietary manufacturing processes and deep expertise in glass, ceramics and optical physics are more relevant than ever. Overall, we're excited about 2019 and our future opportunities, as Tony will describe in more detail in just a few minutes.
Now let's turn to the Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework. Under the framework, we target generating $26 billion to $30 billion in cash through 2019. We plan to return more than $12.5 billion to our shareholders through repurchases and dividends and to invest $10 billion to extend our leadership and deliver growth. As we've discussed within numerous times, we have continued to make great progress for the framework goals we announced in October 2015. As we enter the final year of our plan, we expect to meet our stated goals. Our cash generation is on target. And through the end of 2018, we have returned $11.8 billion to shareholders. We increased dividends per share by 50% since the framework began. Investments in RD&E, capital expenditures and acquisitions also remain on track to our 4-year plan totaling $8.2 billion to the end of 2018.
As outlined in our framework, Corning is best in the world in 3 core technologies, 4 manufacturing and engineering platforms and 5 market access platforms. Our capabilities are interrelated and reinforcing. We focused 80% of our resources on opportunities that use capabilities in at least 2 of these 3 categories. This increases our probability of success, reduces the cost of innovation, creates stronger competitive advantages and most importantly, delights our customers.
Now I'll turn to progress in each of our market access platforms, starting with Optical Communications. Our performance in Optical Communications continues to be outstanding, and we expect to surpass our goal of $5 billion in 2020 sales with further growth beyond. We remain the world leader in passive optical solutions and the only true end-to-end supplier of integrated solutions. 2018 was an excellent year for our Optical Communications business. Recognition of the value created by our solution and co-innovation approach continues to grow. We secured additional multiyear contracts with industry leaders in the carrier and data center segments, which will add significant sales and profit in 2019 and beyond. This committed demand supports our additional investments in manufacturing capacity.
Another highlight of the year was completing the acquisition of 3M's Communications Markets Division. In addition to bringing us a talented group of employees, it extends our market reach and access to global customers, while expanding our portfolio in rapidly growing optical solutions markets.
Next, we achieved product milestones that demonstrate our long track record of innovation and industry expertise. Our pre-connectorised, fiber to the home solution have passed more than 45 million homes around the world. We introduced products in 2018, such as extreme density cable tailored for next-generation hyperscale data center architectures as well as a fiber that offers significant advantages for high throughput transmission. All products continue to reduce network costs and increase the speed of installations. And we earned industry accolades in multiple customer segments, including data centers and access networks.
Interestingly, beyond the hardware solutions, we also developed software tools that speed up installation. For example, FiberPass helps accelerate typical installations from weeks to just days. Bruce Furlong, Bell's Vice President of Deployment and Access, described the benefits this way: ""The efficiency and accuracy of the FiberPass solution has contributed to the rapid expansion of Bell's broadband network and our fast-growing Fibe TV and Internet services.""
Our investments in capacity clearly paid off in the second half of 2018, with strong sales growth and even greater growth and profitability. As we turn to 2019, committed demand supports additional investments and will lead to additional growth. Overall, we expect to continue to grow more than twice as fast as the communications infrastructure market.
Now let's turn to Mobile Consumer Electronics, where we are the world leader in glass for smartphones, tablets and emerging categories, like [ NIPs ] and augmented reality devices. Our goal has been to double Mobile Consumer Electronics sales over the next several years despite a maturing smartphone market, and we've been making significant progress toward that goal. Here's how. First, we're capturing more value per device. We extended our leadership in the cover glass market with the launch of Gorilla Glass 6 in July. Leading OEMs are continuing to design our premium glasses into their devices. We expect more than 10 new models with Gorilla Glass 6 to launch throughout this year.
We're not only benefiting from adoption of our premium glasses but also from more glass on each phone. Glass back penetration on smartphones doubled, from 15% in 2017 to 30% in 2018. And we expect continued growth in 2019.
We're also significantly expanding our presence in the aftermarket. As announced this month, we will collaborate with OtterBox, the #1 selling smartphone case brand in the U.S. to introduce the Amplify line of glass screen protectors. This will offer extra protection for consumers and add a third piece of our glass to devices.
Second, we are winning in new and emerging device categories. We launched Corning Gorilla Glass DX and DX+ in July, which provide enhanced antireflective optics and scratch resistance for wearables. These new glass composites are continuing to gain traction in the wearable market, with several launches slated during the first half. We're also partnering with leading consumer electronics makers on augmented reality devices and precise 3D-sensing technology. For example, at CES, we announced an agreement with WaveOptics to help enable fleek augmented reality wearables. The ultra-flat, high-index class that Corning supplies, coupled with our proprietary laser processing and characterization tools, enable optimizing this quality in fleek device form factors. So overall, we're off to a great start to meet our goal: to double sales in Mobile Consumer Electronics.
A quick fun fact, since 2016, smartphone unit sales have been relatively flat. We, however, grew our sales in this space 30% due to our innovations. We'll continue to innovate for our customers, and you'll continue to see more Corning in your devices.
Turning to Automotive market access platforms. Our materials expertise is helping to propel the auto industry into a new era of cleaner cars with enhanced cockpit functionality, connectivity and design. Our objectives are to build on our base business with the gasoline particulate filter opportunity and to launch an automotive glass business. 2018 was an exciting year for both objectives. Our gasoline particulate filter technology makes cars significantly cleaner. We exceeded $50 million in GPF sales in 2018 as European regulations took effect. And we expect more than $150 million in 2019 GPF sales. China will be the next to introduce GPFs, with initial filter sales this year as OEMs prepare for the first phase of China 6 regulations in mid-2020. We are ramping dedicated capacity in China to support a robust pipeline of business resulting from upcoming Chinese regulations.
Next, we experienced strong call for Gorilla Glass for automotive in 2018. We are capitalizing on long-term industry trends to the driving demand for technical glass. At CES, automakers confirmed the trend towards larger, longer, shaped and more integrated displays. We also saw a strong call for Corning's industry-first auto grade glass solutions for automotive interiors, launched exclusively with customers at CES. These new solutions are making it easier and more affordable for automakers to bring curved and flat displays to market. In total, we've been awarded more than 55 platforms to-date globally. Demand is materializing faster than we expected, and we are accelerating our investments accordingly.
In our Life Sciences Vessels platform, we continue to make strong progress on the path to a new long-term multi-billion dollar franchise. Valor Glass substantially reduces particle contamination breaks and cracks while significantly increasing throughput. Valor helps protect patients and improve pharmaceutical manufacturing. Key customers are advancing towards the FDA certification required for the use of Valor. We continue to make progress with our development partners, Merck and Pfizer, and shipments are increasing to other major pharmaceutical manufacturers to support their individual drug regulatory filings. Total shipments of Valor Glass increased fourfold compared to 2017, indicating growing progress towards certification across more pharmaceutical companies.
In parallel, we're supporting customers by scaling up our production capabilities on case with market adoption. We brought new capacity online in 2018 and extended our range of products. We're also progressing with the construction of the new high-volume manufacturing facility in North Carolina that we announced in April.
Finally, industry poll remains favorable. Regulatory concerns about the need for improved glass packaging were highlighted in the lead story of the January PDA letter, reinforcing the need for new solutions such as Valor Glass. In addition, Valor Glass was named one of the top 6 pharmaceutical and medical packaging developments in 2018 by Packaging Digest. We continue to believe Valor has the potential to power Corning's growth to the next decade and beyond. We remain closely engaged with the FDA and support its efforts to address this important public health issue. We look forward to being able to share additional updates soon.
In Display, we're delivering stable returns. During 2018, we extended our global leadership by successfully ramping the world's first Gen 10.5 glass plant. This accomplishment allow us to grow volume faster than the overall market. Also, the Display glass pricing environment continues to improve. We reached the important milestone of mid-single-digit year-over-year price declines in the second half of 2018. In fact, 2018 was the best pricing environment in more than a decade. We expect the pricing environment to improve further in 2019 and reach mid-single-digit declines for the full year. We're off to a great start, with first quarter price declines expected to be significantly better within quarter 1 2018 and the best quarter 1 in a decade. Display will continue to execute its proven strategy to deliver stable returns.
So we continue to make significant progress across all our market access platforms. Ultimately, we remain on track to fully achieve our Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework goals. In 2018, we leveraged our investments to meet increased demand from our customers, grow sales and significantly improve profitability in the second half, just as we said we would. Looking ahead, we are confident in our ability to deliver sustained performance. We have multiple businesses driving our growth. Our capabilities are becoming increasingly vital to important trends. Our relationships with industry-leading customers are opening new opportunities. And our strategic investments are paying off. We're not only succeeding at building a bigger company. We're building a stronger, more resilient one. We look forward to outlining the next phase of our strategic framework in the coming months.
Now let me turn the call over to Tony for a review of our results and outlook."
173840,597009556,1642038,"Corning Incorporated, Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2019",2019-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Corning Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Wendell, and good morning. We had another outstanding quarter, and our full year results exceeded our expectations. In 2018, we get what we said we were going to do, which was to expand our manufacturing capacity in the first half and begin lev",2011,"Thank you, Wendell, and good morning. We had another outstanding quarter, and our full year results exceeded our expectations. In 2018, we get what we said we were going to do, which was to expand our manufacturing capacity in the first half and begin leveraging those growth investments in the second half. In 2019, we expect to build on this momentum and keep growing across all of our businesses.
Before I get into the details of our performance and results, I want to note that the primary difference between our GAAP and core results is, again, a noncash marked-to-market adjustment for our currency hedge contracts. As we've discussed before, GAAP accounting requires earning translation hedge contracts settling in future periods to be mark-to-market and recorded at current value at the end of each quarter even though those contracts will not be settled in the current quarter. For us, this resulted in an after-tax GAAP loss of $180 million for the fourth quarter. To be clear, this mark-to-market accounting has no impact on our cash flow. Our currency hedges protect us economically from foreign exchange rate fluctuations and provide higher certainty for our earnings and cash flow, our ability to invest for growth and our future shareholder distributions. Our non-GAAP, or core results, provides additional transparency into operations by using a constant currency rate aligned with the economics of our underlying transactions. We're very pleased with our hedging program and the economic certainty it provides. We have received $1.7 billion in cash under our hedge contracts since their inception slightly over 5 years ago.
Now, that brings me to our results and outlook. For the fourth quarter, sales were up 15% year-over-year to $3.1 billion, net income rose 18% to $539 million, and EPS is $0.59, up 28%. For the full year, sales were $11.4 billion, and EPS was $1.78, both up 11%. As Wendell noted, this strong growth resulted from customers adopting our innovations and from us factoring the benefits of our capacity investments. As a reminder, our capacity expansion projects in 2018 supported strong committed customer demand across all businesses. These investments include capacity expansion for optical fiber and cable, Gen 10.5 Display glass, gasoline particulate filters and multiple development projects, such as Gorilla Glass for mobile devices and automotive. 2018 capital spending totaled $2.2 billion. As our new capacity ramp towards full production levels, our sales run rate climbed and our gross margin expanded at 42% in the second half of the year.
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $2.4 billion of cash. Adjusted operating cash flow for the year was $3.2 billion and on track for the accumulative target in the 4-year capital allocation plan.
Now let's look at the detailed segment results and outlook. In Display Technologies, we're delivering stable returns. Our full year sales were $3.3 billion, up 4% year-over-year. Fourth quarter performance was in line with our expectations. Sales were $899 million, and net income was $240 million. 2018 was the best pricing environment in more than a decade. As expected, fourth quarter price declines were very moderate, at a mid-single-digit percentage year-over-year, and even more moderate than Q3. With over 90% of our volume under contract, we expect our full year 2019 price declines to improve further through a mid-single-digit percentage and to be even better than they were in 2018. For the first quarter of 2019, we expect sequential price declines to be significantly better than the first quarter of 2018 and be the most favorable first quarter price change in over a decade. Now 3 factors continue to drive our view that this favorable pricing environment will continue: first, we expect glass supply to continue to be balanced or even tight. Our new Gen 10.5 plant supports the expected growth of large-sized TVs. It is co-located with, and dedicated to, our customer BOE. We paced in a line capacity in tandem with BOE to ensure a Gen 10.5 glass supply is balanced to demand. The ramp is on schedule. We expect the glass supply-demand balance below Gen 10.5 to continue to be tight, as public information indicates there's low capacity growth planned in this segment; second, our competitors continue to face profitability challenges at current pricing levels. Therefore, we expect their price declines will slow further as they try to remain profitable; and third, display glass manufacturing requires ongoing investment in current capacity to maintain our operations. To generate acceptable returns on investments, glass pricing will need to improve even further. For Corning, we will only add capacity if we can get an attractive return for our shareholders.
In the fourth quarter, Display glass market volume grew low-single digits sequentially and our volume grew faster, as expected, due to the ramp of our Gen 10.5 plant. For the full year, the Display glass market volume increased mid-single digits as expected, driven by growth in TV screen size. We expect mid-single-digit growth again in 2019, also driven by growth in TV screen size. We also expect our volume to grow more than the market once again, resulting from the ramp of our Gen 10.5 plant during that 2018. In the first quarter of 2019, we expect the Display glass market to be at mid-single digits year-over-year and our volume to be up significantly more. Sequentially, we expect the market and our volume to decline by a mid-single-digit percentage, consistent with normal seasonality.
In summary, we remain very pleased with the current dynamics in our Display business, including our ability to cash our higher productivity and margin through fleet optimization and the Gen 10.5 ramp. And most importantly, the fact that we are now delivering stable returns.
Let's move to our fastest-growing segment, Optical Communications. Full year sales were $4.2 billion, up 18% for the second consecutive year. The business is on track to surpass its goal of $5 billion in 2020 sales. Net income was up 26% year-over-year. In the fourth quarter, sales exceeded $1 billion for the third consecutive quarter, and we were up 26% over 2017. Net income for the quarter, was up 60% year-over-year. Sales growth for the year and the quarter were driven by multiyear data center and carrier projects, availability of new manufacturing capacity as well as sales from the recently acquired 3M Communication Markets Division. As planned, we are leveraging our capacity investments to drive higher volume and earnings.
Our midyear acquisition of 3M's Communications Market Division contributed about $200 million to 2018 sales. We are pleased with our progress on integrating this acquisition and continue to expect it to be accretive to EPS in 2019. Looking forward, we expect first quarter sales to be up in the low-20% range year-over-year. We expect another year of growth, with full year 2019 sales up low teens. Key growth drivers include customer projects and the full year of sales from the 3M acquisition. Our customers, the world's leading network and cloud operators, continue to deploy Corning's optical solutions to densify their 4G, 5G and data center networks. We continue to be very excited about the growth ahead of us.
Environmental Technologies 2018 sales were $1.3 billion, up 17% year-over-year, driven by growth in all product categories and accelerated by emerging sales of GPFs. Net income grew faster than sales at 26% year-over-year. 2018 GPF sales were more than $50 million, as demand ramp strongly in the second half of the year, primarily in Europe. We are now starting to sell into China with early adoption of China 6 regulations. Dedicated capacity and engineering investments support the ramp of this business. Fourth quarter Environmental sales grew 10% year-over-year. Looking to 2019, we expect first quarter sales growth of mid-single digits and full year sales to be up high single digits year-over-year. We expect $150 million of GPF sales in 2019. And we continue to add capacity to meet the additional demand.
In Specialty Materials, 2018 results were strong after an exceptional year of 25% sales growth in 2017. Full year sales rose 5% as OEMs adopted our portfolio of premium glass products. And the use of glass backs double to about 30% of smartphones in 2018. Fourth quarter sales were $399 million, in line with our expectations, and up 2% versus a very strong fourth quarter in 2017, when customers built aggressively to support launch cycles. Overall, we are pleased with our performance in Specialty Materials. Our results demonstrate the value of our premium glasses, the strength of our innovation portfolio and the continued adoption of glass smartphone backs. For the first quarter, we expect sales to grow mid- to high single digits year-over-year. We also expect to grow again for the full year despite a mature market. Exactly how much will depend on the adoption rate of our innovations.
In Life Sciences, 2018 sales were $946 million, up 8% year-over-year, with strong fourth quarter sales, as we continue to outpace market growth. Net income was up 23% year-over-year, driven by higher sales volume and manufacturing efficiencies. We expect sales growth to be a low to mid-single-digit percentage year-over-year for the first quarter and full year.
In summary, 2018 was a terrific year. All of our businesses have strong momentum. And we expect another year of sales, gross margin, net income and EPS growth in 2019. We expect 2019 gross margin dollars, in percent, to expand due to the manufacturing capacity that came online in 2018, our improved utilization of that capacity and the strength of our sales growth. The percentage increase will be somewhat muted due to our continuing investments in 2019 to meet committed demand for Optical Communications, GPFs and automotive glass. We expect to see the sales and margin benefit that means additional investments starting Q2 and build throughout the remainder of the year. In the first quarter, we expect double-digit year-over-year sales, gross margin dollars and net income growth. We expect gross margin percent to improve slightly from Q1 2018. Sequentially, we expect Q1 gross margin dollars and percent to be down due to seasonality in Display and Specialty, as is typical. We expect both to improve in Q2 and to continue climbing throughout the year.
Annual operating expenses should remain consistent with last year as a percentage of sales. For the full year, SG&A is expected to be about 14% of sales, and RD&E between 8% and 8.5%. We expect other income, other operating expenses to be approximately $250 million for the year. Full year of gross equity earnings are expected to be approximately $210 million, predominantly from Hemlock Semiconductor, with the first quarter at approximately $20 million, consistent with typical seasonality. Fourth quarter 2018 gross equity earnings were $152 million.
Our tax rate should be between 21% and 22% for the year and for the quarter. The slide we posted gives you additional modeling-related details for the first quarter and the full year. In 2019, we expect to spend just over $2 billion on capital expenditures with programs in every market access platform. How much more will depend on how quickly we ramp some of our investments. We'll provide more detail as the year progresses.
Finally, I would like to make a couple of comments on the economic environment, in particular, China. First, as we said previously, we do not expect the material impact from the enacted tariffs. Second, we incorporated conservative estimates for China end market demand for TVs and autos in our strong guidance and outlook for 2019. If Chinese demand is better, there's an opportunity for upside.
In closing, 2018 demonstrates that we are delivering on our priorities to grow and extend our leadership. Results were outstanding, with 11% sales growth and second half margin expansion. Our strong guidance reflects the rich set of opportunities ahead of us in 2019 and beyond as we continue to grow faster than the market across all of our businesses. We are also rewarding investors by returning more than $12.5 billion to shareholders, which compounds the benefit of our future growth for long-term shareholders.
With that, let's move to Q&A. Ann?"

So the primary reason we're growing faster in the market really has sort of has 2 layers to it. First of all, you've just seen new networks being put in place that used to be fiber-poor and because of the requirements in our innovations are going to be fiber-rich. So in a way, for us you can think about is, it's not just more networks, right, but basically it's more us in the network. And that's why you're going to -- you start to see us begin to differentiate from the industry growth. Take something like wireless, as everybody's heard a lot about 4G densification or 5G. Wireless, today, is relatively fiber lean architecture. As you move to the wireless of the future, you end up adding a lot of glass. So as they talk about wireless networks densifying, right, what that really means is they're glassifying. And so if you compare us to others who are already in the wireless market, we were pretty small, but now we're getting pretty big because of our innovations and the requirements, what it is a unique fiber optics expertise offers. You see a similar dynamic happening in data centers, with the continued strong growth really at the percent of the load that's cloud-based, which is then allows -- when you do things like public cloud and in very large private clouds. You concentrate much more processing power, right, that is shared across many. What then makes it more economical, since you have that bandwidth all in one place, to start using fiber where you used to use copper. So once again, a substitution of that. Now all of these things are furthered by the dynamic that we have a set of unique innovations in all of those areas that gives us an additional advantage versus other players. So that's why you tend to see the difference. Now then you asked another question which is where do we expect to see the growth here in these coming years. We expect to see it being driven in access networks, especially with an accent on wireless densification. And then, we do expect to see a hyperscale data center business to continue to grow strongly and has now this new concept of sort of what adds compute and more EDGE cloud to that also opening up some opportunities for us. So sorry for the long answer, Steven. Does that get it at the core of what you're talking about?"

As it does is it increases both the size of our business and the number of different areas that we're doing. The number of different customers that were doing it with and the number of different locations we're building at. So by increasing the number of projects, in a way, it becomes a little smoother, not because the individual projects aren't lumpy -- they are, but that they end up being in slightly different stages at different times. But I am quite sure, at some point, we'll hit a time where -- we'll hit a time where things will go a little lumpier because number of the projects were together."

And you saw it in the fourth quarter results where our profits were up more than our -- the sales were on a year-over-year basis. And so when we've always talked about stabilization, what we talked about is getting to a certain profit level and continuing that on a going-forward basis. And we think that we feel good about the stabilization we saw in the second half. In fact, the fact that we grew profits in the second half and we think that's evidence as the strategy that we have been working on for a number of years really starting to pay off."

And so really, but outside smartphones, you see us playing with the same basic approach, which is getting our new innovations adopted in those areas that also allows to add value. Then you have entirely new device categories like the augmented reality, where you're seeing the potential start to take shape for really significant innovation in a vast new device category.

As you've noted that in those 2 areas, were not necessarily talking about more devices. You're talking about more on Corning. And if you're listening when I answered Steven's question of why are we growing faster, and communications then -- there's communications infrastructure, once again, it's an answer of more of our content. It's more us. Necessarily, we'll add more networks. In automotive which you heard Tony talk about is we're not counting on more cars. What we're counting on is more content from us with gas particulate filters, our auto glass solutions. So you're right, you're not seeing us diversify out of our core market access platforms are 5. Instead, you're seeing us get more product opportunities within it. We believe this is going to reduce cyclically the economic sensitivity and increase the resilience of our growth that really observe it. Thank you for asking that."

Wamsi, overall, we're really pleased with our gross margin performance. We said at the beginning in 2018 that we're investing intensely and that would lead to significant growth and margin expansion in the back half. And that's exactly what happened. Our sales were up 16% in the back half over the first half. And our gross margins expanded about 150 basis points. And we expect, going forward, continued strong margin performance, both in dollars and the percentages, but did get somewhat nearly by investments that we're making. And the good news is those investments are for committed growth in Optical Communications, GPF and in auto glass. And we're going to start seeing those investments starting in Q2. The benefits of those investments and it's going to expand from there. And in any given quarter, trends are going to be impacted by seasonality of our businesses, like it is in the first quarter, by the various mixes that we have in the businesses. But we're happy with our each of our businesses performances as they're the best in the industries. And also, just like the total impact of these investments. So in Q1, you see some of these investments impacting us. But the main reason why Q1 is down versus Q4 is really the seasonality, not the investment. In terms of China, we were happy with the approach we took in the third and the fourth quarter. It turned out that we're exactly slight on both in terms of wearing the auto production ended up in China and also from a TV standpoint. So we feel good about that. And as we go forward into next year, we're assuming that the clients in both of those markets and the strong guidance that I gave you for the year."

And in 2018, the screen size grow -- drove the market growth to the mid-single digits. And that's what we expect to happen again. Now we also benefited a little bit in 2018 where the number of TV units went up. But that's still -- what really matters here is the screen size growth. As we go into 2019, we, again, think the market is going to grow about the mid-single digits and what's driving that is the screen size growth. Now most people looking at the market print, the TV unit themselves are going to be flat-to-down a little bit. A lot of that being driven in China. And we've factored that into our projections. But what really drives the market is the screen size growth, and we expect that once again to be in the about mid-single digits. Now, we're growing faster than that because of the Gen 10.5 ramp but you know generally speaking, it's about the mid-single digits. Relative to Specialty Materials. Again, what really drives the growth there is the technology adoption of our products, as Wendell would say, having more Corning in those products. Last year, I think most people believed smartphones were down a little bit. That's what they're projecting again for this year, a lot of that being driven in China. But the reason that we're confident that we can be up is because of the adoption of the technologies. How much we're going to be up will depend on the actual timing of that adoption, but we feel pretty good about that."

For the fourth quarter, sales were $3.1 billion, up 15% year-over-year. Net income was $539 million, up 18% year-over-year. And EPS was $0.59",2122,"Thank you, Ann, and good morning, everyone.
This morning, we reported a very strong finish to an excellent 2018. For the fourth quarter, sales were $3.1 billion, up 15% year-over-year. Net income was $539 million, up 18% year-over-year. And EPS was $0.59, up 28% year-over-year. For the full year, sales were $11.4 billion, and EPS was $1.78, both up 11% from 2017. We also delivered on our goal to improve gross margin to 42% in the second half, a significant increase over last year and the first half of 2018.
All of our businesses produced year-over-year sales growth in 2018. Highlights include: Optical Communications sales up 18% for the second consecutive year; Environmental sales up 17%, as the adoption of gasoline particulate filters accelerated; Specialty Materials sales up 5% following an exceptional 2017 growth of 25%; Display sales up 4% as we ramp our new Gen 10.5 facility, and annual price declines reached the important milestone of mid-single digits in the second half. And full year pricing was the best in more than a decade; Life Science sales up 8% as we continue to outpace market growth.
For the past 3 years, we have invested for growth through our Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework. The significant benefits of these investments are evident in our financial performance. In 2018, we built new capacity, launched new products, grew sales by more than $1 billion and extended our leadership position in all businesses. We exited the year with strong execution, expanded margins and great momentum. 
We expect our momentum to continue into 2019 and beyond, and we expect strong year-over-year growth in the first quarter and additional growth in subsequent quarters. In total, we anticipate another strong year for Corning.
We also feel confident that we're well positioned for long-term growth. Important trends, such as 5G and smart cars, connected homes and augmented reality are converging around Corning's unique capabilities. These interconnected ecosystems require technology that have been our fundamental strengths for a decade. Our proprietary manufacturing processes and deep expertise in glass, ceramics and optical physics are more relevant than ever. Overall, we're excited about 2019 and our future opportunities, as Tony will describe in more detail in just a few minutes.
Now let's turn to the Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework. Under the framework, we target generating $26 billion to $30 billion in cash through 2019. We plan to return more than $12.5 billion to our shareholders through repurchases and dividends and to invest $10 billion to extend our leadership and deliver growth. 
As we've discussed within numerous times, we have continued to make great progress for the framework goals we announced in October 2015. As we enter the final year of our plan, we expect to meet our stated goals. Our cash generation is on target. And through the end of 2018, we have returned $11.8 billion to shareholders. We increased dividends per share by 50% since the framework began. Investments in RD&E, capital expenditures and acquisitions also remain on track to our 4-year plan totaling $8.2 billion to the end of 2018.
As outlined in our framework, Corning is best in the world in 3 core technologies, 4 manufacturing and engineering platforms and 5 market access platforms. Our capabilities are interrelated and reinforcing. We focused 80% of our resources on opportunities that use capabilities in at least 2 of these 3 categories. This increases our probability of success, reduces the cost of innovation, creates stronger competitive advantages and most importantly, delights our customers.
Now I'll turn to progress in each of our market access platforms, starting with Optical Communications. Our performance in Optical Communications continues to be outstanding, and we expect to surpass our goal of $5 billion in 2020 sales with further growth beyond. We remain the world leader in passive optical solutions and the only true end-to-end supplier of integrated solutions. 
2018 was an excellent year for our Optical Communications business. Recognition of the value created by our solution and co-innovation approach continues to grow as we secured additional multiyear contracts with industry leaders in the carrier and data center segments, which will add significant sales and profit in 2019 and beyond. This committed demand supports our additional investments in manufacturing capacity.
Another highlight of the year was completing the acquisition of 3M's Communications Markets Division. In addition to bringing us a talented group of employees, it extends our market reach and access to global customers, while expanding our portfolio in rapidly growing optical solutions markets.
Next, we achieved product milestones that demonstrate our long track record of innovation and industry expertise. Our pre-connectorised, fiber to the home solution have passed more than 45 million homes around the world. We introduced products in 2018, such as extreme density cable tailored for next-generation hyperscale data center architectures as well as a fiber that offers significant advantages for high throughput transmission. 
[ All ] products continue to reduce network costs and increase the speed of installations. And we earned industry accolades in multiple customer segments, including data centers and access networks.
Interestingly, beyond the hardware solutions, we've also developed software tools that speed up installation. For example, FiberPass helps accelerate typical installations from weeks to just days. Bruce Furlong, Bell's Vice President of Deployment and Access, described the benefits this way: ""The efficiency and accuracy of the FiberPass solution has contributed to the rapid expansion of Bell's broadband network and our fast-growing Fibe TV and Internet services.""
Our investments in capacity clearly paid off in the second half of 2018, with strong sales growth and even greater growth and profitability. As we turn to 2019, committed demand supports additional investments and will lead to additional growth. Overall, we expect to continue to grow more than twice as fast as the communications infrastructure market.
Now let's turn to Mobile Consumer Electronics, where we are the world leader in glass for smartphones, tablets and emerging categories, like wearables and augmented reality devices. Our goal has been to double Mobile Consumer Electronics sales over the next several years despite a maturing smartphone market, and we've been making significant progress toward that goal. 
Here's how. First, we're capturing more value per device. We extended our leadership in the cover glass market with the launch of Gorilla Glass 6 in July. Leading OEMs are continuing to design our premium glasses into their devices. We expect more than 10 new models with Gorilla Glass 6 to launch throughout this year.
We're not only benefiting from adoption of our premium glasses but also from more glass on each phone. Glass back penetration on smartphones doubled, from 15% in 2017 to 30% in 2018. And we expect continued growth in 2019.
We're also significantly expanding our presence in the aftermarket. As announced this month, we will collaborate with OtterBox, the #1 selling smartphone case brand in the U.S. to introduce the Amplify line of glass screen protectors. This will offer extra protection for consumers and add a third piece of our glass to devices.
Second, we are winning in new and emerging device categories. We launched Corning Gorilla Glass DX and DX+ in July, which provide enhanced antireflective optics and scratch resistance for wearables. These new glass composites are continuing to gain traction in the wearable market, with several launches slated during the first half. We're also partnering with leading consumer electronics makers on augmented reality devices and precise 3D-sensing technology. For example, at CES, we announced an agreement with WaveOptics to help enable sleek augmented reality wearables. The ultra-flat, high-index class that Corning supplies, coupled with our proprietary laser processing and characterization tools, enable optimizing this quality and sleek device form factors. So overall, we're off to a great start to meet our goal: to double sales in Mobile Consumer Electronics.
A quick fun fact, since 2016, smartphone unit sales have been relatively flat. We, however, grew our sales in this space 30% due to our innovations. We'll continue to innovate for our customers, and you'll continue to see more Corning in your devices.
Turning to Automotive market access platforms. Our materials expertise is helping to propel the auto industry into a new era of cleaner cars with enhanced cockpit functionality, connectivity and design. Our objectives are to build on our base business with the gasoline particulate filter opportunity and to launch an automotive glass business. 2018 was an exciting year for both objectives. Our gasoline particulate filter technology makes cars significantly cleaner. We exceeded $50 million in GPF sales in 2018 as European regulations took effect. And we expect more than $150 million in 2019 GPF sales. China will be the next to introduce GPFs, with initial filter sales this year as OEMs prepare for the first phase of China 6 regulations in mid-2020. We are ramping dedicated capacity in China to support a robust pipeline of business resulting from upcoming Chinese regulations.
Next, we experienced strong call for Gorilla Glass for automotive in 2018. We are capitalizing on long-term industry trends to the driving demand for technical glass. At CES, automakers confirmed the trend towards larger, longer, shaped and more integrated displays. We also saw a strong call for Corning's industry-first auto grade glass solutions for automotive interiors, launched exclusively with customers at CES. These new solutions are making it easier and more affordable for automakers to bring curved and flat displays to market. 
In total, we've been awarded more than 55 platforms to-date globally. Demand is materializing faster than we expected, and we are accelerating our investments accordingly.
In our Life Sciences Vessels platform, we continue to make strong progress on the path to a new long-term multi-billion dollar franchise. Valor Glass substantially reduces particle contamination breaks and cracks while significantly increasing throughput. Valor helps protect patients and improve pharmaceutical manufacturing. 
Key customers are advancing towards the FDA certification required for the use of Valor. We continue to make progress with our development partners, Merck and Pfizer, and shipments are increasing to other major pharmaceutical manufacturers to support their individual drug regulatory filings. Total shipments of Valor Glass increased fourfold compared to 2017, indicating growing progress towards certification across more pharmaceutical companies.
In parallel, we're supporting customers by scaling up our production capabilities on case with market adoption. We brought new capacity online in 2018 and expanded our range of products. We're also progressing with the construction of the new high-volume manufacturing facility in North Carolina that we announced in April.
Finally, industry poll remains favorable. Regulatory concerns about the need for improved glass packaging were highlighted in the lead story of the January PDA letter, reinforcing the need for new solutions such as Valor Glass. In addition, Valor Glass was named one of the top 6 pharmaceutical and medical packaging developments in 2018 by Packaging Digest. We continue to believe Valor has the potential to power Corning's growth to the next decade and beyond. We remain closely engaged with the FDA and support its efforts to address this important public health issue. We look forward to being able to share additional updates soon.
In Display, we're delivering stable returns. During 2018, we extended our global leadership by successfully ramping the world's first Gen 10.5 glass plant. This accomplishment allow us to grow volume faster than the overall market. Also, the Display glass pricing environment continues to improve. 
We reached the important milestone of mid-single-digit year-over-year price declines in the second half of 2018. In fact, 2018 was the best pricing environment in more than a decade. We expect the pricing environment to improve further in 2019 and reach mid-single-digit declines for the full year. We're off to a great start, with first quarter price declines expected to be significantly better than quarter 1 2018 and the best quarter 1 in a decade. Display will continue to execute its proven strategy to deliver stable returns.
So we continue to make significant progress across all our market access platforms. Ultimately, we remain on track to fully achieve our Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework goals. In 2018, we leveraged our investments to meet increased demand from our customers, grow sales and significantly improve profitability in the second half, just as we said we would. 
Looking ahead, we are confident in our ability to deliver sustained performance. We have multiple businesses driving our growth. Our capabilities are becoming increasingly vital to important trends. Our relationships with industry-leading customers are opening new opportunities. And our strategic investments are paying off. We're not only succeeding at building a bigger company. We're building a stronger, more resilient one. We look forward to outlining the next phase of our strategic framework in the coming months.
Now let me turn the call over to Tony for a review of our results and outlook."
173840,597009556,1642139,"Corning Incorporated, Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2019",2019-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Corning Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Wendell, and good morning. We had another outstanding quarter, and our full year results exceeded our expectations. In 2018, we did what we said we were going to do, which was to expand our manufacturing capacity in the first half and begin lev",2011,"Thank you, Wendell, and good morning. We had another outstanding quarter, and our full year results exceeded our expectations. In 2018, we did what we said we were going to do, which was to expand our manufacturing capacity in the first half and begin leveraging those growth investments in the second half. In 2019, we expect to build on this momentum and keep growing across all of our businesses.
Before I get into the details of our performance and results, I want to note that the primary difference between our GAAP and core results is, again, a noncash marked-to-market adjustment for our currency hedge contracts. As we've discussed before, GAAP accounting requires earning translation hedge contracts settling in future periods to be marked-to-market and recorded at current value at the end of each quarter even though those contracts will not be settled in the current quarter. For us, this resulted in an after-tax GAAP loss of $180 million for the fourth quarter. To be clear, this mark-to-market accounting has no impact on our cash flow. 
Our currency hedges protect us economically from foreign exchange rate fluctuations and provide higher certainty for our earnings and cash flow, our ability to invest for growth and our future shareholder distributions. Our non-GAAP, or core results, provides additional transparency into operations by using a constant currency rate aligned with the economics of our underlying transactions. We're very pleased with our hedging program and the economic certainty it provides. We have received $1.7 billion in cash under our hedged contracts since their inception slightly over 5 years ago.
Now, that brings me to our results and outlook. For the fourth quarter, sales were up 15% year-over-year to $3.1 billion, net income rose 18% to $539 million, and EPS is $0.59, up 28%. For the full year, sales were $11.4 billion, and EPS was $1.78, both up 11%. As Wendell noted, this strong growth resulted from customers adopting our innovations and from us factoring the benefits of our capacity investments. As a reminder, our capacity expansion projects in 2018 supported strong committed customer demand across all businesses. These investments include capacity expansion for optical fiber and cable, Gen 10.5 Display glass, gasoline particulate filters and multiple development projects, such as Gorilla Glass for mobile devices and automotive. 
2018 capital spending totaled $2.2 billion. As our new capacity ramped towards full production levels, our sales run rate climbed and our gross margin expanded at 42% in the second half of the year.
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $2.4 billion of cash. Adjusted operating cash flow for the year was $3.2 billion and on track for the cumulative target in the 4-year capital allocation plan.
Now let's look at the detailed segment results and outlook. In Display Technologies, we're delivering stable returns. Our full year sales were $3.3 billion, up 4% year-over-year. Fourth quarter performance was in line with our expectations. Sales were $899 million, and net income was $240 million. 2018 was the best pricing environment in more than a decade. As expected, fourth quarter price declines were very moderate, at a mid-single-digit percentage year-over-year, and even more moderate than Q3. With over 90% of our volume under contract, we expect our full year 2019 price declines to improve further through a mid-single-digit percentage and to be even better than they were in 2018. 
For the first quarter of 2019, we expect sequential price declines to be significantly better than the first quarter of 2018 and be the most favorable first quarter price change in over a decade. 
Now 3 factors continue to drive our view that this favorable pricing environment will continue: first, we expect glass supply to continue to be balanced or even tight. Our new Gen 10.5 plant supports the expected growth of large-sized TVs. It is co-located with, and dedicated to, our customer BOE. We pace and align capacity in tandem with BOE to ensure a Gen 10.5 glass supply is balanced to demand. The ramp is on schedule. We expect the glass supply-demand balance below Gen 10.5 to continue to be tight, as public information indicates there's little capacity growth planned in this segment. Second, our competitors continue to face profitability challenges at current pricing levels. Therefore, we expect their price declines will slow further as they try to remain profitable. And third, display glass manufacturing requires ongoing investment in current capacity to maintain our operations. To generate acceptable returns on investments, glass pricing will need to improve even further. For Corning, we will only add capacity if we can get an attractive return for our shareholders.
In the fourth quarter, Display glass market volume grew low-single digits sequentially and our volume grew faster, as expected, due to the ramp of our Gen 10.5 plant. For the full year, the Display glass market volume increased mid-single digits as expected, driven by growth in TV screen size. We expect mid-single-digit growth again in 2019, also driven by growth in TV screen size. We also expect our volume to grow more than the market once again, resulting from the ramp of our Gen 10.5 plant during that 2018. 
In the first quarter of 2019, we expect the Display glass market to be at mid-single digits year-over-year and our volume to be up significantly more. Sequentially, we expect the market and our volume to decline by a mid-single-digit percentage, consistent with normal seasonality.
In summary, we remain very pleased with the current dynamics in our Display business, including our ability to cash our higher productivity and margin through fleet optimization and the Gen 10.5 ramp. And most importantly, the fact that we are now delivering stable returns.
Let's move to our fastest-growing segment, Optical Communications. Full year sales were $4.2 billion, up 18% for the second consecutive year. The business is on track to surpass its goal of $5 billion in 2020 sales. Net income was up 26% year-over-year. In the fourth quarter, sales exceeded $1 billion for the third consecutive quarter, and we were up 26% over 2017. Net income for the quarter, was up 60% year-over-year. Sales growth for the year and the quarter were driven by multiyear data center and carrier projects, availability of new manufacturing capacity as well as sales from the recently acquired 3M Communication Markets Division. As planned, we are leveraging our capacity investments to drive higher volume and earnings.
Our midyear acquisition of 3M's Communications Market Division contributed about $200 million to 2018 sales. We are pleased with our progress on integrating this acquisition and continue to expect it to be accretive to EPS in 2019. Looking forward, we expect first quarter sales to be up in the low-20% range year-over-year. We expect another year of growth, with full year 2019 sales up low teens. Key growth drivers include customer projects and the full year of sales from the 3M acquisition. 
Our customers, the world's leading network and cloud operators, continue to deploy Corning's optical solutions to densify their 4G, 5G and data center networks. We continue to be very excited about the growth ahead of us.
Environmental Technologies' 2018 sales were $1.3 billion, up 17% year-over-year, driven by growth in all product categories and accelerated by emerging sales of GPFs. Net income grew faster than sales at 26% year-over-year. 2018 GPF sales were more than $50 million, as demand ramp strongly in the second half of the year, primarily in Europe. We are now starting to sell into China with early adoption of China 6 regulations. Dedicated capacity and engineering investments support the ramp of this business. 
Fourth quarter Environmental sales grew 10% year-over-year. Looking to 2019, we expect first quarter sales growth of mid-single digits and full year sales to be up high single digits year-over-year. We expect $150 million of GPF sales in 2019. And we continue to add capacity to meet the additional demand.
In Specialty Materials, 2018 results were strong after an exceptional year of 25% sales growth in 2017. Full year sales rose 5% as OEMs adopted our portfolio of premium glass products. And the use of glass backs double to about 30% of smartphones in 2018. Fourth quarter sales were $399 million, in line with our expectations, and up 2% versus a very strong fourth quarter in 2017, when customers built aggressively to support launch cycles. 
Overall, we are pleased with our performance in Specialty Materials. Our results demonstrate the value of our premium glasses, the strength of our innovation portfolio and the continued adoption of glass smartphone backs. For the first quarter, we expect sales to grow mid- to high single digits year-over-year. We also expect to grow again for the full year despite a mature market. Exactly how much will depend on the adoption rate of our innovations.
In Life Sciences, 2018 sales were $946 million, up 8% year-over-year, with strong fourth quarter sales, as we continue to outpace market growth. Net income was up 23% year-over-year, driven by higher sales volume and manufacturing efficiencies. We expect sales growth to be a low to mid-single-digit percentage year-over-year for the first quarter and full year.
In summary, 2018 was a terrific year. All of our businesses have strong momentum. And we expect another year of sales, gross margin, net income and EPS growth in 2019. We expect 2019 gross margin dollars, in percent, to expand due to the manufacturing capacity that came online in 2018, our improved utilization of that capacity and the strength of our sales growth. The percentage increase will be somewhat muted due to our continuing investments in 2019 to meet committed demand for Optical Communications, GPFs and automotive glass. 
We expect to see the sales and margin benefit that means additional investments start in Q2 and build throughout the remainder of the year. 
In the first quarter, we expect double-digit year-over-year sales, gross margin dollars and net income growth. We expect gross margin percent to improve slightly from Q1 2018. Sequentially, we expect Q1 gross margin dollars and percent to be down due to seasonality in Display and Specialty, as is typical. We expect both to improve in Q2 and to continue climbing throughout the year.
Annual operating expenses should remain consistent with last year as a percentage of sales. For the full year, SG&A is expected to be about 14% of sales, and RD&E between 8% and 8.5%. We expect other income, other operating expenses to be approximately $250 million for the year. Full year of gross equity earnings are expected to be approximately $210 million, predominantly from Hemlock Semiconductor, with the first quarter at approximately $20 million, consistent with typical seasonality. Fourth quarter 2018 gross equity earnings were $152 million.
Our tax rate should be between 21% and 22% for the year and for the quarter. The slide we posted gives you additional modeling-related details for the first quarter and the full year. In 2019, we expect to spend just over $2 billion on capital expenditures with programs in every market access platform. How much more will depend on how quickly we ramp some of our investments. We'll provide more detail as the year progresses.
Finally, I would like to make a couple of comments on the economic environment, in particular, China. First, as we said previously, we do not expect the material impact from the enacted tariffs. Second, we incorporated conservative estimates for China end market demand for TVs and autos in our strong guidance and outlook for 2019. If Chinese demand is better, there's an opportunity for upside.
In closing, 2018 demonstrates that we are delivering on our priorities to grow and extend our leadership. Results were outstanding, with 11% sales growth and second half margin expansion. Our strong guidance reflects the rich set of opportunities ahead of us in 2019 and beyond as we continue to grow faster than the market across all of our businesses. We are also rewarding investors by returning more than $12.5 billion to shareholders, which compounds the benefit of our future growth for long-term shareholders.
With that, let's move to Q&A. Ann?"

So the primary reason we're growing faster in the market really has sort of has 2 layers to it. First of all, you're just seeing new networks being put in place that used to be fiber-poor and because of the requirements in our innovations are going to be fiber-rich. So in a way, for us you can think about is as it's not just more networks, right, but basically it's more us in the network. And that's why you're going to -- you start to see us begin to differentiate from the industry growth. Take something like wireless, as everybody's heard a lot about 4G densification or 5G. Wireless, today, is relatively fiber lean architecture. As you move to the wireless of the future, you end up adding a lot of glass. So as they talk about wireless networks densifying, right, what that really means is they're glassifying. And so if you compare us to others who are already in the wireless market, we were pretty small, but now we're getting pretty big because of our innovations and the requirements, what it is are unique fiber optics expertise offers. You see a similar dynamic happening in data centers, with the continued strong growth really at the percent of the load that's cloud-based, which is then allows -- when you do things like public cloud and in very large private clouds -- you to concentrate much more processing power, right, that is shared across many. That then makes it more economical, since you have that bandwidth all in one place, to start using fiber where you used to use copper. So once again, a substitution of that. Now all of these things are furthered by the dynamic that we have a set of unique innovations in all of those areas that gives us an additional advantage versus other players. So that's why you tend to see the difference. Now that you asked another question which is where do we expect to see the growth here in these coming years. We expect to see it being driven in access networks, especially with an accent on wireless densification. And then, we do expect to see a hyperscale data center business to continue to grow strongly and has now this new concept of sort of more EDGE compute and more EDGE cloud to that also opening up some opportunities for us. So sorry for the long answer, Steven. Does that get it at the core of what you're talking about?"

As it does -- as it increases both the size of our business and the number of different areas that we're doing. The number of different customers that were doing it with and the number of different locations we're building at. So by increasing the number of projects, in a way, it becomes a little smoother, not because the individual projects aren't lumpy -- they are, but that they end up being in slightly different stages at different times. But I am quite sure, at some point, we'll hit a time where -- we'll hit a time where things will go a little lumpier because number of the projects go together."

And what we saw in the second half of the year was the benefit of those things to occur. And you saw it in the fourth quarter results where our profits were up more than our -- the sales were on a year-over-year basis. And so when we've always talked about stabilization, what we talked about is getting to a certain profit level and continuing that on a going-forward basis. And we think that we feel good about the stabilization we saw in the second half. In fact, the fact that we grew profits in the second half and we think that's evidence as the strategy that we have been working on for a number of years really starting to pay off."

And so really even outside smartphones, you see us playing with the same basic approach, which is getting our new innovations adopted in those areas that also allows and adds value. Then you have entirely new device categories like the augmented reality, where you're seeing the potential start to take shape for really significant innovation in a vast new device category. But it's too soon to get too excited about it. There's a time for all the positioning, innovations.

So in Q1, you see some of these investments impacting us. But the main reason why Q1 is down versus Q4 is really the seasonality, not the investment. In terms of China, we were happy with the approach we took in the third and the fourth quarter. It turned out that we're exactly right on both in terms of where the auto production ended up in China and also from a TV standpoint. So we feel good about that. And as we go forward into next year, we're assuming the declines in both of those markets and the strong guidance that I gave you for the year."

And in 2018, the screen size grow -- drove the market growth to the mid-single digits. And that's what we expect to happen again. Now we also benefited a little bit in 2018 where the number of TV units went up. But that's still -- what really matters here is the screen size growth. As we go into 2019, we, again, think the market is going to grow about the mid-single digits and what's driving that is the screen size growth. Now most people looking at the market think the TV unit themselves are going to be flat-to-down a little bit. A lot of that being driven in China. And we've factored that into our projections. But what really drives the market is the screen size growth, and we expect that once again to be in the about mid-single digits. Now, we're growing faster than that because of the Gen 10.5 ramp but you know generally speaking, it's about the mid-single digits. Relative to Specialty Materials, again, what really drives the growth there is the technology adoption of our products, as Wendell would say, having more Corning in those products. Last year, I think most people believed smartphones were down a little bit. That's what they're projecting again for this year, a lot of that being driven in China. But the reason that we're confident that we can be up is because of the adoption of the technologies. How much we're going to be up will depend on the actual timing of that adoption, but we feel pretty good about that."

For the fourth quarter, sales were $3.1 billion, up 15% year-over-year. Net income was $539 million, up 18% year-over-year. And EPS was $0.59",2122,"Thank you, Ann, and good morning, everyone.
This morning, we reported a very strong finish to an excellent 2018. For the fourth quarter, sales were $3.1 billion, up 15% year-over-year. Net income was $539 million, up 18% year-over-year. And EPS was $0.59, up 28% year-over-year. For the full year, sales were $11.4 billion, and EPS was $1.78, both up 11% from 2017. We also delivered on our goal to improve gross margin to 42% in the second half, a significant increase over last year and the first half of 2018.
All of our businesses produced year-over-year sales growth in 2018. Highlights include: Optical Communications sales up 18% for the second consecutive year; Environmental sales up 17%, as the adoption of gasoline particulate filters accelerated; Specialty Materials sales up 5% following an exceptional 2017 growth of 25%; Display sales up 4% as we ramp our new Gen 10.5 facility, and annual price declines reached the important milestone of mid-single digits in the second half. And full year pricing was the best in more than a decade; Life Science sales up 8% as we continue to outpace market growth.
For the past 3 years, we have invested for growth through our Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework. The significant benefits of these investments are evident in our financial performance. In 2018, we built new capacity, launched new products, grew sales by more than $1 billion and extended our leadership position in all businesses. We exited the year with strong execution, expanded margins and great momentum. 
We expect our momentum to continue into 2019 and beyond, and we expect strong year-over-year growth in the first quarter and additional growth in subsequent quarters. In total, we anticipate another strong year for Corning.
We also feel confident that we're well positioned for long-term growth. Important trends, such as 5G and smart cars, connected homes and augmented reality are converging around Corning's unique capabilities. These interconnected ecosystems require technology that have been our fundamental strengths for a decade. Our proprietary manufacturing processes and deep expertise in glass, ceramics and optical physics are more relevant than ever. Overall, we're excited about 2019 and our future opportunities, as Tony will describe in more detail in just a few minutes.
Now let's turn to the Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework. Under the framework, we target generating $26 billion to $30 billion in cash through 2019. We plan to return more than $12.5 billion to our shareholders through repurchases and dividends and to invest $10 billion to extend our leadership and deliver growth. 
As we've discussed within numerous times, we have continued to make great progress for the framework goals we announced in October 2015. As we enter the final year of our plan, we expect to meet our stated goals. Our cash generation is on target. And through the end of 2018, we have returned $11.8 billion to shareholders. We increased dividends per share by 50% since the framework began. Investments in RD&E, capital expenditures and acquisitions also remain on track to our 4-year plan totaling $8.2 billion to the end of 2018.
As outlined in our framework, Corning is best in the world in 3 core technologies, 4 manufacturing and engineering platforms and 5 market access platforms. Our capabilities are interrelated and reinforcing. We focused 80% of our resources on opportunities that use capabilities in at least 2 of these 3 categories. This increases our probability of success, reduces the cost of innovation, creates stronger competitive advantages and most importantly, delights our customers.
Now I'll turn to progress in each of our market access platforms, starting with Optical Communications. Our performance in Optical Communications continues to be outstanding, and we expect to surpass our goal of $5 billion in 2020 sales with further growth beyond. We remain the world leader in passive optical solutions and the only true end-to-end supplier of integrated solutions. 
2018 was an excellent year for our Optical Communications business. Recognition of the value created by our solution and co-innovation approach continues to grow as we secured additional multiyear contracts with industry leaders in the carrier and data center segments, which will add significant sales and profit in 2019 and beyond. This committed demand supports our additional investments in manufacturing capacity.
Another highlight of the year was completing the acquisition of 3M's Communications Markets Division. In addition to bringing us a talented group of employees, it extends our market reach and access to global customers, while expanding our portfolio in rapidly growing optical solutions markets.
Next, we achieved product milestones that demonstrate our long track record of innovation and industry expertise. Our pre-connectorised, fiber to the home solution have passed more than 45 million homes around the world. We introduced products in 2018, such as extreme density cable tailored for next-generation hyperscale data center architectures as well as a fiber that offers significant advantages for high throughput transmission. 
[ All ] products continue to reduce network costs and increase the speed of installations. And we earned industry accolades in multiple customer segments, including data centers and access networks.
Interestingly, beyond the hardware solutions, we've also developed software tools that speed up installation. For example, FiberPass helps accelerate typical installations from weeks to just days. Bruce Furlong, Bell's Vice President of Deployment and Access, described the benefits this way: ""The efficiency and accuracy of the FiberPass solution has contributed to the rapid expansion of Bell's broadband network and our fast-growing Fibe TV and Internet services.""
Our investments in capacity clearly paid off in the second half of 2018, with strong sales growth and even greater growth and profitability. As we turn to 2019, committed demand supports additional investments and will lead to additional growth. Overall, we expect to continue to grow more than twice as fast as the communications infrastructure market.
Now let's turn to Mobile Consumer Electronics, where we are the world leader in glass for smartphones, tablets and emerging categories, like wearables and augmented reality devices. Our goal has been to double Mobile Consumer Electronics sales over the next several years despite a maturing smartphone market, and we've been making significant progress toward that goal. 
Here's how. First, we're capturing more value per device. We extended our leadership in the cover glass market with the launch of Gorilla Glass 6 in July. Leading OEMs are continuing to design our premium glasses into their devices. We expect more than 10 new models with Gorilla Glass 6 to launch throughout this year.
We're not only benefiting from adoption of our premium glasses but also from more glass on each phone. Glass back penetration on smartphones doubled, from 15% in 2017 to 30% in 2018. And we expect continued growth in 2019.
We're also significantly expanding our presence in the aftermarket. As announced this month, we will collaborate with OtterBox, the #1 selling smartphone case brand in the U.S. to introduce the Amplify line of glass screen protectors. This will offer extra protection for consumers and add a third piece of our glass to devices.
Second, we are winning in new and emerging device categories. We launched Corning Gorilla Glass DX and DX+ in July, which provide enhanced antireflective optics and scratch resistance for wearables. These new glass composites are continuing to gain traction in the wearable market, with several launches slated during the first half. We're also partnering with leading consumer electronics makers on augmented reality devices and precise 3D-sensing technology. For example, at CES, we announced an agreement with WaveOptics to help enable sleek augmented reality wearables. The ultra-flat, high-index class that Corning supplies, coupled with our proprietary laser processing and characterization tools, enable optimizing this quality and sleek device form factors. So overall, we're off to a great start to meet our goal: to double sales in Mobile Consumer Electronics.
A quick fun fact, since 2016, smartphone unit sales have been relatively flat. We, however, grew our sales in this space 30% due to our innovations. We'll continue to innovate for our customers, and you'll continue to see more Corning in your devices.
Turning to Automotive market access platforms. Our materials expertise is helping to propel the auto industry into a new era of cleaner cars with enhanced cockpit functionality, connectivity and design. Our objectives are to build on our base business with the gasoline particulate filter opportunity and to launch an automotive glass business. 2018 was an exciting year for both objectives. Our gasoline particulate filter technology makes cars significantly cleaner. We exceeded $50 million in GPF sales in 2018 as European regulations took effect. And we expect more than $150 million in 2019 GPF sales. China will be the next to introduce GPFs, with initial filter sales this year as OEMs prepare for the first phase of China 6 regulations in mid-2020. We are ramping dedicated capacity in China to support a robust pipeline of business resulting from upcoming Chinese regulations.
Next, we experienced strong call for Gorilla Glass for automotive in 2018. We are capitalizing on long-term industry trends to the driving demand for technical glass. At CES, automakers confirmed the trend towards larger, longer, shaped and more integrated displays. We also saw a strong call for Corning's industry-first auto grade glass solutions for automotive interiors, launched exclusively with customers at CES. These new solutions are making it easier and more affordable for automakers to bring curved and flat displays to market. 
In total, we've been awarded more than 55 platforms to-date globally. Demand is materializing faster than we expected, and we are accelerating our investments accordingly.
In our Life Sciences Vessels platform, we continue to make strong progress on the path to a new long-term multi-billion dollar franchise. Valor Glass substantially reduces particle contamination breaks and cracks while significantly increasing throughput. Valor helps protect patients and improve pharmaceutical manufacturing. 
Key customers are advancing towards the FDA certification required for the use of Valor. We continue to make progress with our development partners, Merck and Pfizer, and shipments are increasing to other major pharmaceutical manufacturers to support their individual drug regulatory filings. Total shipments of Valor Glass increased fourfold compared to 2017, indicating growing progress towards certification across more pharmaceutical companies.
In parallel, we're supporting customers by scaling up our production capabilities on case with market adoption. We brought new capacity online in 2018 and expanded our range of products. We're also progressing with the construction of the new high-volume manufacturing facility in North Carolina that we announced in April.
Finally, industry poll remains favorable. Regulatory concerns about the need for improved glass packaging were highlighted in the lead story of the January PDA letter, reinforcing the need for new solutions such as Valor Glass. In addition, Valor Glass was named one of the top 6 pharmaceutical and medical packaging developments in 2018 by Packaging Digest. We continue to believe Valor has the potential to power Corning's growth to the next decade and beyond. We remain closely engaged with the FDA and support its efforts to address this important public health issue. We look forward to being able to share additional updates soon.
In Display, we're delivering stable returns. During 2018, we extended our global leadership by successfully ramping the world's first Gen 10.5 glass plant. This accomplishment allow us to grow volume faster than the overall market. Also, the Display glass pricing environment continues to improve. 
We reached the important milestone of mid-single-digit year-over-year price declines in the second half of 2018. In fact, 2018 was the best pricing environment in more than a decade. We expect the pricing environment to improve further in 2019 and reach mid-single-digit declines for the full year. We're off to a great start, with first quarter price declines expected to be significantly better than quarter 1 2018 and the best quarter 1 in a decade. Display will continue to execute its proven strategy to deliver stable returns.
So we continue to make significant progress across all our market access platforms. Ultimately, we remain on track to fully achieve our Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework goals. In 2018, we leveraged our investments to meet increased demand from our customers, grow sales and significantly improve profitability in the second half, just as we said we would. 
Looking ahead, we are confident in our ability to deliver sustained performance. We have multiple businesses driving our growth. Our capabilities are becoming increasingly vital to important trends. Our relationships with industry-leading customers are opening new opportunities. And our strategic investments are paying off. We're not only succeeding at building a bigger company. We're building a stronger, more resilient one. We look forward to outlining the next phase of our strategic framework in the coming months.
Now let me turn the call over to Tony for a review of our results and outlook."

We had another outstanding quarter, and our full year results exceeded our expectations. In 2018, we did what we said we were going to do, which was to expand our manufacturing capacity in the first half and begin leveraging those growth investments in the second half. In 2019, we expect to build on this momentum and keep growing across all of our businesses.
Before I get into the details of our performance and results, I want to note that the primary difference between our GAAP and core results is, again, a noncash marked-to-market adjustment for our currency hedge contracts. As we've discussed before, GAAP accounting requires earning translation hedge contracts settling in future periods to be marked-to-market and recorded at current value at the end of each quarter even though those contracts will not be settled in the current quarter. For us, this resulted in an after-tax GAAP loss of $180 million for the fourth quarter. To be clear, this mark-to-market accounting has no impact on our cash flow. 
Our currency hedges protect us economically from foreign exchange rate fluctuations and provide higher certainty for our earnings and cash flow, our ability to invest for growth and our future shareholder distributions. Our non-GAAP, or core results, provides additional transparency into operations by using a constant currency rate aligned with the economics of our underlying transactions. We're very pleased with our hedging program and the economic certainty it provides. We have received $1.7 billion in cash under our hedged contracts since their inception slightly over 5 years ago.
Now, that brings me to our results and outlook. For the fourth quarter, sales were up 15% year-over-year to $3.1 billion, net income rose 18% to $539 million, and EPS is $0.59, up 28%. For the full year, sales were $11.4 billion, and EPS was $1.78, both up 11%. As Wendell noted, this strong growth resulted from customers adopting our innovations and from us factoring the benefits of our capacity investments. As a reminder, our capacity expansion projects in 2018 supported strong committed customer demand across all businesses. These investments include capacity expansion for optical fiber and cable, Gen 10.5 Display glass, gasoline particulate filters and multiple development projects, such as Gorilla Glass for mobile devices and automotive. 
2018 capital spending totaled $2.2 billion. As our new capacity ramped towards full production levels, our sales run rate climbed and our gross margin expanded at 42% in the second half of the year.
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $2.4 billion of cash. Adjusted operating cash flow for the year was $3.2 billion and on track for the cumulative target in the 4-year capital allocation plan.
Now let's look at the detailed segment results and outlook. In Display Technologies, we're delivering stable returns. Our full year sales were $3.3 billion, up 4% year-over-year. Fourth quarter performance was in line with our expectations. Sales were $899 million, and net income was $240 million. 2018 was the best pricing environment in more than a decade. As expected, fourth quarter price declines were very moderate, at a mid-single-digit percentage year-over-year, and even more moderate than Q3. With over 90% of our volume under contract, we expect our full year 2019 price declines to improve further through a mid-single-digit percentage and to be even better than they were in 2018. 
For the first quarter of 2019, we expect sequential price declines to be significantly better than the first quarter of 2018 and be the most favorable first quarter price change in over a decade. 
Now 3 factors continue to drive our view that this favorable pricing environment will continue: first, we expect glass supply to continue to be balanced or even tight. Our new Gen 10.5 plant supports the expected growth of large-sized TVs. It is co-located with, and dedicated to, our customer BOE. We pace and align capacity in tandem with BOE to ensure a Gen 10.5 glass supply is balanced to demand. The ramp is on schedule. We expect the glass supply-demand balance below Gen 10.5 to continue to be tight, as public information indicates there's little capacity growth planned in this segment. Second, our competitors continue to face profitability challenges at current pricing levels. Therefore, we expect their price declines will slow further as they try to remain profitable. And third, display glass manufacturing requires ongoing investment in current capacity to maintain our operations. To generate acceptable returns on investments, glass pricing will need to improve even further. For Corning, we will only add capacity if we can get an attractive return for our shareholders.
In the fourth quarter, Display glass market volume grew low-single digits sequentially and our volume grew faster, as expected, due to the ramp of our Gen 10.5 plant. For the full year, the Display glass market volume increased mid-single digits as expected, driven by growth in TV screen size. We expect mid-single-digit growth again in 2019, also driven by growth in TV screen size. We also expect our volume to grow more than the market once again, resulting from the ramp of our Gen 10.5 plant during that 2018. 
In the first quarter of 2019, we expect the Display glass market to be at mid-single digits year-over-year and our volume to be up significantly more. Sequentially, we expect the market and our volume to decline by a mid-single-digit percentage, consistent with normal seasonality.
In summary, we remain very pleased with the current dynamics in our Display business, including our ability to cash our higher productivity and margin through fleet optimization and the Gen 10.5 ramp. And most importantly, the fact that we are now delivering stable returns.
Let's move to our fastest-growing segment, Optical Communications. Full year sales were $4.2 billion, up 18% for the second consecutive year. The business is on track to surpass its goal of $5 billion in 2020 sales. Net income was up 26% year-over-year. In the fourth quarter, sales exceeded $1 billion for the third consecutive quarter, and we were up 26% over 2017. Net income for the quarter, was up 60% year-over-year. Sales growth for the year and the quarter were driven by multiyear data center and carrier projects, availability of new manufacturing capacity as well as sales from the recently acquired 3M Communication Markets Division. As planned, we are leveraging our capacity investments to drive higher volume and earnings.
Our midyear acquisition of 3M's Communications Market Division contributed about $200 million to 2018 sales. We are pleased with our progress on integrating this acquisition and continue to expect it to be accretive to EPS in 2019. Looking forward, we expect first quarter sales to be up in the low-20% range year-over-year. We expect another year of growth, with full year 2019 sales up low teens. Key growth drivers include customer projects and the full year of sales from the 3M acquisition. 
Our customers, the world's leading network and cloud operators, continue to deploy Corning's optical solutions to densify their 4G, 5G and data center networks. We continue to be very excited about the growth ahead of us.
Environmental Technologies' 2018 sales were $1.3 billion, up 17% year-over-year, driven by growth in all product categories and accelerated by emerging sales of GPFs. Net income grew faster than sales at 26% year-over-year. 2018 GPF sales were more than $50 million, as demand ramp strongly in the second half of the year, primarily in Europe. We are now starting to sell into China with early adoption of China 6 regulations. Dedicated capacity and engineering investments support the ramp of this business. 
Fourth quarter Environmental sales grew 10% year-over-year. Looking to 2019, we expect first quarter sales growth of mid-single digits and full year sales to be up high single digits year-over-year. We expect $150 million of GPF sales in 2019. And we continue to add capacity to meet the additional demand.
In Specialty Materials, 2018 results were strong after an exceptional year of 25% sales growth in 2017. Full year sales rose 5% as OEMs adopted our portfolio of premium glass products. And the use of glass backs double to about 30% of smartphones in 2018. Fourth quarter sales were $399 million, in line with our expectations, and up 2% versus a very strong fourth quarter in 2017, when customers built aggressively to support launch cycles. 
Overall, we are pleased with our performance in Specialty Materials. Our results demonstrate the value of our premium glasses, the strength of our innovation portfolio and the continued adoption of glass smartphone backs. For the first quarter, we expect sales to grow mid- to high single digits year-over-year. We also expect to grow again for the full year despite a mature market. Exactly how much will depend on the adoption rate of our innovations.
In Life Sciences, 2018 sales were $946 million, up 8% year-over-year, with strong fourth quarter sales, as we continue to outpace market growth. Net income was up 23% year-over-year, driven by higher sales volume and manufacturing efficiencies. We expect sales growth to be a low to mid-single-digit percentage year-over-year for the first quarter and full year.
In summary, 2018 was a terrific year. All of our businesses have strong momentum. And we expect another year of sales, gross margin, net income and EPS growth in 2019. We expect 2019 gross margin dollars, in percent, to expand due to the manufacturing capacity that came online in 2018, our improved utilization of that capacity and the strength of our sales growth. The percentage increase will be somewhat muted due to our continuing investments in 2019 to meet committed demand for Optical Communications, GPFs and automotive glass. 
We expect to see the sales and margin benefit that means additional investments start in Q2 and build throughout the remainder of the year. 
In the first quarter, we expect double-digit year-over-year sales, gross margin dollars and net income growth. We expect gross margin percent to improve slightly from Q1 2018. Sequentially, we expect Q1 gross margin dollars and percent to be down due to seasonality in Display and Specialty, as is typical. We expect both to improve in Q2 and to continue climbing throughout the year.
Annual operating expenses should remain consistent with last year as a percentage of sales. For the full year, SG&A is expected to be about 14% of sales, and RD&E between 8% and 8.5%. We expect other income, other operating expenses to be approximately $250 million for the year. Full year of gross equity earnings are expected to be approximately $210 million, predominantly from Hemlock Semiconductor, with the first quarter at approximately $20 million, consistent with typical seasonality. Fourth quarter 2018 gross equity earnings were $152 million.
Our tax rate should be between 21% and 22% for the year and for the quarter. The slide we posted gives you additional modeling-related details for the first quarter and the full year. In 2019, we expect to spend just over $2 billion on capital expenditures with programs in every market access platform. How much more will depend on how quickly we ramp some of our investments. We'll provide more detail as the year progresses.
Finally, I would like to make a couple of comments on the economic environment, in particular, China. First, as we said previously, we do not expect the material impact from the enacted tariffs. Second, we incorporated conservative estimates for China end market demand for TVs and autos in our strong guidance and outlook for 2019. If Chinese demand is better, there's an opportunity for upside.
In closing, 2018 demonstrates that we are delivering on our priorities to grow and extend our leadership. Results were outstanding, with 11% sales growth and second half margin expansion. Our strong guidance reflects the rich set of opportunities ahead of us in 2019 and beyond as we continue to grow faster than the market across all of our businesses. We are also rewarding investors by returning more than $12.5 billion to shareholders, which compounds the benefit of our future growth for long-term shareholders.
With that, let's move to Q&A. Ann?"

So the primary reason we're growing faster in the market really has sort of has 2 layers to it. First of all, you're just seeing new networks being put in place that used to be fiber-poor and because of the requirements in our innovations are going to be fiber-rich. So in a way, for us you can think about is as it's not just more networks, right, but basically it's more us in the network. And that's why you're going to -- you start to see us begin to differentiate from the industry growth. Take something like wireless, as everybody's heard a lot about 4G densification or 5G. Wireless, today, is relatively fiber lean architecture. As you move to the wireless of the future, you end up adding a lot of glass. So as they talk about wireless networks densifying, right, what that really means is they're glassifying. And so if you compare us to others who are already in the wireless market, we were pretty small, but now we're getting pretty big because of our innovations and the requirements, what it is are unique fiber optics expertise offers. You see a similar dynamic happening in data centers, with the continued strong growth really at the percent of the load that's cloud-based, which is then allows -- when you do things like public cloud and in very large private clouds -- you to concentrate much more processing power, right, that is shared across many. That then makes it more economical, since you have that bandwidth all in one place, to start using fiber where you used to use copper. So once again, a substitution of that. Now all of these things are furthered by the dynamic that we have a set of unique innovations in all of those areas that gives us an additional advantage versus other players. So that's why you tend to see the difference. Now that you asked another question which is where do we expect to see the growth here in these coming years. We expect to see it being driven in access networks, especially with an accent on wireless densification. And then, we do expect to see a hyperscale data center business to continue to grow strongly and has now this new concept of sort of more EDGE compute and more EDGE cloud to that also opening up some opportunities for us. So sorry for the long answer, Steven. Does that get it at the core of what you're talking about?"

As it does -- as it increases both the size of our business and the number of different areas that we're doing. The number of different customers that were doing it with and the number of different locations we're building at. So by increasing the number of projects, in a way, it becomes a little smoother, not because the individual projects aren't lumpy -- they are, but that they end up being in slightly different stages at different times. But I am quite sure, at some point, we'll hit a time where -- we'll hit a time where things will go a little lumpier because number of the projects go together."

And you saw it in the fourth quarter results where our profits were up more than our -- the sales were on a year-over-year basis. And so when we've always talked about stabilization, what we talked about is getting to a certain profit level and continuing that on a going-forward basis.

In fact, the fact that we grew profits in the second half and we think that's evidence as the strategy that we have been working on for a number of years really starting to pay off."

And so really even outside smartphones, you see us playing with the same basic approach, which is getting our new innovations adopted in those areas that also allows and adds value. Then you have entirely new device categories like the augmented reality, where you're seeing the potential start to take shape for really significant innovation in a vast new device category. But it's too soon to get too excited about it. There's a time for all the positioning, innovations.

And we expect, going forward, continued strong margin performance, both in dollars and the percentages, but those get somewhat muted by investments that we're making. And the good news is those investments are for committed growth in Optical Communications, GPF and in auto glass. And we're going to start seeing those investments starting in Q2, the benefits of those investments and it's going to expand from there. And in any given quarter, trends are going to be impacted by seasonality of our businesses, like it is in the first quarter, by the various mixes that we have in the businesses. But we're happy with our each of our businesses' performances as they're the best in the industries. And also, just like the total impact of these investments. So in Q1, you see some of these investments impacting us. But the main reason why Q1 is down versus Q4 is really the seasonality, not the investment. In terms of China, we were happy with the approach we took in the third and the fourth quarter. It turned out that we're exactly right on both in terms of where the auto production ended up in China and also from a TV standpoint. So we feel good about that.

Now we also benefited a little bit in 2018 where the number of TV units went up. But that's still -- what really matters here is the screen size growth. As we go into 2019, we, again, think the market is going to grow about the mid-single digits and what's driving that is the screen size growth. Now most people looking at the market think the TV unit themselves are going to be flat-to-down a little bit. A lot of that being driven in China. And we've factored that into our projections. But what really drives the market is the screen size growth, and we expect that once again to be in the about mid-single digits. Now, we're growing faster than that because of the Gen 10.5 ramp but you know generally speaking, it's about the mid-single digits. Relative to Specialty Materials, again, what really drives the growth there is the technology adoption of our products, as Wendell would say, having more Corning in those products. Last year, I think most people believed smartphones were down a little bit. That's what they're projecting again for this year, a lot of that being driven in China. But the reason that we're confident that we can be up is because of the adoption of the technologies. How much we're going to be up will depend on the actual timing of that adoption, but we feel pretty good about that."

We tend not to think about it so much as share, as what's happening is with this constant move to larger sized TVs and this new Gen 10.5 plants that are getting built, when those happen, we co-locate and build the Gen 10.5 glass plant with our customer. And since those plants have a much lower cost platform for overall wireless television panels, what we expect of that category of Gen 10.5 to take more and more of the market.

This morning, we reported excellent results that position us for another year of strong growth. For the first quarter, sales were $2.9 billion, up 13% year-over-year. Net income was $365 million, up 22% year-ove",1589,"Thank you, Ann, and good morning, everyone. This morning, we reported excellent results that position us for another year of strong growth. For the first quarter, sales were $2.9 billion, up 13% year-over-year. Net income was $365 million, up 22% year-over-year. And EPS was $0.40, up 29% year-over-year. 4 of our 5 segments achieved double-digit sales growth year-over-year. 
Highlights included that Optical Communications continued to outpace the market with sales up 20%; Environmental Technologies delivered 12% sales growth, driven by accelerating adoption of our gasoline particulate filters; Specialty Materials sales were up 11% on the strength of Gorilla Glass and our other innovations; Life Science sales were up 5% as the business continues to benefit from its leadership in cell culture vessels; Display continues to deliver stable returns with first quarter sales and net income, up double digits year-over-year and the best first quarter pricing environment in well over a decade. 
These results keep us on track to deliver the growth and shareholder returns we designed into the 4-year Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework introduced in October of 2015. We targeted returning more than $12.5 billion to our shareholders through our repurchases and dividends while investing $10 billion to extend our leadership and deliver growth. We continue to make great progress, and we expect to meet all our stated goals. 
Our cash generation is on target. Through the first quarter of 2019, we have returned $12.3 billion to shareholders, reducing outstanding shares by approximately 37%. And we've increased dividends per share by 67% since the Framework began, including an 11% increase in February. 
Our investments in our RD&E, capital expenditures and acquisitions are also on track, totaling $8.8 billion through first quarter 2019. 
Now let's take a closer look at our progress in each of our market access platforms, starting with Optical Communications. Our performance in Optical Communications continues to be outstanding. We remain on track to surpass our goal of $5 billion in 2020 sales. We're growing faster than the overall market as our unique co-innovation model continues to deliver the right product at the right time for the right customer. 
Our first quarter results reflect our progress with 20% sales growth. We continue to earn recognition around the world for our stream of product and technology innovations that reduce network costs and increase the speed of installations. For example, in the first quarter, Lightwave Innovation reviews recognized 2 of our solutions in extreme high density cable, which make hyperscale data center fiber deployment up to 30% faster, and a surface-mounted in-home fiber connection solution that is not only fast and easy to install but also integrate seamlessly into the decor because its transparency renders it essentially invisible. This product is among the innovations added to Corning's portfolio through our 2018 acquisition of 3M's Communication Markets Division. 
At the Global Conference OFC in March, we demonstrated that our EDGE 8 solution provides data center operators with a simple migration path to 400G transmission speeds and beyond. This helps them stay ahead of requirements for emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence. We were first for 100G and we'll be first for 400 as well. 
March also marked the introduction of the new Corning Technology Center Montréal. The center will serve as Corning's global home for software solutions for telecommunications networks and will support emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, augmented reality, cloud computing and data analytics. The center will eventually become a hub for software innovation across all of Corning's business segments. And we're off to a strong start as 2 major North American service providers are now using our software for their fiber to the home installation and maintenance.
Overall, recognition of the value created by our solutions and co-innovation approach continues to grow, and that results in our Optical Communications sales growing faster than the market. 
Now let's turn to Mobile Consumer Electronics where we are the world leader in glass for smartphones, tablets and emerging categories like wearables and augmented reality devices. Our goal has been to double Mobile Consumer Electronics sales over the next several years despite a maturing smartphone market. And we continue making significant progress toward that goal with steady adoption of our premium glass and the other innovative solutions we offer for smartphones, laptops, tablets and wearables. We launched our Amplify line of glass screen protectors on OtterBox.com and in more than 1,600 corporate-owned Verizon stores in the United States. Amplify screen protectors provide a new channel for Corning to capture an additional piece of high-value glass on smartphones. Our strategy combines the best screen protector glass with the #1 selling smartphone case brand in the United States.
In the first quarter, we also continued our success in emerging regions with multiple device launches featuring Gorilla Glass in India and Turkey. 
Overall, we're making great progress on our goal to double sales in Mobile Consumer Electronics. We expect continued momentum throughout the year as we look forward to more new device announcements. And we'll continue to innovate for our customers, and you'll continue to see more Corning in your devices.
Turning to the automotive market access platform. Our core technologies are helping to propel the auto industry into a new era of cleaner cars with enhanced cockpit functionality, connectivity and design. Our objectives are to grow our Environmental business by continuing to win in gasoline particulate filters, and to launch a disruptive automotive glass business. We're off to a great start in 2019 on both objectives. 
Our gasoline particulate filter technology makes cars significantly cleaner, and it increases our sales opportunity per car by a factor of 3 to 4. We continue to see strong GPF sales in the first quarter as European regulations are in full effect and China demand is materializing earlier than expected. And we continue to win the majority of platforms with our industry-leading solutions.
We now expect to exceed our goal of delivering $150 million in 2019 GPF sales and we're investing more to capture accelerating demand. We also continue to demonstrate our ongoing leadership in the industry with a Daimler supplier award that recognizes our collaborative development of next-gen emissions control solutions.
Next, excitement about Corning Gorilla Glass for automotive continues to grow as the industry transitions to highly connected and autonomous vehicles that use technical glass. Customers have validated their desire for Corning's technical glass solutions by awarding us hundreds of millions of dollars in our automotive glass pipeline. Our new and industry first auto-grade glass solutions are making it easier and more affordable for automakers to bring curved and flat displays to market. To service the growing pipeline for our solutions, a dedicated manufacturing facility in [ Hefei ] China, is expected to begin ramping in the third quarter this year.
In our Life Sciences Vessels platform, we continue to make strong progress on the path to a new long-term multibillion dollar franchise. Valor Glass substantially reduces particle contamination, breaks and cracks while significantly increasing throughput. Valor helps protect patients and improve pharmaceutical manufacturing. We're making headway with our development partners, Merck and Pfizer, and our interaction with regulators has been favorable.
We also continued improvement on-site research with a number of customers at their facilities where we completed in-depth validation and fielding live studies that reinforce our progress towards certification. What this means, in essence, is that various customers are doing test runs of our Valor Glass vials on their lines. They're confirming that it's viable on their machines and that it provides the value we described. They're documenting first-hand how significantly Valor Glass will increase their throughput. 
We're getting ready for adoption of Valor Glass by scaling up our production capabilities. We brought new capacity online in 2018 and expanded our radiation of products. We're also progressing with the construction of the new high-volume manufacturing facility in North Carolina that we announced last year. Although this market is slow to adopt new technologies, we continue to invest and make encouraging progress.
In Display, we're delivering stable returns consistent with our goal. First quarter sales and net income were both up year-over-year, with the most favorable first quarter sequential price declines in well over a decade. And we expect continued progress. Full year 2019 price declines are expected to improve further to a mid-single-digit percentage and to be better than in 2018. Our first in the world Gen 10.5 glass facility is ramping to support the expected growth of large-sized TVs, allowing us to grow faster than the overall market. Overall, Display will continue to execute its proven strategy to deliver stable returns.
These examples demonstrate significant progress across all our market access platforms. Ultimately, we remain on track to fully achieve our Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework goals. Looking ahead, we are confident in our ability to deliver sustained performance. We have multiple businesses driving our growth. Our capabilities are becoming increasingly vital to important trends. Our relationships with industry-leading customers are opening new opportunities. We continue to invest in capabilities and capacity that will create substantial additional growth, and you can see the benefits of these investments in our recent results. We're not only succeeding at building a bigger company. We're building a stronger, more resilient one. We look forward to outlining the next phase of our strategic framework in the coming once and we'll unpack some of the opportunities that I've discussed today in more detail at our Investor Day on June 14.
Now let me turn the call over to Tony for a review of our results and outlook."
173840,608377234,1712658,"Corning Incorporated, Q1 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2019",2019-04-30,"Earnings Calls","Corning Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Wendell, and good morning. We had another outstanding quarter. We grew sales 13% year-over-year with every business segment growing. We also grew net income 22% and earnings per share 29%, all while continuing to invest for even more sales grow",1936,"Thank you, Wendell, and good morning. We had another outstanding quarter. We grew sales 13% year-over-year with every business segment growing. We also grew net income 22% and earnings per share 29%, all while continuing to invest for even more sales growth this year and beyond.
Now before I get into the details of our performance and results, I want to note that the primary difference between our GAAP and core results is, again, a noncash mark-to-market adjustment for our currency hedge contracts. As we discussed before, GAAP accounting requires earning translation hedge contracts settling in future periods to be mark-to-market and recorded at current value at the end of each quarter even though those contracts will not be settled in the current quarter. For us, this resulted in an after-tax GAAP gain of $138 million in Q1. Now to be clear, this mark-to-market accounting has no impact on our cash flow. Our currency hedges protect us economically from foreign exchange rate fluctuations and provide higher certainty for our earnings and cash flow, our ability to invest for growth and our future shareholder distributions. Our non-GAAP or core results provide additional transparency into operations by using a constant currency rate aligned with the economics of our underlying transactions.
We're very pleased with our hedging program and the economic certainty it provides. We received $1.7 billion in cash under our hedged contracts since their inceptions more than 5 years ago.
Now that brings me to our results and outlook. For the first quarter, sales were up 13% year-over-year to $2.9 billion, net income rose 22% to $365 million and EPS was $0.40, up 29%. As Wendell noted, our strong growth results from our technology and manufacturing leadership. We are benefiting from recent investments, including capacity expansions for optical fiber and cable, Gen 10.5 display glass, gasoline particulate filters and multiple development projects such as Gorilla Glass for mobile devices and automotive. We are very pleased with how these investments are playing out, and we're continuing to invest. Throughout the year, additional manufacturing plants will come online, creating capacity for committed demand and driving additional sales growth in 2019 and beyond. Capital spending in Q1 totaled $524 million and we expect to spend just over $2 billion in 2019, with programs in every market access platform.
Now let's look at the detailed segment results and outlook. In Display Technologies, our goal is to stabilize returns, and we had a very strong quarter. First quarter sales were $818 million, up 10%, and net income was up 12% year-over-year. First quarter sequential glass price declines were more moderate than we expected and the most favorable first quarter in well over a decade. Second quarter sequential price declines are expected to remain moderate as well. With all of our volume under contract, we expect our full year 2019 price declines to improve further to a mid-single-digit percentage and be even better than they were in 2018. 
Now 3 factors continue to drive our view that this pricing environment will continue. First, we expect glass supply to be continue to be balanced or even tight. Our Gen 10.5 plant supports expected growth of large-sized TVs. It is colocated with and dedicated to our customer BOE. We pace and align capacity in tandem with BOE to ensure our Gen 10.5 glass supply is balanced to demand. That ramp remains on schedule. We expect the glass supply demand balance below Gen 10.5 to continue to be tight as public information indicates there is little capacity growth planned in this segment.
Second, our competitors continue to face profitability challenges at current pricing levels therefore, we expect their price declines will slow further as they try to remain profitable. 
And third display glass manufacturing requires ongoing investment in current capacity to maintain operations. To generate acceptable returns on investments, glass price declines will need to improve even further. For Corning, we will only add capacity if we can get an attractive return for our shareholders.
In the first quarter, the display glass market grew mid-single digits year-over-year and our volume grew significantly faster as we expected due to the ramp of our Gen 10.5 plant. In the second quarter of 2019, we expect the display glass market to be up mid-single digits year-over-year and our volume to be up significantly more, again due to the Gen 10.5 ramp. Sequentially, we expect the market and our volume to increase by a mid-single-digit percentage, consistent with normal seasonality. For the full year, we continue to expect the display glass market volume to grow mid-single digits, driven by TV screen size growth. We expect our volume to grow faster than the market, again resulting from the ramp of our Gen 10.5 facility.
In summary, we remain very pleased with the current dynamics in our Display business, including our ability to capture Gen 10.5 glass growth and deliver stable returns. 
Let's move to our fastest-growing segment, Optical Communications. The business is on track to surpass its goal of $5 billion of sales in 2020 with further growth beyond. In the first quarter, sales were $1.1 billion and we're up 20% over last year. Net income for the quarter increased 30% year-over-year. Sales growth in this segment is driven by multiyear data center and carrier projects, as well as sales from the recently acquired 3M's communications market division. As planned, we are leveraging our capacity investments to deliver higher volume and earnings.
Our 2019 outlook has been impacted by a major fiber to the home customer shifting its deployment from homes passed to homes connected in quarter 2, not quarter 3 as originally anticipated. This will impact sales by about $100 million. As a result, we now expect our full year sales growth to be up about 10%, which is revised from the low teens guidance we provided last quarter, but still well ahead of the market. For the second quarter, we expect sales to grow high single digits year-over-year, driven by strong data center, fiber and cable growth. Overall, demand for our fiber, cable and connectivity solutions remained strong. Our customers, the world's leading network cloud operators, continue to deploy Corning's optical solutions to densify their 4G, 5G and data center networks. We continue to outpace the competition and we're very excited about the growth ahead of us.
Environmental Technologies' first quarter sales were $362 million, up 12% year-over-year. Net income grew 6%. We are well on our way to building a $500 million gasoline particulate filter business. European regulations are in full effect and automakers in China are preparing for full China 6 implementation in 2020. The market appears to be developing faster, and we are winning more platforms than we anticipated. As a result, we are accelerating our investments and we are raising our short- and long-term sales targets we now expect GPS sales to exceed $150 million in 2019, and to grow robustly thereafter.
China is also considering early implementation of its heavy-duty regulations as part of their Blue Sky initiative. This could further increase both our investment and our sales opportunity. We will have more clarity on the exact timing and impact by the end of quarter 2.
As we invest to capture the opportunities I just described, it mutes our profitability somewhat in the short term but will result in greater sales and profit growth in the medium and long term. Based on our accelerating demand, we now expect full year sales to be up 10%, or slightly more, versus our prior expectations of high single-digit growth. We also expect second quarter sales to be up about 10% year-over-year.
In Specialty Materials, first quarter performance was strong. First quarter sales were $309 million, up 11% year-over-year and driven by continued strong demand for the company's portfolio of Mobile Consumer Electronics glass solutions. Net income grew 7% year-over-year. For the second quarter, we expect sales to grow high single digits year-over-year. We continue to expect to grow again in 2019 despite a maturing smartphone market. Exactly how much will depend on the adoption rate of our innovations. Our results and outlook demonstrate the value of our premium glasses and the strength of our innovation portfolio.
In Life Sciences, we continue to outpace market growth. First quarter sales were $243 million, up 5% year-over-year. Net income was up 15% year-over-year. We expect both second quarter and full year sales growth of low to mid-single digits year-over-year.
In summary, we had an excellent first quarter with strong performance across the company. The benefits of our recent investments are evident in our results. All of our businesses have solid momentum and we expect continued sales growth through 2019.
For the second quarter, we expect year-over-year growth with sales up by a high single-digit percentage, operating margin up 75 basis points and EPS up by a mid-teen percentage. 
As both Wendell and I described earlier, we continue to invest in all of our businesses. We are increasing capacity utilization in plants that came online in 2018 and at the same time, we're building new plants including facilities for GPS and auto glass finishing. While we build, start up, ramp and optimize those facilities, associated costs offset some of the normal leverage on our gross margin line. As the commitments from and to our customers increase so does the piece of our work on the manufacturing floor. As a result, the offset to our gross margin line is slightly higher than we anticipated a quarter ago. As sales grow significantly in the second quarter, we expect our gross margin dollars to also grow significantly, both sequentially and year-over-year. We expect our Q2 gross margin percentage to be slightly better than Q1. 
Now similar to last year, we expect our gross margin percentage in the second half to improve versus the first half as we utilized ramping capacity to meet committed demand. Depending on the pace of facility startup and optimization, we now expect our second half gross margin percentage to be between 41% and 42%. For your modeling purposes, we expect the 2019 operating margin percent to be greater than 2018. 
Now moving to additional outlook details. We expect other income other expense to be approximately $250 million for the full year. Full year gross equity earnings are expected to be approximately $210 million predominantly from Hemlock Semiconductor with the second quarter at approximately $20 million to $25 million versus the first quarter 2019 gross equity earnings of $26 million. We expect our effective tax rate for 2019 to be approximately 20%, consistent with Q1. 
Now finally, I'd like to make a couple of comments on the economic environment, in particular China. First, as we said previously, we do not expect a material impact from the enacted tariffs. Second, we incorporated conservative estimates for China end market demand for TVs and autos in our strong guidance and outlook for 2019. If Chinese demand is better, there is an opportunity for upside. 
In closing, we're off to an excellent start in Q1. We are benefiting from our recent investments and we are delighted with the customer reactions to our innovations. We welcome the opportunity to invest and continue delivering strong sales and earnings growth for our shareholders. Our strong guidance reflects the rich set of opportunities ahead of us in 2019 and beyond as we continue to grow faster than the market across all of our businesses. We are within striking distance of fully delivering on the Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework and I look forward to sharing our exciting longer-term outlook on June 14.
With that, let's move to Q&A. Ann?"

In terms of the sales adjustment, I think it's pretty straightforward. We have one fiber to the home customer that we expected to shift its deployments from homes pass to homes connected in Q3 and it's actually starting in Q2. So that impact sales of about $100 million and it means we'll be up around 10% in sales versus low teens, but that's still a lot faster than the market's growing. So we feel good about that. And in terms of the margin profile, yes, we'd see the opportunity to expand margins. Part of it is that just like all of our other businesses, we've been investing in this business. And as we ramp capacity in those businesses, you expect market the improve. And then the second thing is we're offering a lot of great innovations to our customers and with those innovations help save them money and also give us an opportunity to provide solutions in some of our technologies and that's good from a margin standpoint, too."

I think if you go back and look at our cash flow cycle for the last several years, I mean actually we're probably longer than that, we always start off with Q1 being our lowest cash flow cycle and we grow robustly throughout the year. And that's exactly what we expect to happen in 2019. And the reason for that is that we kind of wind down a lot of our sales in the fourth quarter, especially as we enter December and we wind them up in the first quarter, especially as we get to the month of March. And so you have significant change in working capital in those 2 periods. And then in addition to that, we have some of our payments like our incentive payments get paid out in the first quarter. So they improve during the year but they get paid out in the first quarter. And we expect exactly that similar cycle to continue in 2019. Now I think if you go back and look at you'll see that same cycle last year. Last year did have some incentive payments that happened in the first quarter. So it was a little bit higher than what it was the first quarter this year. But the cycle is exactly the same. We're certainly on track we said we were going to do on a 4-year standpoint in the capital allocation framework."

I think the news in this call is the investments that mute our gross margin percentage are going to be a little bit higher than we thought a quarter ago. In particular, in the second quarter, as both Wendell and I talked about, we see GPS accelerating. The market is appearing to develop faster and we're winning more of those platforms. And so that clearly is having an impact on second quarter gross margin. In Specialty Materials, we're investing now in some innovations that our customers are going to introduce into the back half of the curiously as they launch new products and so that's occurring in the second quarter. And then in the auto glass factory, we're beginning to put that together because we're having good success in that market. As you know, we introduced the auto-grade glass earlier this year and so we need to be prepared for what happens with sales probably in the fourth quarter may be in the first quarter but it takes a few months the ramp-up in advance of that. And then in the back half of the year besides those kinds of opportunities, exactly where we end up with the Blue Sky initiative and the diesel factory will just depend on exactly where things end up in the back half of the year. But from an overall standpoint, I mean we're really happy with this. We consider this all to be good news. It's going to drive both short- and near-term growth and on top of that, our operating margin is expanding. And so we end up actually with more of our revenue dollars to the bottom line, and that makes a CFO very happy."

This saves just a ton of money and is really, we believe, going to put us in a position to extremely well in the industry.

Instead, we're just talking about how fast we continue to grow. And that is a really interesting spot where we've tried to engineer and has happened and we will still feel as our different customers do big civil works projects at different times, right, how much growth that we have. But the big megatrend here is that you're seeing densification enter into the wireless network, enter into the cloud computing network and densification means glassification.

I'd say in automotive interiors, it's going faster than we anticipated. We thought we had a pretty good understanding of the automotive market access platform because we've been in it for so long and we felt it was going to be relatively slow for our advanced glass solutions just because of the way that industry works. We've actually gotten a positive surprise by how quickly people are pulling on our interior solutions and how excited they are about some of our new cost advantage solutions. So as a result, we accelerated our investment to bring up a dedicated facility to do these large area glass parts with various optical treatments that we had to our vapor deposition platforms. So there, it's gone faster and we're sort of playing catch up with the supply chain not because anybody else is ahead of us but because we have so much pull. So the way that sort of doubling down was a positive surprise surveyor. Valor, I say is moving in a very stately pace, okay? In this industry, as you know, if you follow it, adopting new technologies tends to be slow. It's a highly regulated industry. And because margins tend to be quite high in the industry, there tends to be a relatively slow move of gravity towards new solutions because they're quite profitable where they are. That being said, we are seeing just tremendous amount of excitement from our customers, especially because of the opportunity to provide more out of existing facilities. And if you follow the industry, you're going to see many reports of drug shortages and inability to get enough vaccines and inability to provide enough of lifesaving medicines. And where we're really getting very strong pull, as fast as we can adopt it tends to be in those areas where they're missing revenues and endangering patients' lives by inability people supply with a capital platform that they have. So with Valor view is stately but feeling very strong attraction from the industry to bringing us into it to help them serve patients better."

I think that I would add to ability to benefit of the investments that we may guess that we're going to see very nice expansion a number operating cash flows and that expansion in the operating cash flows, which we'll talk more about and we all get together on IR day is really giving us just very, very nice financial resilience and strength to pretty much fund both our growth as well as nice shareholder returns. So we feel really good about that. Now let's deal with Display. So I think you're quite right to point out that as some of the major new Gen 10.5 plants come on stream, they're lower costs than some of the older pants and so therefore they'll get most of the growth and then the question is what happens to some of the older generation LCD plants for our customers and will those lose share. So first, for our customer base, you're seeing them trying to develop new markets and technologies, seems like the automotive display market or wearables, a bunch of other areas to put their product to use. But really from a more selfish standpoint, from Corning's standpoint, this is what is behind our strategy for things like Gorilla of we're already a pretty significant art of what was displayed capacity if we've already moved over to doing the radio for Mobile Consumer Electronics and now increasingly for auto. And you can expect us to continue to do that. And that allows us to basically repurpose those assets and capitalize those businesses without having to spend a lot of capital. So that worked out really well. I think was more of a dynamic for us will be our increasing productivity. As we bring our new -- you're seeing invest in new technologies in our LCD glass plants, in our Gorilla Glass pants. This allows us to continue to improve our cost position, which usually means increasing productivity and as a result that could give us the opportunity to consolidate facilities, et cetera. But it has more to do with how quickly we can develop those new process technologies than it does our ability to repurpose. We've done a really good job repurposing."

Let me start with your question about increasing depreciation versus capital spending. I mean, there's no doubt that we are investing in our businesses and the reason we're investing in the business is that our customers coming to us with loss of great opportunities and we're inventing products and solutions for those customers. And then we do that we grow significantly. And we've seen that growth in the back half of 2018. We're seeing that growth this year. And we're going to see that growth into the future. So there's no question that, that is happening. We're getting greater depreciation. Of course, that will have an impact on the gross margin line but it creates a lot of cash flow and gives us the opportunity to continue investing. And so we're really happy about where we are right now from that standpoint. And then in terms of from a standpoint of where we are in Optical Communications, again, we're very pleased with our results here. I mean, we are growing considerably faster than the market please and we've been working closely with our customers. And when you look at our results and you see strong results both in the carrier market and in the enterprise market, which is where we have our hyperscale data center customer that we feel good about the growth there."

It's really important that when you think about [indiscernible] is how these are large movements in architecture and they can get pretty inevitable but their exact timing of when they start and which individual players starts a given program, right, all can move you around from one quarter to another especially when you're doing sort of year-over-year comparisons where you may be comparing to someone's great big fiber to the home built in the last part of last year, right, and then you're comparing that to this year when that same customer isn't doing a major pass, right? But then we're still growing and that's made up of other pieces. I think what's really important to think here on the long-term perspective is do you believe that wireless is going to move from a structure that is relatively glass-light to one that becomes very glass-heavy. And that's what we believe 5G does, densification happens. And so now in the biggest telecommunications network in the world, which is wireless, right, moves to being a very glass-heavy network, that speaks very well for our growth opportunities. As cloud continues to grow rapidly, that will that leads to is this sort of centralization of data flow, which means you get a lot more bandwidth in that area, it has to get there and get out which once again leaves to very dense, very glass-rich networks, that we also look at and see that's going to continue. But these are big builds. So the exact timing of how they all work out and what period you're comparing, that can allow you to be hard to just lay a monotonic growth rate out there, right? So I feel that some of the difficulty in doing the comparisons but when you step back just architecturally and it looks pretty good to us for glass."

This morning, we reported excellent results that position us for another year of strong growth. For the first quarter, sales were $2.9 billion, up 13% year-over-year. Net income was $365 million, up 22% year-ove",1583,"Thank you, Ann, and good morning, everyone. This morning, we reported excellent results that position us for another year of strong growth. For the first quarter, sales were $2.9 billion, up 13% year-over-year. Net income was $365 million, up 22% year-over-year. And EPS was $0.40, up 29% year-over-year. 4 of our 5 segments achieved double-digit sales growth year-over-year. 
Highlights included that Optical Communications continued to outpace the market with sales up 20%; Environmental Technologies delivered 12% sales growth, driven by accelerating adoption of our gasoline particulate filters; Specialty Materials sales were up 11% on the strength of Gorilla Glass and our other innovations; Life Science sales were up 5% as the business continues to benefit from its leadership in cell culture vessels; Display continues to deliver stable returns with first quarter sales and net income up double digits year-over-year and the best first quarter pricing environment in well over a decade.
These results keep us on track to deliver the growth and shareholder returns we designed into the 4-year Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework introduced in October of 2015. We targeted returning more than $12.5 billion to our shareholders through repurchases and dividends while investing $10 billion to extend our leadership and deliver growth. We continue to make great progress, and we expect to meet all our stated goals. 
Our cash generation is on target. Through the first quarter of 2019, we have returned $12.3 billion to shareholders, reducing outstanding shares by approximately 37%. And we've increased dividends per share by 67% since the framework began, including an 11% increase in February.
Our investments in RD&E, capital expenditures and acquisitions are also on track, totaling $8.8 billion through first quarter 2019. 
Now let's take a closer look at our progress in each of our market access platforms starting with Optical Communications. Our performance in Optical Communications continues to be outstanding. We remain on track to surpass our goal of $5 billion in 2020 sales. We're growing faster than the overall market as our unique co-innovation model continues to deliver the right product at the right time for the right customer.
Our first quarter results reflect our progress with 20% sales growth. We continue to earn recognition around the world for our stream of product and technology innovations that reduce network costs and increase the speed of installations. For example, in the first quarter, Lightwave Innovation Reviews recognized 2 of our solutions: an extreme high-density cable, which make hyperscale data center fiber deployment up to 30% faster; and a surface-mounted, in-home fiber connection solution that is not only fast and easy to install but also integrate seamlessly into the decor because its transparency renders it essentially invisible. This product is among the innovations added to Corning's portfolio through our 2018 acquisition of 3M's Communication Markets Division.
At the global conference, OFC, in March, we demonstrated that our EDGE 8 solution provides data center operators with a simple migration path to 400G transmission speeds and beyond. This helps them stay ahead of requirements for emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence. We were first for 100G, and we'll be first for 400 as well.
March also marked the introduction of the new Corning Technology Center Montréal. The center will serve as Corning's global home for software solutions for telecommunications networks and will support emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, augmented reality, cloud computing and data analytics. The center will eventually become a hub for software innovation across all of Corning's business segments. And we're off to a strong start as 2 major North American service providers are now using our software for their fiber to the home installation and maintenance.
Overall, recognition of the value created by our solutions and co-innovation approach continues to grow, and that results in our Optical Communications sales growing faster than the market. 
Now let's turn to Mobile Consumer Electronics where we are the world leader in glass for smartphones, tablets and emerging categories like wearables and augmented reality devices. Our goal has been to double Mobile Consumer Electronics sales over the next several years despite a maturing smartphone market. And we continue making significant progress toward that goal with steady adoption of our premium glass and the other innovative solutions we offer for smartphones, laptops, tablets and wearables.
We launched our Amplify line of glass screen protectors on OtterBox.com and in more than 1,600 corporate-owned Verizon stores in the United States. Amplify screen protectors provide a new channel for Corning to capture an additional piece of high-value glass on smartphones. Our strategy combines the best screen protector glass with the #1 selling smartphone case brand in the United States.
In the first quarter, we also continued our success in emerging regions with multiple device launches featuring Gorilla Glass in India and Turkey. Overall, we're making great progress on our goal to double sales in Mobile Consumer Electronics. We expect continued momentum throughout the year as we look forward to more new device announcements. And we'll continue to innovate for our customers, and you'll continue to see more Corning in your devices.
Turning to the automotive market access platform. Our core technologies are helping to propel the auto industry into a new era of cleaner cars with enhanced cockpit functionality, connectivity and design. Our objectives are to grow our Environmental business by continuing to win in gasoline particulate filters, and to launch a disruptive automotive glass business. We're off to a great start in 2019 on both objectives.
Our gasoline particulate filter technology makes cars significantly cleaner, and it increases our sales opportunity per car by a factor of 3 to 4. We continue to see strong GPF sales in the first quarter as European regulations are in full effect and China demand is materializing earlier than expected. And we continue to win the majority of platforms with our industry-leading solutions.
We now expect to exceed our goal of delivering $150 million in 2019 GPF sales, and we're investing more to capture accelerating demand. We also continue to demonstrate our ongoing leadership in the industry with a Daimler Supplier Award that recognizes our collaborative development of next-gen emissions control solutions.
Next, excitement about Corning Gorilla Glass for automotive continues to grow as the industry transitions to highly connected and autonomous vehicles that use technical glass. Customers have validated their desire for Corning's technical glass solutions by awarding us hundreds of millions of dollars in our automotive glass pipeline. Our new and industry-first auto-grade glass solutions are making it easier and more affordable for automakers to bring curved and flat displays to market. To service the growing pipeline for our solutions, a dedicated manufacturing facility in Hefei, China, is expected to begin ramping in the third quarter this year.
In our Life Sciences Vessels platform, we continue to make strong progress on the path to a new long-term multibillion dollar franchise. Valor Glass substantially reduces particle contamination, breaks and cracks while significantly increasing throughput. Valor helps protect patients and improve pharmaceutical manufacturing. We're making headway with our development partners, Merck and Pfizer, and our interaction with regulators has been favorable.
We also continued improvement on-site research with a number of customers at their facilities where we completed in-depth validation and fielding live studies that reinforce our progress towards certification. What this means, in essence, is that various customers are doing test runs of our Valor Glass vials on their lines. They're confirming that it's viable on their machines and that it provides the value we described. They're documenting firsthand how significantly Valor Glass will increase their throughput.
We're getting ready for adoption of Valor Glass by scaling up our production capabilities. We brought new capacity online in 2018 and expanded our range of products. We're also progressing with the construction of the new high-volume manufacturing facility in North Carolina that we announced last year. Although this market is slow to adopt new technologies, we continue to invest and make encouraging progress.
In Display, we're delivering stable returns consistent with our goal. First quarter sales and net income were both up year-over-year, with the most favorable first quarter sequential price declines in well over a decade. And we expect continued progress. Full year 2019 price declines are expected to improve further to a mid-single-digit percentage and to be better than in 2018. Our first in the world Gen 10.5 glass facility is ramping to support the expected growth of large-sized TVs, allowing us to grow faster than the overall market. Overall, Display will continue to execute its proven strategy to deliver stable returns.
These examples demonstrate significant progress across all our market access platforms. Ultimately, we remain on track to fully achieve our Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework goals. Looking ahead, we are confident in our ability to deliver sustained performance. We have multiple businesses driving our growth. Our capabilities are becoming increasingly vital to important trends. Our relationships with industry-leading customers are opening new opportunities. We continue to invest in capabilities and capacity that will create substantial additional growth, and you can see the benefits of these investments in our recent results.
We're not only succeeding at building a bigger company. We're building a stronger, more resilient one. We look forward to outlining the next phase of our strategic framework in the coming months, and we'll unpack some of the opportunities that I've discussed today in more detail at our Investor Day on June 14.
Now let me turn the call over to Tony for a review of our results and outlook."
173840,608377234,1713242,"Corning Incorporated, Q1 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2019",2019-04-30,"Earnings Calls","Corning Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Wendell, and good morning. We had another outstanding quarter. We grew sales 13% year-over-year with every business segment growing. We also grew net income 22% and earnings per share 29%, all while continuing to invest for even more sales grow",1940,"Thank you, Wendell, and good morning. We had another outstanding quarter. We grew sales 13% year-over-year with every business segment growing. We also grew net income 22% and earnings per share 29%, all while continuing to invest for even more sales growth this year and beyond.
Now before I get into the details of our performance and results, I want to note that the primary difference between our GAAP and core results is, again, a noncash mark-to-market adjustment for our currency hedge contracts. As we discussed before, GAAP accounting requires earning translation hedge contracts settling in future periods to be mark-to-market and recorded at current value at the end of each quarter even though those contracts will not be settled in the current quarter. For us, this resulted in an after-tax GAAP gain of $138 million in Q1. Now to be clear, this mark-to-market accounting has no impact on our cash flow.
Our currency hedges protect us economically from foreign exchange rate fluctuations and provide higher certainty for our earnings and cash flow, our ability to invest for growth and our future shareholder distributions. Our non-GAAP or core results provide additional transparency into operations by using a constant currency rate aligned with the economics of our underlying transactions. We're very pleased with our hedging program and the economic certainty it provides. We received $1.7 billion in cash under our hedged contracts since their inceptions more than 5 years ago.
Now that brings me to our results and outlook. For the first quarter, sales were up 13% year-over-year to $2.9 billion, net income rose 22% to $365 million and EPS was $0.40, up 29%. As Wendell noted, our strong growth results from our technology and manufacturing leadership. We are benefiting from recent investments, including capacity expansions for optical fiber and cable, Gen 10.5 display glass, gasoline particulate filters and multiple development projects such as Gorilla Glass for mobile devices and automotive. We are very pleased with how these investments are playing out, and we're continuing to invest. Throughout the year, additional manufacturing plants will come online, creating capacity for committed demand and driving additional sales growth in 2019 and beyond. Capital spending in Q1 totaled $524 million, and we expect to spend just over $2 billion in 2019, with programs in every market access platform.
Now let's look at the detailed segment results and outlook. In Display Technologies, our goal is to stabilize returns, and we had a very strong quarter. First quarter sales were $818 million, up 10%, and net income was up 12% year-over-year. First quarter sequential glass price declines were more moderate than we expected and the most favorable first quarter in well over a decade. Second quarter sequential price declines are expected to remain moderate as well. With all of our volume under contract, we expect our full year 2019 price declines to improve further to a mid-single-digit percentage and be even better than they were in 2018.
Now 3 factors continue to drive our view that this favorable pricing environment will continue. First, we expect glass supply to continue to be balanced or even tight. Our Gen 10.5 plant supports expected growth of large-sized TVs. It is colocated with and dedicated to our customer BOE. We pace and align capacity in tandem with BOE to ensure our Gen 10.5 glass supply is balanced to demand. That ramp remains on schedule. We expect the glass supply demand balance below Gen 10.5 to continue to be tight as public information indicates there is little capacity growth planned in this segment.
Second, our competitors continue to face profitability challenges at current pricing levels. Therefore, we expect their price declines will slow further as they try to remain profitable. And third, display glass manufacturing requires ongoing investment in current capacity to maintain operations. To generate acceptable returns on investments, glass price declines will need to improve even further. For Corning, we will only add capacity if we can get an attractive return for our shareholders.
In the first quarter, the display glass market grew mid-single digits year-over-year, and our volume grew significantly faster as we expected due to the ramp of our Gen 10.5 plant. In the second quarter of 2019, we expect that the display glass market to be up mid-single digits year-over-year and our volume to be up significantly more, again due to the Gen 10.5 ramp. Sequentially, we expect the market and our volume to increase by a mid-single-digit percentage, consistent with normal seasonality.
For the full year, we continue to expect the display glass market volume to grow mid-single digits, driven by TV screen size growth. We expect our volume to grow faster than the market, again resulting from the ramp of our Gen 10.5 facility. In summary, we remain very pleased with the current dynamics in our Display business, including our ability to capture Gen 10.5 glass growth and deliver stable returns. 
Let's move to our fastest-growing segment, Optical Communications. The business is on track to surpass its goal of $5 billion of sales in 2020 with further growth beyond. In the first quarter, sales were $1.1 billion and were up 20% over last year. Net income for the quarter increased 30% year-over-year. Sales growth in this segment is driven by multiyear data center and carrier projects as well as sales from the recently acquired 3M's Communication Markets Division. As planned, we are leveraging our capacity investments to deliver higher volume and earnings.
Our 2019 outlook has been impacted by a major fiber to the home customer shifting its deployment from homes passed to homes connected in quarter 2, not quarter 3 as originally anticipated. This will impact sales by about $100 million. As a result, we now expect our full year sales growth to be up about 10%, which is revised from the low teens guidance we provided last quarter but still well ahead of the market. For the second quarter, we expect sales to grow high single digits year-over-year, driven by strong data center, fiber and cable growth. Overall, demand for our fiber, cable and connectivity solutions remained strong. Our customers, the world's leading network and cloud operators, continue to deploy Corning's optical solutions to densify their 4G, 5G and data center networks. We continue to outpace the competition, and we are very excited about the growth ahead of us.
Environmental Technologies' first quarter sales were $362 million, up 12% year-over-year. Net income grew 6%. We are well on our way to building a $500 million gasoline particulate filter business. European regulations are in full effect and automakers in China are preparing for full China 6 implementation in 2020. The market appears to be developing faster, and we are winning more platforms than we anticipated. As a result, we are accelerating our investments and we are raising our short- and long-term sales targets. We now expect GPF sales to exceed $150 million in 2019 and to grow robustly thereafter.
China is also considering early implementation of its heavy duty regulations as part of their Blue Sky initiative. This could further increase both our investment and our sales opportunity. We will have more clarity on the exact timing and impact by the end of quarter 2.
As we invest to capture the opportunities I just described, it mutes our profitability somewhat in the short term but will result in greater sales and profit growth in the medium and long term. Based on our accelerating demand, we now expect full year sales to be up 10% or slightly more versus our prior expectations of high single-digit growth. We also expect second quarter sales to be up about 10% year-over-year.
In Specialty Materials, first quarter performance was strong. First quarter sales were $309 million, up 11% year-over-year and driven by continued strong demand for the company's portfolio of Mobile Consumer Electronics glass solutions. Net income grew 7% year-over-year. For the second quarter, we expect sales to grow high single digits year-over-year. We continue to expect to grow again in 2019 despite a maturing smartphone market. Exactly how much will depend on the adoption rate of our innovations. Our results and outlook demonstrate the value of our premium glasses and the strength of our innovation portfolio.
In Life Sciences, we continue to outpace market growth. First quarter sales were $243 million, up 5% year-over-year. Net income was up 15% year-over-year. We expect both second quarter and full year sales growth of low to mid-single digits year-over-year.
In summary, we had an excellent first quarter with strong performance across the company. The benefits of our recent investments are evident in our results. All of our businesses have solid momentum, and we expect continued sales growth through 2019.
For the second quarter, we expect year-over-year growth with sales up by a high single-digit percentage, operating margin up 75 basis points and EPS up by a mid-teen percentage.
As both Wendell and I described earlier, we continue to invest in all of our businesses. We are increasing capacity utilization in plants that came online in 2018, and at the same time, we're building new plants including facilities for GPFs and auto glass finishing. While we build, start up, ramp and optimize those facilities, associated costs offset some of the normal leverage on our gross margin line. As the commitments from and to our customers increase so does the pace of our work on the manufacturing floor. As a result, the offset to our gross margin line is slightly higher than we anticipated a quarter ago. As sales grow significantly in the second quarter, we expect our gross margin dollars to also grow significantly, both sequentially and year-over-year. We expect our Q2 gross margin percentage to be slightly better than Q1.
Now similar to last year, we expect our gross margin percentage in the second half to improve versus the first half as we utilize ramping capacity to meet committed demand. Depending on the pace of facility startup and optimization, we now expect our second half gross margin percentage to be between 41% and 42%. For your modeling purposes, we expect the 2019 operating margin percent to be greater than 2018.
Now moving to additional outlook details. We expect other income other expense to be approximately $250 million for the full year. Full year gross equity earnings are expected to be approximately $210 million predominantly from Hemlock Semiconductor with the second quarter at approximately $20 million to $25 million versus the first quarter 2019 gross equity earnings of $26 million. We expect our effective tax rate for 2019 to be approximately 20%, consistent with Q1. 
Now finally, I'd like to make a couple of comments on the economic environment, in particular China. First, as we said previously, we do not expect the material impact from the enacted tariffs. Second, we incorporated conservative estimates for China end market demand for TVs and autos in our strong guidance and outlook for 2019. If Chinese demand is better, there is an opportunity for upside.
In closing, we're off to an excellent start in Q1. We are benefiting from our recent investments, and we are delighted with the customer reactions to our innovations. We welcome the opportunity to invest and continue delivering strong sales and earnings growth for our shareholders. Our strong guidance reflects the rich set of opportunities ahead of us in 2019 and beyond as we continue to grow faster than the market across all of our businesses. We are within striking distance of fully delivering on the Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework, and I look forward to sharing our exciting longer-term outlook on June 14.

We have one fiber to the home customer that we expected to shift its deployments from homes passed to homes connected in Q3, and it's actually starting in Q2. So that impact sales about $100 million, and it means we'll be up around 10% in sales versus low teens, but that's still a lot faster than the market's growing. So we feel good about that.
And in terms of the margin profile, yes, we'd see the opportunity to expand margins. Part of it is that just like all of our other businesses, we've been investing in this business. And as we ramp capacity in those businesses, you'd expect margins to improve. And then the second thing is we're offering a lot of great innovations to our customers and those innovations help save them money and also give us an opportunity to provide solutions in some of our technologies, and that's good from a margin standpoint, too."

And that's exactly what we expect to happen in 2019. And the reason for that is that we kind of wind down a lot of our sales in the fourth quarter, especially as we enter December and we wind them up in the first quarter, especially as we get to the month of March. And so you have significant change in working capital in those 2 periods. And in addition to that, we have some of our payments like our incentive payments get paid out in the first quarter. So they improve during the year but they get paid out in the first quarter. And we expect exactly that similar cycle to continue in 2019. Now I think if you go back and look at you see that same cycle last year. Last year did have some incentive payments that happened in the first quarter. So it was a little bit higher than what it was the first quarter this year. But the cycle is exactly the same, and we're certainly on track to what we said we were going to do on a 4-year standpoint in our capital allocation framework."

I think the news in this call is the investments that yield our gross margin percentage are going to be a little bit higher than we thought a quarter ago. In particular, in the second quarter, as both Wendell and I talked about, we see GPFs accelerating. The market is appearing to develop faster, and we're winning more of those platforms. And so that clearly is having an impact on second quarter gross margin.
In Specialty Materials, we're investing now in some innovations that our customers are going to introduce into the back half of the year as they launch new products, and so that's occurring in the second quarter. And then in the auto glass factory, we're beginning to put that together because we're having good success in that market. As you know, we've introduced the auto-grade glass earlier this year, and so we need to be prepared for what happens with sales probably in the fourth quarter maybe in the first quarter, but it takes a few months to ramp-up in advance of that.
And then in the back half of the year besides those kind of opportunities, exactly where we end up with the Blue Sky initiative and the diesel factory will just depend on exactly where things end up in the back half of the year. But from an overall standpoint, I mean we're really happy with this. We consider this all to be good news. It's going to drive both short- and near-term growth. And on top of that, our operating margin is expanding. And so we end up actually with more of our revenue dollars to the bottom line, and that makes a CFO very happy."

And then because of our unique glass and our patented way to get form, we then take and create the form after those processes. This saves just a ton of money and is really, we believe, going to put us in a position to do extremely well in the industry.

I'd say in automotive interiors, it's going faster than we anticipated. We thought we had a pretty good understanding of the automotive market access platform because we've been in it so long, and we felt it was going to be relatively slow for our advanced glass solutions just because of the way that industry works. We've actually gotten a positive surprise by how quickly people are pulling on our interior solutions and how excited they are about some of our new cost advantage solutions. So as a result, we accelerated our investment to bring up a dedicated facility to do these large area glass parts with the various optical treatments that we add through our vapor deposition platforms. So there, it's gone faster and we're sort of playing catch up with the supply chain, not because anybody else is ahead of us but because we have so much pull. So the way we're sort of doubling down on a positive surprise there.
Valor, I'd say is moving in a very stately pace, okay? In this industry, as you know, if you follow it, adopting new technologies tends to be slow. It's a highly regulated industry. And because margins tend to be quite high in the industry, there tends to be a relatively slow move of gravity towards new solutions because they're quite profitable where they are. That being said, we are seeing just tremendous amount of excitement from our customers, especially because of the opportunity to provide more out of existing facilities. And if you follow the industry, you're going to see many reports of drug shortages and inability to get enough vaccines and inability to provide enough of lifesaving medicines. And where we're getting very strong pull, like comes as fast as we can adopt it tends to be in those areas where they're missing revenues and endangering patients' lives by an inability people supply with the capital platform that they have. So Valor I view as stately but feeling very strong attraction from the industry to bringing us into it to help them serve patients better."

So we feel really good about that.
Now let's deal with Display. So I think you're quite right to point out that as some of the major new Gen 10.5 plants come on stream, they're lower costs some of the older pants and so therefore they'll get most of the growth. And then the question is what happens to some of the older generation LCD plants for our customers and will those lose share. So first, for our customer bases, you're seeing them try to develop new markets and technologies, things like the automotive display market or wearables, a bunch of other areas to put their product to use. But really from a more selfish standpoint, from Corning standpoint, this is what is behind our strategy for things like Gorilla where already a pretty significant part of what was display capacity, we've already moved over to doing Gorilla for Mobile Consumer Electronics and now increasingly for auto.
And you can expect us to continue to do that. And that allows us to basically repurpose those assets and capitalize those businesses without having to spend a lot of capital. So that's worked out really well. I think was more of a dynamic for us will be our increasing productivity as we bring our new -- you're seeing us invest in new technologies in our LCD glass plants, in our Gorilla Glass plants. This allows us to continue to improve our cost position, which usually means increasing productivity and as a result that could give us the opportunity to consolidate facilities, et cetera. But it has more to do with how quickly we can develop those new process technologies than it does our ability to repurpose. We've done a really good job repurposing."

So there's no question that, that is happening. We're getting greater depreciation. Of course, that will have an impact on the gross margin line, but it creates a lot of great cash flow and gives us the opportunity to continue investing. And so we're really happy about where we are right now from that standpoint.
And then in terms of from a standpoint of where we are in Optical Communications, again, we're very pleased with our results here. I mean, we are growing considerably faster than the marketplace and we've been working closely with our customers. And when you look at our results and you'll see strong results both in the carrier market and in the enterprise market, which is where we have our hyperscale data center customers and we feel good about the growth there."

It's really important that when you think about [ opto ] is how these are large movements in architecture and they can get pretty inevitable but their exact timing",328,"Yes, and I think your observations on sort of how much organic growth in that time period. It's really important that when you think about [ opto ] is how these are large movements in architecture and they can get pretty inevitable but their exact timing of when they start and which individual player starts given program, right, all can move you around from one quarter to another especially when you're doing sort of year-over-year comparisons where you may be comparing to someone's great big fiber to the home build in the last -- part of last year, right, and then you're comparing that to this year when that same customer isn't doing a major pass, right? But then we're still growing, and it's made up by other pieces. I think what's really important here to think for the long-term perspective is do you believe that wireless is going to move from a structure that is relatively glass-light to one that becomes very glass-heavy. And that's what we believe 5G does. Densification happens. And so now in the biggest telecommunications network in the world, which is wireless, right, moves to being a very glass-heavy network, that speaks very well for our growth opportunities. As cloud continues to grow rapidly, that -- what that leads to is this sort of centralization of data flow, which means you get a lot more bandwidth in that area, it has to get there and get out which once again leaves to very dense, very glass-rich networks, that we also look at and say that's going to continue. But these are big builds. So the exact timing of how they all work out and what period you're comparing, that can allow you to be hard to just lay a monotonic growth rate out there, right? So I feel that some of the difficulty in doing the comparisons but when you step back just architecturally and it looks pretty good to us for glass."

This morning, we reported excellent results that position us for another year of strong growth. For the first quarter, sales were $2.9 billion, up 13% year-over-year. Net income was $365 million, up 22% year-ove",1582,"Thank you, Ann, and good morning, everyone. This morning, we reported excellent results that position us for another year of strong growth. For the first quarter, sales were $2.9 billion, up 13% year-over-year. Net income was $365 million, up 22% year-over-year. And EPS was $0.40, up 29% year-over-year. 4 of our 5 segments achieved double-digit sales growth year-over-year. 
Highlights included that Optical Communications continued to outpace the market with sales up 20%; Environmental Technologies delivered 12% sales growth, driven by accelerating adoption of our gasoline particulate filters. Specialty Materials sales were up 11% on the strength of Gorilla Glass and our other innovations. Life Science sales were up 5% as the business continues to benefit from its leadership in cell culture vessels. Display continues to deliver stable returns with first quarter sales and net income up double digits year-over-year and the best first quarter pricing environment in well over a decade.
These results keep us on track to deliver the growth and shareholder returns we designed into the 4-year Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework introduced in October of 2015. We targeted returning more than $12.5 billion to our shareholders through repurchases and dividends while investing $10 billion to extend our leadership and deliver growth. We continue to make great progress, and we expect to meet all our stated goals. 
Our cash generation is on target. Through the first quarter of 2019, we have returned $12.3 billion to shareholders, reducing outstanding shares by approximately 37%. And we've increased dividends per share by 67% since the framework began, including an 11% increase in February. Our investments in RD&E, capital expenditures and acquisitions are also on track, totaling $8.8 billion through first quarter 2019. 
Now let's take a closer look at our progress in each of our market access platforms starting with Optical Communications. Our performance in Optical Communications continues to be outstanding. We remain on track to surpass our goal of $5 billion in 2020 sales. We're growing faster than the overall market as our unique co-innovation model continues to deliver the right product at the right time for the right customer.
Our first quarter results reflect our progress with 20% sales growth. We continue to earn recognition around the world for our stream of product and technology innovations that reduce network cost and increase the speed of installations. For example, in the first quarter, Lightwave Innovation Reviews recognized 2 of our solutions: an extreme high-density cable, which makes hyperscale data center fiber deployment up to 30% faster; and a surface-mounted, in-home fiber connection solution that is not only fast and easy to install but also integrates seamlessly into the decor because its transparency renders it essentially invisible. This product is among the innovations added to Corning's portfolio through our 2018 acquisition of 3M's Communication Markets Division.
At the global conference, OFC, in March, we demonstrated that our EDGE 8 solution provides data center operators with a simple migration path to 400G transmission speeds and beyond. This helps them stay ahead of requirements for emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence. We were first for 100G, and we'll be first for 400 as well.
March also marked the introduction of the new Corning Technology Center Montreal. The center will serve as Corning's global home for software solutions for telecommunications networks and will support emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence, augmented reality, cloud computing and data analytics. The center will eventually become a hub for software innovation across all of Corning's business segments. And we're off to a strong start as 2 major North American service providers are now using our software for their fiber to the home installation and maintenance. 
Overall, recognition of the value created by our solutions and co-innovation approach continues to grow, and that results in our Optical Communications sales growing faster than the market. 
Now let's turn to Mobile Consumer Electronics where we are the world leader in glass for smartphones, tablets and emerging categories like wearables and augmented reality devices. Our goal has been to double Mobile Consumer Electronics sales over the next several years despite a maturing smartphone market. And we continue making significant progress toward that goal with steady adoption of our premium glass and the other innovative solutions we offer for smartphones, laptops, tablets and wearables.
We launched our Amplify line of glass screen protectors on OtterBox.com and in more than 1,600 corporate-owned Verizon stores in the United States. Amplify screen protectors provide a new channel for Corning to capture an additional piece of high-value glass on smartphones. Our strategy combines the best screen protector glass with the #1 selling smartphone case brand in the United States.
In the first quarter, we also continued our success in emerging regions with multiple device launches featuring Gorilla Glass in India and Turkey. Overall, we're making great progress on our goal to double sales in Mobile Consumer Electronics. We expect continued momentum throughout the year as we look forward to more new device announcements. And we'll continue to innovate for our customers, and you'll continue to see more Corning in your devices.
Turning to the automotive market access platform. Our core technologies are helping to propel the auto industry into a new era of cleaner cars with enhanced cockpit functionality, connectivity and design. Our objectives are to grow our Environmental business by continuing to win in gasoline particulate filters and to launch a disruptive automotive glass business. We're off to a great start in 2019 on both objectives.
Our gasoline particulate filter technology makes cars significantly cleaner, and it increases our sales opportunity per car by a factor of 3 to 4. We continue to see strong GPF sales in the first quarter as European regulations are in full effect and China demand is materializing earlier than expected. 
And we continue to win the majority of platforms with our industry-leading solutions.
We now expect to exceed our goal of delivering $150 million in 2019 GPF sales, and we're investing more to capture accelerating demand. We also continue to demonstrate our ongoing leadership in the industry with a Daimler Supplier Award that recognizes our collaborative development of next-gen emissions control solutions.
Next, excitement about Corning Gorilla Glass for automotive continues to grow as the industry transitions to highly connected and autonomous vehicles that use technical glass. Customers have validated their desire for Corning's technical glass solutions by awarding us hundreds of millions of dollars in our automotive glass pipeline. Our new and industry-first auto-grade glass solutions are making it easier and more affordable for automakers to bring curved and flat displays to market. To service the growing pipeline for our solutions, a dedicated manufacturing facility in Hefei, China, is expected to begin ramping in the third quarter this year.
In our Life Science Vessels platform, we continue to make strong progress on the path to a new long-term multibillion dollar franchise. Valor Glass substantially reduces particle contamination, breaks and cracks while significantly increasing throughput. Valor helps protect patients and improve pharmaceutical manufacturing. We're making headway with our development partners, Merck and Pfizer, and our interaction with regulators has been favorable. 
We also continued important on-site research with a number of customers at their facilities where we completed in-depth validation in filling-line studies that reinforce our progress towards certification. What this means, in essence, is that various customers are doing test runs of our Valor Glass vials on their lines. They're confirming that it's viable on their machines and that it provides the value we described. They're documenting firsthand how significantly Valor Glass will increase their throughput.
We're getting ready for adoption of Valor Glass by scaling up our production capabilities. We brought new capacity online in 2018 and expanded our range of products. We're also progressing with the construction of the new high-volume manufacturing facility in North Carolina that we announced last year. Although this market is slow to adopt new technologies, we continue to invest and make encouraging progress.
In Display, we're delivering stable returns consistent with our goal. First quarter sales and net income were both up year-over-year with the most favorable first quarter sequential price declines in well over a decade. 
And we expect continued progress. Full year 2019 price declines are expected to improve further to a mid-single-digit percentage and to be better than in 2018. Our first in the world Gen 10.5 glass facility is ramping to support the expected growth of large-size TVs, allowing us to grow faster than the overall market. Overall, Display will continue to execute its proven strategy to deliver stable returns.
These examples demonstrate significant progress across all our market access platforms. Ultimately, we remain on track to fully achieve our Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework goals. Looking ahead, we are confident in our ability to deliver sustained performance. We have multiple businesses driving our growth. Our capabilities are becoming increasingly vital to important trends. Our relationships with industry-leading customers are opening new opportunities. We continue to invest in capabilities and capacity that will create substantial additional growth, and you can see the benefits of these investments in our recent results.
We're not only succeeding at building a bigger company. We're building a stronger, more resilient one. We look forward to outlining the next phase of our strategic framework in the coming months, and we'll unpack some of the opportunities that I've discussed today in more detail at our Investor Day on June 14.
Now let me turn the call over to Tony for a review of our results and outlook."
173840,608377234,1713617,"Corning Incorporated, Q1 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2019",2019-04-30,"Earnings Calls","Corning Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Wendell, and good morning. We had another outstanding quarter. We grew sales 13% year-over-year with every business segment growing. We also grew net income 22% and earnings per share 29%, all while continuing to invest for even more sales grow",1935,"Thank you, Wendell, and good morning. We had another outstanding quarter. We grew sales 13% year-over-year with every business segment growing. We also grew net income 22% and earnings per share 29%, all while continuing to invest for even more sales growth this year and beyond.
Now before I get into the details of our performance and results, I want to note that the primary difference between our GAAP and core results is, again, a noncash mark-to-market adjustment for our currency hedge contracts. As we discussed before, GAAP accounting requires earning translation hedge contracts settling in future periods to be mark-to-market and recorded at current value at the end of each quarter even though those contracts will not be settled in the current quarter. For us, this resulted in an after-tax GAAP gain of $138 million in Q1. Now to be clear, this mark-to-market accounting has no impact on our cash flow.
Our currency hedges protect us economically from foreign exchange rate fluctuations and provide higher certainty for our earnings and cash flow, our ability to invest for growth and our future shareholder distributions. Our non-GAAP or core results provide additional transparency into operations by using a constant currency rate aligned with the economics of our underlying transactions. We're very pleased with our hedging program and the economic certainty it provides. We've received $1.7 billion in cash under our hedge contracts since their inceptions more than 5 years ago.
Now that brings me to our results and outlook. For the first quarter, sales were up 13% year-over-year to $2.9 billion. Net income rose 22% to $365 million. And EPS was $0.40, up 29%. 
As Wendell noted, our strong growth results from our technology and manufacturing leadership. We are benefiting from recent investments, including capacity expansions for optical fiber and cable, Gen 10.5 display glass, gasoline particulate filters and multiple development projects, such as Gorilla Glass for mobile devices and automotive. 
We are very pleased with how these investments are playing out, and we're continuing to invest. Throughout the year, additional manufacturing plants will come online, creating capacity for committed demand and driving additional sales growth in 2019 and beyond. Capital spending in Q1 totaled $524 million, and we expect to spend just over $2 billion in 2019 with programs in every market access platform.
Now let's look at the detailed segment results and outlook. In Display Technologies, our goal is to stabilize returns, and we had a very strong quarter. First quarter sales were $818 million, up 10%, and net income was up 12% year-over-year. First quarter sequential glass price declines were more moderate than we expected and the most favorable first quarter in well over a decade. Second quarter sequential price declines are expected to remain moderate as well. With all of our volume under contract, we expect our full year 2019 price declines to improve further to a mid-single-digit percentage and be even better than they were in 2018.
Now 3 factors continue to drive our view that this favorable pricing environment will continue. First, we expect glass supply to continue to be balanced or even tight. Our Gen 10.5 plant supports the expected growth of large-size TVs. It is colocated with and dedicated to our customer BOE. We pace and align capacity in tandem with BOE to ensure our Gen 10.5 glass supply is balanced to demand. That ramp remains on schedule. We expect the glass supply demand balance below Gen 10.5 to continue to be tight as public information indicates there is little capacity growth planned in this segment.
Second, our competitors continue to face profitability challenges at current pricing levels. Therefore, we expect their price declines will slow further as they try to remain profitable. And third, display glass manufacturing requires ongoing investment in current capacity to maintain operations. To generate acceptable returns on investments, glass price declines will need to improve even further. For Corning, we will only add capacity if we can get an attractive return for our shareholders.
In the first quarter, the display glass market grew mid-single digits year-over-year, and our volume grew significantly faster as we expected due to the ramp of our Gen 10.5 plant. In the second quarter of 2019, we expect the display glass market to be up mid-single digits year-over-year and our volume to be up significantly more, again due to the Gen 10.5 ramp. Sequentially, we expect the market and our volume to increase by a mid-single-digit percentage, consistent with normal seasonality.
For the full year, we continue to expect the display glass market volume to grow mid-single digits, driven by TV screen size growth. We expect our volume to grow faster than the market, again resulting from the ramp of our Gen 10.5 facility. In summary, we remain very pleased with the current dynamics in our Display business, including our ability to capture Gen 10.5 glass growth and deliver stable returns. 
Let's move to our fastest-growing segment, Optical Communications. The business is on track to surpass its goal of $5 billion of sales in 2020 with further growth beyond. In the first quarter, sales were $1.1 billion and were up 20% over last year. Net income for the quarter increased 30% year-over-year. Sales growth in this segment is driven by multiyear data center and carrier projects as well as sales from the recently acquired 3M's Communication Market Division. As planned, we are leveraging our capacity investments to deliver higher volume and earnings.
Our 2019 outlook has been impacted by a major fiber-to-the-home customer, shifting its deployment from homes passed to homes connected in quarter 2, not quarter 3 as originally anticipated. This will impact sales by about $100 million. As a result, we now expect our full year sales growth to be up about 10%, which is revised from the low teens guidance we provided last quarter but still well ahead of the market. 
For the second quarter, we expect sales to grow high single digits year-over-year, driven by strong data center, fiber and cable growth. Overall, demand for our fiber, cable and connectivity solutions remain strong. Our customers, the world's leading network and cloud operators, continue to deploy Corning's optical solutions to densify their 4G, 5G and data center networks. We continue to outpace the competition, and we are very excited about the growth ahead of us.
Environmental Technologies' first quarter sales were $362 million, up 12% year-over-year. Net income grew 6%. We are well on our way to building a $500 million gasoline particulate filter business. European regulations are in full effect, and automakers in China are preparing for full China 6 implementation in 2020. The market appears to be developing faster, and we are winning more platforms than we anticipated. As a result, we are accelerating our investments, and we are raising our short- and long-term sales targets. We now expect GPF sales to exceed $150 million in 2019 and to grow robustly thereafter.
China is also considering early implementation of its heavy-duty regulations as part of their Blue Sky initiative. This could further increase both our investment and our sales opportunity. We will have more clarity on the exact timing and impact by the end of quarter 2.
As we invest to capture the opportunities I just described, it mutes our profitability somewhat in the short term but will result in greater sales and profit growth in the medium and long term. Based on our accelerating demand, we now expect full year sales to be up 10% or slightly more versus our prior expectations of high single-digit growth. We also expect second quarter sales to be up about 10% year-over-year.
In Specialty Materials, first quarter performance was strong. First quarter sales were $309 million, up 11% year-over-year and driven by continued strong demand for the company's portfolio of Mobile Consumer Electronics glass solutions. Net income grew 7% year-over-year. 
For the second quarter, we expect sales to grow high single digits year-over-year. We continue to expect to grow again in 2019 despite a maturing smartphone market. Exactly how much will depend on the adoption rate of our innovations. Our results and outlook demonstrate the value of our premium glasses and the strength of our innovation portfolio.
In Life Sciences, we continue to outpace market growth. First quarter sales were $243 million, up 5% year-over-year. Net income was up 15% year-over-year. We expect both second quarter and full year sales growth of low to mid-single digits year-over-year.
In summary, we had an excellent first quarter with strong performance across the company. The benefits of our recent investments are evident in our results. All of our businesses have solid momentum, and we expect continued sales growth through 2019.
For the second quarter, we expect year-over-year growth with sales up by a high single-digit percentage, operating margin up 75 basis points and EPS up by a mid-teen percentage.
As both Wendell and I described earlier, we continue to invest in all of our businesses. We are increasing capacity utilization in plants that came online in 2018, and at the same time, we're building new plants, including facilities for GPFs and auto glass finishing. While we build, start up, ramp and optimize those facilities, associated costs offset some of the normal leverage on our gross margin line. 
As the commitments from and to our customers increase, so does the pace of our work on the manufacturing floor. As a result, the offset to our gross margin line is slightly higher than we anticipated a quarter ago. As sales grow significantly in the second quarter, we expect our gross margin dollars to also grow significantly, both sequentially and year-over-year. We expect our Q2 gross margin percentage to be slightly better than Q1.
Now similar to last year, we expect our gross margin percentage in the second half to improve versus the first half as we utilize ramping capacity to meet committed demand. Depending on the pace of facility start-up and optimization, we now expect our second half gross margin percentage to be between 41% and 42%. For your modeling purposes, we expect the 2019 operating margin percent to be greater than 2018.
Now moving to additional outlook details. We expect other income/other expense to be approximately $250 million for the full year. Full year gross equity earnings are expected to be approximately $210 million predominantly from Hemlock Semiconductor with the second quarter at approximately $20 million to $25 million versus the first quarter 2019 gross equity earnings of $26 million. We expect our effective tax rate for 2019 to be approximately 20%, consistent with Q1. 
Now finally, I'd like to make a couple of comments on the economic environment, in particular China. First, as we said previously, we do not expect the material impact from the enacted tariffs. Second, we incorporated conservative estimates for China end market demand for TVs and autos in our strong guidance and outlook for 2019. If Chinese demand is better, there is an opportunity for upside.
In closing, we're off to an excellent start in Q1. We are benefiting from our recent investments, and we are delighted with the customer reactions to our innovations. We welcome the opportunity to invest and continue delivering strong sales and earnings growth for our shareholders. Our strong guidance reflects the rich set of opportunities ahead of us in 2019 and beyond as we continue to grow faster than the market across all of our businesses. We are within striking distance of fully delivering on the Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework, and I look forward to sharing our exciting longer-term outlook on June 14.

I think if you go back and look at our cash flow cycle for the last several years -- I mean actually for probably longer than that, we always start off with Q1 being our lowest cash flow cycle and we grow robustly throughout the year. And that's exactly what we expect to happen in 2019. And the reason for that is, is that we kind of wind down a lot of our sales in the fourth quarter, especially as we enter December, and we wind them up in the first quarter, especially as we get to the month of March. And so you have significant change in working capital in those 2 periods. And in addition to that, we have some of our payments, like our incentive payments, get paid out in the first quarter. So they improve during the year, but they get paid out in the first quarter. And we expect exactly that similar cycle to continue in 2019. Now I think if you go back and look at -- you'll see that same cycle last year. Last year did have some incentive payments that happened in the first quarter. So it was a little bit higher than what it was the first quarter this year. But the cycle is exactly the same, and we're certainly on track to what we said we were going to do from a 4-year standpoint in our capital allocation framework."

I think the news in this call is the investments that yield our gross margin percentage are going to be a little bit higher than we thought a quarter ago. In particular, in the second quarter, as both Wendell and I talked about, we see GPFs accelerating. The market is appearing to develop faster, and we're winning more of those platforms. And so that clearly is having an impact on second quarter gross margin. Now in Specialty Materials, we're investing now in some innovations that our customers are going to introduce into the back half of the year as they launch new products, and so that's occurring in the second quarter. And then in the auto glass factory, we're beginning to put that together because we're having good success in that market. As you know, we've introduced the auto-grade glass earlier this year, and so we need to be prepared for what happens with sales probably in the fourth quarter maybe in the first quarter, but it takes a few months to ramp up in advance of that. And then in the back half of the year besides those kind of opportunities, exactly where we end up with the Blue Sky initiative and the diesel factory will just depend on exactly where things end up in the back half of the year. But from an overall standpoint, I mean we're really happy with this. We consider this all to be good news. It's going to drive both short- and near-term growth. And on top of that, our operating margin is expanding. And so we end up actually with more of our revenue dollars to the bottom line, and that makes a CFO very happy."

And then because of our unique glass and our patented way to get form, we then take and create the form after those processes.

Instead, we're just talking about how fast we continue to grow. And that is a really interesting spot where we've tried to engineer and has happened. And we will still feel as our different customers do big civil works projects at different times, right, how much growth that we have.

I'd say on automotive interiors, it's going faster than we anticipated. We thought we had a pretty good understanding of the automotive market access platform because we've been in it so long, and we felt it was going to be relatively slow for our advanced glass solutions just because of the way that industry works. We've actually gotten a positive surprise by how quickly people are pulling on our interior solutions and how excited they are about some of our new cost advantage solutions. So as a result, we've accelerated our investment to bring up a dedicated facility to do these large area glass parts with the various optical treatments that we add through our vapor deposition platforms. So there, it's gone faster and we're sort of playing catch-up with the supply chain not because anybody else is ahead of us but because we have so much pull. So in a way, we're sort of doubling down on a positive surprise there. Valor I'd say is moving at a very stately pace, okay? In this industry, as you know, if you follow it, adopting new technologies tends to be slow. It's a highly regulated industry. And because margins tend to be quite high in the industry, there tends to be a relatively slow move of gravity towards new solutions because they're quite profitable where they are. That being said, we are seeing just tremendous amount of excitement from our customers, especially because of the opportunity to provide more out of existing facilities. And as -- if you follow the industry, you're going to see many reports of drug shortages, an inability to get enough vaccines, an inability to provide enough of lifesaving medicines. And where we're getting very strong pull, like come as fast as we can adopt it, tends to be in those areas where they're missing revenues and endangering patients' lives by an inability to supply with the capital platform that they have. So Valor I view as stately but feeling very strong attraction from the industry to bringing us into it to help them serve patients better."

So we feel really good about that. Now let's deal with Display. So I think you're quite right to point out that, as some of the major new Gen 10.5 plants come onstream, they're lower cost than some of the older plants, and so therefore, they'll get most of the growth. And then the question is what happens to some of the older-generation LCD plants for our customers and will those lose share? So first, for our customer bases, you're seeing them try to develop new markets and technologies, things like the automotive display market or wearables, a bunch of other areas to put their product to use. But really from a more selfish standpoint, from Corning standpoint, this is what is behind our strategy for things like Gorilla where already a pretty significant part of what was display capacity, we've already moved over to doing Gorilla for Mobile Consumer Electronics and now increasingly for auto. And you can expect us to continue to do that. And that allows us to basically repurpose those assets and capitalize those businesses without having to spend a lot of capital. So that's worked out really well. I think was more of a dynamic for us will be our increasing productivity as we bring our new -- you're seeing us invest in new technologies in our LCD glass plants and our Gorilla Glass plants. This allows us to continue to improve our cost position, which usually means increasing productivity, and as a result that could give us the opportunity to consolidate facilities, et cetera. But it has more to do with how quickly we can develop those new process technologies than it does our ability to repurpose. We've done a really good job repurposing."

I think what's really important here to think for the long-term perspective is do you believe that wireless is going to move from a structure that is relatively glass-light to one that becomes very glass-heavy. And that's what we believe 5G does. Densification happens. And so now in the biggest telecommunications network in the world, which is wireless, right, moves to being a very glass-heavy network. That speaks very well for our growth opportunities. As cloud continues to grow rapidly, that -- what that leads to is this sort of centralization of data flow, which means you get a lot more bandwidth in that area. It has to get there and get out, which once again leads to very dense, very glass-rich networks that we also look at and say that's going to continue. But these are big builds. So the exact timing of how they all work out and what period you're comparing, that can allow you to be -- for it to be hard to just lay a monotonic growth rate out there, right? So I feel that some of the difficulty of doing the comparisons, but when you step back just architecturally and it looks pretty good to us for glass."

This morning, we reported excellent results that position us for another year of strong growth. For the first quarter, sales were $2.9 billion, up 13% year-over-year. Net income was $365 million, up 22% year-ove",1582,"Thank you, Ann, and good morning, everyone. This morning, we reported excellent results that position us for another year of strong growth. For the first quarter, sales were $2.9 billion, up 13% year-over-year. Net income was $365 million, up 22% year-over-year. And EPS was $0.40, up 29% year-over-year. 4 of our 5 segments achieved double-digit sales growth year-over-year. 
Highlights included that Optical Communications continued to outpace the market with sales up 20%; Environmental Technologies delivered 12% sales growth, driven by accelerating adoption of our gasoline particulate filters. Specialty Materials sales were up 11% on the strength of Gorilla Glass and our other innovations. Life Science sales were up 5% as the business continues to benefit from its leadership in cell culture vessels. Display continues to deliver stable returns with first quarter sales and net income up double digits year-over-year and the best first quarter pricing environment in well over a decade.
These results keep us on track to deliver the growth and shareholder returns we designed into the 4-year Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework introduced in October of 2015. We targeted returning more than $12.5 billion to our shareholders through repurchases and dividends while investing $10 billion to extend our leadership and deliver growth. We continue to make great progress, and we expect to meet all our stated goals. 
Our cash generation is on target. Through the first quarter of 2019, we have returned $12.3 billion to shareholders, reducing outstanding shares by approximately 37%. And we've increased dividends per share by 67% since the framework began, including an 11% increase in February. Our investments in RD&E, capital expenditures and acquisitions are also on track, totaling $8.8 billion through first quarter 2019. 
Now let's take a closer look at our progress in each of our market access platforms starting with Optical Communications. Our performance in Optical Communications continues to be outstanding. We remain on track to surpass our goal of $5 billion in 2020 sales. We're growing faster than the overall market as our unique co-innovation model continues to deliver the right product at the right time for the right customer.
Our first quarter results reflect our progress with 20% sales growth. We continue to earn recognition around the world for our stream of product and technology innovations that reduce network cost and increase the speed of installations. For example, in the first quarter, Lightwave Innovation Reviews recognized 2 of our solutions: an extreme high-density cable, which makes hyperscale data center fiber deployment up to 30% faster; and a surface-mounted, in-home fiber connection solution that is not only fast and easy to install but also integrates seamlessly into the decor because its transparency renders it essentially invisible. This product is among the innovations added to Corning's portfolio through our 2018 acquisition of 3M's Communication Markets Division.
At the global conference, OFC, in March, we demonstrated that our EDGE 8 solution provides data center operators with a simple migration path to 400G transmission speeds and beyond. This helps them stay ahead of requirements for emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence. We were first for 100G, and we'll be first for 400 as well.
March also marked the introduction of the new Corning Technology Center Montreal. The center will serve as Corning's global home for software solutions for telecommunications networks and will support emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence, augmented reality, cloud computing and data analytics. The center will eventually become a hub for software innovation across all of Corning's business segments. And we're off to a strong start as 2 major North American service providers are now using our software for their fiber to the home installation and maintenance. 
Overall, recognition of the value created by our solutions and co-innovation approach continues to grow, and that results in our Optical Communications sales growing faster than the market. 
Now let's turn to Mobile Consumer Electronics where we are the world leader in glass for smartphones, tablets and emerging categories like wearables and augmented reality devices. Our goal has been to double Mobile Consumer Electronics sales over the next several years despite a maturing smartphone market. And we continue making significant progress toward that goal with steady adoption of our premium glass and the other innovative solutions we offer for smartphones, laptops, tablets and wearables.
We launched our Amplify line of glass screen protectors on OtterBox.com and in more than 1,600 corporate-owned Verizon stores in the United States. Amplify screen protectors provide a new channel for Corning to capture an additional piece of high-value glass on smartphones. Our strategy combines the best screen protector glass with the #1 selling smartphone case brand in the United States.
In the first quarter, we also continued our success in emerging regions with multiple device launches featuring Gorilla Glass in India and Turkey. Overall, we're making great progress on our goal to double sales in Mobile Consumer Electronics. We expect continued momentum throughout the year as we look forward to more new device announcements. And we'll continue to innovate for our customers, and you'll continue to see more Corning in your devices.
Turning to the automotive market access platform. Our core technologies are helping to propel the auto industry into a new era of cleaner cars with enhanced cockpit functionality, connectivity and design. Our objectives are to grow our Environmental business by continuing to win in gasoline particulate filters and to launch a disruptive automotive glass business. We're off to a great start in 2019 on both objectives.
Our gasoline particulate filter technology makes cars significantly cleaner, and it increases our sales opportunity per car by a factor of 3 to 4. We continue to see strong GPF sales in the first quarter as European regulations are in full effect and China demand is materializing earlier than expected. 
And we continue to win the majority of platforms with our industry-leading solutions.
We now expect to exceed our goal of delivering $150 million in 2019 GPF sales, and we're investing more to capture accelerating demand. We also continue to demonstrate our ongoing leadership in the industry with a Daimler Supplier Award that recognizes our collaborative development of next-gen emissions control solutions.
Next, excitement about Corning Gorilla Glass for automotive continues to grow as the industry transitions to highly connected and autonomous vehicles that use technical glass. Customers have validated their desire for Corning's technical glass solutions by awarding us hundreds of millions of dollars in our automotive glass pipeline. Our new and industry-first auto-grade glass solutions are making it easier and more affordable for automakers to bring curved and flat displays to market. To service the growing pipeline for our solutions, a dedicated manufacturing facility in Hefei, China, is expected to begin ramping in the third quarter this year.
In our Life Science Vessels platform, we continue to make strong progress on the path to a new long-term multibillion dollar franchise. Valor Glass substantially reduces particle contamination, breaks and cracks while significantly increasing throughput. Valor helps protect patients and improve pharmaceutical manufacturing. We're making headway with our development partners, Merck and Pfizer, and our interaction with regulators has been favorable. 
We also continued important on-site research with a number of customers at their facilities where we completed in-depth validation in filling-line studies that reinforce our progress towards certification. What this means, in essence, is that various customers are doing test runs of our Valor Glass vials on their lines. They're confirming that it's viable on their machines and that it provides the value we described. They're documenting firsthand how significantly Valor Glass will increase their throughput.
We're getting ready for adoption of Valor Glass by scaling up our production capabilities. We brought new capacity online in 2018 and expanded our range of products. We're also progressing with the construction of the new high-volume manufacturing facility in North Carolina that we announced last year. Although this market is slow to adopt new technologies, we continue to invest and make encouraging progress.
In Display, we're delivering stable returns consistent with our goal. First quarter sales and net income were both up year-over-year with the most favorable first quarter sequential price declines in well over a decade. 
And we expect continued progress. Full year 2019 price declines are expected to improve further to a mid-single-digit percentage and to be better than in 2018. Our first in the world Gen 10.5 glass facility is ramping to support the expected growth of large-size TVs, allowing us to grow faster than the overall market. Overall, Display will continue to execute its proven strategy to deliver stable returns.
These examples demonstrate significant progress across all our market access platforms. Ultimately, we remain on track to fully achieve our Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework goals. Looking ahead, we are confident in our ability to deliver sustained performance. We have multiple businesses driving our growth. Our capabilities are becoming increasingly vital to important trends. Our relationships with industry-leading customers are opening new opportunities. We continue to invest in capabilities and capacity that will create substantial additional growth, and you can see the benefits of these investments in our recent results.
We're not only succeeding at building a bigger company. We're building a stronger, more resilient one. We look forward to outlining the next phase of our strategic framework in the coming months, and we'll unpack some of the opportunities that I've discussed today in more detail at our Investor Day on June 14.
Now let me turn the call over to Tony for a review of our results and outlook."
173840,608377234,1718698,"Corning Incorporated, Q1 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2019",2019-04-30,"Earnings Calls","Corning Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Wendell, and good morning. We had another outstanding quarter. We grew sales 13% year-over-year with every business segment growing. We also grew net income 22% and earnings per share 29%, all while continuing to invest for even more sales grow",1935,"Thank you, Wendell, and good morning. We had another outstanding quarter. We grew sales 13% year-over-year with every business segment growing. We also grew net income 22% and earnings per share 29%, all while continuing to invest for even more sales growth this year and beyond.
Now before I get into the details of our performance and results, I want to note that the primary difference between our GAAP and core results is, again, a noncash mark-to-market adjustment for our currency hedge contracts. As we discussed before, GAAP accounting requires earning translation hedge contracts settling in future periods to be mark-to-market and recorded at current value at the end of each quarter even though those contracts will not be settled in the current quarter. For us, this resulted in an after-tax GAAP gain of $138 million in Q1. Now to be clear, this mark-to-market accounting has no impact on our cash flow.
Our currency hedges protect us economically from foreign exchange rate fluctuations and provide higher certainty for our earnings and cash flow, our ability to invest for growth and our future shareholder distributions. Our non-GAAP or core results provide additional transparency into operations by using a constant currency rate aligned with the economics of our underlying transactions. We're very pleased with our hedging program and the economic certainty it provides. We've received $1.7 billion in cash under our hedge contracts since their inceptions more than 5 years ago.
Now that brings me to our results and outlook. For the first quarter, sales were up 13% year-over-year to $2.9 billion. Net income rose 22% to $365 million. And EPS was $0.40, up 29%. 
As Wendell noted, our strong growth results from our technology and manufacturing leadership. We are benefiting from recent investments, including capacity expansions for optical fiber and cable, Gen 10.5 display glass, gasoline particulate filters and multiple development projects, such as Gorilla Glass for mobile devices and automotive. 
We are very pleased with how these investments are playing out, and we're continuing to invest. Throughout the year, additional manufacturing plants will come online, creating capacity for committed demand and driving additional sales growth in 2019 and beyond. Capital spending in Q1 totaled $524 million, and we expect to spend just over $2 billion in 2019 with programs in every market access platform.
Now let's look at the detailed segment results and outlook. In Display Technologies, our goal is to stabilize returns, and we had a very strong quarter. First quarter sales were $818 million, up 10%, and net income was up 12% year-over-year. First quarter sequential glass price declines were more moderate than we expected and the most favorable first quarter in well over a decade. Second quarter sequential price declines are expected to remain moderate as well. With all of our volume under contract, we expect our full year 2019 price declines to improve further to a mid-single-digit percentage and be even better than they were in 2018.
Now 3 factors continue to drive our view that this favorable pricing environment will continue. First, we expect glass supply to continue to be balanced or even tight. Our Gen 10.5 plant supports the expected growth of large-size TVs. It is colocated with and dedicated to our customer BOE. We pace and align capacity in tandem with BOE to ensure our Gen 10.5 glass supply is balanced to demand. That ramp remains on schedule. We expect the glass supply demand balance below Gen 10.5 to continue to be tight as public information indicates there is little capacity growth planned in this segment.
Second, our competitors continue to face profitability challenges at current pricing levels. Therefore, we expect their price declines will slow further as they try to remain profitable. And third, display glass manufacturing requires ongoing investment in current capacity to maintain operations. To generate acceptable returns on investments, glass price declines will need to improve even further. For Corning, we will only add capacity if we can get an attractive return for our shareholders.
In the first quarter, the display glass market grew mid-single digits year-over-year, and our volume grew significantly faster as we expected due to the ramp of our Gen 10.5 plant. In the second quarter of 2019, we expect the display glass market to be up mid-single digits year-over-year and our volume to be up significantly more, again due to the Gen 10.5 ramp. Sequentially, we expect the market and our volume to increase by a mid-single-digit percentage, consistent with normal seasonality.
For the full year, we continue to expect the display glass market volume to grow mid-single digits, driven by TV screen size growth. We expect our volume to grow faster than the market, again resulting from the ramp of our Gen 10.5 facility. In summary, we remain very pleased with the current dynamics in our Display business, including our ability to capture Gen 10.5 glass growth and deliver stable returns. 
Let's move to our fastest-growing segment, Optical Communications. The business is on track to surpass its goal of $5 billion of sales in 2020 with further growth beyond. In the first quarter, sales were $1.1 billion and were up 20% over last year. Net income for the quarter increased 30% year-over-year. Sales growth in this segment is driven by multiyear data center and carrier projects as well as sales from the recently acquired 3M's Communication Market Division. As planned, we are leveraging our capacity investments to deliver higher volume and earnings.
Our 2019 outlook has been impacted by a major fiber-to-the-home customer, shifting its deployment from homes passed to homes connected in quarter 2, not quarter 3 as originally anticipated. This will impact sales by about $100 million. As a result, we now expect our full year sales growth to be up about 10%, which is revised from the low teens guidance we provided last quarter but still well ahead of the market. 
For the second quarter, we expect sales to grow high single digits year-over-year, driven by strong data center, fiber and cable growth. Overall, demand for our fiber, cable and connectivity solutions remain strong. Our customers, the world's leading network and cloud operators, continue to deploy Corning's optical solutions to densify their 4G, 5G and data center networks. We continue to outpace the competition, and we are very excited about the growth ahead of us.
Environmental Technologies' first quarter sales were $362 million, up 12% year-over-year. Net income grew 6%. We are well on our way to building a $500 million gasoline particulate filter business. European regulations are in full effect, and automakers in China are preparing for full China 6 implementation in 2020. The market appears to be developing faster, and we are winning more platforms than we anticipated. As a result, we are accelerating our investments, and we are raising our short- and long-term sales targets. We now expect GPF sales to exceed $150 million in 2019 and to grow robustly thereafter.
China is also considering early implementation of its heavy-duty regulations as part of their Blue Sky initiative. This could further increase both our investment and our sales opportunity. We will have more clarity on the exact timing and impact by the end of quarter 2.
As we invest to capture the opportunities I just described, it mutes our profitability somewhat in the short term but will result in greater sales and profit growth in the medium and long term. Based on our accelerating demand, we now expect full year sales to be up 10% or slightly more versus our prior expectations of high single-digit growth. We also expect second quarter sales to be up about 10% year-over-year.
In Specialty Materials, first quarter performance was strong. First quarter sales were $309 million, up 11% year-over-year and driven by continued strong demand for the company's portfolio of Mobile Consumer Electronics glass solutions. Net income grew 7% year-over-year. 
For the second quarter, we expect sales to grow high single digits year-over-year. We continue to expect to grow again in 2019 despite a maturing smartphone market. Exactly how much will depend on the adoption rate of our innovations. Our results and outlook demonstrate the value of our premium glasses and the strength of our innovation portfolio.
In Life Sciences, we continue to outpace market growth. First quarter sales were $243 million, up 5% year-over-year. Net income was up 15% year-over-year. We expect both second quarter and full year sales growth of low to mid-single digits year-over-year.
In summary, we had an excellent first quarter with strong performance across the company. The benefits of our recent investments are evident in our results. All of our businesses have solid momentum, and we expect continued sales growth through 2019.
For the second quarter, we expect year-over-year growth with sales up by a high single-digit percentage, operating margin up 75 basis points and EPS up by a mid-teen percentage.
As both Wendell and I described earlier, we continue to invest in all of our businesses. We are increasing capacity utilization in plants that came online in 2018, and at the same time, we're building new plants, including facilities for GPFs and auto glass finishing. While we build, start up, ramp and optimize those facilities, associated costs offset some of the normal leverage on our gross margin line. 
As the commitments from and to our customers increase, so does the pace of our work on the manufacturing floor. As a result, the offset to our gross margin line is slightly higher than we anticipated a quarter ago. As sales grow significantly in the second quarter, we expect our gross margin dollars to also grow significantly, both sequentially and year-over-year. We expect our Q2 gross margin percentage to be slightly better than Q1.
Now similar to last year, we expect our gross margin percentage in the second half to improve versus the first half as we utilize ramping capacity to meet committed demand. Depending on the pace of facility start-up and optimization, we now expect our second half gross margin percentage to be between 41% and 42%. For your modeling purposes, we expect the 2019 operating margin percent to be greater than 2018.
Now moving to additional outlook details. We expect other income/other expense to be approximately $250 million for the full year. Full year gross equity earnings are expected to be approximately $210 million predominantly from Hemlock Semiconductor with the second quarter at approximately $20 million to $25 million versus the first quarter 2019 gross equity earnings of $26 million. We expect our effective tax rate for 2019 to be approximately 20%, consistent with Q1. 
Now finally, I'd like to make a couple of comments on the economic environment, in particular China. First, as we said previously, we do not expect the material impact from the enacted tariffs. Second, we incorporated conservative estimates for China end market demand for TVs and autos in our strong guidance and outlook for 2019. If Chinese demand is better, there is an opportunity for upside.
In closing, we're off to an excellent start in Q1. We are benefiting from our recent investments, and we are delighted with the customer reactions to our innovations. We welcome the opportunity to invest and continue delivering strong sales and earnings growth for our shareholders. Our strong guidance reflects the rich set of opportunities ahead of us in 2019 and beyond as we continue to grow faster than the market across all of our businesses. We are within striking distance of fully delivering on the Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework, and I look forward to sharing our exciting longer-term outlook on June 14.

And in terms of the margin profile, yes, we see the opportunity to expand margins. Part of it is, is that, just like all of our other businesses, we've been investing in this business. And as we ramp capacity in those businesses, you'd expect margins to improve. And then the second thing is, is that we're offering a lot of great innovations to our customers, and those innovations help save them money and also give us an opportunity to provide solutions in some of our technologies, and that's good from a margin standpoint, too."

And that's exactly what we expect to happen in 2019. And the reason for that is, is that we kind of wind down a lot of our sales in the fourth quarter, especially as we enter December, and we wind them up in the first quarter, especially as we get to the month of March. And so you have significant change in working capital in those 2 periods. And in addition to that, we have some of our payments, like our incentive payments, get paid out in the first quarter. So they improve during the year, but they get paid out in the first quarter. And we expect exactly that similar cycle to continue in 2019. Now I think if you go back and look at -- you'll see that same cycle last year. Last year did have some incentive payments that happened in the first quarter.

I think the news in this call is the investments that yield our gross margin percentage are going to be a little bit higher than we thought a quarter ago. In particular, in the second quarter, as both Wendell and I talked about, we see GPFs accelerating. The market is appearing to develop faster, and we're winning more of those platforms. And so that clearly is having an impact on second quarter gross margin. Now in Specialty Materials, we're investing now in some innovations that our customers are going to introduce into the back half of the year as they launch new products, and so that's occurring in the second quarter. And then in the auto glass factory, we're beginning to put that together because we're having good success in that market. As you know, we've introduced the auto-grade glass earlier this year, and so we need to be prepared for what happens with sales probably in the fourth quarter maybe in the first quarter, but it takes a few months to ramp up in advance of that. And then in the back half of the year besides those kind of opportunities, exactly where we end up with the Blue Sky initiative and the diesel factory will just depend on exactly where things end up in the back half of the year. But from an overall standpoint, I mean we're really happy with this. We consider this all to be good news. It's going to drive both short- and near-term growth. And on top of that, our operating margin is expanding. And so we end up actually with more of our revenue dollars to the bottom line, and that makes a CFO very happy."

And then because of our unique glass and our patented way to get form, we then take and create the form after those processes.

Instead, we're just talking about how fast we continue to grow. And that is a really interesting spot where we've tried to engineer and has happened. And we will still feel as our different customers do big civil works projects at different times, right, how much growth that we have.

I'd say on automotive interiors, it's going faster than we anticipated. We thought we had a pretty good understanding of the automotive market access platform because we've been in it so long, and we felt it was going to be relatively slow for our advanced glass solutions just because of the way that industry works. We've actually gotten a positive surprise by how quickly people are pulling on our interior solutions and how excited they are about some of our new cost advantage solutions. So as a result, we've accelerated our investment to bring up a dedicated facility to do these large area glass parts with the various optical treatments that we add through our vapor deposition platforms. So there, it's gone faster and we're sort of playing catch-up with the supply chain not because anybody else is ahead of us but because we have so much pull. So in a way, we're sort of doubling down on a positive surprise there. Valor I'd say is moving at a very stately pace, okay? In this industry, as you know, if you follow it, adopting new technologies tends to be slow. It's a highly regulated industry. And because margins tend to be quite high in the industry, there tends to be a relatively slow move of gravity towards new solutions because they're quite profitable where they are. That being said, we are seeing just tremendous amount of excitement from our customers, especially because of the opportunity to provide more out of existing facilities. And as -- if you follow the industry, you're going to see many reports of drug shortages, an inability to get enough vaccines, an inability to provide enough of lifesaving medicines. And where we're getting very strong pull, like come as fast as we can adopt it, tends to be in those areas where they're missing revenues and endangering patients' lives by an inability to supply with the capital platform that they have. So Valor I view as stately but feeling very strong attraction from the industry to bringing us into it to help them serve patients better."

I mean, the places where we've added leverage over the last couple of years has been in Japan, where the interest rates are low and we have high exposure and that's been over 10 years maturity; and in the United States, where we've added a lot of -- what debt we've added has been at the 30- to 40-year maturity, and we're also looking maybe in the China market where we have some -- where we also have a lot of exposure.

So we feel really good about that. Now let's deal with Display. So I think you're quite right to point out that, as some of the major new Gen 10.5 plants come onstream, they're lower cost than some of the older plants, and so therefore, they'll get most of the growth. And then the question is what happens to some of the older-generation LCD plants for our customers and will those lose share? So first, for our customer bases, you're seeing them try to develop new markets and technologies, things like the automotive display market or wearables, a bunch of other areas to put their product to use. But really from a more selfish standpoint, from Corning standpoint, this is what is behind our strategy for things like Gorilla where already a pretty significant part of what was display capacity, we've already moved over to doing Gorilla for Mobile Consumer Electronics and now increasingly for auto. And you can expect us to continue to do that. And that allows us to basically repurpose those assets and capitalize those businesses without having to spend a lot of capital. So that's worked out really well. I think was more of a dynamic for us will be our increasing productivity as we bring our new -- you're seeing us invest in new technologies in our LCD glass plants and our Gorilla Glass plants. This allows us to continue to improve our cost position, which usually means increasing productivity, and as a result that could give us the opportunity to consolidate facilities, et cetera. But it has more to do with how quickly we can develop those new process technologies than it does our ability to repurpose. We've done a really good job repurposing."

So there's no question that, that is happening. We're getting greater depreciation.

It's really important that when you think about opto is how these are large movements in architecture, and they can get pretty inevitable but their exact timing of when they start and which individual player starts a given program, right, all can move you around from 1 quarter to another, especially when you're doing sort of year-over-year comparisons where you may be comparing to someone's great big fiber-to-the-home build in the last part of last year, right, and then you're comparing that to this year when that same customer isn't doing a major pass, right. But then we're still growing, and it's made up by other pieces. I think what's really important here to think for the long-term perspective is do you believe that wireless is going to move from a structure that is relatively glass-light to one that becomes very glass-heavy. And that's what we believe 5G does. Densification happens. And so now in the biggest telecommunications network in the world, which is wireless, right, moves to being a very glass-heavy network. That speaks very well for our growth opportunities. As cloud continues to grow rapidly, that -- what that leads to is this sort of centralization of data flow, which means you get a lot more bandwidth in that area. It has to get there and get out, which once again leads to very dense, very glass-rich networks that we also look at and say that's going to continue. But these are big builds. So the exact timing of how they all work out and what period you're comparing, that can allow you to be -- for it to be hard to just lay a monotonic growth rate out there, right? So I feel that some of the difficulty of doing the comparisons, but when you step back just architecturally and it looks pretty good to us for glass."

This morning, we reported excellent results that keep us on track for growth in 2019 and beyond. Our performance demonstrates the strength of Corning's portfolio, and our ability to deliver for shareholders in a mixed macro environment.
Looking at the second quarter, sales were $3 billion, up 8% year-over-year. Net income of $410 million grew faster than sales at 14% year-over-year, driven by operating margin expansion.
And EPS was $0.45, up 18% year-over-year. Segment sales growth rates ranged from the mid-single digits to mid-teens, and we grew earnings in all segments. 
Highlights from the quarter include: optical Communications met expectations, delivering high single-digit sales growth, driven by data center and fiber demand; Environmental Technologies delivered 15% year-over-year sales growth, driven by the accelerating adoption of our gasoline particulate filters; and continued strong demand in the North American heavy-duty market.
Life Science sales were up 6% year-over-year with net income growing much faster than sales, up 29% year-over-year. Specialty Materials sales were up 8% year-over-year on the strength of Gorilla Glass and our other innovations. Display continues to deliver stable returns with second quarter sales and net income up significantly year-over-year and better-than-expected pricing. 
Our performance stands from the successful execution of our 4-year strategy and capital allocation framework introduced in October of 2015. Under the framework, we targeted returning more than $12.5 billion to our shareholders through repurchases and dividends, while investing $10 billion to extend our leadership and deliver growth. We surpassed our 4-year goal of $12.5 billion by returning more than $300 million to shareholders during the second quarter. And we're seeing the benefit of our investments in our first half year-over-year performance, and in our expectations for the second half of 2019.
Of course, as you've all seen this earning season, many companies are facing uncertainty and macroeconomic headwinds, and we are not immune to economic downturns or trade disputes or other geopolitical upsets, but we are more resilient than at any other time in our history. 
Across the company, while the end markets we serve are experiencing downward growth revisions, and many of our competitors are not growing at all, we continue to outpace the markets.
In the auto market, global auto production is down, but we expect sales growth in our environmental business to be in the low teens this year. Retail television sell-through forecast are declining in units, but we expect Display volume and sales growth this year. Smartphone unit sales are also forecasted to be down, but we're growing Gorilla Glass sales this year as well. In Life Sciences, the industry is relatively immune to economic headwinds so it is growing in it's typical low single digit rate, but we expect mid-single-digit growth of our Life Science businesses this year. And finally, in Optical Communications, we now expect the passive optical market to be down. Earlier in the year, we projected the market to be up 5%, and for our sales to grow in the low teens. We now expect the market to be down mid-to-high single digit, and for our sales to grow low to mid-single digits. While the growth is lower than previously expected, it is still very positive relative to the market. You will hear more details from Tony on the current dynamics. 
So the good news is, even in this environment, we are growing. And when markets improve, we'll grow even more. We are confident in our long-term growth prospects. The successful execution of our Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework adds to our confidence. We face challenges along our path to grow throughout our 2016 to 2019 Plan, but we address those challenges and met or exceeded all our goals, in so doing, we created a bigger stronger company, and we created a strong foundation for significant additional growth. 
Our new Strategy & Growth Framework sets our leadership priorities for 2020-2023. It's our original framework evolved for a new growth area. We continue to focus our portfolio and utilize our financial strength. We plan to return $8 billion to $10 billion to shareholders and to invest $10 billion to $12 billion in growth and extending our leadership.
We expect a sales compound annual growth rate of 6% to 8%, and an EPS compound annual growth rate of 12% to 15% and annual dividends per share growth of at least 10%.
Our capabilities are becoming increasingly vital and multiple trends are driving growth across multiple businesses and in multiple geographies. 
In Optical Communications, we are on track to deliver growth twice as fast as the passive optical market, driven by opportunities in 5G and Next GEN hyperscale. Recently, CenturyLink announced that it is using Corning fiber to build the largest ultra-low-loss fiber network in North America. They're connecting more than 50 major cities throughout the U.S. and will soon expand into parts of Europe as well, creating a 4.7 million-mile fiber network. 
In the second half, we're going to be introducing next generation solutions that enable 5G and access networks to be installed faster and reduce the total cost of ownership. While pauses may occur as network operation transition between projects, photons replacing electrons in network after network provides a strong upward trajectory over longer periods.
In Mobile Consumer Electronics, we are well on our way to doubling sales despite a maturing smartphone market. As the world leader in glass for smartphones, tablets and emerging categories like wearables and augmented reality devices, we expect to continue capturing more value per device. Gorilla Glass has now being featured on 7 billion devices worldwide and adoption of Gorilla Glass 6 expanding. We continue to innovate in new categories and expect further adoption of new products in the second half.
Turning to the automotive market. We expect to double sales by 2023 driven by gas particulate filter adoption and our new auto glass solutions business. As I already noted, many companies in the auto industry are dropping expectations. We're generating double-digit growth and ramping new capacity. In one new plant, we are now producing large parts to serve the growing pipeline of projects awarded to our Automotive Glass Solutions business. 
In another, we're capturing exhilarating demand for gasoline particulate filters, and not only are we making great progress building a $500 million GPF business, we are growing faster than we expected. We now expect GPF sales to exceed $200 million for the full year. 
Our market leadership for this new technology was publicly recognized by 2 customers in the first half of 2019. We received the Daimler Supplier Award in March, and just recently, we also won the Volkswagen Group Award. We were 1 just 8 suppliers honored in the global performance campaign category, chosen from Volkswagen global network of 40,000 suppliers.
Turning to Life Science vessels, we aim to outpace the industry by more than 2x. We've recently increased manufacturing capacity for several key products used in cell and gene therapy development and production. Our growth is also supported by the increasing need for safety and quality in the packaging of injectable drugs. On this front, we continue to make strong progress on the path to a new, long-term multibillion franchise with Valor Glass. 
In Display, our goal is to stabilize returns, and we are successfully delivering. The growth driver for display glass is large size TVs, which are most efficiently produced by our customers on Gen 10.5 apps. We continued our leadership in quarter 2 with the announcement of 2 new Gen 10.5 plants. Corning now has 3 of the planned 4 Gen 10.5 facilities in the world, and we are thrilled about pricing. 
Third quarter glass prices are expected to remain consistent with quarter 2. Yes, you heard me correctly. Third quarter prices should be approximately flat to quarter 2. As a result, of the glass of pricing through 3 quarters, we now expect full year glass prices to only decline in the low- to mid-single-digit range.
Across our markets, our relationships with industry-leading customers are creating new opportunities for collaboration, and our strategic investments are paying off. We're capturing opportunities in generating significant top and bottom line growth in multiple businesses. I look forward to sharing our progress against our new objectives over the next 4 years. 
Now let me turn the call over to Tony for more details."
173840,626731730,1783124,"Corning Incorporated, Q2 2019 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2019",2019-07-30,"Earnings Calls","Corning Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Wendell, and good morning.

We had another excellent quarter. Year-over-year, we grew sales 8%, net income 14% and earnings per share 18%, with sales and earnings growth in every business segment, and we did this all while continuing to invest for a long-term growth.
Before I get into the details of our performance and results, I want to note that the largest difference between our GAAP and core results are a noncash mark-to-market adjustment for our currency hedge contracts and a change in our tax reserves. With respect to mark-to-market adjustments, GAAP accounting requires earning translations hedge contracts and foreign debts settling in future periods to be mark-to-market and recorded at current value at the end of each quarter, even though these contracts will not be settled in the current quarter. 
For us, this reduced GAAP earnings in Q2. To be clear, this mark-to-market accounting has no impact on our cash flow.
Our currency hedges protect us economically from foreign exchange rate fluctuations and provide higher certainty for our earnings and cash flow, our ability to invest for growth and our future shareholder distributions. Our non-GAAP, or core results, provide additional transparency into operations by using a constant currency rate aligned with the economics of our underlying transactions. We're very pleased with our hedging program and the economic certainty it provides. We've received $1.7 billion in cash under our hedge contracts since their inception more than 5 years ago.
That brings me to our results and outlook. For the second quarter, sales were up 8% year-over-year to $3 billion, net income rose 14% to $410 million, and EPS was $0.45, up 18%.
Our strong growth results from our technology and manufacturing leadership. We are benefiting from recent investments, including capacity expansions for optical fiber and cable, Gen 10.5 display glass, gasoline particulate filters and multiple development projects, such as advanced glass for mobile devices and automotive.
We are very pleased with how these investments are playing out, and we're continuing to invest. We're bringing new plants online this year, creating capacity for committed demand and driving additional sales growth in 2019 and beyond. Capital spending in Q2 totaled $570 million, and we expect to spend just over $2 billion in 2019 with programs in every market access platform.
Now let's look at the detailed segment results and outlook. In Display Technology, our goal is to stabilize returns, and we had a very strong quarter. Second quarter sales were $848 million, up 9% year-over-year, and net income was up 11% year-over-year. Second quarter sequential glass price declines were moderate and even better than we expected. 
As Wendell said, we expect third quarter glass prices to be approximately flat to Q2. As a result of aggressive pricing through 3 quarters, we now expect full year glass prices to decline in the low- to mid-single digits versus our prior guidance of mid-single digits. Three factors drives overview of this favorable pricing environment will continue. First, we expect glass supply to continue to be balanced to demand, or even tight; second, our competitors continue to face profitability challenges at current pricing levels; and third, display glass manufacturing requires periodic investments in existing capacity to maintain operations. Absolute glass prices must support acceptable returns on those investments. 
For Corning, we will only add capacity if we can get an attractive return for our shareholders.
In the second quarter, the display glass market volume grew mid-single digits year-over-year, and our volume grew faster, as expected, due to the ramp of our Gen 10.5 plant. Now, while and market demand is meeting our expectations, as you've been hearing recently, some panel makers have lowered their utilization. Therefore, for the third quarter of 2019, we expect the display glass market volume to be roughly consistent year-over-year, and to decrease by a low-single-digit percentage sequentially. However, our volume is expected to be up year-over-year, again, due to the Gen 10.5 ramp and decreased low-single-digit sequentially, in line with the market.
Now, for the full year, despite this anticipated weaker third quarter, we continue to expect to outperform the market by delivering volume growth in the high single digits, driven by Gen 10.5. 
In summary, we remain very pleased with the current pricing dynamics in our Display business, and our ability to capture Gen 10.5 glass growth to deliver stable returns.
Let's move to Optical Communications. In the second quarter, sales were $1.1 billion, up 2% sequentially and 7% year-over-year. Net income of $158 million and grew 11% sequentially and 5% year-over-year. Growth was driven by multiyear data center projects, fiber sales and the addition of sales from our 3M communications markets division acquisition. Now in spite of a strong first-half, we are reducing our expectations for the year. We entered 2019 projecting the global passive optical market to increase by more than 5%, and our sales to grow in the low teens. We now believe that the global market will be down mid-to-high single digits, and that our sales will be up in the low- to mid-single digits. 
Now we see weakness primarily, in the carrier market. Since the last earnings call, several large build projects we projected for the second half of the year have been pushed out, and multiple carriers have reduced CapEx for the remainder of the year. We see delays in Fiber-to-the-Home builds at several Tier 2 carriers, slower deployment at North America cable operators and fiber densification for next generation wireless has not yet gained momentum outside the early leaders.
Also we have further reduced our expectations for the 2019 China market and are now seeing related weakness in India and Southeast Asia. The delay in China mobile tender announced earlier this year resulted in surplus inventory, which is currently being absorbed in these regions. Now, we continue to execute well against factors in our control, and our growth remains significantly above the market. 
For the third quarter, we expect sales to be consistent sequentially and down low single digits versus an exceptional third quarter in 2018.
Environmental Technology's second quarter sales were $366 million, up 15% year-over-year and ahead of expectations, driven by ramping GPFs sales and continued strong demand in North America heavy-duty market. Net income grew 20%. We are well on our way to be building a $500 million gasoline particulate filter business. European regulations are in full effect, and automakers in China are preparing for full China 6 implementation in 2020. The market is developing faster than we planned, and we're winning more platforms than we anticipated. We sustained our majority position of awarded platforms to date with additional wins, particularly as OEMs prepare for China 6 implementation.
As a result, we now expect GPF sales to exceed $200 million in 2019 and to grow robustly thereafter.
Based on our accelerating demand, we now expect full year sales to be up by a low-teen percentage percent versus our prior expectations of 10%. We also expect third quarter sales to be up by a low teens percent year-over-year.
In Specialty Materials, second quarter sales were $369 million, up 8% year-over-year and driven by continued strong demand for the company's portfolio of Mobile Consumer Electronics glass solutions. Net income was up 5%.
For the third quarter, we expect sales to be up approximately 25% sequentially and consistent year-over-year. We continue to expect full year growth, again, in 2019, despite a maturing smartphone market, exactly how much will depend on the adoption rate of our innovations. Our results and outlook demonstrate the value of our premium glasses and the strength of our innovation portfolio.
In Life Sciences, second quarter sales were $260 million, up 6% year-over-year. Net income was up 29% year-over-year. Manufacturing performance and operating leverage were outstanding. For both the third quarter and the year, we expect sales to be at mid-single digits year-over-year.
In summary, we had an excellent second quarter with strong performance across the company. The benefits of our recent investments are contributing to results. All of our businesses have solid momentum relative to their markets, and we are on track for sales growth for full year 2019. 
Now let's move to the consolidated income statement. Second quarter gross margin was 40.1%, a slight increase from the first quarter. As I described last quarter, we are continuing to invest, while we build, startup, ramp and optimize new facilities associated cost offset some of the lower leverage on our gross margin line.
For the second half of 2019, we expect gross margin to be slightly better than the first half. This is less than we thought in April because of lower-than-expected sales in Optical as well as higher-than-expected cost in Display. 
In our Gen 10.5 facility, we're bringing up new technology, ramping volume and improving our cost, just not as quickly as we expected. We are excited about our Gen 10.5 projects because they enable us to capture the majority of the market growth and will, ultimately, provide a step change in glass manufacturing.
From an operating margin standpoint, we expect the second half to expand over the first half. 
Moving to additional outlook details, we expect other income, other expenses to be approximately $250 million for the full year. Full year gross equity earnings are expected to be approximately $210 million, predominantly from Hemlock Semiconductor, with the third quarter at approximately $20 million to $25 million versus second quarter 2019 gross equity earnings of $28 million. And we expect our effective tax rate for 2019 to be approximately 20%, consistent with Q2.
In closing, we had an excellent first half with sales and MPEG growth in every one of our businesses. As we discussed, most companies are facing uncertainty and macroeconomic headwinds right now. We feel these headwinds as well, but our solid execution against the factors within our control is evident in our strong first half and makes us confidence in our ability to grow every business for the full year. Now we are not immune to challenges, but we are more resilient than ever. Our portfolio and emphasis on capturing technology substitutions enable us to outpace the markets we served. As conditions improved, our growth will accelerate. 
Our confidence is reflected in the long-term growth targets we've laid out in our 2020 to 2023 Strategy & Growth Framework.
There are exciting opportunities across our market access platforms. We are becoming increasingly relevant to the trends fueling those markets, and that allows us to capture more opportunities and products and categories where we are already the leaders. I look forward to sharing progress on our framework in the months and years ahead. With that, let's move to Q&A. Ann?"

I think the big change statement here is that we had expected gross margin to go to 41% to 42% in the back half. And now we're looking at it to be slightly better than the first half and it's really there are 2 drivers on this. I mean the first is what's happening in the Optical Communications sales. This is all driven in the carrier market where we've gone from low-teen sales at the beginning of the year to low- to mid-single digits. And there's incremental profitability on the sales are high, given that we have all the fixed cost infrastructure in place so we see margin compression for COC in the company as though sales don't occur. And then the second area is higher than expected cost in display and that is really driving -- is really been driven by -- as we bring up our new technology and ramping volume and improving our cost in Gen 10.5, it's just not happening as quickly as we expected. So that is the big change statement over what we'd expected a quarter ago. In terms of operating margin, we did expand operating margin in the first half of the year versus last year, and we expect to expand operating margin in the second half of the year. And so, from our standpoint, as we've discussed, that's the most important of the metrics because of the operating leverage that we get as we grew sales."

And that is because, in the first half, we have working capital growth to increase -- to support our increased sales. And we also have some significant annual payments that occur in the first half related to compensation, tax payments and legal settlements. And that's exactly what's happened this year. I mean our operating cash flow for the first half is about $150 million, and included in that is a built-in working capital of about $500 million. Now that's a couple million, maybe more than what you would normally expect, which is mostly an inventory. And the reason for that is that we have significant new products like GPF, Gen 10.5, some of our new innovations in Specialty Materials, it's also a little bit higher than you'd expected because we thought, at in the beginning of the year, optical coverage and that will be a little bit stronger in terms of sales and now it's a little bit less than that. But we expect that inventory to correct itself in the second half, and we expect, just like in most years are all years, will generate more operating cash flow in the back half. So I think, we are confident that we will end up with free cash flow for the year and this is just the normal cycle that we have."

Sort of all lights are flashing green on that we're right with the point of view we laid out over 2 years ago that 5G is going to equal significant network densification, which in turn means, glassification, which means more demand for our innovation. And you're right, all you tend to be hearing is confirmatory data on that topic. So that's what we're hearing as well. So we are increasingly confident of our long-term predictions of which architecture events for 5G and that's a bully signal for us. 
Now then the next piece has to be happen. These are significant capital projects, and our customers needed to get themselves organized, make the decision and then begin to make those investments.

So I think that what we're trying to do is be right on the architecture in the long-term demand cycle and then be able to support our customers as they gear up. 
The good news here is this isn't going to be subtle. As our customers announce and decide there going to roll and how they're going to roll in 5G, they'll talk about it, all the different cities that they're going to go to will talk about it. And in a way, you'll see the normal cycle of the announcement piece getting a little bit ahead of demand, and then demand will follow and will have a hard time keeping up."

So for us, it's a little like our -- the walk-through that I just did on optical. We've got 2 levels that we try to align. The first is the long-term technology substitution curves for our innovations. And as you remember from the Investor Day, the core of our growth story is a content story, which is what we expect over the coming 4 years is more and more of our innovations to be adopted into the products that people buy. And then that is our primary growth driver as opposed to how much of everything everybody buys or what type of economy do we face. We continue to get nothing, but positive signals on those items, whether it's in Optical or in the areas that you just named, automotive. So here we are in a time period when you see declining forecast of overall automotive sales and production, but we're projecting growth in the teams because of more and more of our content. Similar things we would expect to happen in the Valor story. We, once again, tend to have confirmatory evidence that we're in the right side of that substitution curve. Optical, very much the same as you heard in my answer. And in Specialty Materials or Mobile Consumer Electronic business, also much the same. So that's the first level. We feel pretty good about that. Then [indiscernible], how does the timing of that substitution curve play out, and how does that interact with the overall demand for our customers? Now that you can get a little more noise in in the near term, and we certainly experiencing some of that.

So first, I think you quite wisely pointing out that, once again, we've seen some regional shift in the display market. we follow date from Japan to Korea to Taiwan and then in China. What we try to do with each of those moves is enhance our position in each new region, and we've done that, again, here. So we're very well-positioned for the direction with which we see panel production shifting. So that's the first strategic level. 
Now, embedded in there, of course, I think you're making a wise comment, which is, then what happens to the sort of panel production capability, glass production in the regions that will be relatively weaker relative to China. So in that, you're seeing a combination of things happen. First, shifts to new and more advanced display technologies, right? Which we're supporting with the newer and more advanced glass types. Second, you're seeing optimization of our network of supply of glass, and you can expect to see us to continue to optimize that to always make use of capital that we have in place to serve our number of our growing different glass markets. So we'll expect us to continue to optimize our cost structure, optimize our glass supply, and then support our customers in those previous regions so that innovation aspirations. and their market diversification. Like for instance, in Taiwan, we're seeing a nice buildup of capabilities to address the automotive industry, which are going very nicely with our automotive glass opportunity sets. So that's the way we're going to work through it all. 
Now I can't pass this answer to your question without noting that you said, pricing continue to be flat in Display. We are not taking that yet for a long-term, just saying is we expect other rate have declined to continue to improve and for our glass returns to stabilize, we're not predicting the glass prices remain flat for the foreseeable future."

This morning, we reported excellent results that keep us on track for growth in 2019 and beyond. Our performance demonstrates the strength of Corning's portfolio and our ability to deliver for shareholders in a mixed macro environment.
Looking at the second quarter, sales were $3 billion, up 8% year-over-year. Net income of $410 million grew faster than sales at 14% year-over-year, driven by operating margin expansion. And EPS was $0.45, up 18% year-over-year. Segment sales growth rates ranged from the mid-single digits to mid-teens, and we grew earnings in all segments.
Highlights from the quarter include: Optical Communications met expectations, delivering high single-digit sales growth, driven by data center and fiber demand. Environmental Technologies delivered 15% year-over-year sales growth, driven by the accelerating adoption of our gasoline particulate filters and continued strong demand in the North American heavy-duty market.
Life Science sales were up 6% year-over-year with net income growing much faster than sales, up 29% year-over-year. Specialty Materials sales were up 8% year-over-year on the strength of Gorilla Glass and our other innovations. Display continues to deliver stable returns with second quarter sales and net income up significantly year-over-year and better-than-expected pricing.
Our performance stems from the successful execution of our 4-year strategy and capital allocation framework introduced in October of 2015. Under the framework, we targeted returning more than $12.5 billion to our shareholders through repurchases and dividends, while investing $10 billion to extend our leadership and deliver growth. We surpassed our 4-year goal of $12.5 billion by returning more than $300 million to shareholders during the second quarter. And we're seeing the benefit of our investments in our first half year-over-year performance and in our expectations for the second half of 2019.
Of course, as you've all seen this earnings season, many companies are facing uncertainty and macroeconomic headwinds, and we are not immune to economic downturns or trade disputes or other geopolitical upsets, but we are more resilient than at any other time in our history. Across the company, while the end markets we serve are experiencing downward growth revisions and many of our competitors are not growing at all, we continued to outpace the markets.
In the auto market, global auto production is down, but we expect sales growth in our environmental business to be in the low teens this year. Retail television sell-through forecasts are declining in units, but we expect Display volume and sales growth this year. Smartphone unit sales are also forecasted to be down, but we are growing Gorilla Glass sales this year as well.
In Life Sciences, the industry is relatively immune to economic headwinds, so it is growing in its typical low single-digit rate, but we expect mid-single-digit growth of our Life Science business this year.
And finally, in Optical Communications, we now expect the passive optical market to be down. Earlier in the year, we projected the market to be up 5% and for our sales to grow in the low teens. We now expect the market to be down mid-to high single digits and for our sales to grow low to mid single digits. While the growth is lower than previously expected, it is still very positive relative to the market. You'll hear more details from Tony on the current dynamics.
So the good news is, even in this environment, we are growing. And when markets improve, we'll grow even more. We are confident in our long-term growth prospects. The successful execution of our Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework adds to our confidence. We face challenges along our path to grow throughout our 2016 to 2019 plan, but we addressed those challenges and met or exceeded all our goals. In so doing, we created a bigger stronger company, and we created a strong foundation for significant additional growth.
Our new Strategy & Growth Framework sets our leadership priorities for 2020 to 2023. It's our original framework evolved for a new growth era. We will continue to focus our portfolio and utilize our financial strength. We plan to return $8 billion to $10 billion to shareholders and to invest $10 billion to $12 billion in growth and extending our leadership. We expect a sales compound annual growth rate of 6% to 8% and an EPS compound annual growth rate of 12% to 15% and annual dividends per share growth of at least 10%.
Our capabilities are becoming increasingly vital and multiple trends are driving growth across multiple businesses and in multiple geographies.
In Optical Communications, we are on track to deliver growth twice as fast as the passive optical market, driven by opportunities in 5G and next-gen hyperscale. Recently, CenturyLink announced that it is using Corning fiber to build the largest ultra-low loss fiber network in North America. They are connecting more than 50 major cities throughout the U.S. and will soon expand into parts of Europe as well, creating a 4.7 million mile fiber network.
In the second half, we're going to be introducing next generation solutions that enable 5G and access networks to be installed faster and reduce the total cost of ownership. While pauses may occur as network operators transition between projects, photons replacing electrons in network after network provides a strong upward trajectory over longer periods.
In Mobile Consumer Electronics, we are well on our way to doubling sales despite a maturing smartphone market. As the world leader in glass for smartphones, tablets and emerging categories like wearables and augmented reality devices, we expect to continue capturing more value per device. Gorilla Glass has now been featured on 7 billion devices worldwide and adoption of Gorilla Glass 6 is expanding. We continue to innovate in new categories and expect further adoption of new products in the second half.
Turning to the automotive market. We expect to double sales by 2023, driven by gas particulate filter adoption and our new auto glass solutions business. As I already noted, many companies in the auto industry are dropping expectations. We're generating double-digit growth and ramping new capacity. In one new plant, we're now producing large parts to serve the growing pipeline of projects awarded to our Automotive Glass Solutions business.
In another, we're capturing accelerating demand for gasoline particulate filters. And not only are we making great progress building a $500 million GPF business, we're growing faster than we expected. We now expect GPF sales to exceed $200 million for the full year.
Our market leadership for this new technology was publicly recognized by 2 customers in the first half of 2019. We received the Daimler Supplier Award in March. And just recently, we also won the Volkswagen Group Award. We were 1 of just 8 suppliers honored in the Global Performance Champion category, chosen from Volkswagen's global network of 40,000 suppliers.
Turning to Life Science vessels, we aim to outpace the industry by more than 2x. We've recently increased manufacturing capacity for several key products used in cell and gene therapy development and production. Our growth is also supported by the increasing need for safety and quality in the packaging of injectable drugs. On this front, we continue to make strong progress on the path to a new, long-term multibillion franchise with Valor Glass.
In Display, our goal is to stabilize returns, and we are successfully delivering. The growth driver for display glass is large-size TVs, which are most efficiently produced by our customers on Gen 10.5 fabs. We continued our leadership in quarter 2 with the announcement of 2 new Gen 10.5 plants. Corning now has 3 of the planned 4 Gen 10.5 facilities in the world, and we are thrilled about pricing.
Third quarter glass prices are expected to remain consistent with quarter 2. Yes, you heard me correctly. Third quarter prices should be approximately flat to quarter 2. As a result, of the glass pricing through 3 quarters, we now expect full year glass prices to only decline in the low to mid single digit range.
Across our markets, our relationships with industry-leading customers are creating new opportunities for collaboration, and our strategic investments are paying off. We're capturing opportunities in generating significant top and bottom line growth in multiple businesses. I look forward to sharing our progress against our new objectives over the next 4 years.
Now let me turn the call over to Tony for more details."

We had another excellent quarter. Year-over-year, we grew sales 8%, net income 14% and earnings per share 18% with sales and earnings growth in every business segment, and we did this all while continuing to invest for long-term growth.
Before I get into the details of our performance and results, I want to note that the largest difference between our GAAP and core results are a noncash mark-to-market adjustment for our currency hedge contracts and a change in our tax reserves. With respect to mark-to-market adjustments, GAAP accounting requires earning translation hedge contracts and foreign debts settling in future periods to be mark-to-market and recorded at current value at the end of each quarter, even though these contracts will not be settled in the current quarter. For us, this reduced GAAP earnings in Q2. To be clear, this mark-to-market accounting has no impact on our cash flow.
Our currency hedges protect us economically from foreign exchange rate fluctuations and provide higher certainty for our earnings and cash flow, our ability to invest for growth and our future shareholder distributions. Our non-GAAP or core results provide additional transparency into operations by using a constant currency rate aligned with the economics of our underlying transactions.
We're very pleased with our hedging program and the economic certainty it provides. We've received $1.7 billion in cash under our hedge contracts since their inception more than 5 years ago.
That brings me to our results and outlook. For the second quarter, sales were up 8% year-over-year to $3 billion, net income rose 14% to $410 million and EPS was $0.45, up 18%. Our strong growth results from our technology and manufacturing leadership. We are benefiting from recent investments, including capacity expansions for optical fiber and cable, Gen 10.5 display glass, gasoline particulate filters and multiple development projects such as advanced glass for mobile devices and automotive.
We are very pleased with how these investments are playing out, and we are continuing to invest. We are bringing new plants online this year, creating capacity for committed demand and driving additional sales growth in 2019 and beyond. Capital spending in Q2 totaled $570 million, and we expect to spend just over $2 billion in 2019 with programs in every market access platform.
Now let's look at the detailed segment results and outlook. In Display Technology, our goal is to stabilize returns, and we had a very strong quarter. Second quarter sales were $848 million, up 9% year-over-year and net income was up 11% year-over-year. Second quarter sequential glass price declines were moderate and even better than we expected.
As Wendell said, we expect third quarter glass prices to be approximately flat to Q2. As a result of the glass pricing through 3 quarters, we now expect full year glass prices to decline in the low to mid single digits versus our prior guidance of mid-single digits.
Now 3 factors drive our view that this favorable pricing environment will continue. First, we expect glass supply to continue to be balanced to demand or even tight. Second, our competitors continue to face profitability challenges at current pricing levels. And third, display glass manufacturing requires periodic investments in existing capacity to maintain operations. Absolute glass prices must support acceptable returns on those investments. For Corning, we will only add capacity if we can get an attractive return for our shareholders.
In the second quarter, the display glass market volume grew mid-single digits year-over-year and our volume grew faster, as expected, due to the ramp of our Gen 10.5 plant. Now while end market demand is meeting our expectations, as you've been hearing recently, some panel makers have lowered their utilization. Therefore, for the third quarter of 2019, we expect the display glass market volume to be roughly consistent year-over-year and to decrease by a low single-digit percentage sequentially. However, our volume is expected to be up year-over-year, again, due to the Gen 10.5 ramp and decrease low single-digit sequentially, in line with the market.
Now for the full year, despite this anticipated weaker third quarter, we continue to expect to outperform the market by delivering volume growth in the high single digits, driven by Gen 10.5.
In summary, we remain very pleased with the current pricing dynamics in our Display business and our ability to capture Gen 10.5 glass growth to deliver stable returns.
Let's move to Optical Communications. In the second quarter, sales were $1.1 billion, up 2% sequentially and 7% year-over-year. Net income of $158 million grew 11% sequentially and 5% year-over-year. Growth was driven by multiyear data center projects, fiber sales and the addition of sales from our 3M Communications Markets division acquisition.
Now in spite of our strong first half, we are reducing our expectations for the year. We entered 2019 projecting the global passive optical market to increase by more than 5% and our sales to grow in the low teens. We now believe that the global market will be down mid-to high single digits and that our sales will be up in the low to mid single digits.
We see weakness primarily in the carrier market. Since the last earnings call, several large build projects we projected for the second half of the year have been pushed out and multiple carriers have reduced CapEx for the remainder of the year. We see delays in Fiber to the Home builds at several Tier 2 carriers, slower deployment at North America cable operators and fiber densification for next generation wireless has not yet gained momentum outside the early leaders.
Also we have further reduced our expectations for the 2019 China market and are now seeing related weakness in India and Southeast Asia. The delay in China Mobile's tender announced earlier this year resulted in surplus inventory, which is currently being absorbed in these regions.
Now we continue to execute well against factors in our control, and our growth remains significantly above the market. For the third quarter, we expect sales to be consistent sequentially and down low single digits versus an exceptional third quarter in 2018.
Environmental Technology's second quarter sales were $366 million, up 15% year-over-year and ahead of expectations, driven by ramping GPF sales and continued strong demand in North America heavy-duty market. Net income grew 20%. We are well on our way to building a $500 million gasoline particulate filter business. European regulations are in full effect, and automakers in China are preparing for full China 6 implementation in 2020. The market is developing faster than we planned and we are winning more platforms than we anticipated. We sustained our majority position of awarded platforms to date with additional wins, particularly as OEMs prepare for China 6 implementation. As a result, we now expect GPF sales to exceed $200 million in 2019 and to grow robustly thereafter.
Based on our accelerating demand, we now expect full year sales to be up by a low-teen percentage versus our prior expectation of 10%. We also expect third quarter sales to be up by a low teens percent year-over-year.
In Specialty Materials, second quarter sales were $369 million, up 8% year-over-year and driven by continued strong demand for the company's portfolio of Mobile Consumer Electronics glass solutions. Net income was up 5%.
For the third quarter, we expect sales to be up approximately 25% sequentially and consistent year-over-year. We continue to expect full year growth, again, in 2019 despite a maturing smartphone market. Exactly how much will depend on the adoption rate of our innovations. Our results and outlook demonstrate the value of our premium glasses and the strength of our innovation portfolio.
In Life Sciences, second quarter sales were $260 million, up 6% year-over-year. Net income was up 29% year-over-year. Manufacturing performance and operating leverage were outstanding. For both the third quarter and the year, we expect sales to be at mid-single digits year-over-year.
In summary, we had an excellent second quarter with strong performance across the company. The benefits of our recent investments are contributing to results. All of our businesses have solid momentum relative to their markets, and we are on track for sales growth for full year 2019.
Now let's move to the consolidated income statement. Second quarter gross margin was 40.1%, a slight increase from the first quarter. As I described last quarter, we are continuing to invest. While we build, start-up, ramp and optimize new facilities, associated costs offset some of the normal leverage on our gross margin line.
For the second half of 2019, we expect gross margin to be slightly better than the first half. This is less than we thought in April because of lower-than-expected sales in Optical as well as higher-than-expected costs in Display.
In our Gen 10.5 facility, we are bringing up new technology, ramping volume and improving our cost, just not as quickly as we expected. We are excited about our Gen 10.5 projects because they enable us to capture the majority of the market growth and will ultimately provide a step change in glass manufacturing.
From an operating margin standpoint, we expect the second half to expand over the first half.
Moving to additional outlook details, we expect other income, other expense to be approximately $250 million for the full year. Full year gross equity earnings are expected to be approximately $210 million, predominantly from Hemlock Semiconductor, with the third quarter at approximately $20 million to $25 million versus second quarter 2019 gross equity earnings of $28 million. And we expect our effective tax rate for 2019 to be approximately 20%, consistent with Q2.
In closing, we had an excellent first half with sales and NPAT growth in every one of our businesses. As we discussed, most companies are facing uncertainty and macroeconomic headwinds right now. We feel these headwinds as well, but our solid execution against the factors within our control is evident in our strong first half and makes us confident in our ability to grow every business for the full year.
Now we are not immune to challenges, but we are more resilient than ever. Our portfolio and emphasis on capturing technology substitutions enable us to outpace the markets we serve. As conditions improve, our growth will accelerate. Our confidence is reflected in the long-term growth targets we've laid out in our 2020 to 2023 Strategy & Growth Framework.
There are exciting opportunities across our market access platforms. We are becoming increasingly relevant to the trends fueling those markets and that allows us to capture more opportunities in products and categories where we are already the leaders. I look forward to sharing progress on our framework in the months and years ahead.

I think the big change statement here is that we had expected gross margin to go to 41% to 42% in the back half. And now we're looking at it to be slightly better than the first half and it's really there are 2 drivers on this. I mean the first is what's happening in our -- in the Optical Communications sales. This is all driven in the carrier market where we've gone from low-teen sales at the beginning of the year to low to mid single digits. And there's incremental profitability on these sales are high, given that we have all the fixed cost infrastructure in place, so we see margin compression for COC in the company as though sales don't occur. And then the second area is the higher than expected cost in display and that is really driving -- has really been driven by -- as we bring up our new technology and ramping volume and improving our cost in Gen 10.5, it's just not happening as quickly as we expected. So that is the big change statement over what we'd expected a quarter ago.
In terms of operating margin, we did expand operating margin in the first half of the year versus last year, and we expect to expand operating margin in the second half of the year. And so from our standpoint, as we have discussed, that's the most important of the metrics because of the operating leverage that we get as we grow sales."

And that is because in the first half, we have working capital growth to support our increased sales. And we also have some significant annual payments that occur in the first half related to compensation, tax payments and legal settlements. And that's exactly what's happened this year. I mean our operating cash flow for the first half is about $150 million and included in that is a built-in working capital of about $500 million.
Now that's a couple hundred million dollars, maybe more than what you would normally expect, which is mostly an inventory. And the reason for that is that we have significant new products like GPF, Gen 10.5, some of our new innovations in Specialty Materials, it's also a little bit higher than you'd expect because we thought at the beginning of the year, Optical Communications would be a little bit stronger in terms of sales and now it's a little bit less than that. But we expect that inventory to correct itself in the second half and we expect, just like in most years or in all years, will generate more operating cash flow in the back half. So I think we're confident that we will end up with free cash flow for the year and this is just the normal cycle that we have."

Sort of all lights are flashing green on that we're right with the point of view we laid out over 2 years ago that 5G is going to equal significant network densification, which in turn means glassification, which means more demand for our innovations. And you're right, all you tend to be hearing is confirmatory data on that topic. So that's what we're hearing as well. So we are increasingly confident of our long-term projections of which architecture wins for 5G and that's a bullish signal for us.
Now then the next piece has to be happen. These are significant capital projects, and our customers need to get themselves organized, make the decision and then begin to make those investments. Now in that, timing can be difficult to all. And what we're seeing right now is that people are waiting a little bit. There's sort of a gap between projects other than the sort of real leaders in 5G.

All the different cities that they're going to go to, we'll talk about it.

So for us, it's a little like the walk-through that I just did on Optical. We've got 2 levels that we try to align. The first is the long-term technology substitution curves for our innovations. And as you remember from the Investor Day, the core of our growth story is a content story, which is what we expect over the coming 4 years is more and more of our innovations to be adopted into the products that people buy. And that is our primary growth driver as opposed to how much of everything everybody buys or what type of economy do we face.
We continue to get nothing, but positive signals on those items, whether it's in Optical or in the areas that you just named, automotive. So here we are in a time period when you see declining forecasts of overall automotive sales and production, but we are projecting growth in the teens because of more and more of our content. Similar things we would expect to happen in the Valor story. We once again tend to have confirmatory evidence that we're on the right side of that substitution curve. Optical, very much the same as you heard in my answer. And in Specialty Materials, our Mobile Consumer Electronics business, also much the same.

The next then comes to how does the timing of that substitution curve play out and how does that interact with overall demand for our customers? Now that you can get a little more noise in, in the near term and we're certainly experiencing some of that.

We're also seeing some knock on effects in India and South East Asia primarily, and we've incorporated all that into our outlook for our Optical Communications business."

So first, let's deal with the 5G one because I think there's -- the way to understand 5G is how quickly does it start and expand beyond some of the few early adopters and leaders? So it's less people like changing deeply their 5G plans, if them arriving at their 5G plans and how they're going to deploy and then get that rolling? That's sort of the next leg of growth. And for us, when that clicks in exactly -- when it clicks in, it will be very significant in growth. When it happens is sort of hard to call. Meanwhile, what we see in our near-term results is more having to do with the pieces of the carrier market that dealt with particular projects that they have on wireline, some on wireless, but it's just -- really just some delays and pushouts that they've done into 2020 rather than big significant 5G changes.
So that's why I keep saying, the 5G piece won't be subtle when it starts to hit our demand cycle. You'll see it coming. And all you're seeing in our growth this year, primarily, right, is the adoption of our previous innovations and other pieces of the network. We haven't really started to feel the big oomph from the wireless networks of the world changing from relatively fiber-poor to really fiber-rich. That's all ahead of us.
Now to your next question on, can we expect continued downward revisions in auto? I would say it is clearly our intent that, that is not the case. What we've tried to do here is guide in a way that we feel highly confident it will deliver. Now as the months go by, we'll know more and how accurate our point of view is. But it is not our intent to have a sort of sliding set of expectations in [indiscernible]. Does that answer your question?"

Is there potential for that pricing pressure to flow downhill onto new or do you feel like you have enough leverage in terms of those customer relationships where, again, pricing can remain flat on a go-forward basis?

So first, I think you're quite wisely pointing out that once again, we're seeing some regional shift in the display market. We have followed it from Japan to Korea to Taiwan and now in China. What we try to do with each of those moves is enhance our position in each new region and we have done that again here. So we are very well positioned for the direction with which we see panel production shifting. So that's the first strategic level.
Now embedded in there, of course, I think you're making a wise comment, which is, then what happens to the sort of panel production capability and glass production capability in the regions that will be relatively weaker relative to China. So in that, you're seeing a combination of things happen. First, this shifts to newer and more advanced display technologies, right, which we're supporting with newer and more advanced glass types. Second, you're seeing optimization of our network of supply of glass and you can expect to see us to continue to optimize that to always make use of the capital that we have in place to serve our number of growing different glass markets. So we'll expect us to continue to optimize our cost structure, optimize our glass supply and then support our customers in those previous regions, so that innovation aspirations and their market diversification. Like for instance, in Taiwan, we're seeing a nice buildup of capabilities to address the automotive industry, which are going very nicely with our automotive glass opportunity sets. So that's the way we're going to work through it all.
Now I can't pass this answer to your question without noting that you said pricing continue to be flat in Display. We are not saying that yet for a long term, but we're just saying is we expect the rate of decline to continue to improve and for our glass returns to stabilize. We're not predicting the glass prices remain flat for the foreseeable future."

This morning, we reported excellent results that keep us on track for growth in 2019 and beyond. Our performance demonstrates the strength of Corning's portfolio and our ability to deliver for shareholders in a mixed macro environment.
Looking at the second quarter, sales were $3 billion, up 8% year-over-year. Net income of $410 million grew faster than sales at 14% year-over-year, driven by operating margin expansion. And EPS was $0.45, up 18% year-over-year. Segment sales growth rates ranged from the mid-single digits to mid-teens, and we grew earnings in all segments.
Highlights from the quarter include: Optical Communications met expectations, delivering high single-digit sales growth, driven by data center and fiber demand. Environmental Technologies delivered 15% year-over-year sales growth, driven by the accelerating adoption of our gasoline particulate filters and continued strong demand in the North American heavy-duty market.
Life Science sales were up 6% year-over-year with net income growing much faster than sales, up 29% year-over-year. Specialty Materials sales were up 8% year-over-year on the strength of Gorilla Glass and our other innovations. Display continues to deliver stable returns with second quarter sales and net income up significantly year-over-year and better-than-expected pricing.
Our performance stems from the successful execution of our 4-year strategy and capital allocation framework introduced in October of 2015. Under the framework, we targeted returning more than $12.5 billion to our shareholders through repurchases and dividends, while investing $10 billion to extend our leadership and deliver growth. We surpassed our 4-year goal of $12.5 billion by returning more than $300 million to shareholders during the second quarter. And we're seeing the benefit of our investments in our first half year-over-year performance and in our expectations for the second half of 2019.
Of course, as you've all seen this earnings season, many companies are facing uncertainty and macroeconomic headwinds, and we are not immune to economic downturns or trade disputes or other geopolitical upsets, but we are more resilient than at any other time in our history. Across the company, while the end markets we serve are experiencing downward growth revisions and many of our competitors are not growing at all, we continued to outpace the markets.
In the auto market, global auto production is down, but we expect sales growth in our environmental business to be in the low teens this year. Retail television sell-through forecasts are declining in units, but we expect Display volume and sales growth this year. Smartphone unit sales are also forecasted to be down, but we are growing Gorilla Glass sales this year as well.
In Life Sciences, the industry is relatively immune to economic headwinds, so it is growing in its typical low single-digit rate, but we expect mid-single-digit growth of our Life Science business this year.
And finally, in Optical Communications, we now expect the passive optical market to be down. Earlier in the year, we projected the market to be up 5% and for our sales to grow in the low teens. We now expect the market to be down mid-to high single digits and for our sales to grow low to mid single digits. While the growth is lower than previously expected, it is still very positive relative to the market. You'll hear more details from Tony on the current dynamics.
So the good news is, even in this environment, we are growing. And when markets improve, we'll grow even more. We are confident in our long-term growth prospects. The successful execution of our Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework adds to our confidence. We face challenges along our path to grow throughout our 2016 to 2019 plan, but we addressed those challenges and met or exceeded all our goals. In so doing, we created a bigger stronger company, and we created a strong foundation for significant additional growth.
Our new Strategy & Growth Framework sets our leadership priorities for 2020 to 2023. It's our original framework evolved for a new growth era. We will continue to focus our portfolio and utilize our financial strength. We plan to return $8 billion to $10 billion to shareholders and to invest $10 billion to $12 billion in growth and extending our leadership. We expect a sales compound annual growth rate of 6% to 8% and an EPS compound annual growth rate of 12% to 15% and annual dividends per share growth of at least 10%.
Our capabilities are becoming increasingly vital and multiple trends are driving growth across multiple businesses and in multiple geographies.
In Optical Communications, we are on track to deliver growth twice as fast as the passive optical market, driven by opportunities in 5G and next-gen hyperscale. Recently, CenturyLink announced that it is using Corning fiber to build the largest ultra-low loss fiber network in North America. They are connecting more than 50 major cities throughout the U.S. and will soon expand into parts of Europe as well, creating a 4.7 million mile fiber network.
In the second half, we're going to be introducing next generation solutions that enable 5G and access networks to be installed faster and reduce the total cost of ownership. While pauses may occur as network operators transition between projects, photons replacing electrons in network after network provides a strong upward trajectory over longer periods.
In Mobile Consumer Electronics, we are well on our way to doubling sales despite a maturing smartphone market. As the world leader in glass for smartphones, tablets and emerging categories like wearables and augmented reality devices, we expect to continue capturing more value per device. Gorilla Glass has now been featured on 7 billion devices worldwide and adoption of Gorilla Glass 6 is expanding. We continue to innovate in new categories and expect further adoption of new products in the second half.
Turning to the automotive market. We expect to double sales by 2023, driven by gas particulate filter adoption and our new auto glass solutions business. As I already noted, many companies in the auto industry are dropping expectations. We're generating double-digit growth and ramping new capacity. In one new plant, we're now producing large parts to serve the growing pipeline of projects awarded to our Automotive Glass Solutions business.
In another, we're capturing accelerating demand for gasoline particulate filters. And not only are we making great progress building a $500 million GPF business, we're growing faster than we expected. We now expect GPF sales to exceed $200 million for the full year.
Our market leadership for this new technology was publicly recognized by 2 customers in the first half of 2019. We received the Daimler Supplier Award in March. And just recently, we also won the Volkswagen Group Award. We were 1 of just 8 suppliers honored in the Global Performance Champion category, chosen from Volkswagen's global network of 40,000 suppliers.
Turning to Life Science vessels, we aim to outpace the industry by more than 2x. We've recently increased manufacturing capacity for several key products used in cell and gene therapy development and production. Our growth is also supported by the increasing need for safety and quality in the packaging of injectable drugs. On this front, we continue to make strong progress on the path to a new, long-term multibillion franchise with Valor Glass.
In Display, our goal is to stabilize returns, and we are successfully delivering. The growth driver for display glass is large-size TVs, which are most efficiently produced by our customers on Gen 10.5 fabs. We continued our leadership in quarter 2 with the announcement of 2 new Gen 10.5 plants. Corning now has 3 of the planned 4 Gen 10.5 facilities in the world, and we are thrilled about pricing.
Third quarter glass prices are expected to remain consistent with quarter 2. Yes, you heard me correctly. Third quarter prices should be approximately flat to quarter 2. As a result, of the glass pricing through 3 quarters, we now expect full year glass prices to only decline in the low to mid single digit range.
Across our markets, our relationships with industry-leading customers are creating new opportunities for collaboration, and our strategic investments are paying off. We're capturing opportunities in generating significant top and bottom line growth in multiple businesses. I look forward to sharing our progress against our new objectives over the next 4 years.
Now let me turn the call over to Tony for more details."

We had another excellent quarter. Year-over-year, we grew sales 8%, net income 14% and earnings per share 18% with sales and earnings growth in every business segment, and we did this all while continuing to invest for long-term growth.
Before I get into the details of our performance and results, I want to note that the largest difference between our GAAP and core results are a noncash mark-to-market adjustment for our currency hedge contracts and a change in our tax reserves. With respect to mark-to-market adjustments, GAAP accounting requires earning translation hedge contracts and foreign debts settling in future periods to be mark-to-market and recorded at current value at the end of each quarter, even though these contracts will not be settled in the current quarter. For us, this reduced GAAP earnings in Q2. To be clear, this mark-to-market accounting has no impact on our cash flow.
Our currency hedges protect us economically from foreign exchange rate fluctuations and provide higher certainty for our earnings and cash flow, our ability to invest for growth and our future shareholder distributions. Our non-GAAP or core results provide additional transparency into operations by using a constant currency rate aligned with the economics of our underlying transactions.
We're very pleased with our hedging program and the economic certainty it provides. We've received $1.7 billion in cash under our hedge contracts since their inception more than 5 years ago.
That brings me to our results and outlook. For the second quarter, sales were up 8% year-over-year to $3 billion, net income rose 14% to $410 million and EPS was $0.45, up 18%. Our strong growth results from our technology and manufacturing leadership. We are benefiting from recent investments, including capacity expansions for optical fiber and cable, Gen 10.5 display glass, gasoline particulate filters and multiple development projects such as advanced glass for mobile devices and automotive.
We are very pleased with how these investments are playing out, and we are continuing to invest. We are bringing new plants online this year, creating capacity for committed demand and driving additional sales growth in 2019 and beyond. Capital spending in Q2 totaled $570 million, and we expect to spend just over $2 billion in 2019 with programs in every market access platform.
Now let's look at the detailed segment results and outlook. In Display Technology, our goal is to stabilize returns, and we had a very strong quarter. Second quarter sales were $848 million, up 9% year-over-year and net income was up 11% year-over-year. Second quarter sequential glass price declines were moderate and even better than we expected.
As Wendell said, we expect third quarter glass prices to be approximately flat to Q2. As a result of the glass pricing through 3 quarters, we now expect full year glass prices to decline in the low to mid single digits versus our prior guidance of mid-single digits.
Now 3 factors drive our view that this favorable pricing environment will continue. First, we expect glass supply to continue to be balanced to demand, or even tight. Second, our competitors continue to face profitability challenges at current pricing levels. And third, display glass manufacturing requires periodic investments in existing capacity to maintain operations. Absolute glass prices must support acceptable returns on those investments. For Corning, we will only add capacity if we can get an attractive return for our shareholders.
In the second quarter, the display glass market volume grew mid-single digits year-over-year and our volume grew faster, as expected, due to the ramp of our Gen 10.5 plant. Now while end-market demand is meeting our expectations, as you've been hearing recently, some panel makers have lowered their utilization. Therefore, for the third quarter of 2019, we expect the display glass market volume to be roughly consistent year-over-year and to decrease by a low single-digit percentage sequentially. However, our volume is expected to be up year-over-year, again, due to the Gen 10.5 ramp and decrease low single-digit sequentially, in line with the market.
Now for the full year, despite this anticipated weaker third quarter, we continue to expect to outperform the market by delivering volume growth in the high single digits, driven by Gen 10.5.
In summary, we remain very pleased with the current pricing dynamics in our Display business and our ability to capture Gen 10.5 glass growth to deliver stable returns.
Let's move to Optical Communications. In the second quarter, sales were $1.1 billion, up 2% sequentially and 7% year-over-year. Net income of $158 million grew 11% sequentially and 5% year-over-year. Growth was driven by multiyear data center projects, fiber sales and the addition of sales from our 3M Communications Markets division acquisition.
Now in spite of our strong first half, we are reducing our expectations for the year. We entered 2019 projecting the global passive optical market to increase by more than 5% and our sales to grow in the low teens. We now believe that the global market will be down mid-to high single digits and that our sales will be up in the low to mid single digits.
We see weakness primarily in the carrier market. Since the last earnings call, several large build projects we projected for the second half of the year have been pushed out and multiple carriers have reduced CapEx for the remainder of the year. We see delays in Fiber to the Home builds at several Tier 2 carriers, slower deployment at North America cable operators and fiber densification for next generation wireless has not yet gained momentum outside the early leaders.
Also we have further reduced our expectations for the 2019 China market and are now seeing related weakness in India and Southeast Asia. The delay in China Mobile's tender announced earlier this year resulted in surplus inventory, which is currently being absorbed in these regions.
Now we continue to execute well against factors in our control, and our growth remains significantly above the market. For the third quarter, we expect sales to be consistent sequentially and down low single digits versus an exceptional third quarter in 2018.
Environmental Technology's second quarter sales were $366 million, up 15% year-over-year and ahead of expectations, driven by ramping GPF sales and continued strong demand in North America heavy-duty market. Net income grew 20%. We are well on our way to building a $500 million gasoline particulate filter business. European regulations are in full effect, and automakers in China are preparing for full China 6 implementation in 2020. The market is developing faster than we planned and we are winning more platforms than we anticipated. We sustained our majority position of awarded platforms to date with additional wins, particularly as OEMs prepare for China 6 implementation. As a result, we now expect GPF sales to exceed $200 million in 2019 and to grow robustly thereafter.
Based on our accelerating demand, we now expect full year sales to be up by a low-teen percentage versus our prior expectation of 10%. We also expect third quarter sales to be up by a low teens percent year-over-year.
In Specialty Materials, second quarter sales were $369 million, up 8% year-over-year and driven by continued strong demand for the company's portfolio of Mobile Consumer Electronics glass solutions. Net income was up 5%.
For the third quarter, we expect sales to be up approximately 25% sequentially and consistent year-over-year. We continue to expect full year growth, again, in 2019 despite a maturing smartphone market. Exactly how much will depend on the adoption rate of our innovations. Our results and outlook demonstrate the value of our premium glasses and the strength of our innovation portfolio.
In Life Sciences, second quarter sales were $260 million, up 6% year-over-year. Net income was up 29% year-over-year. Manufacturing performance and operating leverage were outstanding. For both the third quarter and the year, we expect sales to be at mid-single digits year-over-year.
In summary, we had an excellent second quarter with strong performance across the company. The benefits of our recent investments are contributing to results. All of our businesses have solid momentum relative to their markets, and we are on track for sales growth for full year 2019.
Now let's move to the consolidated income statement. Second quarter gross margin was 40.1%, a slight increase from the first quarter. As I described last quarter, we are continuing to invest. While we build, start-up, ramp and optimize new facilities, associated costs offset some of the normal leverage on our gross margin line.
For the second half of 2019, we expect gross margin to be slightly better than the first half. This is less than we thought in April because of lower-than-expected sales in Optical as well as higher-than-expected costs in Display.
In our Gen 10.5 facility, we are bringing up new technology, ramping volume and improving our cost, just not as quickly as we expected. We are excited about our Gen 10.5 projects because they enable us to capture the majority of the market growth and will ultimately provide a step change in glass manufacturing.
From an operating margin standpoint, we expect the second half to expand over the first half.
Moving to additional outlook details, we expect other income, other expense to be approximately $250 million for the full year. Full year gross equity earnings are expected to be approximately $210 million, predominantly from Hemlock Semiconductor, with the third quarter at approximately $20 million to $25 million versus second quarter 2019 gross equity earnings of $28 million. And we expect our effective tax rate for 2019 to be approximately 20%, consistent with Q2.
In closing, we had an excellent first half with sales and NPAT growth in every one of our businesses. As we discussed, most companies are facing uncertainty and macroeconomic headwinds right now. We feel these headwinds as well, but our solid execution against the factors within our control is evident in our strong first half and makes us confident in our ability to grow every business for the full year.
Now we are not immune to challenges, but we are more resilient than ever. Our portfolio and emphasis on capturing technology substitutions enable us to outpace the markets we serve. As conditions improve, our growth will accelerate. Our confidence is reflected in the long-term growth targets we've laid out in our 2020 to 2023 Strategy & Growth Framework.
There are exciting opportunities across our market access platforms. We are becoming increasingly relevant to the trends fueling those markets and that allows us to capture more opportunities in products and categories where we are already the leaders. I look forward to sharing progress on our framework in the months and years ahead.
With that, let's move to Q&A. Ann?"

I think the big change statement here is that we had expected gross margin to go to 41% to 42% in the back half. And now we're looking at it to be slightly better than the first half and it's really, there are 2 drivers on this. I mean the first is what's happening in our -- in the Optical Communications sales. This is all driven in the carrier market where we've gone from low-teen sales at the beginning of the year to low to mid single digits. And there's incremental profitability on these sales are high, given that we have all the fixed cost infrastructure in place, so we see margin compression for COC in the company as those sales don't occur. And then the second area is the higher than expected cost in display and that is really driving -- is really been driven by -- as we bring up our new technology and ramping volume and improving our cost in Gen 10.5, it's just not happening as quickly as we expected. So that is the big change statement over what we'd expected a quarter ago.
In terms of operating margin, we did expand operating margin in the first half of the year versus last year, and we expect to expand operating margin in the second half of the year. And so from our standpoint, as we have discussed, that's the most important of the metrics because of the operating leverage that we get as we grow sales."

And that is because in the first half, we have working capital growth to support our increased sales. And we also have some significant annual payments that occur in the first half related to compensation, tax payments and legal settlements. And that's exactly what's happened this year. I mean our operating cash flow for the first half is about $150 million and included in that is a built-in working capital of about $500 million.
Now that's a couple hundred million dollars, maybe more than what you would normally expect, which is mostly in inventory. And the reason for that is that we have significant new products like GPF, Gen 10.5, some of our new innovations in Specialty Materials.  It's also a little bit higher than you'd expect because we thought at the beginning of the year, Optical Communications would be a little bit stronger in terms of sales and now it's a little bit less than that. But we expect that inventory to correct itself in the second half and we expect, just like in most years -- or in all years, will generate more operating cash flow in the back half. So I think we're confident that we will end up with free cash flow for the year and this is just the normal cycle that we have."

So Mehdi, I think you're actually right on top of it and it's just those 2 things that you need to understand around when we think about our demand cycle. First is the one that you're highlighting, which is, architecturally, which solutions win and what are folks choosing? And then second is, how quickly do our customers put it in? So you're right. Sort of all lights are flashing green on that we're right with the point of view we laid out over 2 years ago that 5G is going to equal significant network densification, which in turn means glassification, which means more demand for our innovations. And you're right, all you tend to be hearing is confirmatory data on that topic. So that's what we're hearing as well. So we are increasingly confident of our long-term projections of which architecture wins for 5G and that's a bullish signal for us.
Now then the next piece has to be happen. These are significant capital projects, and our customers need to get themselves organized, make the decision and then begin to make those investments. Now in that, timing can be difficult to all. And what we're seeing right now is that people are waiting a little bit. There's sort of a little gap between projects other than the sort of real leaders in 5G. They're putting their plans together, they're getting their financing house in order and getting their alliances in place that then we would expect the demand that you're pointing to, to occur. Does that make sense to you?"

So I think that what we're trying to do is be right on the architecture in the long-term demand cycle and then be able to support our customers as they gear up. The good news here is this isn't going to be subtle. As our customers announce and decide they're going to roll and how they're going to roll in 5G, they'll talk about it. All the different cities that they're going to go to, we'll talk about it. And in a way, you'll see the normal cycle of the announcement piece getting a little bit ahead of demand and then demand will follow and will have a hard time keeping up."

And that is our primary growth driver as opposed to how much of everything everybody buys or what type of economy do we face.
We continue to get nothing, but positive signals on those items, whether it's in Optical or in the areas that you just named, automotive. So here we are in a time period when you see declining forecasts of overall automotive sales and production, but we are projecting growth in the teens because of more and more of our content. Similar things we would expect to happen in the Valor story. We once again tend to have confirmatory evidence that we're on the right side of that substitution curve. Optical, very much the same as you heard in my answer. And in Specialty Materials, our Mobile Consumer Electronics business, also much the same.
So that's the first level. We feel pretty good about that. The next then comes to how does the timing of that substitution curve play out and how does that interact with overall demand for our customers? Now that you can get a little more noise in, in the near term and we're certainly experiencing some of that. So then we have folks like Jeff Evenson who's here in the room as well as pretty significant analytical groups to try to start right at the end market and then work the way all the way back to the value chain and build models and the right analytic tools to keep track of it. We don't always get it exactly right, but we feel pretty good that we're able to track the core demand signals through the system."

As we look at kind of the recovery of that 100 basis points and maybe coming back in line with 2018, is it more contingent on some of the macro headwinds dissipating? Or are you looking at some cost actions that might help you kind of exit that recovery back of that 100 basis points? And secondly, just to follow-up, a second question on the Display side. I just wanted to see, given that you have an outsized share of the Gen 10.5 plant or market share there, is -- can you give us a sense of your market share in Display today? And what it will be once all the plants are online?"

Clearly, what's most important to us in the way that we really think about our profitability is what's happening on the operating margin line. Our operating margin is being compressed and our gross margin is being compressed primarily -- compared to what we thought at the beginning of the year on what's happening in Optical Communications sales and the -- what's happening in cost in our Display business.
So as those things change, then of course we'd expect the continued improvement there. But from an overall standpoint, what we're really measuring and what we're really driving for is improvement in operating margin. And in the first half of this year, our operating margin actually expanded by 80 basis points and we expect that to continue in the second half of the year.
And the other thing, of course, is what's very important to us is return on invested capital. Over the last 4 years, we've improved our return on invested capital by 300 basis points. And over the next 4 years, we expect to continue to expand that as our profitability improves and we get the returns on the investments we've been making."

So first, let's deal with the 5G one because I think there's -- the way to understand 5G is how quickly does it start and expand beyond some of the few early adopters and leaders? So it's less people like changing deeply their 5G plans, if them arriving at their 5G plans and how they're going to deploy and then get that rolling? That's sort of the next leg of growth. And for us, when that clicks in exactly -- when it clicks in, it will be very significant in growth. When it happens is sort of hard to call. Meanwhile, what we see in our near-term results is more having to do with the pieces of the carrier market that dealt with particular projects that they have on wireline, some on wireless, but it's just -- really just some delays and pushouts that they've done into 2020 rather than big significant 5G changes.
So that's why I keep saying, the 5G piece won't be subtle when it starts to hit our demand cycle. You'll see it coming. And all you're seeing in our growth this year, primarily, right, is the adoption of our previous innovations and other pieces of the network. We haven't really started to feel the big oomph from the wireless networks of the world changing from relatively fiber-poor to really fiber-rich. That's all ahead of us.
Now to your next question on, can we expect continued downward revisions in auto? I would say it is clearly our intent that, that is not the case. What we've tried to do here is guide in a way that we feel highly confident it will deliver. Now as the months go by, we'll know more and how accurate our point of view is. But it is not our intent to have a sort of a sliding set of expectations in Opto. Does that answer your question?"

So first, I think you're quite wisely pointing out that once again, we're seeing some regional shift in the display market. We have followed it from Japan to Korea to Taiwan and now in China. What we try to do with each of those moves is enhance our position in each new region and we have done that again here. So we are very well positioned for the direction with which we see panel production shifting. So that's the first strategic level.
Now embedded in there, of course, I think you're making a wise comment, which is, then what happens to the sort of panel production capability and glass production capability in the regions that will be relatively weaker relative to China. So in that, you're seeing a combination of things happen. First, the shifts to newer and more advanced display technologies, right, which we're supporting with newer and more advanced glass types. Second, you're seeing optimization of our network of supply of glass and you can expect to see us to continue to optimize that to always make use of the capital that we have in place to serve our number of growing different glass markets. So we'll expect us to continue to optimize our cost structure, optimize our glass supply and then support our customers in those previous regions, so that innovation aspirations and their market diversification. Like for instance, in Taiwan, we're seeing a nice buildup of capabilities to address the automotive industry, which are going very nicely with our automotive glass opportunity sets. So that's the way we're going to work through it all.
Now I can't pass this answer to your question without noting that you said pricing continued to be flat in Display. We are not saying that yet for a long term, what we're just saying is we expect the rate of decline to continue to improve and for our glass returns to stabilize. We're not predicting the glass prices remain flat for the foreseeable future."

This morning, we reported excellent results that keep us on track for growth in 2019 and beyond. Our performance demonstrates the strength of Corning's portfolio and our ability to deliver for shareholders in a mixed macro environment.
Looking at the second quarter, sales were $3 billion, up 8% year-over-year. Net income of $410 million grew faster than sales at 14% year-over-year driven by operating margin expansion. And EPS was $0.45, up 18% year-over-year. Segment sales growth rates ranged from the mid-single digits to mid-teens, and we grew earnings in all segments.
Highlights from the quarter include: Optical Communications met expectations, delivering high single-digit sales growth driven by data center and fiber demand. Environmental Technologies delivered 15% year-over-year sales growth driven by the accelerating adoption of our gasoline particulate filters and continued strong demand in the North American heavy-duty market.
Life Science sales were up 6% year-over-year with net income growing much faster than sales, up 29% year-over-year. Specialty Materials sales were up 8% year-over-year on the strength of Gorilla Glass and our other innovations. Display continues to deliver stable returns with second quarter sales and net income up significantly year-over-year and better-than-expected pricing.
Our performance stems from the successful execution of our 4-year strategy and capital allocation framework introduced in October of 2015. Under the framework, we targeted returning more than $12.5 billion to our shareholders through repurchases and dividends, while investing $10 billion to extend our leadership and deliver growth. We surpassed our 4-year goal of $12.5 billion by returning more than $300 million to shareholders during the second quarter. And we're seeing the benefit of our investments in our first half year-over-year performance and in our expectations for the second half of 2019.
Of course, as you've all seen this earnings season, many companies are facing uncertainty and macroeconomic headwinds, and we are not immune to economic downturns or trade disputes or other geopolitical upsets, but we are more resilient than at any other time in our history. Across the company, while the end markets we serve are experiencing downward growth revisions and many of our competitors are not growing at all, we continued to outpace the markets.
In the auto market, global auto production is down, but we expect sales growth in our environmental business to be in the low teens this year. Retail television sell-through forecasts are declining in units, but we expect Display volume and sales growth this year. Smartphone unit sales are also forecasted to be down, but we are growing Gorilla Glass sales this year as well.
In Life Sciences, the industry is relatively immune to economic headwinds, so it is growing in its typical low single-digit rate, but we expect mid-single-digit growth of our Life Science business this year.
And finally, in Optical Communications, we now expect the passive optical market to be down. Earlier in the year, we projected the market to be up 5% and for our sales to grow in the low teens. We now expect the market to be down mid- to high single digits and for our sales to grow low to mid-single digits. While the growth is lower than previously expected, it is still very positive relative to the market. You'll hear more details from Tony on the current dynamics.
So the good news is, even in this environment, we are growing. And when markets improve, we'll grow even more. We are confident in our long-term growth prospects. The successful execution of our Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework adds to our confidence. We face challenges along our path to grow throughout our 2016 to 2019 plan, but we addressed those challenges and met or exceeded all our goals. In so doing, we created a bigger stronger company, and we created a strong foundation for significant additional growth.
Our new Strategy & Growth Framework sets our leadership priorities for 2020 to 2023. It's our original framework evolved for a new growth era. We will continue to focus our portfolio and utilize our financial strength. We plan to return $8 billion to $10 billion to shareholders and to invest $10 billion to $12 billion in growth and extending our leadership. We expect a sales compound annual growth rate of 6% to 8% and an EPS compound annual growth rate of 12% to 15% and annual dividends per share growth of at least 10%.
Our capabilities are becoming increasingly vital and multiple trends are driving growth across multiple businesses and in multiple geographies.
In Optical Communications, we are on track to deliver growth twice as fast as the passive optical market driven by opportunities in 5G and next-gen hyperscale. Recently, CenturyLink announced that it is using Corning fiber to build the largest ultra-low loss fiber network in North America. They are connecting more than 50 major cities throughout the U.S. and will soon expand into parts of Europe as well, creating a 4.7 million mile fiber network.
In the second half, we're going to be introducing next generation solutions that enable 5G and access networks to be installed faster and reduce the total cost of ownership. While pauses may occur as network operators transition between projects, photons replacing electrons in network after network provides a strong upward trajectory over longer periods.
In Mobile Consumer Electronics, we are well on our way to doubling sales despite a maturing smartphone market. As the world leader in glass for smartphones, tablets and emerging categories like wearables and augmented reality devices, we expect to continue capturing more value per device. Gorilla Glass has now been featured on 7 billion devices worldwide and adoption of Gorilla Glass 6 is expanding. We continue to innovate in new categories and expect further adoption of new products in the second half.
Turning to the automotive market. We expect to double sales by 2023 driven by gas particulate filter adoption and our new auto glass solutions business. As I already noted, many companies in the auto industry are dropping expectations. We're generating double-digit growth and ramping new capacity. In one new plant, we're now producing large parts to serve the growing pipeline of projects awarded to our Automotive Glass Solutions business.
In another, we're capturing accelerating demand for gasoline particulate filters. And not only are we making great progress building a $500 million GPF business, we're growing faster than we expected. We now expect GPF sales to exceed $200 million for the full year.
Our market leadership for this new technology was publicly recognized by 2 customers in the first half of 2019. We received the Daimler Supplier Award in March. And just recently, we also won the Volkswagen Group Award. We were 1 of just 8 suppliers honored in the Global Performance Champion category, chosen from Volkswagen's global network of 40,000 suppliers.
Turning to Life Science vessels, we aim to outpace the industry by more than 2x. We've recently increased manufacturing capacity for several key products used in cell and gene therapy development and production. Our growth is also supported by the increasing need for safety and quality in the packaging of injectable drugs. On this front, we continue to make strong progress on the path to a new, long-term multibillion franchise with Valor Glass.
In Display, our goal is to stabilize returns, and we are successfully delivering. The growth driver for display glass is large-size TVs, which are most efficiently produced by our customers on Gen 10.5 fabs. We continued our leadership in quarter 2 with the announcement of 2 new Gen 10.5 plants. Corning now has 3 of the planned 4 Gen 10.5 facilities in the world, and we are thrilled about pricing.
Third quarter glass prices are expected to remain consistent with quarter 2. Yes, you heard me correctly. Third quarter prices should be approximately flat to quarter 2. As a result, of the glass pricing through 3 quarters, we now expect full year glass prices to only decline in the low to mid-single-digit range.
Across our markets, our relationships with industry-leading customers are creating new opportunities for collaboration, and our strategic investments are paying off. We're capturing opportunities in generating significant top and bottom line growth in multiple businesses. I look forward to sharing our progress against our new objectives over the next 4 years.
Now let me turn the call over to Tony for more details."
173840,626731730,1786639,"Corning Incorporated, Q2 2019 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2019",2019-07-30,"Earnings Calls","Corning Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Wendell, and good morning.

We had another excellent quarter. Year-over-year, we grew sales 8%, net income 14% and earnings per share 18% with sales and earnings growth in every business segment, and we did this all while continuing to invest for long-term growth.
Before I get into the details of our performance and results, I want to note that the largest difference between our GAAP and core results are a noncash mark-to-market adjustment for our currency hedge contracts and a change in our tax reserves. With respect to mark-to-market adjustments, GAAP accounting requires earning translation hedge contracts and foreign debts settling in future periods to be mark-to-market and recorded at current value at the end of each quarter, even though these contracts will not be settled in the current quarter. For us, this reduced GAAP earnings in Q2. To be clear, this mark-to-market accounting has no impact on our cash flow.
Our currency hedges protect us economically from foreign exchange rate fluctuations and provide higher certainty for our earnings and cash flow, our ability to invest for growth and our future shareholder distributions. Our non-GAAP or core results provide additional transparency into operations by using a constant currency rate aligned with the economics of our underlying transactions.
We're very pleased with our hedging program and the economic certainty it provides. We've received $1.7 billion in cash under our hedge contracts since their inception more than 5 years ago.
That brings me to our results and outlook. For the second quarter, sales were up 8% year-over-year to $3 billion, net income rose 14% to $410 million and EPS was $0.45, up 18%. Our strong growth results from our technology and manufacturing leadership. We are benefiting from recent investments, including capacity expansions for optical fiber and cable, Gen 10.5 display glass, gasoline particulate filters and multiple development projects such as advanced glass for mobile devices and automotive.
We are very pleased with how these investments are playing out, and we are continuing to invest. We are bringing new plants online this year, creating capacity for committed demand and driving additional sales growth in 2019 and beyond. Capital spending in Q2 totaled $570 million, and we expect to spend just over $2 billion in 2019 with programs in every market access platform.
Now let's look at the detailed segment results and outlook. In Display Technology, our goal is to stabilize returns, and we had a very strong quarter. Second quarter sales were $848 million, up 9% year-over-year and net income was up 11% year-over-year. Second quarter sequential glass price declines were moderate and even better than we expected.
As Wendell said, we expect third quarter glass prices to be approximately flat to Q2. As a result of the glass pricing through 3 quarters, we now expect full year glass prices to decline in the low to mid-single digits versus our prior guidance of mid-single digits.
Now 3 factors drive our view that this favorable pricing environment will continue. First, we expect glass supply to continue to be balanced to demand, or even tight. Second, our competitors continue to face profitability challenges at current pricing levels. And third, display glass manufacturing requires periodic investments in existing capacity to maintain operations. Absolute glass prices must support acceptable returns on those investments. For Corning, we will only add capacity if we can get an attractive return for our shareholders.
In the second quarter, the display glass market volume grew mid-single digits year-over-year and our volume grew faster, as expected, due to the ramp of our Gen 10.5 plant. Now while end-market demand is meeting our expectations, as you've been hearing recently, some panel makers have lowered their utilization. Therefore, for the third quarter of 2019, we expect the display glass market volume to be roughly consistent year-over-year and to decrease by a low single-digit percentage sequentially. However, our volume is expected to be up year-over-year, again, due to the Gen 10.5 ramp and decrease low single-digit sequentially, in line with the market.
Now for the full year, despite this anticipated weaker third quarter, we continue to expect to outperform the market by delivering volume growth in the high single digits, driven by Gen 10.5.
In summary, we remain very pleased with the current pricing dynamics in our Display business and our ability to capture Gen 10.5 glass growth to deliver stable returns.
Let's move to Optical Communications. In the second quarter, sales were $1.1 billion, up 2% sequentially and 7% year-over-year. Net income of $158 million grew 11% sequentially and 5% year-over-year. Growth was driven by multiyear data center projects, fiber sales and the addition of sales from our 3M Communications Markets division acquisition.
Now in spite of our strong first half, we are reducing our expectations for the year. We entered 2019 projecting the global passive optical market to increase by more than 5% and our sales to grow in the low teens. We now believe that the global market will be down mid-to high single digits and that our sales will be up in the low to mid single digits.
We see weakness primarily in the carrier market. Since the last earnings call, several large build projects we projected for the second half of the year have been pushed out and multiple carriers have reduced CapEx for the remainder of the year. We see delays in Fiber to the Home builds at several Tier 2 carriers, slower deployment at North America cable operators and fiber densification for next generation wireless has not yet gained momentum outside the early leaders.
Also we have further reduced our expectations for the 2019 China market and are now seeing related weakness in India and Southeast Asia. The delay in China Mobile's tender announced earlier this year resulted in surplus inventory, which is currently being absorbed in these regions.
Now we continue to execute well against factors in our control, and our growth remains significantly above the market. For the third quarter, we expect sales to be consistent sequentially and down low single digits versus an exceptional third quarter in 2018.
Environmental Technology's second quarter sales were $366 million, up 15% year-over-year and ahead of expectations driven by ramping GPF sales and continued strong demand in North America heavy-duty market. Net income grew 20%. We are well on our way to building a $500 million gasoline particulate filter business. European regulations are in full effect, and automakers in China are preparing for full China 6 implementation in 2020. The market is developing faster than we planned and we are winning more platforms than we anticipated. We sustained our majority position of awarded platforms to date with additional wins, particularly as OEMs prepare for China 6 implementation. As a result, we now expect GPF sales to exceed $200 million in 2019 and to grow robustly thereafter.
Based on our accelerating demand, we now expect full year sales to be up by a low-teen percentage versus our prior expectation of 10%. We also expect third quarter sales to be up by a low teens percent year-over-year.
In Specialty Materials, second quarter sales were $369 million, up 8% year-over-year and driven by continued strong demand for the company's portfolio of Mobile Consumer Electronics glass solutions. Net income was up 5%.
For the third quarter, we expect sales to be up approximately 25% sequentially and consistent year-over-year. We continue to expect full year growth, again, in 2019 despite a maturing smartphone market. Exactly how much will depend on the adoption rate of our innovations. Our results and outlook demonstrate the value of our premium glasses and the strength of our innovation portfolio.
In Life Sciences, second quarter sales were $260 million, up 6% year-over-year. Net income was up 29% year-over-year. Manufacturing performance and operating leverage were outstanding. For both the third quarter and the year, we expect sales to be at mid-single digits year-over-year.
In summary, we had an excellent second quarter with strong performance across the company. The benefits of our recent investments are contributing to results. All of our businesses have solid momentum relative to their markets, and we are on track for sales growth for full year 2019.
Now let's move to the consolidated income statement. Second quarter gross margin was 40.1%, a slight increase from the first quarter. As I described last quarter, we are continuing to invest. While we build, start up, ramp and optimize new facilities, associated costs offset some of the normal leverage on our gross margin line.
For the second half of 2019, we expect gross margin to be slightly better than the first half. This is less than we thought in April because of lower-than-expected sales in Optical as well as higher-than-expected costs in Display.
In our Gen 10.5 facility, we are bringing up new technology, ramping volume and improving our cost, just not as quickly as we expected. We are excited about our Gen 10.5 projects because they enable us to capture the majority of the market growth and will ultimately provide a step change in glass manufacturing.
From an operating margin standpoint, we expect the second half to expand over the first half.
Moving to additional outlook details, we expect other income, other expense to be approximately $250 million for the full year. Full year gross equity earnings are expected to be approximately $210 million, predominantly from Hemlock Semiconductor, with the third quarter at approximately $20 million to $25 million versus second quarter 2019 gross equity earnings of $28 million. And we expect our effective tax rate for 2019 to be approximately 20%, consistent with Q2.
In closing, we had an excellent first half with sales and NPAT growth in every one of our businesses. As we discussed, most companies are facing uncertainty and macroeconomic headwinds right now. We feel these headwinds as well, but our solid execution against the factors within our control is evident in our strong first half and makes us confident in our ability to grow every business for the full year.
Now we are not immune to challenges, but we are more resilient than ever. Our portfolio and emphasis on capturing technology substitutions enable us to outpace the markets we serve. As conditions improve, our growth will accelerate. Our confidence is reflected in the long-term growth targets we've laid out in our 2020 to 2023 Strategy & Growth Framework.
There are exciting opportunities across our market access platforms. We are becoming increasingly relevant to the trends fueling those markets and that allows us to capture more opportunities in products and categories where we are already the leaders. I look forward to sharing progress on our framework in the months and years ahead.
With that, let's move to Q&A. Ann?"

I think the big change statement here is that we had expected gross margin to go to 41% to 42% in the back half. And now we're looking at it to be slightly better than the first half and it's really, there are 2 drivers on this. I mean the first is what's happening in our -- in the Optical Communications sales. This is all driven in the carrier market where we've gone from low-teen sales at the beginning of the year to low to mid-single digits. And there's incremental profitability on these sales are high, given that we have all the fixed cost infrastructure in place, so we see margin compression for COC in the company as those sales don't occur. And then the second area is the higher than expected cost in display and that is really driving -- is really been driven by -- as we bring up our new technology and ramping volume and improving our cost in Gen 10.5, it's just not happening as quickly as we expected. So that is the big change statement over what we'd expected a quarter ago.
In terms of operating margin, we did expand operating margin in the first half of the year versus last year, and we expect to expand operating margin in the second half of the year. And so from our standpoint, as we have discussed, that's the most important of the metrics because of the operating leverage that we get as we grow sales."

And that is because in the first half, we have working capital growth to support our increased sales. And we also have some significant annual payments that occur in the first half related to compensation, tax payments and legal settlements. And that's exactly what's happened this year. I mean our operating cash flow for the first half is about $150 million and included in that is a built-in working capital of about $500 million.
Now that's a couple hundred million dollars, maybe more than what you would normally expect, which is mostly in inventory. And the reason for that is that we have significant new products like GPF, Gen 10.5, some of our new innovations in Specialty Materials. It's also a little bit higher than you'd expect because we thought at the beginning of the year, Optical Communications would be a little bit stronger in terms of sales and now it's a little bit less than that. But we expect that inventory to correct itself in the second half and we expect, just like in most years -- or in all years, will generate more operating cash flow in the back half. So I think we're confident that we will end up with free cash flow for the year and this is just the normal cycle that we have."

So Mehdi, I think you're actually right on top of it and it's just those 2 things that you need to understand around when we think about our demand cycle. First is the one that you're highlighting, which is, architecturally, which solutions win and what are folks choosing? And then second is how quickly do our customers put it in? So you're right. Sort of all lights are flashing green on that we're right with the point of view we laid out over 2 years ago that 5G is going to equal significant network densification, which in turn means glassification, which means more demand for our innovations. And you're right, all you tend to be hearing is confirmatory data on that topic. So that's what we're hearing as well. So we are increasingly confident of our long-term projections of which architecture wins for 5G and that's a bullish signal for us.
Now then the next piece has to be happen. These are significant capital projects, and our customers need to get themselves organized, make the decision and then begin to make those investments. Now in that, timing can be difficult to all. And what we're seeing right now is that people are waiting a little bit. There's sort of a little gap between projects other than the sort of real leaders in 5G. They're putting their plans together, they're getting their financing house in order and getting their alliances in place that then we would expect the demand that you're pointing to, to occur. Does that make sense to you?"

So I think that what we're trying to do is be right on the architecture in the long-term demand cycle and then be able to support our customers as they gear up. The good news here is this isn't going to be subtle. As our customers announce and decide they're going to roll and how they're going to roll in 5G, they'll talk about it. All the different cities that they're going to go to, we'll talk about it.

So for us, it's a little like the walk-through that I just did on Optical. We've got 2 levels that we try to align. The first is the long-term technology substitution curves for our innovations. And as you remember from the Investor Day, the core of our growth story is a content story, which is what we expect over the coming 4 years is more and more of our innovations to be adopted into the products that people buy. And that is our primary growth driver as opposed to how much of everything everybody buys or what type of economy do we face.
We continue to get nothing, but positive signals on those items, whether it's in Optical or in the areas that you just named, automotive. So here we are in a time period when you see declining forecasts of overall automotive sales and production, but we are projecting growth in the teens because of more and more of our content. Similar things we would expect to happen in the Valor story. We once again tend to have confirmatory evidence that we're on the right side of that substitution curve. Optical, very much the same as you heard in my answer. And in Specialty Materials, our Mobile Consumer Electronics business, also much the same.
So that's the first level. We feel pretty good about that. The next then comes to how does the timing of that substitution curve play out and how does that interact with overall demand for our customers? Now that you can get a little more noise in, in the near term and we're certainly experiencing some of that. So then we have folks like Jeff Evenson who's here in the room as well as pretty significant analytical groups to try to start right at the end market and then work the way all the way back to the value chain and build models and the right analytic tools to keep track of it. We don't always get it exactly right, but we feel pretty good that we're able to track the core demand signals through the system."

So as those things change, then of course we'd expect the continued improvement there. But from an overall standpoint, what we're really measuring and what we're really driving for is improvement in operating margin. And in the first half of this year, our operating margin actually expanded by 80 basis points and we expect that to continue in the second half of the year.
And the other thing, of course, is what's very important to us is return on invested capital. Over the last 4 years, we've improved our return on invested capital by 300 basis points.

So first, let's deal with the 5G one because I think there's -- the way to understand 5G is how quickly does it start and expand beyond some of the few early adopters and leaders? So it's less people like changing deeply their 5G plans, if them arriving at their 5G plans and how they're going to deploy and then get that rolling? That's sort of the next leg of growth. And for us, when that clicks in exactly -- when it clicks in, it will be very significant in growth. When it happens is sort of hard to call. Meanwhile, what we see in our near-term results is more having to do with the pieces of the carrier market that dealt with particular projects that they have on wireline, some on wireless, but it's just -- really just some delays and pushouts that they've done into 2020 rather than big significant 5G changes.
So that's why I keep saying, the 5G piece won't be subtle when it starts to hit our demand cycle. You'll see it coming. And all you're seeing in our growth this year, primarily, right, is the adoption of our previous innovations and other pieces of the network. We haven't really started to feel the big oomph from the wireless networks of the world changing from relatively fiber-poor to really fiber-rich. That's all ahead of us.
Now to your next question on, can we expect continued downward revisions in auto? I would say it is clearly our intent that, that is not the case. What we've tried to do here is guide in a way that we feel highly confident it will deliver. Now as the months go by, we'll know more and how accurate our point of view is.

So first, I think you're quite wisely pointing out that once again, we're seeing some regional shift in the display market. We have followed it from Japan to Korea to Taiwan and now in China. What we try to do with each of those moves is enhance our position in each new region and we have done that again here. So we are very well positioned for the direction with which we see panel production shifting. So that's the first strategic level.
Now embedded in there, of course, I think you're making a wise comment, which is, then what happens to the sort of panel production capability and glass production capability in the regions that will be relatively weaker relative to China. So in that, you're seeing a combination of things happen. First, the shifts to newer and more advanced display technologies, right, which we're supporting with newer and more advanced glass types. Second, you're seeing optimization of our network of supply of glass and you can expect to see us to continue to optimize that to always make use of the capital that we have in place to serve our number of growing different glass markets. So we'll expect us to continue to optimize our cost structure, optimize our glass supply and then support our customers in those previous regions, so that innovation aspirations and their market diversification. Like for instance, in Taiwan, we're seeing a nice buildup of capabilities to address the automotive industry, which are going very nicely with our automotive glass opportunity sets. So that's the way we're going to work through it all.
Now I can't pass this answer to your question without noting that you said pricing continued to be flat in Display. We are not saying that yet for a long term, what we're just saying is we expect the rate of decline to continue to improve and for our glass returns to stabilize. We're not predicting the glass prices remain flat for the foreseeable future."

While challenges unfolded throughout the quarter,",1458,"Thank you, Ann, and good morning, everyone. This morning, we reported results in line with the early update we released in September. 
Sales were $3 billion. Net income was $397 million and EPS was $0.44. While challenges unfolded throughout the quarter, our results and expectations are consistent with our September update. We are not immune to the types of challenges facing us and many other companies this earning season, but I think we're more resilient than at any other time in our history and we are taking actions on the things within our control.
We're adjusting our cost and capacity, while at the same time maintaining focus on key growth initiatives. We continue to invest in technology and innovate with industry leaders across our markets as we pursue the rich set of opportunities outlined in our 2020-2023 Strategy & Growth Framework.
I'd like to share a few other important notes on the quarter. The favorable pricing environment in the Display market continued as third quarter glass prices in Display Technologies were consistent with the second quarter.
Environmental Technologies grew sales 20% year-over-year as the company's gasoline particulate filter solution propelled sales well above the underlying auto industry growth rate. Specialty Materials and Life Sciences also grew faster than their underlying markets as adoption of Corning's new technology continued.
Of course, we're living in uncertain times. We see it in the headline about trade disputes, political unrest and China's economy. Amid this uncertainty, you may be wondering why we continue to be confident that we will grow over the next 4 years. Part of our confidence stems from the relevance of our technology leadership and the tangible customer commitments that support our build projects. We're also confident because we're not just counting on everybody buying more stuff. Instead, we're putting more Corning into the products that people already buy. This provides a mechanism for us to grow even when spending in the end market category is down. There's no clearer example than in automotive.
In the third quarter, we grew sales in Environmental 20% in a market that is expected to be down 3% this year. Our growth is driven by increasing sales of our proprietary gasoline particulate filters, which track fine particulate and help reduce harmful engine emissions. From a financial perspective, GPF increased Corning's opportunity per car by $30. These types of content place create a path for growth even when underlying unit demand is flat or declining as our environmental results are demonstrating.
We expect to double our sales to the auto industry by 2023. By adding auto grade interior glass solutions to GPF, we increased our opportunity per car by another $25 to about $70 in total. That's up almost a factor of 5 versus just 2 years ago and additional products will further increase our opportunity. So we're not counting on more cars being sold, we're driving more Corning into each car. In short, a big part of Corning's story over the next 4 years is a content story. We see it playing out in Mobile Consumer Electronics, Display, Optical Communications and Life Sciences Vessels as well as Automotive. Because we're capturing significant technology substitutions, we have sales drivers beyond just end market growth. 
Let's look at how we advanced our strategy in each market access platform in the third quarter. In Optical Communications, we continue to be impacted by capital spending reductions in both the carrier and enterprise markets. Despite this near-term weakness, we are confident in our ability to outperform the passive optical market over time. As you've seen, with Fiber-to-the-Home and corporate data centers, Corning is the unquestioned technology and market leader. We delivered on those opportunities, and we are well positioned for the next waves of growth as 5G and hyperscale data centers drive the optical signal closure to the edge.
Our near-term goal is that Optical Communications are to align cost with demand and to continue advancing our product portfolio through co-innovation. We made progress in both areas during the quarter. Verizon and Corning are co-innovating and are manufacturing a technology center in Hickory, North Carolina. Engineers from both companies are using Verizon's 5G ultra wideband service and Corning's optical fiber and cable innovations to explore the capabilities of 5G in a manufacturing environment. Our work will demonstrate 5G's ability to revolutionize the way goods and services are produced as the technology enhances capabilities like machine learning, augmented reality and virtual reality.
Corning is also co-innovating on the 5G with Intel. We're making future 5G in building networks scalable and easy to install. Our innovations will allow for faster adoption of 5G features as they are standardized. 
Shifting to hyperscale. Corning and Facebook are demonstrating how to meet ever increasing bandwidth demand through Space Division Multiplexing or SDM. Internet content providers like Google and Facebook are making SDM their primary strategy for increasing capacity between their data centers across the globe. In short, this technology boosts the number of fibers in submarine cable and multiplies Corning's opportunity per cable by up to 4x. 
In Mobile Consumer Electronics, we're well on our way to doubling sales despite a maturing smartphone market. Apple announced that it is awarding $250 million from its Advanced Manufacturing Fund to Corning. This builds on the $200 million we received from Apple's fund in 2017. Both investments support Corning's state-of-the-art glass processes, equipment and materials integral to the delivery of next-generation consumer devices.
In the third quarter, we continued to lead the industry as our innovations were adopted on more and more devices. Apple announced phones with the toughest glass used on a smartphone and we saw the launch of multiple laptops, convertibles and tablets with Gorilla Glass. Corning continues to win in new device categories with 9 wearable launches in quarter 3, 4 featuring Gorilla Glass DX and DX Plus. Gorilla Glass DX delivers improved optics, while DX Plus also provides scratch resistant approaching the finest watches. Both maintained the superior drop performance of Gorilla Glass. 
Moving to the automotive market. As I already noted, our goal is to double sales by 2023. In the third quarter, we continued ramping production capacity in Hefei, China to meet committed demand for both our Auto Glass Solutions and our gasoline particulate filter products. We're making great progress building a $500 million plus GPF business, and we expect over $200 million in 2019 sales. Our Auto Glass Solutions business continues to build its order book. At next month's Guangzhou Auto Show, the industry's first shaped dual display module with a single covered glass part will be on display in the GAC Aion LX, an electric vehicle. The module's cover classes is produced using Corning's 3D ColdForm Technology.
In Life Sciences Vessels, we have some very exciting news. The FDA has approved Corning Valor Glass for use as a primary packaging for an already marketed drug produced by a leading pharmaceutical company. This approval makes Valor Glass the first and only fundamentally new glass composition to be approved by the FDA since the advent of borosilicate glass more than 100 years ago. This approval also marks a major milestone in our strategy to build a long-term multi-billion dollar franchise and the success provides another step on our journey to create a new higher standard in pharmaceutical glass packaging. 
Overall, we continue making good progress with our development partners and interest and engagement with other major pharmaceutical manufacturers continues to grow as well.
In Display, our goal is to stabilize returns. In the near term, retail demand continues to track our expectations with TV viewing area growing year-to-date through August. Said makers are purchasing panels more conservatively. Apparently, due to a macro uncertainty, which drove panel maker utilization reductions in the third quarter. This caused the panel makers to purchase less glass in the third quarter. We expect this supply chain adjustment to be temporary and for panel maker utilization to increase in the first half of 2020.
We remain confident in our long-term strategy because our growth driver is large-sized TVs, which are most efficiently produced by our customers on Gen 10.5 fabs. Our leadership in Gen 10.5 glass supports medium and longer-term volume growth despite temporary supply chain adjustments. And we have great news about pricing. We now expect full year glass price declines of a low single-digit percentage compared with our previous guidance of a low- to mid-single digit percentage. You can see that across our markets. Our strategic investments are well aligned with major trends and our relationships with industry-leading customers are creating new opportunities. Of course, we understand our current environment, and we'll continue to navigate thoughtfully through any headwinds that may arise.
Now let me turn the call over to Tony for more details."
173840,637321097,1843205,"Corning Incorporated, Q3 2019 Earnings Call, Oct 29, 2019",2019-10-29,"Earnings Calls","Corning Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Wendell, and good morning. In the third quarter, Corning took steps to offset recent market headwinds. In Display Technologies, we aligned capacity to demand. In Optical Communication, we idled capacity and reduced capital spending to reflect",1782,"Thank you, Wendell, and good morning. In the third quarter, Corning took steps to offset recent market headwinds. 
In Display Technologies, we aligned capacity to demand. In Optical Communication, we idled capacity and reduced capital spending to reflect our customers' near-term infrastructure investment plans. And across the company, we reduced operating expenses to align with near-term sales projections. While we experienced these headwinds and took steps to offset them, it is important to note that even in these challenging market, we grew sales year-over-year and faster than the underlying markets in Environmental Technologies, Life Sciences and Specialty Materials.
It is also important to note that, while we were taking these steps, we continue to advance our long-term growth initiatives, investing in technology and innovating with customers to capture future commercial opportunities. 
Now before I get into the details of our performance and results, I want to note that the largest difference between our GAAP and core results come from charges related to capacity realignment in Display Technologies and Optical Communications segment. Other differences between our GAAP and core results come from a noncash mark-to-market adjustment for our currency hedge contracts and a change in our tax reserves. 
With respect to mark-to-market adjustments, GAAP accounting requires earnings translation hedge contracts and foreign debts settling in future periods to be marked-to-market and recorded a current value at the end of each quarter even though those contracts will not be settled in the current quarter. For us, this impacted GAAP earnings in the quarter and quarter 3 by $72 million. Now to be clear, this mark-to-market accounting has no impact on our cash flow. Our currency hedges -- our currency hedges protect us economically from foreign exchange rate fluctuations and provide higher certainty for our earnings and cash flow, our ability to invest for growth in our future shareholder distributions. Our non-GAAP or core results provided additional transparency into operations by using a constant currency rate aligned with the economics of our underlying transactions.
We're very pleased with our hedging program and the economic certainty it provides. We received $1.7 billion in cash under our hedge contracts since their inception more than 5 years ago.
That brings me to our results and outlook. For the third quarter, sales were $3 billion. Net income was $397 million and EPS was $0.44. Operating cash flow in the quarter was $864 million. As we said in July, we built working capital in the second half. We also said we expected to reduce working capital in the second half.
We had -- sorry, as I said in July, we built working capital in the first half. We also said we expected to reduce working capital in the second half and we did reduce working capital in Q3 and expect to further reduce it in Q4.
Now let's look at the detailed segment results and outlook. In Display Technologies, third quarter sales were $793 million and net income was $185 million. Net income was down year-over-year, primarily driven by the lower volume. Third quarter volume was down high single-digit sequentially and prices were consistent with the second quarter, both as expected.
Now there's no change in our outlook in terms of volume. Retail demand is tracking to our expectations with TV viewing area growing year-to-date through August and preliminary data for September is also encouraging. The industry, however, remains conservative on inventory and panel maker utilization is expected to stay at current levels in the fourth quarter. Consequently, we expect our fourth quarter glass volume to be down mid-single digits sequentially.
That said, we expect this current supply chain adjustment to be temporary. We expect panel maker utilization to increase in the first half of 2020 over the second half of 2019.
Glass pricing in the fourth quarter continues to be positive. We expect prices to decline only slightly sequentially, which is equivalent to down low-single digits year-over-year.
For the full year, our volume outlook remains consistent with our September 16 update. We expect our volume to be up slightly year-over-year, which is higher than the glass market driven by the ramp of our Gen 10.5 facility in Hefei. In terms of price, our outlook is more favorable than our previous guidance. We are revising our full year price guidance to low single-digit declines from prior expectations of low- to mid-single digit declines, and we expect that the favorable pricing environment will continue into 2020. 
Now 3 factors derive our view. First, we expect glass supply to continue to be balanced to demand or even tight. For Corning, we are aligning our capacity with demand. We are also pacing our Gen 10.5 capital projects to align with panel maker's schedules. Second, our competitors continue to face profitability challenges at current pricing levels. And third, display glass manufacturing requires periodic investments in existing capacity to maintain operations. Glass prices must support the acceptable returns on those investments.
In summary, we are experiencing a temporary supply chain correction. However, retail TV viewing area's growing and expected to create more demand for display glass, especially at Gen 10.5. As the leader in Gen 10.5, we expect to capture most of the growth and we expect the favorable pricing environment to continue.
Results in Optical Communications were consistent with our September update. In the third quarter, sales were $1 billion and net income was $127 million. Our third quarter sales and net income were down versus last year. These results reflect overall mark -- market weakness, including the spending decisions of several major carrier customers. For the full year, we continue to expect sales to decline in the 3% to 5% range as previously guided.
We have taken actions to align our cost to our current sales reality, including idling capacity, pacing capital projects and reducing operating expenses to align with near-term sales projections. At the same time, we continue to innovate to improve network speed, cost and capacity and to secure long-term agreements with major industry players, sustaining our confidence and our ability to outperform and deliver long-term growth.
In Environmental Technologies, third quarter sales were $397 million, up 20% year-over-year and ahead of expectations driven by continued adoption of gasoline particulate filters and strong demand in the heavy-duty diesel market. Net income grew 32% driven by strong operational performance and successful ramping of additional GPF capacity in China. 
We are well on our way to building a greater than $500 million gasoline particulate filters business. With a market-leading product, we continue to earn a majority position globally as automakers award platforms to make Euro 6 and China 6 regulations. Sales are accelerating as Euro 6 regulations are in full effect and automakers are preparing for China 6 implementation in 2020. Our Hefei plant start-up is ahead of schedule and has been key to delivering incremental sales and net income. As a result, we continue to expect GPF sales to exceed $200 million in 2019 and to grow robustly thereafter.
Our strong performance is expected to extend into the fourth quarter with sales growth up by a low teen percentage year-over-year. Given a strong second half, we now expect full year sales to be up by a mid-teen percentage compared to our previous guidance of a low teen percentage.
In Specialty Materials, third quarter sales were $463 million and net income was $92 million. We were pleased with strong sales from our new innovations, as Wendell noted. However, our overall sales growth was muted because our Gorilla Glass shipments in China were lower due to the current trade environment and Advanced Optic sales were down on semiconductor market weakness.
From a profitability standpoint, some of our newer innovations start initially at lower margins and could not offset the loss of higher margin Gorilla Glass and AO products. We anticipate these issues will improve over time as the trade situation is resolved, the semiconductor market returns to growth, and we reduce cost on newer innovations as we come up the learning curve.
For the fourth quarter, we expect sales to be approximately flat year-over-year. We expect full year sales growth again despite a smartphone market that is down year-over-year. This growth is driven by adoption of new innovations, including premium cover class and innovative parts products including DX Plus for wearables.
Life Sciences third quarter sales were $256 million, up 11% year-over-year. Net income was $41 million, up 37%. For both the fourth quarter and the full year, we expect sales to be at mid-single digits year-over-year.
In summary, our third quarter performance was impacted by changes in the display and optical markets and we took actions to lower our cost to our align with those lower sales. We now expect the full year price decline in display to improve to a low single-digit percentage. We grew sales in Environmental, Specialty Materials and Life Sciences year-over-year and faster than their underlying markets, and we delivered strategic milestones with Apple's investment and FDA approval of Valor Glass.
Now let's turn to the consolidated P&L. Gross margin in the third quarter was 39% as expected. Last quarter, we talked about the Gen 10.5 facility, and I'd like to give you an update. We continue to make progress coming up the learning curve and improving our low cost in our Gen 10.5 plant, which should lead to further improvement in 2020. We are excited about our Gen 10.5 projects because the  enable us to capture the majority of the market growth and will ultimately provide the step-change in glass manufacturing. For the rest of our P&L, there has been no change in our guidance. Gross margin is inspected to be approximately 39% in the back half. SG&A and RD&E is expected to be just under 14% and approximately 8.5% of sales, respectively, for the year. And capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $2 billion.
Moving to additional outlook details. We expect other income, other expense to be approximately $260 million for the full year. Full year gross equity earnings are expected to be approximately $230 million, predominantly from Hemlock Semiconductor, and we expect our effective tax rate for 2019 to be approximately 20%.
In closing, we acted quickly in the third quarter to address changing market conditions. We met our revised targets. We continued our actions to advance our long-term growth plans, and we remain confident in our strategy. We are operating on the strong foundation that we built over the last 4 years, and we're making progress in key areas as evidenced by our ongoing customer announcements. This makes us confident in our ability to achieve the objectives we laid out in our 2020-2023 Strategy & Growth Framework.
With that, let's move to Q&A. Ann?"

But it also means that from a forecasting perspective, we need to be right about both the underlying market and the rate of adoption of specific technologies at specific customers in a specific time frame. This can be difficult. During quarter 3, we heard from some key customers that they plan to reduce their spending on our products below their existing run rates and our expectations.

However, at the same time, the very strong positive upside has been demand for our new technologies in interior, and we've been shifting more of our resources because the key innovation is you have to go really towards those positive surprises towards interior. And we continue to build both our order book and momentum there. We were especially excited about being able to demonstrate our proprietary ColdForm Technology in a commercial offering that I talked about for GAC, and we expect to have more momentum there as well. So right now, we're beginning to scale our plant that we just put in place in Hefei, China, and we're really excited about our opportunities. That being said, looks like you pointed out on exterior.
The way the car industry works is we will get a nomination well before the sales actually begin.

And in fact, things are coming a little bit better than what we originally expected. But equally, maybe even more important than that is what's happening with TV sizes. 65-inch TVs are growing greater than 40% on a year-over-year basis and 75-inch TVs are growing greater than 60% on a year-over-year basis. So we believe in the fundamental drivers of what's happening this business and what's really happening right now is caution with the panel makers in the supply chain with the set makers and the supply chain because of all the trade uncertainties, and we think that gets itself work through the rest of this year and in the first half of next year, volume's going to be better than the back half of this year."

That being said, sort of the core of what it is not to try to call specific quarters and specific time periods around supply chain.

That turned out not to be true as some specific customers were adopting the strong changed some of their timing and capital plans. That being said, though it's very hard to recall the exact timing by quarter or even by year, we remain more confident than ever that the fundamental drivers for the demand of our technology will become increasingly ascended.
IG is going to take the wireless network for being a fiber poor network to a very fiber rich network. Our innovations in hyperscale are going to push that optical signal closer to the edge and use more of our product. So over the long term, we see a set of demand that is higher for glass.

This morning, we reported results in line with the early update we released in September. 
Sales were $3 billion. Net income was $397 million, and EPS was $0.44. 
While challenges unfolded throughout the quarter, our results and expectations are consistent with our September update. We are not immune to the types of challenges facing us and many other companies this earnings season, but I think we are more resilient than at any other time in our history, and we are taking actions on the things within our control.
We're adjusting our cost and capacity, while, at the same time, maintaining focus on key growth initiatives. We continue to invest in technology and innovate with industry leaders across our markets as we pursue the rich set of opportunities outlined in our 2020-2023 Strategy & Growth Framework.
I'd like to share a few other important notes on the quarter. The favorable pricing environment in the Display market continued as third quarter glass prices in Display Technologies were consistent with the second quarter.
Environmental Technologies grew sales 20% year-over-year as the company's gasoline particulate filter solution propelled sales well above the underlying auto industry growth rate. Specialty Materials and Life Sciences also grew faster than their underlying markets as adoption of Corning's new technology continued.
Of course, we're living in uncertain times. We see it in the headlines about trade disputes, political unrest and China's economy. Amid this uncertainty, you may be wondering why we continue to be confident that we will grow over the next 4 years. 
Part of our confidence stems from the relevance of our technology leadership and the tangible customer commitments that support our build projects. We're also confident because we're not just counting on everybody buying more stuff. Instead, we're putting more Corning into the products that people already buy. This provides a mechanism for us to grow even when spending in the end market category is down. There's no clearer example than in automotive.
In the third quarter, we grew sales in Environmental 20% in a market that is expected to be down 3% this year. Our growth is driven by increasing sales of our proprietary gasoline particulate filters, which track fine particulate and help reduce harmful engine emissions. 
From a financial perspective, GPS increased Corning's opportunity per car by $30. These types of content plays create a path for growth even when underlying unit demand is flat or declining, as our environmental results are demonstrating.
We expect to double our sales to the auto industry by 2023. By adding auto grade interior glass solutions to GPS, we increase our opportunity per car by another $25 to about $70 in total. That's up almost a factor of 5 versus just 2 years ago. 
And additional products will further increase our opportunity. So we're not counting on more cars being sold, we're driving more Corning into each car. 
In short, a big part of Corning's story over the next 4 years is a content story. We see it playing out in Mobile Consumer Electronics, Display, Optical Communications and Life Sciences Vessels as well as Automotive. Because we're capturing significant technology substitutions, we have sales drivers beyond just end market growth. 
Let's look at how we advanced our strategy in each market access platform in the third quarter. 
In Optical Communications, we continue to be impacted by capital spending reductions in both the carrier and enterprise markets. Despite this near-term weakness, we are confident in our ability to outperform the passive optical market over time. As you've seen, with Fiber to the Home and corporate data centers, Corning is the unquestioned technology and market leader. We delivered on those opportunities, and we are well positioned for the next waves of growth as 5G and hyperscale data centers drive the optical signal closure to the edge.
Our near-term goal is that Optical Communications are to align costs with demand and to continue advancing our product portfolio through co-innovation. We made progress in both areas during the quarter. 
Verizon and Corning are co-innovating and are manufacturing a technology center in Hickory, North Carolina. Engineers from both companies are using Verizon's 5G ultra wideband service and Corning's optical fiber and cable innovations to explore the capabilities of 5G in a manufacturing environment. Our work will demonstrate 5G's ability to revolutionize the way goods and services are produced as the technology enhances capabilities like machine learning, augmented reality and virtual reality.
Corning is also co-innovating on 5G with Intel. We're making future 5G in building networks scalable and easy to install. Our innovations will allow for faster adoption of 5G features as they are standardized. 
Shifting to hyperscale. Corning and Facebook are demonstrating how to meet ever increasing bandwidth demand through space division multiplexing or SDM. 
Internet content providers like Google and Facebook are making SDM their primary strategy for increasing capacity between their data centers across the globe. In short, this technology boosts the number of fibers in a submarine cable and multiplies Corning's opportunity per cable by up to 4x. 
In Mobile Consumer Electronics, we're well on our way to doubling sales despite a maturing smartphone market. Apple announced that it is awarding $250 million from its Advanced Manufacturing Fund to Corning. This builds on the $200 million we received from Apple's fund in 2017. Both investments support Corning's state-of-the-art glass processes, equipment and materials integral to the delivery of next-generation consumer devices.
In the third quarter, we continued to lead the industry as our innovations were adopted on more and more devices. Apple announced phones with the toughest glass ever used on a smartphone, and we saw the launch of multiple laptops, convertibles and tablets with Gorilla Glass. 
Corning continues to win in new device categories with 9 wearable launches in quarter 3, 4 featuring Gorilla Glass DX and DX+. Gorilla Glass DX delivers improved optics, while DX+ also provides scratch resistance approaching the finest watches. Both maintained the superior drop performance of Gorilla Glass. 
Moving to the Automotive market. As I already noted, our goal is to double sales by 2023. In the third quarter, we continued ramping production capacity in Hefei, China to meet committed demand for both our auto glass solutions and our gasoline particulate filter products. We're making great progress building a $500 million plus GPF business, and we expect over $200 million in 2019 sales. 
Our auto glass solutions business continues to build its order book. At next month's Guangzhou Auto Show, the industry's first shaped dual-display module with a single covered glass part will be on display in the GAC Aion LX, an electric vehicle. The module's cover glass is produced using Corning's 3D ColdForm technology.
In Life Science Vessels, we have some very exciting news. The FDA has approved Corning Valor Glass for use as a primary packaging for an already marketed drug produced by a leading pharmaceutical company. This approval makes Valor Glass the first and only fundamentally new glass composition to be approved by the FDA since the advent of borosilicate glass more than 100 years ago. 
This approval also marks a major milestone in our strategy to build a long-term, multi-billion dollar franchise, and the success provides another step on our journey to create a new higher standard in pharmaceutical glass packaging. 
Overall, we continue making good progress with our development partners and interest, and engagement with other major pharmaceutical manufacturers continues to grow as well.
In Display, our goal is to stabilize returns. In the near term, retail demand continues to track to our expectations with TV viewing area growing year-to-date through August. Set makers are purchasing panels more conservatively. Apparently, due to macro uncertainty, which drove panel maker utilization reductions in the third quarter, this caused the panel makers to purchase less glass in the third quarter. 
We expect this supply chain adjustment to be temporary and for panel maker utilization to increase in the first half of 2020.
We remain confident in our long-term strategy because our growth driver is large-sized TVs, which are most efficiently produced by our customers on Gen 10.5 fabs. 
Our leadership in Gen 10.5 glass supports medium and longer-term volume growth despite temporary supply chain adjustments. 
And we have great news about pricing. We now expect full year glass price declines of a low single digit percentage compared with our previous guidance of a low- to mid-single-digit percentage. You can see that across our markets. 
Our strategic investments are well aligned with major trends, and our relationships with industry-leading customers are creating new opportunities. Of course, we understand our current environment, and we'll continue to navigate thoughtfully through any headwinds that may arise.
Now let me turn the call over to Tony for more details."
173840,637321097,1843464,"Corning Incorporated, Q3 2019 Earnings Call, Oct 29, 2019",2019-10-29,"Earnings Calls","Corning Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Wendell, and good morning.

In the third quarter, Corning took steps to offset recent market headwinds. 
In Display Technologies, we aligned capacity to demand. 
In Optical Communications, we idled capacity and reduced capital spending to reflect our customers' near-term infrastructure investment plans. And across the company, we reduced operating expenses to align with near-term sales projections. 
While we experienced these headwinds and took steps to offset them, it is important to note that even in this challenging market, we grew sales year-over-year and faster than the underlying markets in Environmental Technologies, Life Sciences and Specialty Materials.
It is also important to note that, while we were taking these steps, we continue to advance our long-term growth initiatives, investing in technology and innovating with customers to capture future commercial opportunities. 
Now before I get into the details of our performance and results, I want to note that the largest difference between our GAAP and core results come from charges related to capacity realignment in Display Technologies and Optical Communications. Other differences between our GAAP and core results come from a noncash mark-to-market adjustment for our currency hedge contracts and a change in our tax reserves. 
With respect to mark-to-market adjustments, GAAP accounting requires earnings translation hedge contracts and foreign debt settling in future periods to be mark-to-market and recorded at current value at the end of each quarter even though those contracts will not be settled in the current quarter. For us, this impacted GAAP earnings in the quarter 3 by $72 million. 
Now to be clear, this mark-to-market accounting has no impact on our cash flow. Our currency hedges protect us economically from foreign exchange rate fluctuations and provide higher certainty for our earnings and cash flow, our ability to invest for growth in our future shareholder distributions. Our non-GAAP or core results provide additional transparency into operations by using a constant-currency rate aligned with the economics of our underlying transactions.
We're very pleased with our hedging program and the economic certainty it provides. We received $1.7 billion in cash under our hedge contracts since their inception more than 5 years ago.
That brings me to our results and outlook. For the third quarter, sales were $3 billion. Net income was $397 million, and EPS was $0.44. Operating cash flow in the quarter was $864 million. As we said in July, we built working capital in the second half. We also said we expected to reduce working capital in the second half.
We -- sorry, as I said in July, we built working capital in the first half. We also said we expected to reduce working capital in the second half, and we did reduce working capital in Q3 and expect to further reduce it in Q4.
Now let's look at the detailed segment results and outlook. In Display Technologies, third quarter sales were $793 million, and net income was $185 million. Net income was down year-over-year, primarily driven by the lower volume. Third quarter volume was down high single digit sequentially, and prices were consistent with the second quarter, both as expected.
Now there's no change in our outlook in terms of volume. Retail demand is tracking to our expectations with TV viewing area growing year-to-date through August, and preliminary data for September is also encouraging. The industry, however, remains conservative on inventory, and panel maker utilization is expected to stay at current levels in the fourth quarter. Consequently, we expect our fourth quarter glass volume to be down mid-single digits sequentially.
That said, we expect this current supply chain adjustment to be temporary. We expect panel maker utilization to increase in the first half of 2020 over the second half of 2019.
Glass pricing in the fourth quarter continues to be positive. We expect prices to decline only slightly sequentially, which is equivalent to down low single digits year-over-year.
For the full year, our volume outlook remains consistent with our September 16 update. We expect our volume to be up slightly year-over-year, which is higher than the glass market, driven by the ramp of our Gen 10.5 facility in Hefei. 
In terms of price, our outlook is more favorable than our previous guidance. We are revising our full year price guidance to low single digit declines from prior expectations of low to mid-single-digit declines, and we expect that the favorable pricing environment will continue into 2020. 
Now 3 factors drive our view. First, we expect glass supply to continue to be balanced to demand or even tight. For Corning, we are aligning our capacity with demand. We are also pacing our Gen 10.5 capital projects to align with panel makers' schedules. 
Second, our competitors continue to face profitability challenges at current pricing levels. 
And third, display glass manufacturing requires periodic investments in existing capacity to maintain operations. Glass prices must support acceptable returns on those investments.
In summary, we are experiencing a temporary supply chain correction. However, retail TV viewing area's growing and expected to create more demand for display glass, especially at Gen 10.5. As the leader in Gen 10.5, we expect to capture most of the growth, and we expect the favorable pricing environment to continue.
Results in Optical Communications were consistent with our September update. In the third quarter, sales were $1 billion, and net income was $127 million. Our third quarter sales and net income were down versus last year. These results reflect overall market weakness, including the spending decisions of several major carrier customers. 
For the full year, we continue to expect sales to decline in the 3% to 5% range, as previously guided.
We have taken actions to align our costs to our current sales reality, including idling capacity, pacing capital projects and reducing operating expenses to align with near-term sales projections. At the same time, we continue to innovate to improve network speed, cost and capacity and to secure long-term agreements with major industry players, sustaining our confidence and our ability to outperform and deliver long-term growth.
In Environmental Technologies, third quarter sales were $397 million, up 20% year-over-year and ahead of expectations, driven by continued adoption of gasoline particulate filters and strong demand in the heavy-duty diesel market. Net income grew 32%, driven by strong operational performance and successful ramping of additional GPS capacity in China. 
We are well on our way to building a greater than $500 million gasoline particulate filter business. With a market-leading product, we continue to earn a majority position globally as automakers award platforms to make Euro 6 and China 6 regulations. Sales are accelerating as Euro 6 regulations are in full effect, and automakers are preparing for China 6 implementation in 2020. 
Our Hefei plant start-up is ahead of schedule and has been key to delivering incremental sales and net income. As a result, we continue to expect GPF sales to exceed $200 million in 2019 and to grow robustly thereafter.
Our strong performance is expected to extend into the fourth quarter with sales growth up by a low teen percentage year-over-year. Given a strong second half, we now expect full year sales to be up by a mid-teen percentage compared to our previous guidance of a low-teen percentage.
In Specialty Materials, third quarter sales were $463 million, and net income was $92 million. We were pleased with strong sales from our new innovations, as Wendell noted. However, our overall sales growth was muted because our Gorilla Glass shipments in China were lower due to the current trade environment and Advanced Optic sales were down on semiconductor market weakness.
From a profitability standpoint, some of our newer innovations start initially at lower margins and could not offset the loss of higher margin Gorilla Glass and AO products. We anticipate these issues will improve over time as the trade situation is resolved, the semiconductor market returns to growth and we reduce costs on newer innovations as we come up the learning curve.
For the fourth quarter, we expect sales to be approximately flat year-over-year. We expect full year sales growth again despite a smartphone market that is down year-over-year. This growth is driven by adoption of new innovations, including premium cover glass and innovative parts products, including DX+, for wearables.
Life Sciences third quarter sales were $256 million, up 11% year-over-year. Net income was $41 million, up 37%. For both the fourth quarter and the full year, we expect sales to be at mid-single digits year-over-year.
In summary, our third quarter performance was impacted by changes in the display and optical markets, and we took actions to lower our costs to our align with those lower sales. We now expect the full year price decline in display to improve to a low single digit percentage. 
We grew sales in Environmental, Specialty Materials and Life Sciences year-over-year and faster than their underlying markets, and we delivered strategic milestones with Apple's investment and FDA approval of Valor Glass.
Now let's turn to the consolidated P&L. Gross margin in the third quarter was 39%, as expected. Last quarter, we talked about the Gen 10.5 facility, and I'd like to give you an update. We continue to make progress coming up the learning curve and improving our costs in our Gen 10.5 plant, which should lead to further improvement in 2020. 
We are excited about our Gen 10.5 projects because they enable us to capture the majority of the market growth and will ultimately provide the step-change in glass manufacturing. 
For the rest of our P&L, there has been no change in our guidance. Gross margin is inspected to be approximately 39% in the back half. SG&A and RD&E is expected to be just under 14% and approximately 8.5% of sales, respectively, for the year, and capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $2 billion.
Moving to additional outlook details. We expect other income, other expense to be approximately $260 million for the full year. 
Full year gross equity earnings are expected to be approximately $230 million, predominantly from Hemlock Semiconductor, and we expect our effective tax rate for 2019 to be approximately 20%.
In closing, we acted quickly in the third quarter to address changing market conditions. We met our revised targets. We continued our actions to advance our long-term growth plans, and we remain confident in our strategy. We are operating on the strong foundation that we've built over the last 4 years, and we're making progress in key areas, as evidenced by our ongoing customer announcements. This makes us confident in our ability to achieve the objectives we laid out in our 2020-2023 Strategy & Growth Framework.

So as you noted in your earlier question, we tend to grow much faster than our underlying markets as customers adopt more of our innovations in their products. And this has been true in Opto, Life Sciences, Gorilla and Auto over the last 4 years where our growth rate has been significantly higher than that of the underlying markets we serve. And that's a good thing.
But it also means that from a forecasting perspective, we need to be right about both the underlying market and the rate of adoption of specific technologies at specific customers in a specific time frame. This can be difficult. During quarter 3, we heard from some key customers that they plan to reduce their spending on our products below their existing run rate and our expectations. We, in turn, lowered our expectations across those industries, and we initiated actions to adjust our costs and capacity accordingly. Now as we finish the quarter, some customers exceed that assumed take rate and we performed better. That being said, our approach for the remainder of the year is the same, and we're reaffirming our guidance at this time. Is that helpful to you, sir?"

So the answer is, yes, we're continuing to see momentum building on XQ. However, at the same time, the very strong positive upside has been demand for our new technologies in interior, and we've been shifting more of our resources because the key to innovation is you have to go really towards those positive surprises towards interior. And we continue to build both our order book and momentum there. We were especially excited about being able to demonstrate our proprietary ColdForm technology in a commercial offering that I talked about for GAC, and we expect to have more momentum there as well. So right now, we're beginning to scale our plant that we just put in place in Hefei, China, and we're really excited about our opportunities. 
That being said, much like you pointed out on exterior, the way the car industry works is we will get a nomination well before the sales actually begin.

And as both Wendell and I said, I mean, we haven't really changed our perspective on the market for the rest of the year for the full year.
And in fact, things are coming in a little bit better than what we originally expected, but, equally, maybe even more important than that, is what's happening with TV sizes. 65-inch TVs are growing greater than 40% on a year-over-year basis, and 75-inch TVs are growing greater than 60% on a year-over-year basis. So we believe in the fundamental drivers of this -- what's happening in this business. And what's really happening right now is caution with the panel makers in the supply chain with the set makers and the supply chain because of all the trade uncertainties. And we think that gets itself worked through the rest of this year. And in the first half of next year, volume's going to be better than the back half of this year."

And I think in Tony's answer, you see that we do expect in the first half of '20, right, that to be above that in the back half of 2019. 
That being said, sort of the core of what we do is not to try to call sort of specific quarters and specific time periods around supply chain. It is a worthy exercise, but we tend to be focused more on that long-term market and to get our capacity in the appropriate spot to be able to serve our customers."

As we entered this year, we would see a number of signals that the end market would be going down. And then -- but, at the same time, we saw adoption of our new technologies, some specific customers more than offsetting that sort of underlying heartbeat. And I think this probably led us to being able to believe, as long as that continued, we could ride out this temporary dip in the end market for Optical without having much impact on us.
That turned out not to be true as some specific customers were adopting the strong tact, changed some of their timing and capital plans. That being said, though it's very hard to call the exact timing by quarter or even by year, we remain more confident than ever that the fundamental drivers for the demand of our technology will become increasingly ascendent.
5G is going to take the wireless network from being a fiber-poor network to a very fiber-rich network. Our innovations in hyperscale are going to push that optical signal closer to the edge and use more of our product. So over the long term, we see a set of demand that is higher for glass. Because densification of networks is occurring, that will lead to glassification. And if we do our job well, we will capture our unfair share of that."

This morning, we reported results in line with the early update we released in September. 
Sales were $3 billion. Net income was $397 million, and EPS was $0.44. 
While challenges unfolded throughout the quarter, our results and expectations are consistent with our September update. We are not immune to the types of challenges facing us and many other companies this earnings season, but I think we are more resilient than at any other time in our history, and we are taking actions on the things within our control.
We're adjusting our cost and capacity, while, at the same time, maintaining focus on key growth initiatives. We continue to invest in technology and innovate with industry leaders across our markets as we pursue the rich set of opportunities outlined in our 2020-2023 Strategy & Growth Framework.
I'd like to share a few other important notes on the quarter. The favorable pricing environment in the Display market continued as third quarter glass prices in Display Technologies were consistent with the second quarter.
Environmental Technologies grew sales 20% year-over-year as the company's gasoline particulate filter solution propelled sales well above the underlying auto industry growth rate. Specialty Materials and Life Sciences also grew faster than their underlying markets as adoption of Corning's new technology continued.
Of course, we're living in uncertain times. We see it in the headlines about trade disputes, political unrest and China's economy. Amid this uncertainty, you may be wondering why we continue to be confident that we will grow over the next 4 years. 
Part of our confidence stems from the relevance of our technology leadership and the tangible customer commitments that support our build projects. We're also confident because we're not just counting on everybody buying more stuff. Instead, we're putting more Corning into the products that people already buy. This provides a mechanism for us to grow even when spending in the end market category is down. There's no clearer example than in automotive.
In the third quarter, we grew sales in Environmental 20% in a market that is expected to be down 3% this year. Our growth is driven by increasing sales of our proprietary gasoline particulate filters, which track fine particulates and help reduce harmful engine emissions. 
From a financial perspective, GPS increased Corning's opportunity per car by $30. These types of content plays create a path for growth even when underlying unit demand is flat or declining, as our environmental results are demonstrating.
We expect to double our sales to the auto industry by 2023. By adding auto grade interior glass solutions to GPS, we increase our opportunity per car by another $25 to about $70 in total. That's up almost a factor of 5 versus just 2 years ago. 
And additional products will further increase our opportunity. So we're not counting on more cars being sold, we're driving more Corning into each car. 
In short, a big part of Corning's story over the next 4 years is a content story. We see it playing out in Mobile Consumer Electronics, Display, Optical Communications and Life Sciences Vessels as well as Automotive. Because we're capturing significant technology substitutions, we have sales drivers beyond just end market growth. 
Let's look at how we advanced our strategy in each market access platform in the third quarter. 
In Optical Communications, we continue to be impacted by capital spending reductions in both the carrier and enterprise markets. Despite this near-term weakness, we are confident in our ability to outperform the passive optical market over time. As you've seen, with Fiber to the Home and corporate data centers, Corning is the unquestioned technology and market leader. We delivered on those opportunities, and we are well positioned for the next waves of growth as 5G and hyperscale data centers drive the optical signal closer to the edge.
Our near-term goals in Optical Communications are to align costs with demand and to continue advancing our product portfolio through co-innovation. We made progress in both areas during the quarter. 
Verizon and Corning are co-innovating at our manufacturing and technology center in Hickory, North Carolina. Engineers from both companies are using Verizon's 5G ultra wideband service and Corning's optical fiber and cable innovations to explore the capabilities of 5G in a manufacturing environment. Our work will demonstrate 5G's ability to revolutionize the way goods and services are produced as the technology enhances capabilities like machine learning, augmented reality and virtual reality.
Corning is also co-innovating on 5G with Intel. We're making future 5G in building networks scalable and easy to install. Our innovations will allow for faster adoption of 5G features as they are standardized. 
Shifting to hyperscale. Corning and Facebook are demonstrating how to meet ever increasing bandwidth demand through space division multiplexing or SDM. 
Internet content providers like Google and Facebook are making SDM their primary strategy for increasing capacity between their data centers across the globe. In short, this technology boosts the number of fibers in a submarine cable and multiplies Corning's opportunity per cable by up to 4x. 
In Mobile Consumer Electronics, we're well on our way to doubling sales despite a maturing smartphone market. Apple announced that it is awarding $250 million from its Advanced Manufacturing Fund to Corning. This builds on the $200 million we received from Apple's fund in 2017. Both investments support Corning's state-of-the-art glass processes, equipment and materials integral to the delivery of next-generation consumer devices.
In the third quarter, we continued to lead the industry as our innovations were adopted on more and more devices. Apple announced phones with the toughest glass ever used on a smartphone, and we saw the launch of multiple laptops, convertibles and tablets with Gorilla Glass. 
Corning continues to win in new device categories with 9 wearable launches in quarter 3, 4 featuring Gorilla Glass DX and DX+. Gorilla Glass DX delivers improved optics, while DX+ also provides scratch resistance approaching the finest watches. Both maintain the superior drop performance of Gorilla Glass. 
Moving to the Automotive market. As I already noted, our goal is to double sales by 2023. In the third quarter, we continued ramping production capacity in Hefei, China to meet committed demand for both our auto glass solutions and our gasoline particulate filter products. We're making great progress building a $500 million plus GPF business, and we expect over $200 million in 2019 sales. 
Our auto glass solutions business continues to build its order book. At next month's Guangzhou Auto Show, the industry's first shaped dual-display module with a single cover glass part will be on display in the GAC Aion LX, an electric vehicle. The module's cover glass is produced using Corning's 3D ColdForm technology.
In Life Science Vessels, we have some very exciting news. The FDA has approved Corning Valor Glass for use as a primary packaging for an already marketed drug produced by a leading pharmaceutical company. This approval makes Valor Glass the first and only fundamentally new glass composition to be approved by the FDA since the advent of borosilicate glass more than 100 years ago. 
This approval also marks a major milestone in our strategy to build a long-term, multi-billion dollar franchise, and the success provides another step on our journey to create a new higher standard in pharmaceutical glass packaging. 
Overall, we continue making good progress with our development partners and interest, and engagement with other major pharmaceutical manufacturers continues to grow as well.
In Display, our goal is to stabilize returns. In the near term, retail demand continues to track to our expectations with TV viewing area growing year-to-date through August. Set makers are purchasing panels more conservatively apparently due to macro uncertainty, which drove panel maker utilization reductions in the third quarter. This caused the panel makers to purchase less glass in the third quarter. 
We expect this supply chain adjustment to be temporary and for panel maker utilization to increase in the first half of 2020.
We remain confident in our long-term strategy because our growth driver is large-sized TVs, which are most efficiently produced by our customers on Gen 10.5 fabs. 
Our leadership in Gen 10.5 glass supports medium and longer-term volume growth despite temporary supply chain adjustments. 
And we have great news about pricing. We now expect full year glass price declines of a low single digit percentage compared with our previous guidance of a low- to mid-single-digit percentage. You can see that across our markets. 
Our strategic investments are well aligned with major trends, and our relationships with industry-leading customers are creating new opportunities. Of course, we understand our current environment, and we'll continue to navigate thoughtfully through any headwinds that may arise.
Now let me turn the call over to Tony for more details."

In the third quarter, Corning took steps to offset recent market headwinds. 
In Display Technologies, we aligned capacity to demand. 
In Optical Communications, we idled capacity and reduced capital spending to reflect our customers' near-term infrastructure investment plans. And across the company, we reduced operating expenses to align with near-term sales projections. 
While we experienced these headwinds and took steps to offset them, it is important to note that even in this challenging market, we grew sales year-over-year and faster than the underlying markets in Environmental Technologies, Life Sciences and Specialty Materials.
It is also important to note that, while we were taking these steps, we continue to advance our long-term growth initiatives, investing in technology and innovating with customers to capture future commercial opportunities. 
Now before I get into the details of our performance and results, I want to note that the largest difference between our GAAP and core results come from charges related to capacity realignment in Display Technologies and Optical Communications. Other differences between our GAAP and core results come from a noncash mark-to-market adjustment for our currency hedge contracts and a change in our tax reserves. 
With respect to mark-to-market adjustments, GAAP accounting requires earnings translation hedge contracts and foreign debt settling in future periods to be mark-to-market and recorded at current value at the end of each quarter even though those contracts will not be settled in the current quarter. For us, this impacted GAAP earnings in the quarter -- in quarter 3 by $72 million. 
Now to be clear, this mark-to-market accounting has no impact on our cash flow. Our currency hedges protect us economically from foreign exchange rate fluctuations and provide higher certainty for our earnings and cash flow, our ability to invest for growth and our future shareholder distributions. Our non-GAAP or core results provide additional transparency into operations by using a constant-currency rate aligned with the economics of our underlying transactions.
We're very pleased with our hedging program and the economic certainty it provides. We received $1.7 billion in cash under our hedge contracts since their inception more than 5 years ago.
That brings me to our results and outlook. For the third quarter, sales were $3 billion. Net income was $397 million, and EPS was $0.44. Operating cash flow in the quarter was $864 million. As we said in July, we built working capital in the second half. We also said we expected to reduce working capital in the second half.
We -- sorry, as I said in July, we built working capital in the first half. We also said we expected to reduce working capital in the second half, and we did reduce working capital in Q3 and expect to further reduce it in Q4.
Now let's look at the detailed segment results and outlook. In Display Technologies, third quarter sales were $793 million, and net income was $185 million. Net income was down year-over-year, primarily driven by the lower volume. Third quarter volume was down high single digit sequentially, and prices were consistent with the second quarter, both as expected.
Now there's no change in our outlook in terms of volume. Retail demand is tracking to our expectations with TV viewing area growing year-to-date through August, and preliminary data for September is also encouraging. The industry, however, remains conservative on inventory, and panel maker utilization is expected to stay at current levels in the fourth quarter. Consequently, we expect our fourth quarter glass volume to be down mid-single digits sequentially.
That said, we expect this current supply chain adjustment to be temporary. We expect panel maker utilization to increase in the first half of 2020 over the second half of 2019.
Glass pricing in the fourth quarter continues to be positive. We expect prices to decline only slightly sequentially, which is equivalent to down low single digits year-over-year.
For the full year, our volume outlook remains consistent with our September 16 update. We expect our volume to be up slightly year-over-year, which is higher than the glass market, driven by the ramp of our Gen 10.5 facility in Hefei. 
In terms of price, our outlook is more favorable than our previous guidance. We are revising our full year price guidance to low single digit declines from prior expectations of low to mid-single-digit declines, and we expect that the favorable pricing environment will continue into 2020. 
Now 3 factors drive our view. First, we expect glass supply to continue to be balanced to demand or even tight. For Corning, we are aligning our capacity with demand. We are also pacing our Gen 10.5 capital projects to align with panel makers' schedules. 
Second, our competitors continue to face profitability challenges at current pricing levels. 
And third, display glass manufacturing requires periodic investments in existing capacity to maintain operations. Glass prices must support acceptable returns on those investments.
In summary, we are experiencing a temporary supply chain correction. However, retail TV viewing area is growing and expected to create more demand for display glass, especially at Gen 10.5. As the leader in Gen 10.5, we expect to capture most of the growth, and we expect the favorable pricing environment to continue.
Results in Optical Communications were consistent with our September update. In the third quarter, sales were $1 billion, and net income was $127 million. Our third quarter sales and net income were down versus last year. These results reflect overall market weakness, including the spending decisions of several major carrier customers. 
For the full year, we continue to expect sales to decline in the 3% to 5% range, as previously guided.
We have taken actions to align our costs to our current sales reality, including idling capacity, pacing capital projects and reducing operating expenses to align with near-term sales projections. At the same time, we continue to innovate to improve network speed, cost and capacity and to secure long-term agreements with major industry players, sustaining our confidence and our ability to outperform and deliver long-term growth.
In Environmental Technologies, third quarter sales were $397 million, up 20% year-over-year and ahead of expectations, driven by continued adoption of gasoline particulate filters and strong demand in the heavy-duty diesel market. Net income grew 32%, driven by strong operational performance and successful ramping of additional GPS capacity in China. 
We are well on our way to building a greater than $500 million gasoline particulate filter business. With a market-leading product, we continue to earn a majority position globally as automakers award platforms to make Euro 6 and China 6 regulations. Sales are accelerating as Euro 6 regulations are in full effect, and automakers are preparing for China 6 implementation in 2020. 
Our Hefei plant start-up is ahead of schedule and has been key to delivering incremental sales and net income. As a result, we continue to expect GPF sales to exceed $200 million in 2019 and to grow robustly thereafter.
Our strong performance is expected to extend into the fourth quarter with sales growth up by a low teen percentage year-over-year. Given a strong second half, we now expect full year sales to be up by a mid-teen percentage compared to our previous guidance of a low-teen percentage.
In Specialty Materials, third quarter sales were $463 million, and net income was $92 million. We were pleased with strong sales from our new innovations, as Wendell noted. However, our overall sales growth was muted because our Gorilla Glass shipments in China were lower due to the current trade environment and Advanced Optic sales were down on semiconductor market weakness.
From a profitability standpoint, some of our newer innovations start initially at lower margins and could not offset the loss of higher margin Gorilla Glass and AO products. We anticipate these issues will improve over time as the trade situation is resolved, the semiconductor market returns to growth and we reduce costs on newer innovations as we come up the learning curve.
For the fourth quarter, we expect sales to be approximately flat year-over-year. We expect full year sales growth again despite a smartphone market that is down year-over-year. This growth is driven by adoption of new innovations, including premium cover glass and innovative parts products, including DX+, for wearables.
Life Sciences third quarter sales were $256 million, up 11% year-over-year. Net income was $41 million, up 37%. For both the fourth quarter and the full year, we expect sales to be at mid-single digits year-over-year.
In summary, our third quarter performance was impacted by changes in the display and optical markets, and we took actions to lower our costs to our align with those lower sales. We now expect the full year price decline in display to improve to a low single digit percentage. 
We grew sales in Environmental, Specialty Materials and Life Sciences year-over-year and faster than their underlying markets, and we delivered strategic milestones with Apple's investment and FDA approval of Valor Glass.
Now let's turn to the consolidated P&L. Gross margin in the third quarter was 39%, as expected. Last quarter, we talked about the Gen 10.5 facility, and I'd like to give you an update. We continue to make progress coming up the learning curve and improving our costs in our Gen 10.5 plant, which should lead to further improvement in 2020. 
We are excited about our Gen 10.5 projects because they enable us to capture the majority of the market growth and will ultimately provide a step-change in glass manufacturing. 
For the rest of our P&L, there has been no change in our guidance. Gross margin is inspected to be approximately 39% in the back half. SG&A and RD&E is expected to be just under 14% and approximately 8.5% of sales, respectively, for the year, and capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $2 billion.
Moving to additional outlook details. We expect other income, other expense to be approximately $260 million for the full year. 
Full year gross equity earnings are expected to be approximately $230 million, predominantly from Hemlock Semiconductor, and we expect our effective tax rate for 2019 to be approximately 20%.
In closing, we acted quickly in the third quarter to address changing market conditions. We met our revised targets. We continued our actions to advance our long-term growth plans, and we remain confident in our strategy. We are operating on the strong foundation that we've built over the last 4 years, and we're making progress in key areas, as evidenced by our ongoing customer announcements. This makes us confident in our ability to achieve the objectives we laid out in our 2020-2023 Strategy & Growth Framework.

So as you noted in your earlier question, we tend to grow much faster than our underlying markets as customers adopt more of our innovations in their products. And this has been true in Opto, Life Sciences, Gorilla and Auto over the last 4 years where our growth rate has been significantly higher than that of the underlying markets we serve. And that's a good thing.
But it also means that from a forecasting perspective, we need to be right about both the underlying market and the rate of adoption of specific technologies at specific customers in a specific time frame. This can be difficult. During quarter 3, we heard from some key customers that they plan to reduce their spending on our products below their existing run rate and our expectations. We, in turn, lowered our expectations across those industries, and we initiated actions to adjust our costs and capacity accordingly. Now as we finish the quarter, some customers exceed that assumed take rate and we performed better. That being said, our approach for the remainder of the year is the same, and we're reaffirming our guidance at this time. Is that helpful to you, sir?"

So the answer is, yes, we're continuing to see momentum building on exterior. However, at the same time, the very strong positive upside has been demand for our new technologies in interior, and we've been shifting more of our resources because the key to innovation is you have to go really towards those positive surprises towards interior. And we continue to build both our order book and momentum there.

And as both Wendell and I said, I mean, we haven't really changed our perspective on the market for the rest of the year for the full year.
And in fact, things are coming in a little bit better than what we originally expected, but, equally, maybe even more important than that, is what's happening with TV sizes. 65-inch TVs are growing greater than 40% on a year-over-year basis, and 75-inch TVs are growing greater than 60% on a year-over-year basis. So we believe in the fundamental drivers of this -- what's happening in this business.

And then -- but, at the same time, we saw adoption of our new technologies, some specific customers more than offsetting that sort of underlying heartbeat. And I think this probably led us to being able to believe as long as that continued, we could ride out this temporary dip in the end market for Optical without having much impact on us.
That turned out not to be true as some specific customers who were adopting this strong tech, changed some of their timing and capital plans. That being said, though it's very hard to call the exact timing by quarter or even by year, we remain more confident than ever that the fundamental drivers for the demand of our technology will become increasingly ascendant.
5G is going to take the wireless network from being a fiber-poor network to a very fiber-rich network. Our innovations in hyperscale are going to push that optical signal closer to the edge and use more of our product. So over the long term, we see a set of demand that is higher for glass. Because densification of networks is occurring, that will lead to glassification. And if we do our job well, we will capture our unfair share of that."

This morning, we reported results in line with the early update we released in September. Sales were $3 billion. Net income was $397 million, and EPS was $0.44.

Sales were $3 billion. Net income was $397 million, and EPS was $0.44. 
While challenges unfolded throughout the quarter, our results and expectations are consistent with our September update. We are not immune to the types of challenges facing us and many other companies this earnings season, but I think we are more resilient than at any other time in our history, and we are taking actions on the things within our control.
We're adjusting our cost and capacity, while, at the same time, maintaining focus on key growth initiatives. We continue to invest in technology and innovate with industry leaders across our markets as we pursue the rich set of opportunities outlined in our 2020-2023 Strategy & Growth Framework.
I'd like to share a few other important notes on the quarter. The favorable pricing environment in the Display market continued as third quarter glass prices in Display Technologies were consistent with the second quarter.
Environmental Technologies grew sales 20% year-over-year as the company's gasoline particulate filter solution propelled sales well above the underlying auto industry growth rate. Specialty Materials and Life Sciences also grew faster than their underlying markets as adoption of Corning's new technology continued.
Of course, we're living in uncertain times. We see it in the headlines about trade disputes, political unrest and China's economy. Amid this uncertainty, you may be wondering why we continue to be confident that we will grow over the next 4 years. 
Part of our confidence stems from the relevance of our technology leadership and the tangible customer commitments that support our build projects. We're also confident because we're not just counting on everybody buying more stuff. Instead, we're putting more Corning into the products that people already buy. This provides a mechanism for us to grow even when spending in the end market category is down. There's no clearer example than in automotive.
In the third quarter, we grew sales in Environmental 20% in a market that is expected to be down 3% this year. Our growth is driven by increasing sales of our proprietary gasoline particulate filters, which track fine particulates and help reduce harmful engine emissions. 
From a financial perspective, GPS increased Corning's opportunity per car by $30. These types of content plays create a path for growth even when underlying unit demand is flat or declining, as our environmental results are demonstrating.
We expect to double our sales to the auto industry by 2023. By adding auto grade interior glass solutions to GPS, we increase our opportunity per car by another $25 to about $70 in total. That's up almost a factor of 5 versus just 2 years ago. 
And additional products will further increase our opportunity. So we're not counting on more cars being sold, we're driving more Corning into each car. 
In short, a big part of Corning's story over the next 4 years is a content story. We see it playing out in Mobile Consumer Electronics, Display, Optical Communications and Life Sciences Vessels as well as Automotive. Because we're capturing significant technology substitutions, we have sales drivers beyond just end market growth. 
Let's look at how we advanced our strategy in each market access platform in the third quarter. 
In Optical Communications, we continue to be impacted by capital spending reductions in both the carrier and enterprise markets. Despite this near-term weakness, we are confident in our ability to outperform the passive optical market over time. As you've seen, with Fiber to the Home and corporate data centers, Corning is the unquestioned technology and market leader. We delivered on those opportunities, and we are well positioned for the next waves of growth as 5G and hyperscale data centers drive the optical signal closer to the edge.
Our near-term goals in Optical Communications are to align costs with demand and to continue advancing our product portfolio through co-innovation. We made progress in both areas during the quarter. 
Verizon and Corning are co-innovating at our manufacturing and technology center in Hickory, North Carolina. Engineers from both companies are using Verizon's 5G ultra wideband service and Corning's optical fiber and cable innovations to explore the capabilities of 5G in a manufacturing environment. Our work will demonstrate 5G's ability to revolutionize the way goods and services are produced as the technology enhances capabilities like machine learning, augmented reality and virtual reality.
Corning is also co-innovating on 5G with Intel. We're making future 5G in building networks scalable and easy to install. Our innovations will allow for faster adoption of 5G features as they are standardized. 
Shifting to hyperscale. Corning and Facebook are demonstrating how to meet ever increasing bandwidth demand through space division multiplexing or SDM. 
Internet content providers like Google and Facebook are making SDM their primary strategy for increasing capacity between their data centers across the globe. In short, this technology boosts the number of fibers in a submarine cable and multiplies Corning's opportunity per cable by up to 4x. 
In Mobile Consumer Electronics, we're well on our way to doubling sales despite a maturing smartphone market. Apple announced that it is awarding $250 million from its Advanced Manufacturing Fund to Corning. This builds on the $200 million we received from Apple's fund in 2017. Both investments support Corning's state-of-the-art glass processes, equipment and materials integral to the delivery of next-generation consumer devices.
In the third quarter, we continued to lead the industry as our innovations were adopted on more and more devices. Apple announced phones with the toughest glass ever used on a smartphone, and we saw the launch of multiple laptops, convertibles and tablets with Gorilla Glass. 
Corning continues to win in new device categories with 9 wearable launches in quarter 3, 4 featuring Gorilla Glass DX and DX+. Gorilla Glass DX delivers improved optics, while DX+ also provides scratch resistance approaching the finest watches. Both maintain the superior drop performance of Gorilla Glass. 
Moving to the Automotive market. As I already noted, our goal is to double sales by 2023. In the third quarter, we continued ramping production capacity in Hefei, China to meet committed demand for both our auto glass solutions and our gasoline particulate filter products. We're making great progress building a $500 million plus GPF business, and we expect over $200 million in 2019 sales. 
Our auto glass solutions business continues to build its order book. At next month's Guangzhou Auto Show, the industry's first shaped dual-display module with a single cover glass part will be on display in the GAC Aion LX, an electric vehicle. The module's cover glass is produced using Corning's 3D ColdForm technology.
In Life Science Vessels, we have some very exciting news. The FDA has approved Corning Valor Glass for use as a primary packaging for an already marketed drug produced by a leading pharmaceutical company. This approval makes Valor Glass the first and only fundamentally new glass composition to be approved by the FDA since the advent of borosilicate glass more than 100 years ago. 
This approval also marks a major milestone in our strategy to build a long-term, multi-billion dollar franchise, and the success provides another step on our journey to create a new higher standard in pharmaceutical glass packaging. 
Overall, we continue making good progress with our development partners and interest, and engagement with other major pharmaceutical manufacturers continues to grow as well.
In Display, our goal is to stabilize returns. In the near term, retail demand continues to track to our expectations with TV viewing area growing year-to-date through August. Set makers are purchasing panels more conservatively apparently due to macro uncertainty, which drove panel maker utilization reductions in the third quarter. This caused the panel makers to purchase less glass in the third quarter. 
We expect this supply chain adjustment to be temporary and for panel maker utilization to increase in the first half of 2020.
We remain confident in our long-term strategy because our growth driver is large-sized TVs, which are most efficiently produced by our customers on Gen 10.5 fabs. 
Our leadership in Gen 10.5 glass supports medium and longer-term volume growth despite temporary supply chain adjustments. 
And we have great news about pricing. We now expect full year glass price declines of a low single digit percentage compared with our previous guidance of a low- to mid-single-digit percentage. You can see that across our markets. 
Our strategic investments are well aligned with major trends, and our relationships with industry-leading customers are creating new opportunities. Of course, we understand our current environment, and we'll continue to navigate thoughtfully through any headwinds that may arise.
Now let me turn the call over to Tony for more details."
173840,637321097,1846500,"Corning Incorporated, Q3 2019 Earnings Call, Oct 29, 2019",2019-10-29,"Earnings Calls","Corning Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Wendell, and good morning.

In the third quarter, Corning took steps to offset recent market headwinds. 
In Display Technologies, we aligned capacity to demand. 
In Optical Communications, we idled capacity and reduced capital spending to reflect our customers' near-term infrastructure investment plans. And across the company, we reduced operating expenses to align with near-term sales projections. 
While we experienced these headwinds and took steps to offset them, it is important to note that even in this challenging market, we grew sales year-over-year and faster than the underlying markets in Environmental Technologies, Life Sciences and Specialty Materials.
It is also important to note that, while we were taking these steps, we continue to advance our long-term growth initiatives, investing in technology and innovating with customers to capture future commercial opportunities. 
Now before I get into the details of our performance and results, I want to note that the largest difference between our GAAP and core results come from charges related to capacity realignment in Display Technologies and Optical Communications. Other differences between our GAAP and core results come from a noncash mark-to-market adjustment for our currency hedge contracts and a change in our tax reserves. 
With respect to mark-to-market adjustments, GAAP accounting requires earnings translation hedge contracts and foreign debt settling in future periods to be mark-to-market and recorded at current value at the end of each quarter even though those contracts will not be settled in the current quarter. For us, this impacted GAAP earnings in the quarter -- in quarter 3 by $72 million. 
Now to be clear, this mark-to-market accounting has no impact on our cash flow. Our currency hedges protect us economically from foreign exchange rate fluctuations and provide higher certainty for our earnings and cash flow, our ability to invest for growth and our future shareholder distributions. Our non-GAAP or core results provide additional transparency into operations by using a constant currency rate aligned with the economics of our underlying transactions.
We're very pleased with our hedging program and the economic certainty it provides. We received $1.7 billion in cash under our hedge contracts since their inception more than 5 years ago.
That brings me to our results and outlook. For the third quarter, sales were $3 billion. Net income was $397 million, and EPS was $0.44. Operating cash flow in the quarter was $864 million. As we said in July, we built working capital in the second half. We also said we expected to reduce working capital in the second half.
We -- sorry, as I said in July, we built working capital in the first half. We also said we expected to reduce working capital in the second half, and we did reduce working capital in Q3 and expect to further reduce it in Q4.
Now let's look at the detailed segment results and outlook. In Display Technologies, third quarter sales were $793 million, and net income was $185 million. Net income was down year-over-year primarily driven by the lower volume. Third quarter volume was down high single digit sequentially, and prices were consistent with the second quarter, both as expected.
Now there's no change in our outlook in terms of volume. Retail demand is tracking to our expectations with TV viewing area growing year-to-date through August, and preliminary data for September is also encouraging. The industry, however, remains conservative on inventory, and panel maker utilization is expected to stay at current levels in the fourth quarter. Consequently, we expect our fourth quarter glass volume to be down mid-single digits sequentially.
That said, we expect this current supply chain adjustment to be temporary. We expect panel maker utilization to increase in the first half of 2020 over the second half of 2019.
Glass pricing in the fourth quarter continues to be positive. We expect prices to decline only slightly sequentially, which is equivalent to down low single digits year-over-year.
For the full year, our volume outlook remains consistent with our September 16 update. We expect our volume to be up slightly year-over-year, which is higher than the glass market, driven by the ramp of our Gen 10.5 facility in Hefei. 
In terms of price, our outlook is more favorable than our previous guidance. We are revising our full year price guidance to low single-digit declines from prior expectations of low to mid-single-digit declines, and we expect that the favorable pricing environment will continue into 2020. 
Now 3 factors drive our view. First, we expect glass supply to continue to be balanced to demand or even tight. For Corning, we are aligning our capacity with demand. We are also pacing our Gen 10.5 capital projects to align with panel makers' schedules. 
Second, our competitors continue to face profitability challenges at current pricing levels. 
And third, display glass manufacturing requires periodic investments in existing capacity to maintain operations. Glass prices must support acceptable returns on those investments.
In summary, we are experiencing a temporary supply chain correction. However, retail TV viewing area is growing and expected to create more demand for display glass, especially at Gen 10.5. As the leader in Gen 10.5, we expect to capture most of the growth, and we expect the favorable pricing environment to continue.
Results in Optical Communications were consistent with our September update. In the third quarter, sales were $1 billion, and net income was $127 million. Our third quarter sales and net income were down versus last year. These results reflect overall market weakness, including the spending decisions of several major carrier customers. 
For the full year, we continue to expect sales to decline in the 3% to 5% range, as previously guided.
We have taken actions to align our costs to our current sales reality, including idling capacity, pacing capital projects and reducing operating expenses to align with near-term sales projections. At the same time, we continue to innovate to improve network speed, cost and capacity and to secure long-term agreements with major industry players, sustaining our confidence and our ability to outperform and deliver long-term growth.
In Environmental Technologies, third quarter sales were $397 million, up 20% year-over-year and ahead of expectations, driven by continued adoption of gasoline particulate filters and strong demand in the heavy-duty diesel market. Net income grew 32% driven by strong operational performance and successful ramping of additional GPS capacity in China. 
We are well on our way to building a greater than $500 million gasoline particulate filter business. With a market-leading product, we continue to earn a majority position globally as automakers award platforms to make Euro 6 and China 6 regulations. Sales are accelerating as Euro 6 regulations are in full effect, and automakers are preparing for China 6 implementation in 2020. 
Our Hefei plant start-up is ahead of schedule and has been key to delivering incremental sales and net income. As a result, we continue to expect GPF sales to exceed $200 million in 2019 and to grow robustly thereafter.
Our strong performance is expected to extend into the fourth quarter with sales growth up by a low teen percentage year-over-year. Given a strong second half, we now expect full year sales to be up by a mid-teen percentage compared to our previous guidance of a low-teen percentage.
In Specialty Materials, third quarter sales were $463 million, and net income was $92 million. We were pleased with strong sales from our new innovations, as Wendell noted. However, our overall sales growth was muted because our Gorilla Glass shipments in China were lower due to the current trade environment and Advanced Optic sales were down on semiconductor market weakness.
From a profitability standpoint, some of our newer innovations start initially at lower margins and could not offset the loss of higher-margin Gorilla Glass and AO products. We anticipate these issues will improve over time as the trade situation is resolved, the semiconductor market returns to growth and we reduce costs on newer innovations as we come up the learning curve.
For the fourth quarter, we expect sales to be approximately flat year-over-year. We expect full year sales growth again despite a smartphone market that is down year-over-year. This growth is driven by adoption of new innovations, including premium cover glass and innovative parts products, including DX+, for wearables.
Life Sciences third quarter sales were $256 million, up 11% year-over-year. Net income was $41 million, up 37%. For both the fourth quarter and the full year, we expect sales to be at mid-single digits year-over-year.
In summary, our third quarter performance was impacted by changes in the display and optical markets, and we took actions to lower our costs to our align with those lower sales. We now expect the full year price decline in display to improve to a low single-digit percentage. 
We grew sales in Environmental, Specialty Materials and Life Sciences year-over-year and faster than their underlying markets, and we delivered strategic milestones with Apple's investment and FDA approval of Valor Glass.
Now let's turn to the consolidated P&L. Gross margin in the third quarter was 39%, as expected. Last quarter, we talked about the Gen 10.5 facility, and I'd like to give you an update. We continue to make progress coming up the learning curve and improving our costs in our Gen 10.5 plant, which should lead to further improvement in 2020. 
We are excited about our Gen 10.5 projects because they enable us to capture the majority of the market growth and will ultimately provide a step-change in glass manufacturing. 
For the rest of our P&L, there has been no change in our guidance. Gross margin is inspected to be approximately 39% in the back half. SG&A and RD&E is expected to be just under 14% and approximately 8.5% of sales, respectively, for the year, and capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $2 billion.
Moving to additional outlook details. We expect other income, other expense to be approximately $260 million for the full year. 
Full year gross equity earnings are expected to be approximately $230 million, predominantly from Hemlock Semiconductor, and we expect our effective tax rate for 2019 to be approximately 20%.
In closing, we acted quickly in the third quarter to address changing market conditions. We met our revised targets. We continued our actions to advance our long-term growth plans, and we remain confident in our strategy. We are operating on the strong foundation that we've built over the last 4 years, and we're making progress in key areas, as evidenced by our ongoing customer announcements. This makes us confident in our ability to achieve the objectives we laid out in our 2020-2023 Strategy & Growth Framework.

So as you noted in your earlier question, we tend to grow much faster than our underlying markets as customers adopt more of our innovations in their products. And this has been true in Opto, Life Sciences, Gorilla and Auto over the last 4 years where our growth rate has been significantly higher than that of the underlying markets we serve. And that's a good thing.
But it also means that from a forecasting perspective, we need to be right about both the underlying market and the rate of adoption of specific technologies at specific customers in a specific time frame. This can be difficult. During quarter 3, we heard from some key customers that they plan to reduce their spending on our products below their existing run rate and our expectations. We, in turn, lowered our expectations across those industries, and we initiated actions to adjust our costs and capacity accordingly. Now as we finish the quarter, some customers exceed that assumed take rate and we performed better. That being said, our approach for the remainder of the year is the same, and we're reaffirming our guidance at this time. Is that helpful to you, sir?"

And in fact, things are coming in a little bit better than what we originally expected, but, equally, maybe even more important than that, is what's happening with TV sizes. 65-inch TVs are growing greater than 40% on a year-over-year basis, and 75-inch TVs are growing greater than 60% on a year-over-year basis. So we believe in the fundamental drivers of this -- what's happening in this business.

And I think this probably led us to being able to believe as long as that continued, we could ride out this temporary dip in the end market for Optical without having much impact on us.
That turned out not to be true as some specific customers who were adopting this strong tech, changed some of their timing and capital plans. That being said, though it's very hard to call the exact timing by quarter or even by year, we remain more confident than ever that the fundamental drivers for the demand of our technology will become increasingly ascendant.
5G is going to take the wireless network from being a fiber-poor network to a very fiber-rich network. Our innovations in hyperscale are going to push that optical signal closer to the edge and use more of our product. So over the long term, we see a set of demand that is higher for glass.

So I would say we should keep our expectations low for the near term on it having any significant impact on us.
It is very confirmatory for our long-term revenue opportunities and our ability to really bring life-changing innovation to market. But from a financial modeling standpoint, I will continue to caution and say exercise great strength. At such time as we believe it becomes important to start modeling this in, we will articulate that."

Our particular dynamics all depend on what you compare to, right? So if I look delta to last year, we can have a different sort of answer than the total market because we grew so much faster than the total market, right? So we can have dynamics that in the near term, at any given quarter, can be a little different than that market.

And over the sweep of time, we should do better than the overall markets just due to the ascendancy of our technology. Does that answer your question, sir?"
