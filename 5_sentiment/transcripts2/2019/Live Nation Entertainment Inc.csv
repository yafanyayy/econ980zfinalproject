I will make my comments today, excluding the 2017 impacts of $110 million legal settlement to keep our year-over-year numbers comparable. Live.Nation delivered it's ei",1139,"Good afternoon, and welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2018 conference call. I will make my comments today, excluding the 2017 impacts of $110 million legal settlement to keep our year-over-year numbers comparable. Live.
Nation delivered it's eighth consecutive year of record results. Revenue was up 11%, AOI up 13% and free cash flow up 8%. All our divisions, concerts, sponsorship and ticketing delivered their strongest AOI results in the history of the company. 
Starting with our Concert unit. Fans, more than ever, find the live experience from club shows to arenas to festivals a top entertainment choice and the best way to celebrate their favorite artists and show the experience with fans. 
In the U.S. alone, over the past 10 years, consumer spend on live experiences has grown by $5 billion per year. We believe this ongoing trend will structurally continue to drive increased demand for concerts globally. 
As a result of the strong demand growth in 2018, we delivered double-digit attendance growth across our arenas, amphitheaters and theaters and clubs, continuing to grow our global market share, adding nearly 7 million fans globally for a total of 93 million fans, driving concert revenue up 11% and AOI up 22%. 
Across all of the artists we work with, we invested over $6 billion to promote 35,000 shows in 40 countries, with Live Nation by far the largest financial supporter of artists and music. In addition to growing our show count and attendance, our pricing and on-site initiatives also continued to grow our AOI. Average ticket prices for our amphitheater and arena shows increased by 13% in 2018, as part of the house pricing was up over 20%. Overall, across all our shows, price increases delivered over $350 million to artists who effectively captured more of the value from the shows. 
Once at the show, average per fans spend grew as well. At our amphitheaters, spend grew by $3 to $27 per head as we added more high-end products, improved the quality of our food and beverage and increased the revenue we earned from parking and service fees. 
The strength of our business is continuing in 2019 with ticket sales for shows this year up double digits through mid-February, along with similar increases and confirmed amphitheater, arena and stadium show count. With this growth and our plan to further monetize our fan relationship, I expect this to translate to continued strong growth in concerts AOI in 2019. 
In our high-end sponsorship business, we grew both revenue and AOI by 13% in 2018. Our top strategic sponsors have been a key driver of this growth, with 75 sponsors collectively spending over $350 million to reach our fans, up 11% over 2017. 
Sponsorship at our festivals grew 13%. This growth was driven by new deals with brands including Heineken, Barclays, State Farm and Frito-Lay. All these reinforced the power of our platform of 93 million fans and the continued shift by brand to invest in reaching fans during live experiences. 
Research from our Power of Live white paper indicates that over 90% of fans believe that brands can enhance the live experience, and over 60% of fans believe they are more likely to connect with brands at concerts. This reinforces that our shows offer brands at truly unique opportunity to connect with fans. 
With over 70% of budgeted sponsorship net revenue for the year already committed [indiscernible] double digits ahead of last year this time, we are confident we will again deliver double-digit AOI growth for 2019. 
Ticketmaster continued growing its leadership position in ticketing in 2018, with fee-bearing GTV up 14% and total platform GTV up 33 billion. This drove our 14% increase in ticketing revenue and AOI of 7%. 
Our top priority at Ticketmaster 2018 was deploying our TM presence product, which we see as our key for effectively unlocking the value of our customer relationship across ticketing concerts and sponsorship business. 
For the end of 2018, we deployed Presence in over 200 venues, operating 20,000 events for 40 million fans, approximately half of whom used our digital tickets. We see our deployment in 2019 further accelerating, and we are expecting to have Presence in over 500 venues by the end of the year with 125 million fans attending events at these buildings. At that point, we will have covered 75% of major sports and Live Nation building taking Ticketmaster by far the global leader in digital tickets. 
At the same time, we continue to build our marketplace, with the fourth quarter being our highest fee-bearing GTV quarter ever selling over 60 million fee-bearing ticket in the quarter for the first time and delivering over 5 billion in fee-bearing GTV. Overall, in 2018, Ticketmaster managed over 400,000 events, delivering almost 500 million tickets in 28 countries. We continue adding new clients to our marketplace who collectively added over 10 million new tickets in 2018. I believe we have a tremendous opportunity for growth on a global basis, particularly in the 13 markets where we promote concert but don't yet have a substantial ticketing operation. 
In 2018, we furthered our international expansion, establishing ticketing operations in Italy, ramping up our German operations and laying the groundwork for our expansion in Latin America. Ticketmaster continues to exceed expectations, both operationally and in its leadership position in digital ticketing, along with its ability to expand that leadership position globally and deliver continued profitable growth. 
In summary, 2018 was another strong year for Live Nation, building our global concert business and thereby driving growth in our high-margin venues, sponsorship and ticketing businesses. We continue to see the tremendous power of live events with strong consumer demand, the robust supply of new and established artists hitting in the road from clubs to stadium. Live is truly unique entertainment form. It cannot be duplicated and creates lifetime memories that fans are craving more than ever in this experienced economy. We believe the live business will continue to have strong growth for years to come as fans globally drive demand, artists are turning more and more and on-site spending sponsorship and ticketing all benefit from the concerts flywheel. 
In 2019, I expect us to further grow our global concert position while enhancing on-site hospitality and capturing more pricing opportunities. In sponsorship, we will continue to drive double-digit growth as more brands look for that direct connection with music fans. And in ticketing continues to transform to a truly digital ecosystem that will benefit from continued growth in concert ticket sales and further expansion of our global footprint. 
We believe that the combination of macro trends and our demonstrated ability to execute are strong indicators of our ability to continue to grow the business for many years to come. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Joe to take you through additional details."
384687,602499523,1674050,"Live Nation Entertainment, Inc., Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Feb 28, 2019",2019-02-28,"Earnings Calls","Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Michael. Looking at our business segments, first, concerts. As Michael said, in 2018, we grew attendance by 8% to a record 93 million fans promoting 19 of the top 25 global tours. As we have talked about over the past year, 2018 was a very strong",981,"Thanks, Michael. Looking at our business segments, first, concerts. As Michael said, in 2018, we grew attendance by 8% to a record 93 million fans promoting 19 of the top 25 global tours. As we have talked about over the past year, 2018 was a very strong year for arenas, amphitheaters and theaters and clubs, with all 3 building types up double digits in attendance. Globally, we also continued growing our festival portfolio, adding 7 festivals to give us a global portfolio of 104 festivals in 14 countries. As a result, we increased festival attendance by 6% to nearly 9 million fans and now have 29 festivals that each attracted over 100,000 fans last year. 
Looking geographically. North America was the primary driver of our fan growth while internationally, the cyclically lower stadium attendance offset much of their strong arena and festival attendance growth. 
Looking specifically at the fourth quarter. While attendance and show count were up, our AOI was lower, heavily driven by a $15 million year-on-year increase in advertising expense related to 2019 shows. This increased advertising spend is representative of a continued shift earlier on sales and is also one of the reasons we are optimistic about 2019 concert activity. 
For 2019, as Michael said, we are already seeing strong growth in ticket sales for shows this year. Sales are particularly strong in our international markets, which we expect to continue through the year, with North America also expected to keep growing. We see growth across all building types in 2019 with arenas globally, amphitheaters in North America and stadiums internationally, all contributing to the increase. Along with our fan growth, we will also be continuing our focus on pricing optimization and on-site monetization in 2019. 
On pricing, with over 2,000 arena and amphitheater shows already on sale, we are seeing high-single-digit increases in front-of-house pricing, which I expect to continue or expand throughout the year. And while our on-site monetization won't start until the summer season, it remains a priority to continue our growth for the past few years with teams already working on specific amphitheater-by-amphitheater plans. 
Turning to our sponsorship and advertising business. In 2018, we again delivered double-digit AOI growth, up 13% this year. This performance was reflective of strength across the board. North America and international sponsorship businesses were both up double digits, and both sponsorship and online advertising also grew double digits. 
For the fourth quarter, revenue was up 20%, and AOI was up 16%. We saw particularly strong growth at our festivals in the fourth quarter, including Austin City Limits and [ Gudu ], while also launching a number of major programs for sponsors including Google, Sony, Pepsi, Uber and T-Mobile. As we get into 2019, we expect to again deliver double-digit AOI growth for the year. As Michael indicated, we are pacing double digits ahead over this time last year. And based on our current discussions with brands, we're expecting strong growth in our base of strategic sponsors as well as our on-site sponsorship, particularly at festivals. 
Finally, Ticketmaster. Global GTV was up 7% for the quarter and up 8% for the full year, driven by fee-bearing GTV, which was up 12% and 14% for the quarter and year, respectively. Primary GTV, which accounts for almost 90% of overall fee-bearing GTV, was up 12% for the quarter and 14% for the full year. Secondary GTV was up 6% for the quarter and up 16% for the full year as we continue to take share in the North America secondary market. 
Throughout 2018, we continue to improve our mobile and app experiences, which is critical for our digital strategy. We grew our app installed base by 40% year-over-year, giving us much greater reach for direct fan relationships. And sales of tickets via mobile devices continue to grow rapidly, up 35% for the year and accounting for over 40% of overall ticket sales. 
For the fourth quarter, Ticketmaster AOI was down slightly, impacted by onetime costs associated with the third-party vendor data breach that affected our marketplace in certain international markets. Much of these costs were in the fourth quarter, and for the full year, these onetime costs totaled approximately $15 million. 
The preemptive question on margins, obviously, these data breach costs had a material impact on our 2018 margins. The majority of the remaining margin impact comes from 2 other factors. 
First, as Michael indicated, we are continuing to invest in expanding Ticketmaster's global footprint, and we expect that any start of the market will have below-average margins for a period of time as it scales. These markets are generally rapidly AOI positive given our ability to get an allocation of Live Nation concert tickets, but initially at below average margins. 
Secondly, as we continue to get more effective at data-driven marketing, we are expanding more to grow our GTV. To be clear, the GTVs from free visits continued growing in 2018. The paid marketing-driven GTV grew even faster. As a result, margins were impacted despite the attractive profitability the incremental GTV generated via this paid marketing. 
So in summary, 2018 was a great year across all of our businesses, and in 2019, we expect to continue growing all of the businesses. From a stadium standpoint, we see our growth continuing to be delivered primarily in the second and third quarters, as most of our concert investments will be playing out in those quarters. The first and fourth quarters each account for less than 10% of our annual AOI, meaning that they will also have to absorb increased fixed costs associated with our overall growth against seasonally lower activity. 
On FX, we ended up with a negligible impact on AOI and revenue for 2018, and at this point, we see very little impact on 2019. 
I will now turn the call over to Kathy to go through more on our financial results."

I will start with our key highlights for the fourth quarter. Revenue increased by 12% to $2.6 billion. AOI was $69 million compared to $87 million in 2017 after adding back a $110 million legal accrual recorded in 2017. As of December 31, our deferred revenue related to future shows was $1.1 billion, up 35% from the $816 million last year. 
Concerts, with a 12% increase, contributed the majority of the revenue growth in the quarter from increased arena and theater and club activity. Sponsorship advertising revenue was up 20% from higher sponsor and online activity in North America, and ticketing revenue increased 15% from higher primary ticket volume. 
Fourth quarter AOI was lower in concerts due to the $15 million increase in advertising expense for 2019 shows that Joe mentioned. Sponsorships and advertising delivered 16% growth in AOI, with higher online advertising in North America and growth in sponsorships internationally. Our operating loss was $90 million in the quarter, essentially flat to last year after adjusting for the legal accrual. The net loss for the quarter was $148 million compared to a loss of $137 million in the prior year before the legal accrual and a $56 million tax benefit related to tax reform changes in 2017. 
For the 2018 full year, revenue was $10.8 billion, an 11% increase over 2017. AOI was $829 million for the full year, up 13% over our 2017 AOI of $735 million before the legal accrual. Free cash flow [indiscernible] was $481 million, up 8% over last year without the legal accrual or 58% of AOI for the year. Our segments delivered double-digit growth in revenue for 2018. The majority of the increase was driven by concerts, up 11% from increased show count and attendance across arenas, amphitheaters and theaters and clubs. Sponsorship & Advertising revenue was up 13% from growth in online advertising and sponsorship programs globally. And ticketing revenue increased by 14% from higher primary ticket volume, driven by concerts along, with increased secondary sales. Concerts AOI was up 22% as a result of more events and fans across arenas, amphitheaters, festivals and theaters and club and higher ancillary revenue per band in our amphitheaters. 
Sponsorship and advertising AOI grew by 13%, in line with this higher revenue. And ticketing AOI grew 7% without the 2017 legal accrual, delivering growth in both primary and secondary ticket sales, although impacted by the cyber investigation costs incurred this year that Joe noted. Operating income was $273 million, up 35% over last year before the legal accrual, driven by our strong AOI growth. Our net income for the year was $60 million as compared to $48 million in 2017 before the legal accrual and the 2017 tax reform-related tax benefit. We recorded $78 million of accretion at redeemable noncontrolling interests in 2018. We currently expect this accretion to be approximately $45 million for 2019, which will be consistently spread across the quarters. We expect that amortization of non-recoupable ticketing contract advances in 2019 will be in line with the last few years of expense. 
Turning to our balance sheet. As of December 31, we had total cash of $2.4 billion, including $859 million in ticketing client cash and $903 million in net concert event-related cash, leaving a free cash balance of $610 million. Net cash provided by operating activities was $942 million as compared to $624 million last year, with the increase driven by our higher event-related deferred revenue. For the full year, total capital expenditures were $251 million, roughly half of which was spent on revenue-generating items. For 2019, we currently expect our total capital expenditures to be approximately $300 million, with a similar split to this year for revenue-generating expenditures. Our total net debt as of December 2018 was $2.8 billion with a weighted average costs of 4.2%.

Each of the markets in terms of its maturation all has -- yes, hard to give you one-size-fits-all, but as I said, they do leave some AOI positive pretty quickly with our concerts location and then we grow it from there."

So a lot of these markets today are lower a service fee. They literally are still distributing out of the local bank. They may have a retail strategy, converting to online, but we also see international has a great opportunity. That is where we actually have a great pricing power. And every year, we're seeing the service fee going up to reflect kind of closer-to-the-U.S. model over time. So great profit pool to grow internationally outside of U.S., Canada."

So I think what we did say is, is the secondary industry over the past several years has been growing at a pretty good cliff, frankly faster than we have been growing our ticket prices. And so we think there continues to be over $1 billion of price arbitrage that exists in our concert tickets alone. If you look at the marketplace, we obviously have a two-headed strategy. One strategy is to create a compelling product on Ticketmaster that offers both the primary and secondary tickets. The other strategy, which is at least is important to us, is to continue to get more effective at that initial primary ticket price and transfer as much of the economics as possible into the artist's pocket, which continues to attract them to tour more and be out there generating more shows, more fans for our overall flywheel strategy. So going forward, I think it'll be our expectation that we would see less growth certainly the secondary market as we continue to focus on that primary pricing. I think they competitors in this space are pretty well known, obviously StubHub, [indiscernible] in the United States.

We still believe that the U.S., Canadian market, let's put those 2 together, still have growth ahead. We are still underserviced in markets, as we've talked before about. We still have opportunities to build more of our businesses in a lot of the A markets. We have low market share in a lot of big markets. So U.S. still has great potential. We still think sponsorship is a double-digit growth business in America, and we think the Concert business continues to be on-site, hospitality, real estate expansion, incredible, frothy opportunity in the U.S. So don't want to -- it's not an either/either where we continue to execute with great, great confidence. But we continue to invest in America. But we ask absolutely have always said that it's a global business. And as we build out the pipe in 40 countries, when we look at all the other cities around the world where we have no market share or low, as we put in the best promoter and a ticketing platform and our global concerts, which then follow usually sponsorship and ticketing, where we have that model down in major cities. And when we got those 3 to 4 legs of that stool in the land and Cape Town and Rio, we know we can build a $10 million to $20 million business. So with a whole bunch of opportunities international where we don't have the 4 legs, we might have 1 leg, that's why you see us buy a festival in a major market and a major promoter in a different market. As we fill out the legs, great opportunity organically will happen through our scale. So we'll be doing that for the next 5 to 10 years. We'll be talking about 30% market share and lots of opportunity to build international business platform. It's behind America in a lot of the ways. I just mentioned on ticketing. So we see it probably as a higher growth potential from unsophisticated in both sponsorship, ticketing and venue development so. All 3 of those, you'll see opportunities over the years. Call that the apparatus we want to get built. The consistent demand that we know is, Rhianna can sell out anywhere, and that's the part that makes our model unique. So continue growing international. That will be a great story for us for many years to come. We're diversing off now, but for certain market, just having a good or bad, we'll be okay we have enough risk aversion. And the U.S. will continue to have a deeper bench to grow on also."

We absolutely see a huge opportunity. If you look at our core business model, I'm sure people are sick of the phrase, and I do appreciate the book you enrich of let me patent from flywheel long before any other businesses as nail that one. So yes, we have a big flywheel concerts, and we're going to wake up every year finding new and adjacent businesses that we can monetize because of the flywheel. And no one in the world has 30,000 shows [ and ] almost 100 million people walking in the door. So that's why we believe in the U.S. and onward, we'll have -- it's endless growth opportunities. One of them happens to be the venue, the real estate. For many years, we were happy putting our content in someone else's venue and getting a ticket fee and selling tickets at the door. A lot of the times, as we've said in our different analyst meetings, when they content ends up in my amphitheater or my festival or my theater and club, we either make more money because we are now counting more revenue streams. And we look now at the real estate market in America, the advantage we have is there's way more real estate than there are artists. And if you're a developer right now with a shopping mall to a development site, you no longer are probably asking the movie theater to be your tenant. You're probably coming to Live Nation saying, I'd love you to build a 2,000-seat, a 4,000 seat, a 6,000-seat. I'd love you to be part of our development because that's the vibrant part of the experience we are creating. So what we're doing now is when those meetings happen and say we are not happy just take it and build your building. We want have equity value in that position and operate and run it to maximize all of the value that can be created from our 6 billion a year. So instead of may be paying somebody millions a year to lease their building to run it while we feel it, there are times when the real estate where our content is the entire reason the building is being financed or the building is growing in value. We should capture, not just the content, not just the food and beverage, but the equity value of the real estate holdings over time, too. So we're seeing more and more opportunities where our flywheel is putting us in a position to have some equity, ownership and control in some great assets that are completely down the middle, completely down the line of a concert live venue, and you'll see us explore more of being more a leverage in our content."

I would say, just in general, we are thrilled with this division. It's another -- I just mentioned it earlier, we have scale, we have artist relationships, great stories to be told so we started a new division organically. I think we've done 5 now. We've probably got 10 to 15 projects in the pipeline of artists telling great live stories or movies or documentaries or festival stories or et cetera. So we really think that division is obviously a much higher margin business from the concert space, but it's low capital-intensive business, but it ultimately is a great marketing platform for our artists, our shows and our Artist Nation division. So we think we're not really [ worried ] in 2019. It will be a small overall contribution to our agenda in AOI. Over time, we think it's a Artist Nation. We think it's a nice high-margin ancillary business to our core mission that will be a positive impact. But ultimately, we'll make AOI be positive much like we learned with Artist Nation and others. They also end up feeding motherships. So Artist Nation, star is born is probably the single greatest marketing exercise we could have did for our sponsorship division. If you are in that division, those kind of things just really setting the flywheel very high and get you in the CMO meeting and other conversations that you haven't been before. So we look at the pieces, always in the end of the [indiscernible] business, gets us one more tour, one more sponsor or one more ticketing contract and it makes high-margin AOI, it's a triple win."

The sports side obviously key historical foundation to the ticketing business that as we've talked, sports is also on probably a more static level. There's not a lot of growth in terms of the number of teams are the number of games played in a season for the major sports. So it's really been the Concerts business that has driven the great growth over the past several years of ticketing. Again, we've given the statistics several times around 80 percentage of a fee-bearing GTV, growth coming from the Concerts business. So it's critical on the sports side as we build incredible arenas, stadiums. They're looking to continue to fill those buildings every night, just, not just when the games are played. Those provide platforms for the tours, the artists that we work with to continue to put on more shows. And it's through putting on those more shows that we've been able to grow the business. So it's not the sports directly. It's the sports indirectly that's been the unlock of Ticketmaster's growth."

And we've always looked at EEG facilities or SMG as partners. They all need us to put more shows and fill those venues that they're managing, and they have all probably experimented elsewhere and ended up realizing Ticketmaster also happens to sell them the most tickets. They're managing those buildings for someone else generally. That someone else doesn't care about competition. They care about results. So the reason we're the largest supplier to AEG's facility business or SMG or others is because it's good business for both of us. So they've got a business to run. We'll continue to be a good supplier to them. And in return, I would assume a ticketing partner going forwards.

I will make my comments today excluding the 2017 impacts of the $110 million legal settlement to keep our year-over-year numbers comparable.Live Nation delivered its e",1141,"Good afternoon, and welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2018 conference call. I will make my comments today excluding the 2017 impacts of the $110 million legal settlement to keep our year-over-year numbers comparable.
Live Nation delivered its eighth consecutive year of record results. Revenue was up 11%, AOI up 13% and free cash flow up 8%. All our divisions, concerts, sponsorship and ticketing, delivered their strongest AOI results in the history of the company.
Starting with our concert unit. Fans, more than ever, find the live experience, from club shows to arenas to festivals, a top entertainment choice and the best way to celebrate their favorite artists and show the experience with fans. In the U.S. alone, over the past 10 years, consumer spend on live experiences has grown by $5 billion per year. We believe this ongoing trend will structurally continue to drive increased demand for concerts globally.
As a result of the strong demand growth in 2018, we delivered double-digit attendance growth across our arenas, amphitheaters and theaters and clubs, continuing to grow our global market share, adding nearly 7 million fans globally for a total of 93 million fans, driving concert revenue up 11% and AOI up 22%.
Across all of the artists we work with, we invested over $6 billion to promote 35,000 shows in 40 countries, with Live Nation by far the largest financial supporter of artists in music.
In addition to growing our show count and attendance, our pricing and on-site initiatives also continued to grow our AOI. Average ticket prices for our amphitheater and arena shows increased by 13% in 2018 as front-of-the-house pricing was up over 20%. Overall, across all our shows, price increases delivered over $350 million to artists who effectively captured more of the value from the shows.
Once at the show, average per fan spend grew as well. At our amphitheaters, spend grew by $3 to $27 per head as we added more high-end products, improved the quality of our food and beverage and increased the revenue we earn from parking and service fees. 
The strength of our business is continuing in 2019 with ticket sales for shows this year up double digits through mid-February, along with similar increases in confirmed amphitheater, arena and stadium show count. With this growth and our plans to further monetize our fan relationship, I expect this to translate to continued strong growth in concerts AOI in 2019.
In our high-end sponsorship business, we grew both revenue and AOI by 13% in 2018. Our top strategic sponsors have been a key driver of this growth with 75 sponsors collectively spending over $350 million to reach our fans, up 11% over 2017. Sponsorship at our festivals grew 13%. This growth was driven by new deals with brands including Heineken, Barclays, State Farm and Frito-Lay.
All of this reinforces the power of our platform of 93 million fans and the continued shift by brands to invest in reaching fans during live experiences. Research from our Power of Live white paper indicates that over 90% of fans believe that brands can enhance the live experience and over 60% of fans believe they are more likely to connect with brands at concerts. This reinforces that our shows offer brands a truly unique opportunity to connect with fans.
With over 70% of budgeted sponsorship net revenue for the year already committed, pacing double digits ahead of last year this time, we are confident we will again deliver double-digit AOI growth for 2019.
Ticketmaster continued growing its leadership position in ticketing in 2018 with fee-bearing GTV up 14% and total platform GTV up $33 billion. This drove our 14% increase in ticketing revenue and AOI of 7%.
Our top priority at Ticketmaster in 2018 was deploying our TM Presence product, which we see as our key for effectively unlocking the value of our customer relationship across ticketing, concerts and sponsorship business. By the end of 2018, we deployed Presence in over 200 venues, operating 20,000 events for 40 million fans, approximately half of whom used our digital tickets.
We see our deployment in 2019 further accelerating and we are expecting to have Presence in over 500 venues by the end of the year with 125 million fans attending events at these buildings. At that point, we will have covered 75% of major sports and Live Nation buildings, making Ticketmaster by far the global leader in digital tickets.
At the same time, we continued to build our marketplace with the fourth quarter being our highest fee-bearing GTV quarter ever, selling over 60 million fee-bearing tickets in a quarter for the first time and delivering over $5 billion in fee-bearing GTV. Overall in 2018, Ticketmaster managed over 400,000 events, delivering almost 500 million tickets in 28 countries. We continue adding new clients to our marketplace who collectively added over 10 million new tickets in 2018.
I believe we have a tremendous opportunity for growth on a global basis, particularly in the 13 markets where we promote concerts but don't yet have a substantial ticketing operation. In 2018, we furthered our international expansion, establishing ticketing operations in Italy, ramping up our German operations and laying the groundwork for our expansion in Latin America. Ticketmaster continues to exceed expectations, both operationally and in its leadership position in digital ticketing, along with its ability to extend that leadership position globally and deliver continued profitable growth.
In summary, 2018 was another strong year for Live Nation, building our global concert business and thereby driving growth in our high-margin venue, sponsorship and ticketing businesses.
We continue to see the tremendous power of live events with strong consumer demand and a robust supply of new and established artists hitting the road from clubs to stadium. Live is truly a unique entertainment form. It cannot be duplicated and creates lifetime memories that fans are craving more than ever in this experience economy.
We believe the live business will continue to have strong growth for years to come as fans globally drive demand, artists are touring more and more and on-site spending, sponsorship and ticketing all benefit from the concerts flywheel.
In 2019, I expect us to further grow our global concert position while enhancing on-site hospitality and capturing more pricing opportunities. In sponsorship, we will continue to drive double-digit growth as more brands look for that direct connection with music fans. And as ticketing continues to transform to a truly digital ecosystem, it will benefit from continued growth in concert ticket sales and further expansion of our global footprint.
We believe that the combination of macro trends and our demonstrated ability to execute are strong indicators of our ability to continue to grow the business for many years to come.
And with that, I will turn the call over to Joe to take you through additional details."

As Michael said, in 2018, we grew attendance by 8% to a record 93 million fans, promoting 19 of the top 25 global tours. As we have talked about over the past year, 2018 was a very stron",980,"Thanks, Michael.
Looking at our business segments, first, concerts. As Michael said, in 2018, we grew attendance by 8% to a record 93 million fans, promoting 19 of the top 25 global tours. As we have talked about over the past year, 2018 was a very strong year for arenas, amphitheaters and theaters and clubs, with all 3 building types up double digits in attendance.
Globally, we also continued growing our festival portfolio, adding 7 festivals to give us a global portfolio of 104 festivals in 14 countries. As a result, we increased festival attendance by 6% to nearly 9 million fans and now have 29 festivals that each attracted over 100,000 fans last year. 
Looking geographically, North America was the primary driver of our fan growth while internationally, the cyclically lower stadium attendance offset much of their strong arena and festival attendance growth.
Looking specifically at the fourth quarter, while attendance and show count were up, our AOI was lower, heavily driven by a $15 million year-on-year increase in advertising expense related to 2019 shows. This increased advertising spend is representative of a continued shift earlier on sales and is also one of the reasons we are optimistic about 2019 concert activity.
For 2019, as Michael said, we are already seeing strong growth in ticket sales for shows this year. Sales are particularly strong in our international markets, which we expect to continue through the year, with North America also expected to keep growing. We see growth across all building types in 2019 with arenas globally, amphitheaters in North America and stadiums internationally all contributing to the increase.
Along with our fan growth, we will also be continuing our focus on pricing optimization and on-site monetization in 2019. On pricing, with over 2,000 arena and amphitheater shows already on sale, we are seeing high-single-digit increases in front-of-house pricing, which I expect to continue or expand throughout the year. And while our on-site monetization won't start until the summer season, it remains a priority to continue our growth for the past few years with teams already working on specific amphitheater-by-amphitheater plans.
Turning to our sponsorship and advertising business. In 2018, we again delivered double-digit AOI growth, up 13% this year. This performance was reflective of strength across the board. North America and international sponsorship businesses were both up double digits and both sponsorship and online advertising also grew double digits.
For the fourth quarter, revenue was up 20% and AOI was up 16%. We saw particularly strong growth at our festivals in the fourth quarter, including Austin City Limits and Voodoo, while also launching a number of major programs for sponsors, including Google, Sony, Pepsi, Uber and T-Mobile.
As we get into 2019, we expect to again deliver double-digit AOI growth for the year. As Michael indicated, we are pacing double digits ahead of this time last year and based on our current discussions with brands, we are expecting strong growth in our base of strategic sponsors as well as our on-site sponsorship, particularly at festivals.
Finally, Ticketmaster. Global GTV was up 7% for the quarter and up 8% for the full year, driven by fee-bearing GTV, which was up 12% and 14% for the quarter and year, respectively. Primary GTV, which accounts for almost 90% of overall fee-bearing GTV, was up 12% for the quarter and 14% for the full year. Secondary GTV was up 6% for the quarter and up 16% for the full year as we continue to take share in the North America secondary market.
Throughout 2018, we continued to improve our mobile and app experiences, which is critical for our digital strategy. We grew our app installed base by 40% year-over-year, giving us much greater reach for direct fan relationships. And sales of tickets via mobile devices continued to grow rapidly, up 35% for the year and accounting for over 40% of overall ticket sales.
For the fourth quarter, Ticketmaster AOI was down slightly, impacted by onetime costs associated with the third-party vendor data breach that affected our marketplace in certain international markets. Much of these costs were in the fourth quarter and for the full year, these onetime costs totaled approximately $15 million.
To preempt the question on margins, obviously these data breach costs had a material impact on our 2018 margins. The majority of the remaining margin impact comes from 2 other factors.
First, as Michael indicated, we are continuing to invest in expanding Ticketmaster's global footprint and we expect that any start-up market will have below average margins for a period of time as it scales. These markets are generally rapidly AOI-positive given our ability to get an allocation of Live Nation concert tickets, but initially at below average margins.
Secondly, as we continue to get more effective at data-driven marketing, we are spending more to grow our GTV. To be clear, the GTVs from free visits continued growing in 2018. The paid marketing-driven GTV grew even faster. As a result, margins were impacted despite the attractive profitability of the incremental GTV generated via this paid marketing.
So in summary, 2018 was a great year across all of our businesses and in 2019, we expect to continue growing all of the businesses. From a stadium standpoint, we see our growth continuing to be delivered primarily in the second and third quarters as most of our concert investments will be playing out in those quarters. The first and fourth quarters each account for less than 10% of our annual AOI, meaning that they will also have to absorb increased fixed costs associated with our overall growth against seasonally lower activity.
On FX, we ended up with a negligible impact on AOI and revenue for 2018. And at this point, we see very little impact on 2019.
I will now turn the call over to Kathy to go through more on our financial results."

Revenue increased by 12% to $2.6 billion. AOI was $69 million compared to $87 million in 2017 after adding back a $110 million legal accrual recorded",659,"Thanks, Joe, and good afternoon, everyone.
I will start with our key highlights for the fourth quarter. Revenue increased by 12% to $2.6 billion. AOI was $69 million compared to $87 million in 2017 after adding back a $110 million legal accrual recorded in 2017. As of December 31, our deferred revenue related to future shows was $1.1 billion, up 35% from the $816 million last year.
Concerts, with a 12% increase, contributed the majority of the revenue growth in the quarter from increased arena and theater and club activity. Sponsorship and advertising revenue was up 20% from higher sponsor and online activity in North America. And ticketing revenue increased 15% from higher primary ticket volume.
Fourth quarter AOI was lower in concerts due to the $15 million increase in advertising expense for 2019 shows that Joe mentioned. Sponsorships and advertising delivered 16% growth in AOI with higher online advertising in North America and growth in sponsorships internationally.
Our operating loss was $90 million in the quarter, essentially flat to last year after adjusting for the legal accrual. The net loss for the quarter was $148 million compared to a loss of $137 million in the prior year before the legal accrual and a $56 million tax benefit related to tax reform changes in 2017.
For the 2018 full year, revenue was $10.8 billion, an 11% increase over 2017. AOI was $829 million for the full year, up 13% over our 2017 AOI of $735 million before the legal accrual. Free cash flow adjusted was $481 million, up 8% over last year without the legal accrual or 58% of AOI for the year.
All our segments delivered double-digit growth in revenue for 2018. The majority of the increase was driven by concerts, up 11% from increased show count and attendance across arenas, amphitheaters and theaters and clubs. Sponsorship and advertising revenue was up 13% from growth in online advertising and sponsorship programs globally. And ticketing revenue increased by 14% from higher primary ticket volume, driven by concerts, along with increased secondary sales.
Concerts AOI was up 22% as a result of more events and fans across arenas, amphitheaters, festivals and theaters and club and higher ancillary revenue per band in our amphitheaters. Sponsorship and advertising AOI grew by 13%, in line with this higher revenue. And ticketing AOI grew 7% without the 2017 legal accrual, delivering growth in both primary and secondary ticket sales, although impacted by the cyber investigation costs incurred this year that Joe noted.
Operating income was $273 million, up 35% over last year before the legal accrual, driven by our strong AOI growth. Our net income for the year was $60 million as compared to $48 million in 2017 before the legal accrual and the 2017 tax reform-related tax benefit.
We recorded $78 million of accretion at redeemable noncontrolling interests in 2018. We currently expect this accretion to be approximately $45 million for 2019, which will be consistently spread across the quarters. We expect that amortization of non-recoupable ticketing contract advances in 2019 will be in line with the last few years of expense.
Turning to our balance sheet. As of December 31, we had total cash of $2.4 billion, including $859 million in ticketing client cash and $903 million in net concert event-related cash, leaving a free cash balance of $610 million. Net cash provided by operating activities was $942 million as compared to $624 million last year, with the increase driven by our higher event-related deferred revenue.
For the full year, total capital expenditures were $251 million, roughly half of which was spent on revenue-generating items. For 2019, we currently expect our total capital expenditures to be approximately $300 million with a similar split to this year for revenue-generating expenditures.
Our total net debt as of December 2018 was $2.8 billion with a weighted average cost of 4.2%.

And while we see some level of convergence over time, don't that -- don't expect that to shift quickly. Each of the markets, in terms of its maturation, all has -- hard to give you a one-size-fits-all, but as I said, they do become AOI-positive pretty quickly with our concert allocations and then we grow it from there."

International, we see great growth in that some of those markets may only have $2 service fees today, but they all have great pricing potential for the next 10 years.
So a lot of these markets today are a lower service fee because they literally are still distributing out of the local bank. They may have a retail strategy converting to online, but we also see international has a great opportunity, that is where we actually have great pricing power. And every year, we're seeing the service fee going up to reflect kind of closer to the U.S. model over time. So great profit pool to grow internationally outside of U.S., Canada."

And then we turn our engine of 80 tours that we're buying onto that area.

So I think what we did say is the secondary industry, over the past several years, has been growing at a pretty good clip, frankly, faster than we have been growing our ticket prices. And so we think there continues to be a -- over $1 billion of price arbitrage that exists in our concert tickets alone.
If you look at the marketplace, we obviously have a 2-headed strategy. One strategy is to create a compelling product on Ticketmaster that offers both the primary and secondary tickets. The other strategy, which is at least as important to us, is to continue to get more effective at that initial primary ticket pricing and transfer as much of the economics as possible into the artist's pocket, which continues to attract them to tour more and be out there generating more shows, more fans for our overall flywheel strategy.
So going forward, I think it would be our expectation that we would see less growth certainly in the secondary market as we continue to focus on that primary pricing. I think that the competitors in this space are pretty well known. Obviously, StubHub, they're better in the United States. But for us, it's really a matter of how do we continue to best serve the artists and the fans with the right products."

We still believe that the U.S., Canadian market, let's put those 2 together, still have growth ahead. We are still underserviced in markets as we've talked before about. We still have opportunities to build more of our businesses in a lot of the A -- in the A markets. We have low market share in a lot of big markets. So U.S. still has great potential. We still think sponsorship is a double-digit growth business in America and we think -- and the concert business continues to be on-site, hospitality, real estate expansion, incredible, frothy opportunity in the U.S. So don't want -- it's not an either/either where we continue to execute with great confidence, but it's a -- we're going to continue to invest in America.
But we have -- absolutely have always said that it's a global business. And as we build out the pipe in 40 countries, when we look at all the other cities around the world where we have no market share or low, as we put in the best promoter and a ticketing platform and our global concerts, which then follow usually sponsorship and ticketing, where we have that model down in major cities and when we got those 3 to 4 legs of that stool in the land and Cape Town and Rio, we know we can build a $10 million to $20 million business. So there are a whole bunch of opportunities international where we don't have the 4 legs. We might have 1 leg, that's why you see us buy a festival in a major market and a major promoter in a different market. As we fill out the legs, great opportunity organically will happen through our scale.
So we'll be doing that for the next 5 to 10 years. We'll be talking about 30% market share and lots of opportunity to build international business platform. It's behind America in a lot of the ways. I just mentioned on ticketing. So we see it probably has a higher growth potential from unsophisticated in both sponsorship, ticketing and venue development. So all 3 of those, you will see opportunities over the years. Call that the apparatus we want to get built. The consistent demand that we know is Rihanna can sell out anywhere and that's the part that makes our model unique.
So continue growing international. That will be a great story for us for many years to come. We're diverse enough now that for a certain market that's having a good or bad day, we'll be okay. We have enough risk aversion. And the U.S. will continue to have a deeper bench to grow on also."

No, it's a valid point. We absolutely see a huge opportunity. If you look at our core business model, I'm sure people are sick of the phrase -- and I do appreciate the book, you and Rich, of let me patent flywheel long before any other businesses. You just nailed that one. So yes, we have a big flywheel of concerts and we're going to wake up every year finding new and adjacent businesses that we can monetize because of the flywheel. No one in the world has 30,000 shows and almost 100 million people walking in the door. So that's why we believe in the U.S. and onward we'll have -- it's endless growth opportunities.
One of them happens to be the venue, the real estate. For many years, we were happy putting our content in someone else's venue and getting a ticket fee and selling tickets at the door. A lot of times, as we've said in our different analyst meetings, when the content ends up in my amphitheater or my festival or my theater and club, we even make more money because we're now counting more revenue streams. And we look now at the real estate market in America, the advantage we have is there's way more real estate than there are artists.
And if you are a developer right now with a shopping mall to a development site, you no longer are probably asking the movie theater to be your tenant. You're probably coming to Live Nation saying, ""I'd love you to build a 2,000-seat, a 4,000-seat, a 6,000-seat. I'd love you to be part of our development because that's the vibrant part of the experience we're creating."" So what we're doing now is when those meetings happen is say we're not happy just to ticket for your building. We want have equity value in that position and operate and run it to maximize all of the value that can be created from our $6 billion a year. So instead of maybe paying somebody millions a year to lease their building to run it while we fill it, there are times wherein we work at those strategies in real estate where our content is the entire reason the building is being financed or the building is growing in value. We should capture not just the content, not just the food and beverage, but the equity value of the real estate holdings over time, too.
So we're seeing more and more opportunities where our flywheel is putting us in a position to have some equity ownership and control in some great assets that are completely down the middle -- completely down the line of a concert live venue and you will see us explore more of being more -- of leveraging our content."

It's another -- I just mentioned it earlier. We have scale. We have artist relationships, great stories to be told. So we started a new division organically. I think we've done 5 now. We've probably got 10 to 15 projects in the pipeline of artists telling great live stories or movies or documentaries or festival stories or et cetera. So we really think that division is obviously a much higher margin business than the concert space, but it's a real capital-intense business, but ultimately it's a great marketing platform for our artists, our shows and our Artist Nation division. So I really think we're not really worried in 2019. It will be a small overall contribution to our agenda and AOI.
Over time, we think it's a -- with Artist Nation, we think it's a nice high margin ancillary business to our core mission that will be a positive impact. Ultimately, on its own, we'll make AOI to be positive. Much like we learned with Artist Nation and others, they also end up feeding mother ship. So Artist Nation's ""A Star is Born"" is probably the single greatest marketing exercise we could have did for our sponsorship division. If you are in that division, those kind of things just really send the flare very high and get you in the CMO meeting and other conversations that you haven't been before. So we'll look at the pieces, always in the end of ancillary business. It gets us one more tour, one more sponsor or one more ticketing contract and makes high margin AOI. It's a triple win."

There aren't -- there's not a lot of growth in terms of the number of teams or the number of games played in a season for the major sports. So it's really been the concerts business that has driven the great growth over the past several years of ticketing. Again, we've given the statistics several times, around 80% of fee-bearing GTV growth coming from the concerts business. So it's critical on the sports side. As they've built incredible arenas, their stadiums, they're looking to continue to fill those buildings every night just -- not just when the games are played. Those provide platforms for the tours, the artists that we work with to continue to put on more shows. And it's through putting on those more shows that we've been able to grow the business. So it's not the sports directly. It's the sports indirectly that's been the unlocker of a lot of Ticketmaster's growth."

And we received a call the minute that was a public announcement to -- from them to reassure us that us continuing to fill their buildings and ticketing their business is a huge strategic imperative of theirs. And we've always looked at AEG facilities or SMG as partners. They all need us to put more shows and fill those venues that they're managing and they have all probably experimented elsewhere and ended up realizing Ticketmaster also happens to sell them the most tickets. They're managing those buildings for someone else generally. That someone else doesn't care about competition. They care about results. So the reason we're the largest supplier to AEG's facility business or SMG or others is because it's good business for both of us. So they've got a business to run. We'll continue to be a good supplier to them. And in return, I would assume a ticketing partner forward.
So no effect from us. We continue to think that we'll grow our business equally well. We've been growing it in both of those companies over the last 5 years."

I will make my comments today excluding the 2017 impacts of the $110 million legal settlement to keep our year-over-year numbers comparable.Live Nation delivered its e",1141,"Good afternoon, and welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2018 conference call. I will make my comments today excluding the 2017 impacts of the $110 million legal settlement to keep our year-over-year numbers comparable.
Live Nation delivered its eighth consecutive year of record results. Revenue was up 11%, AOI up 13% and free cash flow up 8%. All our divisions, concerts, sponsorship and ticketing, delivered their strongest AOI results in the history of the company.
Starting with our concert unit. Fans, more than ever, find the live experience, from club shows to arenas to festivals, a top entertainment choice and the best way to celebrate their favorite artists and show the experience with fans. In the U.S. alone, over the past 10 years, consumer spend on live experiences has grown by $5 billion per year. We believe this ongoing trend will structurally continue to drive increased demand for concerts globally.
As a result of the strong demand growth in 2018, we delivered double-digit attendance growth across our arenas, amphitheaters and theaters and clubs, continuing to grow our global market share, adding nearly 7 million fans globally for a total of 93 million fans, driving concert revenue up 11% and AOI up 22%.
Across all of the artists we work with, we invested over $6 billion to promote 35,000 shows in 40 countries, with Live Nation by far the largest financial supporter of artists in music.
In addition to growing our show count and attendance, our pricing and on-site initiatives also continued to grow our AOI. Average ticket prices for our amphitheater and arena shows increased by 13% in 2018 as front-of-the-house pricing was up over 20%. Overall, across all our shows, price increases delivered over $350 million to artists who effectively captured more of the value from the shows.
Once at the show, average per fan spend grew as well. At our amphitheaters, spend grew by $3 to $27 per head as we added more high-end products, improved the quality of our food and beverage and increased the revenue we earn from parking and service fees. 
The strength of our business is continuing in 2019 with ticket sales for shows this year up double digits through mid-February, along with similar increases in confirmed amphitheater, arena and stadium show count. With this growth and our plans to further monetize our fan relationship, I expect this to translate to continued strong growth in concerts AOI in 2019.
In our high-end sponsorship business, we grew both revenue and AOI by 13% in 2018. Our top strategic sponsors have been a key driver of this growth with 75 sponsors collectively spending over $350 million to reach our fans, up 11% over 2017. Sponsorship at our festivals grew 13%. This growth was driven by new deals with brands including Heineken, Barclays, State Farm and Frito-Lay.
All of this reinforces the power of our platform of 93 million fans and the continued shift by brands to invest in reaching fans during live experiences. Research from our Power of Live white paper indicates that over 90% of fans believe that brands can enhance the live experience and over 60% of fans believe they are more likely to connect with brands at concerts. This reinforces that our shows offer brands a truly unique opportunity to connect with fans.
With over 70% of budgeted sponsorship net revenue for the year already committed, pacing double digits ahead of last year this time, we are confident we will again deliver double-digit AOI growth for 2019.
Ticketmaster continued growing its leadership position in ticketing in 2018 with fee-bearing GTV up 14% and total platform GTV up $33 billion. This drove our 14% increase in ticketing revenue and AOI of 7%.
Our top priority at Ticketmaster in 2018 was deploying our TM Presence product, which we see as our key for effectively unlocking the value of our customer relationship across ticketing, concerts and sponsorship business. By the end of 2018, we deployed Presence in over 200 venues, operating 20,000 events for 40 million fans, approximately half of whom used our digital tickets.
We see our deployment in 2019 further accelerating and we are expecting to have Presence in over 500 venues by the end of the year with 125 million fans attending events at these buildings. At that point, we will have covered 75% of major sports and Live Nation buildings, making Ticketmaster by far the global leader in digital tickets.
At the same time, we continued to build our marketplace with the fourth quarter being our highest fee-bearing GTV quarter ever, selling over 60 million fee-bearing tickets in a quarter for the first time and delivering over $5 billion in fee-bearing GTV. Overall in 2018, Ticketmaster managed over 400,000 events, delivering almost 500 million tickets in 28 countries. We continue adding new clients to our marketplace who collectively added over 10 million new tickets in 2018.
I believe we have a tremendous opportunity for growth on a global basis, particularly in the 13 markets where we promote concerts but don't yet have a substantial ticketing operation. In 2018, we furthered our international expansion, establishing ticketing operations in Italy, ramping up our German operations and laying the groundwork for our expansion in Latin America. Ticketmaster continues to exceed expectations, both operationally and in its leadership position in digital ticketing, along with its ability to extend that leadership position globally and deliver continued profitable growth.
In summary, 2018 was another strong year for Live Nation, building our global concert business and thereby driving growth in our high-margin venue, sponsorship and ticketing businesses.
We continue to see the tremendous power of live events with strong consumer demand and a robust supply of new and established artists hitting the road from clubs to stadium. Live is truly a unique entertainment form. It cannot be duplicated and creates lifetime memories that fans are craving more than ever in this experience economy.
We believe the live business will continue to have strong growth for years to come as fans globally drive demand, artists are touring more and more and on-site spending, sponsorship and ticketing all benefit from the concerts flywheel.
In 2019, I expect us to further grow our global concert position while enhancing on-site hospitality and capturing more pricing opportunities. In sponsorship, we will continue to drive double-digit growth as more brands look for that direct connection with music fans. And as ticketing continues to transform to a truly digital ecosystem, it will benefit from continued growth in concert ticket sales and further expansion of our global footprint.
We believe that the combination of macro trends and our demonstrated ability to execute are strong indicators of our ability to continue to grow the business for many years to come.
And with that, I will turn the call over to Joe to take you through additional details."

As Michael said, in 2018, we grew attendance by 8% to a record 93 million fans, promoting 19 of the top 25 global tours. As we have talked about over the past year, 2018 was a very stron",980,"Thanks, Michael.
Looking at our business segments, first, concerts. As Michael said, in 2018, we grew attendance by 8% to a record 93 million fans, promoting 19 of the top 25 global tours. As we have talked about over the past year, 2018 was a very strong year for arenas, amphitheaters and theaters and clubs, with all 3 building types up double digits in attendance.
Globally, we also continued growing our festival portfolio, adding 7 festivals to give us a global portfolio of 104 festivals in 14 countries. As a result, we increased festival attendance by 6% to nearly 9 million fans and now have 29 festivals that each attracted over 100,000 fans last year. 
Looking geographically, North America was the primary driver of our fan growth while internationally, the cyclically lower stadium attendance offset much of their strong arena and festival attendance growth.
Looking specifically at the fourth quarter, while attendance and show count were up, our AOI was lower, heavily driven by a $15 million year-on-year increase in advertising expense related to 2019 shows. This increased advertising spend is representative of a continued shift to earlier-on sales and is also one of the reasons we are optimistic about 2019 concert activity.
For 2019, as Michael said, we are already seeing strong growth in ticket sales for shows this year. Sales are particularly strong in our international markets, which we expect to continue through the year, with North America also expected to keep growing. We see growth across all building types in 2019 with arenas globally, amphitheaters in North America and stadiums internationally all contributing to the increase.
Along with our fan growth, we will also be continuing our focus on pricing optimization and on-site monetization in 2019. On pricing, with over 2,000 arena and amphitheater shows already on sale, we are seeing high-single-digit increases in front-of-house pricing, which I expect to continue or expand throughout the year. And while our on-site monetization won't start until the summer season, it remains a priority to continue our growth for the past few years with teams already working on specific amphitheater-by-amphitheater plans.
Turning to our sponsorship and advertising business. In 2018, we again delivered double-digit AOI growth, up 13% this year. This performance was reflective of strength across the board. North America and international sponsorship businesses were both up double digits and both sponsorship and online advertising also grew double digits.
For the fourth quarter, revenue was up 20% and AOI was up 16%. We saw particularly strong growth at our festivals in the fourth quarter, including Austin City Limits and Voodoo, while also launching a number of major programs for sponsors, including Google, Sony, Pepsi, Uber and T-Mobile.
As we get into 2019, we expect to again deliver double-digit AOI growth for the year. As Michael indicated, we are pacing double digits ahead of this time last year and based on our current discussions with brands, we are expecting strong growth in our base of strategic sponsors as well as our on-site sponsorship, particularly at festivals.
Finally, Ticketmaster. Global GTV was up 7% for the quarter and up 8% for the full year, driven by fee-bearing GTV, which was up 12% and 14% for the quarter and year, respectively. Primary GTV, which accounts for almost 90% of overall fee-bearing GTV, was up 12% for the quarter and 14% for the full year. Secondary GTV was up 6% for the quarter and up 16% for the full year as we continue to take share in the North America secondary market.
Throughout 2018, we continued to improve our mobile and app experiences, which is critical for our digital strategy. We grew our app installed base by 40% year-over-year, giving us much greater reach for direct fan relationships. And sales of tickets via mobile devices continued to grow rapidly, up 35% for the year and accounting for over 40% of overall ticket sales.
For the fourth quarter, Ticketmaster AOI was down slightly, impacted by onetime costs associated with the third-party vendor data breach that affected our marketplace in certain international markets. Much of these costs were in the fourth quarter and for the full year, these onetime costs totaled approximately $15 million.
To preempt the question on margins, obviously these data breach costs had a material impact on our 2018 margins. The majority of the remaining margin impact comes from 2 other factors.
First, as Michael indicated, we are continuing to invest in expanding Ticketmaster's global footprint and we expect that any start-up market will have below average margins for a period of time as it scales. These markets are generally rapidly AOI-positive given our ability to get an allocation of Live Nation concert tickets, but initially at below average margins.
Secondly, as we continue to get more effective at data-driven marketing, we are spending more to grow our GTV. To be clear, the GTVs from free visits continued growing in 2018. The paid marketing-driven GTV grew even faster. As a result, margins were impacted despite the attractive profitability of the incremental GTV generated via this paid marketing.
So in summary, 2018 was a great year across all of our businesses and in 2019, we expect to continue growing all of the businesses. From a phasing standpoint, we see our growth continuing to be delivered primarily in the second and third quarters as most of our concert investments will be playing out in those quarters. The first and fourth quarters each account for less than 10% of our annual AOI, meaning that they will also have to absorb increased fixed costs associated with our overall growth against seasonally lower activity.
On FX, we ended up with a negligible impact on AOI and revenue for 2018. And at this point, we see very little impact on 2019.
I will now turn the call over to Kathy to go through more on our financial results."

I will start with our key highlights for the fourth quarter. Revenue increased by 12% to $2.6 billion. AOI was $69 million compared to $87 million in 2017 after adding back a $110 million legal accrual recorded in 2017. As of December 31, our deferred revenue related to future shows was $1.1 billion, up 35% from the $816 million last year.
Concerts, with a 12% increase, contributed the majority of the revenue growth in the quarter from increased arena and theater and club activity. Sponsorship and advertising revenue was up 20% from higher sponsor and online activity in North America. And ticketing revenue increased 15% from higher primary ticket volume.
Fourth quarter AOI was lower in concerts due to the $15 million increase in advertising expense for 2019 shows that Joe mentioned. Sponsorships and advertising delivered 16% growth in AOI with higher online advertising in North America and growth in sponsorships internationally.
Our operating loss was $90 million in the quarter, essentially flat to last year after adjusting for the legal accrual. The net loss for the quarter was $148 million compared to a loss of $137 million in the prior year before the legal accrual and a $56 million tax benefit related to tax reform changes in 2017.
For the 2018 full year, revenue was $10.8 billion, an 11% increase over 2017. AOI was $829 million for the full year, up 13% over our 2017 AOI of $735 million before the legal accrual. Free cash flow adjusted was $481 million, up 8% over last year without the legal accrual or 58% of AOI for the year.
All our segments delivered double-digit growth in revenue for 2018. The majority of the increase was driven by concerts, up 11% from increased show count and attendance across arenas, amphitheaters and theaters and clubs. Sponsorship and advertising revenue was up 13% from growth in online advertising and sponsorship programs globally. And ticketing revenue increased by 14% from higher primary ticket volume, driven by concerts, along with increased secondary sales.
Concerts AOI was up 22% as a result of more events and fans across arenas, amphitheaters, festivals and theaters and club and higher ancillary revenue per band in our amphitheaters. Sponsorship and advertising AOI grew by 13%, in line with this higher revenue. And ticketing AOI grew 7% without the 2017 legal accrual, delivering growth in both primary and secondary ticket sales, although impacted by the cyber investigation costs incurred this year that Joe noted.
Operating income was $273 million, up 35% over last year before the legal accrual, driven by our strong AOI growth. Our net income for the year was $60 million as compared to $48 million in 2017 before the legal accrual and the 2017 tax reform-related tax benefit.
We recorded $78 million of accretion at redeemable noncontrolling interests in 2018. We currently expect this accretion to be approximately $45 million for 2019, which will be consistently spread across the quarters. We expect that amortization of non-recoupable ticketing contract advances in 2019 will be in line with the last few years of expense.
Turning to our balance sheet. As of December 31, we had total cash of $2.4 billion, including $859 million in ticketing client cash and $903 million in net concert event-related cash, leaving a free cash balance of $610 million. Net cash provided by operating activities was $942 million as compared to $624 million last year, with the increase driven by our higher event-related deferred revenue.
For the full year, total capital expenditures were $251 million, roughly half of which was spent on revenue-generating items. For 2019, we currently expect our total capital expenditures to be approximately $300 million with a similar split to this year for revenue-generating expenditures.
Our total net debt as of December 2018 was $2.8 billion with a weighted average cost of 4.2%.

International, we see great growth in that some of those markets may only have $2 service fees today, but they all have great pricing potential for the next 10 years. So a lot of these markets today are a lower service fee because they literally are still distributing out of the local bank. They may have a retail strategy converting to online, but we also see international has a great opportunity. That is where we actually have great pricing power. And every year, we're seeing the service fee going up to reflect kind of closer to the U.S. model over time. So great profit pool to grow internationally outside of U.S., Canada."

So we gave some pretty specific numbers at our last Liberty presentation, so I won't try to remember all of those numbers. I think what we did say is the secondary industry, over the past several years, has been growing at a pretty good clip, frankly, faster than we have been growing our ticket prices. And so we think there continues to be a -- over $1 billion of price arbitrage that exists in our concert tickets alone. If you look at the marketplace, we obviously have a 2-headed strategy. One strategy is to create a compelling product on Ticketmaster that offers both the primary and secondary tickets. The other strategy, which is at least as important to us, is to continue to get more effective at that initial primary ticket pricing and transfer as much of the economics as possible into the artist's pocket, which continues to attract them to tour more and be out there generating more shows, more fans for our overall flywheel strategy. So going forward, I think it would be our expectation that we would see less growth certainly in the secondary market as we continue to focus on that primary pricing. I think that the competitors in this space are pretty well known. Obviously, StubHub, Vivid in the United States. But for us, it's really a matter of how do we continue to best serve the artists and the fans with the right products."

We still believe that the U.S., Canadian market, let's put those 2 together, still have growth ahead. We are still underserviced in markets as we've talked before about. We still have opportunities to build more of our businesses in a lot of the A -- in the A markets. We have low market share in a lot of big markets. So U.S. still has great potential. We still think sponsorship is a double-digit growth business in America and we think -- and the concert business continues to be on-site, hospitality, real estate expansion, incredible, frothy opportunity in the U.S. So don't want -- it's not an either/either (sic) [either/or] where we continue to execute with great confidence, but it's a -- we're going to continue to invest in America. But we have -- absolutely have always said that it's a global business. And as we build out the pipe in 40 countries, when we look at all the other cities around the world where we have no market share or low, as we put in the best promoter and a ticketing platform and our global concerts, which then follow usually sponsorship and ticketing, where we have that model down in major cities and when we got those 3 to 4 legs of that stool in Milan and Cape Town and Rio, we know we can build a $10 million to $20 million business. So we think there are a whole bunch of opportunities international where we don't have the 4 legs. We might have 1 leg, that's why you see us buy a festival in a major market and a major promoter in a different market. As we fill out the legs, great opportunity organically will happen through our scale.
So we'll be doing that for the next 5 to 10 years. We'll be talking about 30% market share and lots of opportunity to build international business platform. It's behind America, in a lot of the ways I just mentioned, on ticketing. So we see it probably has a higher growth potential from unsophisticated in both sponsorship, ticketing and venue development. So all 3 of those, you will see opportunities over the years. Call that the apparatus we want to get built. The consistent demand that we know is Rihanna can sell out anywhere and that's the part that makes our model unique. So continue to grow international. That will be a great story for us for many years to come. We're diverse enough now that if a certain market is having a good or bad day, we'll be okay. We have enough risk aversion. And the U.S. will continue to have a deeper bench to grow on also."

If you look at our core business model, I'm sure people are sick of the phrase -- and I do appreciate that both you and Rich let me patent 'flywheel' long before any other businesses [ distilled ] that one. So yes, we have a big flywheel of concerts and we're going to wake up every year finding new and adjacent businesses that we can monetize because of the flywheel. And no one in the world has 30,000 shows and almost 100 million people walking in the door. So that's why we believe in the U.S. and onward will have -- it's endless growth opportunities. One of them happens to be the venue, the real estate. For many years, we were happy putting our content in someone else's venue and getting a ticket fee and selling tickets at the door. A lot of times, as we've said in our different analyst meetings, when the content ends up in my amphitheater or my festival or my theater and club, we even make more money because we're now counting more revenue streams. And we look now at the real estate market in America, the advantage we have is there's way more real estate than there are artists. And if you are a developer right now with a shopping mall to a development site, you no longer are probably asking the movie theater to be your tenant, you're probably coming to Live Nation saying, ""I'd love you to build a 2,000-seat, a 4,000-seat, a 6,000-seat. I'd love you to be part of our development because that's the vibrant part of the experience we're creating."" So what we're doing now is when those meetings happen is say we're not happy just to ticket and bill your building. We want have equity value in that position and operate and run it to maximize all of the value that can be created from our $6 billion a year. So instead of maybe paying somebody millions a year to lease their building to run it while we fill it, there are times we're going to look at hero strategies in real estate where our content is the entire reason the building is being financed or the building is growing in value. We should capture not just the content, not just the food and beverage, but the equity value of the real estate holdings over time, too. So we're seeing more and more opportunities where our flywheel is putting us in a position to have some equity ownership and control in some great assets that are completely down the middle -- completely down the line of a concert live venue and you will see us explore more of being more -- of leveraging our content."

It's another -- I just mentioned it earlier. We have scale. We have artist relationships, great stories to be told. So we started a new division organically. I think we've done 5 now. We've probably got 10 to 15 projects in the pipeline of artists telling great live stories or movies or documentaries or festival stories or -- et cetera. So we really think that division is obviously a much higher margin business than the concert space, it's a [ low ] capital-intense business, but ultimately it's a great marketing platform for our artists, our shows and our Artist Nation division. So I really think we're not really worried in 2019. It will be a small overall contribution to our agenda and AOI. Over time, we think it's a -- like Artist Nation, we think it's a nice high margin ancillary business to our core mission that will be a positive impact. Whether ultimately, on its own, will make AOI to be positive. Much like we learned with Artist Nation and others, they also end up feeding mother ship. So Artist Nation's ""A Star is Born"" is probably the single greatest marketing exercise we could have did for our sponsorship division. If you are in that division, those kind of things just really send the flare very high and get you in the CMO meeting and other conversations that you hadn't been before. So we look at the pieces, always in the end, if ancillary business gets us one more tour, one more sponsor or one more ticketing contract and makes high margin AOI, it's a triple win."

There aren't -- there's not a lot of growth in terms of the number of teams or the number of games played in a season for the major sports. So it's really been the concerts business that has driven the great growth over the past several years of ticketing. Again, we've given the statistics several times, around 80% of fee-bearing GTV growth coming from the concert business. So it's critical on the sports side. As they've built incredible arenas, their stadiums, they're looking to continue to fill those buildings every night just -- not just when the games are played. Those provide platforms for the tours, the artists that we work with to continue to put on more shows. And it's through putting on those more shows that we've been able to grow the business. So it's not the sports directly. It's the sports indirectly that's been the unlock of a lot of Ticketmaster's growth."

I will make my comments today excluding the 2017 impacts of the $110 million legal settlement to keep our year-over-year numbers comparable.Live Nation delivered its e",1141,"Good afternoon, and welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2018 conference call. I will make my comments today excluding the 2017 impacts of the $110 million legal settlement to keep our year-over-year numbers comparable.
Live Nation delivered its eighth consecutive year of record results. Revenue was up 11%, AOI up 13% and free cash flow up 8%. All our divisions, concerts, sponsorship and ticketing, delivered their strongest AOI results in the history of the company.
Starting with our concert unit. Fans, more than ever, find the live experience, from club shows to arenas to festivals, a top entertainment choice and the best way to celebrate their favorite artists and show the experience with fans. In the U.S. alone, over the past 10 years, consumer spend on live experiences has grown by $5 billion per year. We believe this ongoing trend will structurally continue to drive increased demand for concerts globally.
As a result of the strong demand growth in 2018, we delivered double-digit attendance growth across our arenas, amphitheaters and theaters and clubs, continuing to grow our global market share, adding nearly 7 million fans globally for a total of 93 million fans, driving concert revenue up 11% and AOI up 22%.
Across all of the artists we work with, we invested over $6 billion to promote 35,000 shows in 40 countries, with Live Nation by far the largest financial supporter of artists in music.
In addition to growing our show count and attendance, our pricing and on-site initiatives also continued to grow our AOI. Average ticket prices for our amphitheater and arena shows increased by 13% in 2018 as front-of-the-house pricing was up over 20%. Overall, across all our shows, price increases delivered over $350 million to artists who effectively captured more of the value from the shows.
Once at the show, average per fan spend grew as well. At our amphitheaters, spend grew by $3 to $27 per head as we added more high-end products, improved the quality of our food and beverage and increased the revenue we earn from parking and service fees. 
The strength of our business is continuing in 2019 with ticket sales for shows this year up double digits through mid-February, along with similar increases in confirmed amphitheater, arena and stadium show count. With this growth and our plans to further monetize our fan relationship, I expect this to translate to continued strong growth in concerts AOI in 2019.
In our high-end sponsorship business, we grew both revenue and AOI by 13% in 2018. Our top strategic sponsors have been a key driver of this growth with 75 sponsors collectively spending over $350 million to reach our fans, up 11% over 2017. Sponsorship at our festivals grew 13%. This growth was driven by new deals with brands including Heineken, Barclays, State Farm and Frito-Lay.
All of this reinforces the power of our platform of 93 million fans and the continued shift by brands to invest in reaching fans during live experiences. Research from our Power of Live white paper indicates that over 90% of fans believe that brands can enhance the live experience and over 60% of fans believe they are more likely to connect with brands at concerts. This reinforces that our shows offer brands a truly unique opportunity to connect with fans.
With over 70% of budgeted sponsorship net revenue for the year already committed, pacing double digits ahead of last year this time, we are confident we will again deliver double-digit AOI growth for 2019.
Ticketmaster continued growing its leadership position in ticketing in 2018 with fee-bearing GTV up 14% and total platform GTV up $33 billion. This drove our 14% increase in ticketing revenue and AOI of 7%.
Our top priority at Ticketmaster in 2018 was deploying our TM Presence product, which we see as our key for effectively unlocking the value of our customer relationship across ticketing, concerts and sponsorship business. By the end of 2018, we deployed Presence in over 200 venues, operating 20,000 events for 40 million fans, approximately half of whom used our digital tickets.
We see our deployment in 2019 further accelerating and we are expecting to have Presence in over 500 venues by the end of the year with 125 million fans attending events at these buildings. At that point, we will have covered 75% of major sports and Live Nation buildings, making Ticketmaster by far the global leader in digital tickets.
At the same time, we continued to build our marketplace with the fourth quarter being our highest fee-bearing GTV quarter ever, selling over 60 million fee-bearing tickets in a quarter for the first time and delivering over $5 billion in fee-bearing GTV. Overall in 2018, Ticketmaster managed over 400,000 events, delivering almost 500 million tickets in 28 countries. We continue adding new clients to our marketplace who collectively added over 10 million new tickets in 2018.
I believe we have a tremendous opportunity for growth on a global basis, particularly in the 13 markets where we promote concerts but don't yet have a substantial ticketing operation. In 2018, we furthered our international expansion, establishing ticketing operations in Italy, ramping up our German operations and laying the groundwork for our expansion in Latin America. Ticketmaster continues to exceed expectations, both operationally and in its leadership position in digital ticketing, along with its ability to extend that leadership position globally and deliver continued profitable growth.
In summary, 2018 was another strong year for Live Nation, building our global concert business and thereby driving growth in our high-margin venue, sponsorship and ticketing businesses.
We continue to see the tremendous power of live events with strong consumer demand and a robust supply of new and established artists hitting the road from clubs to stadium. Live is truly a unique entertainment form. It cannot be duplicated and creates lifetime memories that fans are craving more than ever in this experience economy.
We believe the live business will continue to have strong growth for years to come as fans globally drive demand, artists are touring more and more and on-site spending, sponsorship and ticketing all benefit from the concerts flywheel.
In 2019, I expect us to further grow our global concert position while enhancing on-site hospitality and capturing more pricing opportunities. In sponsorship, we will continue to drive double-digit growth as more brands look for that direct connection with music fans. And as ticketing continues to transform to a truly digital ecosystem, it will benefit from continued growth in concert ticket sales and further expansion of our global footprint.
We believe that the combination of macro trends and our demonstrated ability to execute are strong indicators of our ability to continue to grow the business for many years to come.
And with that, I will turn the call over to Joe to take you through additional details."

As we have talked about over the past year, 2018 was a very stron",980,"Thanks, Michael.
Looking at our business segments, first, concerts. As Michael said, in 2018, we grew attendance by 8% to a record 93 million fans, promoting 19 of the top 25 global tours. As we have talked about over the past year, 2018 was a very strong year for arenas, amphitheaters and theaters and clubs, with all 3 building types up double digits in attendance.
Globally, we also continued growing our festival portfolio, adding 7 festivals to give us a global portfolio of 104 festivals in 14 countries. As a result, we increased festival attendance by 6% to nearly 9 million fans and now have 29 festivals that each attracted over 100,000 fans last year. 
Looking geographically, North America was the primary driver of our fan growth while internationally, the cyclically lower stadium attendance offset much of their strong arena and festival attendance growth.
Looking specifically at the fourth quarter, while attendance and show count were up, our AOI was lower, heavily driven by a $15 million year-on-year increase in advertising expense related to 2019 shows. This increased advertising spend is representative of a continued shift to earlier-on sales and is also one of the reasons we are optimistic about 2019 concert activity.
For 2019, as Michael said, we are already seeing strong growth in ticket sales for shows this year. Sales are particularly strong in our international markets, which we expect to continue through the year, with North America also expected to keep growing. We see growth across all building types in 2019 with arenas globally, amphitheaters in North America and stadiums internationally all contributing to the increase.
Along with our fan growth, we will also be continuing our focus on pricing optimization and on-site monetization in 2019. On pricing, with over 2,000 arena and amphitheater shows already on sale, we are seeing high-single-digit increases in front-of-house pricing, which I expect to continue or expand throughout the year. And while our on-site monetization won't start until the summer season, it remains a priority to continue our growth for the past few years with teams already working on specific amphitheater-by-amphitheater plans.
Turning to our sponsorship and advertising business. In 2018, we again delivered double-digit AOI growth, up 13% this year. This performance was reflective of strength across the board. North America and international sponsorship businesses were both up double digits and both sponsorship and online advertising also grew double digits.
For the fourth quarter, revenue was up 20% and AOI was up 16%. We saw particularly strong growth at our festivals in the fourth quarter, including Austin City Limits and Voodoo, while also launching a number of major programs for sponsors, including Google, Sony, Pepsi, Uber and T-Mobile.
As we get into 2019, we expect to again deliver double-digit AOI growth for the year. As Michael indicated, we are pacing double digits ahead of this time last year and based on our current discussions with brands, we are expecting strong growth in our base of strategic sponsors as well as our on-site sponsorship, particularly at festivals.
Finally, Ticketmaster. Global GTV was up 7% for the quarter and up 8% for the full year, driven by fee-bearing GTV, which was up 12% and 14% for the quarter and year, respectively. Primary GTV, which accounts for almost 90% of overall fee-bearing GTV, was up 12% for the quarter and 14% for the full year. Secondary GTV was up 6% for the quarter and up 16% for the full year as we continue to take share in the North America secondary market.
Throughout 2018, we continued to improve our mobile and app experiences, which is critical for our digital strategy. We grew our app installed base by 40% year-over-year, giving us much greater reach for direct fan relationships. And sales of tickets via mobile devices continued to grow rapidly, up 35% for the year and accounting for over 40% of overall ticket sales.
For the fourth quarter, Ticketmaster AOI was down slightly, impacted by onetime costs associated with the third-party vendor data breach that affected our marketplace in certain international markets. Much of these costs were in the fourth quarter and for the full year, these onetime costs totaled approximately $15 million.
To preempt the question on margins, obviously these data breach costs had a material impact on our 2018 margins. The majority of the remaining margin impact comes from 2 other factors.
First, as Michael indicated, we are continuing to invest in expanding Ticketmaster's global footprint and we expect that any start-up market will have below average margins for a period of time as it scales. These markets are generally rapidly AOI-positive given our ability to get an allocation of Live Nation concert tickets, but initially at below average margins.
Secondly, as we continue to get more effective at data-driven marketing, we are spending more to grow our GTV. To be clear, the GTVs from free visits continued growing in 2018. The paid marketing-driven GTV grew even faster. As a result, margins were impacted despite the attractive profitability of the incremental GTV generated via this paid marketing.
So in summary, 2018 was a great year across all of our businesses and in 2019, we expect to continue growing all of the businesses. From a phasing standpoint, we see our growth continuing to be delivered primarily in the second and third quarters as most of our concert investments will be playing out in those quarters. The first and fourth quarters each account for less than 10% of our annual AOI, meaning that they will also have to absorb increased fixed costs associated with our overall growth against seasonally lower activity.
On FX, we ended up with a negligible impact on AOI and revenue for 2018. And at this point, we see very little impact on 2019.
I will now turn the call over to Kathy to go through more on our financial results."

I will start with our key highlights for the fourth quarter. Revenue increased by 12% to $2.6 billion. AOI was $69 million compared to $87 million in 2017 after adding back a $110 million legal accrual recorded in 2017. As of December 31, our deferred revenue related to future shows was $1.1 billion, up 35% from the $816 million last year.
Concerts, with a 12% increase, contributed the majority of the revenue growth in the quarter from increased arena and theater and club activity. Sponsorship and advertising revenue was up 20% from higher sponsor and online activity in North America. And ticketing revenue increased 15% from higher primary ticket volume.
Fourth quarter AOI was lower in concerts due to the $15 million increase in advertising expense for 2019 shows that Joe mentioned. Sponsorships and advertising delivered 16% growth in AOI with higher online advertising in North America and growth in sponsorships internationally.
Our operating loss was $90 million in the quarter, essentially flat to last year after adjusting for the legal accrual. The net loss for the quarter was $148 million compared to a loss of $137 million in the prior year before the legal accrual and a $56 million tax benefit related to tax reform changes in 2017.
For the 2018 full year, revenue was $10.8 billion, an 11% increase over 2017. AOI was $829 million for the full year, up 13% over our 2017 AOI of $735 million before the legal accrual. Free cash flow adjusted was $481 million, up 8% over last year without the legal accrual or 58% of AOI for the year.
All our segments delivered double-digit growth in revenue for 2018. The majority of the increase was driven by concerts, up 11% from increased show count and attendance across arenas, amphitheaters and theaters and clubs. Sponsorship and advertising revenue was up 13% from growth in online advertising and sponsorship programs globally. And ticketing revenue increased by 14% from higher primary ticket volume, driven by concerts, along with increased secondary sales.
Concerts AOI was up 22% as a result of more events and fans across arenas, amphitheaters, festivals and theaters and club and higher ancillary revenue per band in our amphitheaters. Sponsorship and advertising AOI grew by 13%, in line with this higher revenue. And ticketing AOI grew 7% without the 2017 legal accrual, delivering growth in both primary and secondary ticket sales, although impacted by the cyber investigation costs incurred this year that Joe noted.
Operating income was $273 million, up 35% over last year before the legal accrual, driven by our strong AOI growth. Our net income for the year was $60 million as compared to $48 million in 2017 before the legal accrual and the 2017 tax reform-related tax benefit.
We recorded $78 million of accretion at redeemable noncontrolling interests in 2018. We currently expect this accretion to be approximately $45 million for 2019, which will be consistently spread across the quarters. We expect that amortization of non-recoupable ticketing contract advances in 2019 will be in line with the last few years of expense.
Turning to our balance sheet. As of December 31, we had total cash of $2.4 billion, including $859 million in ticketing client cash and $903 million in net concert event-related cash, leaving a free cash balance of $610 million. Net cash provided by operating activities was $942 million as compared to $624 million last year, with the increase driven by our higher event-related deferred revenue.
For the full year, total capital expenditures were $251 million, roughly half of which was spent on revenue-generating items. For 2019, we currently expect our total capital expenditures to be approximately $300 million with a similar split to this year for revenue-generating expenditures.
Our total net debt as of December 2018 was $2.8 billion with a weighted average cost of 4.2%.

They may have a retail strategy converting to online, but we also see international has a great opportunity. That is where we actually have great pricing power. And every year, we're seeing the service fee going up to reflect kind of closer to the U.S. model over time. So great profit pool to grow internationally outside of U.S., Canada."

The complexity here, again, with us is we will often use M&A to enter a market. Buy a local, could be relatively small for both promoters, but the one who is well established in that market. And then we turn our engine of 80 tours that we're buying onto that area. So whether we're talking about a local market here in North America or a promoter down in Argentina, we rapidly grow organically off of that initial platform that we're purchasing. So we end up with 70%, 80% organic growth as a result of that. We -- but we do use -- absolutely use M&A for that initial entry point."

So we gave some pretty specific numbers at our last Liberty presentation, so I won't try to remember all of those numbers. I think what we did say is the secondary industry, over the past several years, has been growing at a pretty good clip, frankly, faster than we have been growing our ticket prices. And so we think there continues to be a -- over $1 billion of price arbitrage that exists in our concert tickets alone. If you look at the marketplace, we obviously have a 2-headed strategy. One strategy is to create a compelling product on Ticketmaster that offers both the primary and secondary tickets. The other strategy, which is at least as important to us, is to continue to get more effective at that initial primary ticket pricing and transfer as much of the economics as possible into the artist's pocket, which continues to attract them to tour more and be out there generating more shows, more fans for our overall flywheel strategy. So going forward, I think it would be our expectation that we would see less growth certainly in the secondary market as we continue to focus on that primary pricing. I think that the competitors in this space are pretty well known. Obviously, StubHub, Vivid in the United States. But for us, it's really a matter of how do we continue to best serve the artists and the fans with the right products."

We still believe that the U.S., Canadian market, let's put those 2 together, still have growth ahead. We are still underserviced in markets as we've talked before about. We still have opportunities to build more of our businesses in a lot of the A -- in the A markets. We have low market share in a lot of big markets. So U.S. still has great potential. We still think sponsorship is a double-digit growth business in America and we think -- and the concert business continues to be on-site, hospitality, real estate expansion, incredible, frothy opportunity in the U.S. So don't want -- it's not an either/either (sic) [either/or] where we continue to execute with great confidence, but it's a -- we're going to continue to invest in America. But we have -- absolutely have always said that it's a global business. And as we build out the pipe in 40 countries, when we look at all the other cities around the world where we have no market share or low, as we put in the best promoter and a ticketing platform and our global concerts, which then follow usually sponsorship and ticketing, where we have that model down in major cities and when we got those 3 to 4 legs of that stool in Milan and Cape Town and Rio, we know we can build a $10 million to $20 million business. So we think there are a whole bunch of opportunities international where we don't have the 4 legs. We might have 1 leg, that's why you see us buy a festival in a major market and a major promoter in a different market. As we fill out the legs, great opportunity organically will happen through our scale.
So we'll be doing that for the next 5 to 10 years. We'll be talking about 30% market share and lots of opportunity to build international business platform. It's behind America, in a lot of the ways I just mentioned, on ticketing. So we see it probably has a higher growth potential from unsophisticated in both sponsorship, ticketing and venue development. So all 3 of those, you will see opportunities over the years. Call that the apparatus we want to get built. The consistent demand that we know is Rihanna can sell out anywhere and that's the part that makes our model unique. So continue to grow international. That will be a great story for us for many years to come. We're diverse enough now that if a certain market is having a good or bad day, we'll be okay. We have enough risk aversion. And the U.S. will continue to have a deeper bench to grow on also."

If you look at our core business model, I'm sure people are sick of the phrase -- and I do appreciate that both you and Rich let me patent 'flywheel' long before any other businesses [ distilled ] that one. So yes, we have a big flywheel of concerts and we're going to wake up every year finding new and adjacent businesses that we can monetize because of the flywheel. And no one in the world has 30,000 shows and almost 100 million people walking in the door. So that's why we believe in the U.S. and onward will have -- it's endless growth opportunities. One of them happens to be the venue, the real estate. For many years, we were happy putting our content in someone else's venue and getting a ticket fee and selling tickets at the door. A lot of times, as we've said in our different analyst meetings, when the content ends up in my amphitheater or my festival or my theater and club, we even make more money because we're now counting more revenue streams. And we look now at the real estate market in America, the advantage we have is there's way more real estate than there are artists. And if you are a developer right now with a shopping mall to a development site, you no longer are probably asking the movie theater to be your tenant, you're probably coming to Live Nation saying, ""I'd love you to build a 2,000-seat, a 4,000-seat, a 6,000-seat. I'd love you to be part of our development because that's the vibrant part of the experience we're creating."" So what we're doing now is when those meetings happen is say we're not happy just to ticket and bill your building. We want have equity value in that position and operate and run it to maximize all of the value that can be created from our $6 billion a year. So instead of maybe paying somebody millions a year to lease their building to run it while we fill it, there are times we're going to look at hero strategies in real estate where our content is the entire reason the building is being financed or the building is growing in value. We should capture not just the content, not just the food and beverage, but the equity value of the real estate holdings over time, too. So we're seeing more and more opportunities where our flywheel is putting us in a position to have some equity ownership and control in some great assets that are completely down the middle -- completely down the line of a concert live venue and you will see us explore more of being more -- of leveraging our content."

It's another -- I just mentioned it earlier. We have scale. We have artist relationships, great stories to be told. So we started a new division organically. I think we've done 5 now. We've probably got 10 to 15 projects in the pipeline of artists telling great live stories or movies or documentaries or festival stories or -- et cetera. So we really think that division is obviously a much higher margin business than the concert space, it's a [ low ] capital-intense business, but ultimately it's a great marketing platform for our artists, our shows and our Artist Nation division. So I really think we're not really worried in 2019. It will be a small overall contribution to our agenda and AOI. Over time, we think it's a -- like Artist Nation, we think it's a nice high margin ancillary business to our core mission that will be a positive impact. Whether ultimately, on its own, will make AOI to be positive. Much like we learned with Artist Nation and others, they also end up feeding mother ship. So Artist Nation's ""A Star is Born"" is probably the single greatest marketing exercise we could have did for our sponsorship division. If you are in that division, those kind of things just really send the flare very high and get you in the CMO meeting and other conversations that you hadn't been before. So we look at the pieces, always in the end, if ancillary business gets us one more tour, one more sponsor or one more ticketing contract and makes high margin AOI, it's a triple win."

There aren't -- there's not a lot of growth in terms of the number of teams or the number of games played in a season for the major sports. So it's really been the concerts business that has driven the great growth over the past several years of ticketing. Again, we've given the statistics several times, around 80% of fee-bearing GTV growth coming from the concert business. So it's critical on the sports side. As they've built incredible arenas, their stadiums, they're looking to continue to fill those buildings every night just -- not just when the games are played. Those provide platforms for the tours, the artists that we work with to continue to put on more shows. And it's through putting on those more shows that we've been able to grow the business.

Our constant sponsorship segment drove this growth as bot",841,"Good afternoon, and welcome to our first quarter 2019 conference call. 2019 is off to a strong start with our highest first quarter AOI ever at $115 million and with revenue up 17% to $1.7 million. Our constant sponsorship segment drove this growth as both delivered record first quarter revenue and AOI. 
More importantly, we have now booked enough concerts, sold enough tickets and secured enough sponsorship commitments to be confident the company will deliver double-digit AOI growth for the year. 
We continue to benefit from a global concert industry that is structurally growing with strong tailwinds for both supply and demand. Our performance is further accelerated by our concert flywheel, driving additional profitable growth in our on-site sponsorship and ticketing businesses. 
Starting with the Concert business. We had almost 15 million fans attend our concerts during the first quarter, up 22% year-on-year, led by our arena and theater shows, which are each up over 1 million fans. As a result, revenue was up 27%, and we delivered our first positive AOI Q1 in our Concerts business. This sets up the year well, and through mid-April, we have sold 49 million tickets for our concerts this year, up 5% year-on-year. 
At the same time, we have continued shifting to market-based pricing growing the use of platinum tickets. 
Looking at our front-of-the-house tickets, amphitheater pricing is up double digit this year, and both amphitheater and arenas have seen an increase in pricing of over 30% across the past 2 years. 
Even with this improved pricing, we're not seeing any pull back in demand for concerts as sell-through rates continue to be strong globally. Across arenas, amphitheaters and stadiums, when the best seats in the front to long seats at our amphitheaters. 
As we added fans, we continue to improve our on-site experience, which then drives fan spending, but we were just beginning the amphitheaters theaters, and I expect us to once again grow average per fan spend by $2 this year in our amphitheaters. 
With our global Concerts business set to deliver strong AOI growth again, conscious segment continues to be the engine that powers the overall growth of Live Nation. And what is typically our lowest activity quarter for sponsorship, revenue was up 1% and AOI [ up ] 2%. Through mid-April we are pacing double digits ahead of last year in committed net revenue, reaching over 80% of our target for the full year. I expect our growth to be driven again by festivals and large strategic sponsors. And we continue adding a number of these new partners, including Verizon in the U.S., Rogers communications in Canada and Diego in New York.
As a result, I expect we will deliver double-digit AOI growth in sponsors beginning this year. In the first quarter, Ticketmaster delivered its fourth highest transacted fee-bearing GTV quarter ever, trailing [ in ] only Q1 2018 and Q4 in 2017 and '18. And while Ticketmaster was impacted in the quarter by a pull forward of on sales since the fourth quarter of 2018, by mid-March, those sales trends have turned around, and through mid-April, Ticketmaster has sold 4 million more concert tickets for shows this year than at the same time last year. 
Putting aside the quarterly fluctuations, every metric, including global GTV, ticket sales, clients served and leading digital ticket functionality demonstrates the Ticketmaster is the most effective marketplace to sell tickets to fans. Our road map at Ticketmaster remains very clear and focused, deploy digital ticket and scale and establish the foundation for direct relationships with our fans, which will improve the fan experience, provide opportunities for content, venue operators and sponsors to deliver greater ongoing value to the live event fan. 
As part of this, we remain on track to have presence installed at over 500 venues with more than 135 million fans entering via the system this year. And following our successful first year of digital ticketing with the NFL, we are seeing more teams shift to a pure digital model up to [ 7 teams ] this year from 2 last year. 
In summary, I expect Ticketmaster for the full year to deliver GTV and AOI growth while significantly expanding our digital ticketing footprint. I am pleased with our first quarter results as a start to what we expect to be another record year in 2019. All of our key indicators speak to continued strong consumer demand for our concerts. Our attendance growth in the first [ quarter ], acceptance of market pricing and solid sales for upcoming shows. As a result, we've seen an acceleration of our growth in Q2 with overall AOI increase in the high-teens and each division delivering double-digit AOI growth for the quarter. The combination of this near-term view plus concert ticket sales for the year, sponsors commitment and continued success of the Ticketmaster platform gives us confidence that Live Nation will deliver double-digit AOI growth for the full year. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Joe to take you through more additional details."

Looking at our business segments. First, concerts. In the first quarter, Live Nation promoted 8,000 concerts for nearly 15 million fans worldwide, increases of 12% and 22%, respectively. Fan growth was strong across both North America and",665,"Thanks, Michael. Looking at our business segments. First, concerts. In the first quarter, Live Nation promoted 8,000 concerts for nearly 15 million fans worldwide, increases of 12% and 22%, respectively. Fan growth was strong across both North America and international markets. We're adding particular by arena show count and fan growth along with increased theater activity. 
Looking to the full year, we expect to grow our fan base in both North America and internationally with arenas, theaters and clubs and festivals leading this growth. Our international markets are looking particularly strong, driven also by a resurgence of stadium shows for 2019, including such artists as BTS, Ed Sheeran and Metallica. 
In total, we expect overall fan growth for the year in the mid-single digits, which combined with our pricing initiatives and on-site spending programs, we expect will deliver strong double-digit AOI growth for the concert segment. 
Turning to our sponsorship and advertising business. AOI was up 2% for the quarter and revenue was up 1%. Sponsorship is the only segment where we saw a material FX impact in the quarter, and excluding FX, AOI was up 7% and revenue was up 4%. Given over 85% of our sponsorship is recognized in the second [ report ] quarters, it is our committed net revenue that is our most important indicator at this point of the year, and as Michael indicated, are committed net revenue is up double digits at over 80% of our target for the year. We're seeing consistent growth will both North America and international markets pacing double digits ahead of this point last year as our both online advertising and sponsorship.
And within sponsorship, festival sponsorship per fan and revenue from strategic sponsors are both projected to be up double digits for the year. This broad growth gives us confidence that we will deliver another year of double-digit AOI growth in sponsorship. 
Finally, ticketing. Ticketmaster's global GTV in the first quarter was $7.6 billion, down 10% year-on-year. Both primary and secondary ticketing GTV were down similarly, and in both cases, concerts activities was the main driver. This is consistent with the general sales pattern we see with secondary or most activities is immediately following the on sale or in the P week leading up to the show. So by accelerating concert on sales into the fourth quarter, we have the same impact on secondary sales. As Michael indicated, our digital ticketing deployment is proceeding well and we will evolve into the next level with the NFL this year, shifting to encrypted barcodes as we continue to give content more control over how tickets are sold and managed. 1 of the key implications of digital ticketing is our ongoing shift to mobile ticketing with mobile ticket sales accounting for 46% of total ticket sales in the quarter and also driving a 45% increase in our install base over $60 million. These app installs are critical as it gets is a real-time channel to our digital fans, enabling teams, artists, the venues and our brand partners to directly reach these stance. As Michael noted, we expect we will see growth in fee-bearing GTV for the full year, which will deliver our full year AOI growth for ticketing in the mid-single digits. In summary, following a successful first quarter, we are shaping up to accelerate this growth in the second quarter. This starts with the increase in concert attendance, particularly in stadiums and theaters during the second quarter. In Q2 results will also benefit from a shift in some of our major festival activity from Q3 into Q2, which helps both concerts and sponsorship's. Looking at the full year, given the strength of our leading indicators across concerts, sponsorship and ticketing, we are confident that we will again deliver double-digit AOI growth for the full year in the same range as we have grown over the past several years. And will now turn the call over to Kathy to go through more on our financial results."

Our key financial highlights for the first quarter of 2019 our revenue was up 17% to $1.7 billion. AOI increased 1% to $115 million and as of March 31, our total deferred revenue related to future shows was $1.8",594,"Thanks, Joe, and good afternoon, everyone. Our key financial highlights for the first quarter of 2019 our revenue was up 17% to $1.7 billion. AOI increased 1% to $115 million and as of March 31, our total deferred revenue related to future shows was $1.8 billion, up slightly compared to last year.
The increase in revenue was driven primarily by concert, which grew by 27% as a result of increased activity in arenas and theaters globally. But, which also been delivered the increase in AOI for the quarter. Overall, our AOI for the first quarter finished stronger than what we had expected a few months ago due to a few items. In concerts globally, we had a large number of the year shows that performed strongly and we also saw shift of some artists performance payments from Q1 into Q2. And in ticketing, our ticket sales accelerated starting in mid-March as Michael noted. Our operating loss was $24 million in the first quarter driven by higher depreciation and amortization, along with acquisition-related costs and our net loss for the quarter was $52 million compared to $34 million in the prior year as a result of the higher operating loss.
For the quarter, accretion of redeemable noncontrolling interest was $12 million. For the full year, we currently estimate that this accretion will be approximately $62 million with the remainder for the year fairly consistent across the quarters. For Q1, we had a negative FX impact on revenue and AOI up about 3% and based on the rates now we expect both to be impacted negatively by approximately 1% in the second quarter.
Amortization of non-recoupable ticketing contract advances in 2019 is expected to be in line with the last few years of extent. Turning to our balance sheet. As of March 31, we had total cash of $2.7 billion, including $848 million in client cash and $1.4 billion in net concert event related cash, leaving a free cash balance of $382 million. Net cash provided by operating activities was $469 million as compared to $775 million last year, impacted by the shift to ticket sales into the fourth quarter of 2018. 
Free cash flow adjusted was $3 million driven by the timing of distribution to noncontrolling interest. We currently expect that free cash flow as a percentage of AOI for full year 2019 will be in line with the prior year. 
Our total capital expenditures for the quarter were $62 million with 60% [ spend ] on revenue-generating item. We currently expect that our capital expenditures for the full year will be approximately $310 million with more than half on revenue-generating addition. 
The increase in capital expenditures as compared to last year is driven by concerts as we continue to expand our venue footprint globally and improve our existing venues to drive fan satisfaction, ancillary spend and sponsorship opportunity. 
Our total debt as of March 31 was $2.8 billion with a weighted average cost of 4.3%. We implemented the new lease accounting guidance in the first quarter of 2019, so you will see operating lease assets of $1.1 billion and total operating lease liabilities of $1.2 billion on our balance sheet as of March 31, 2019. These amounts are based on the present value of the remaining minimum lease payments of our various operating leases globally that have terms greater than 1 year. This new lease guidance will not have a material impact to our income statement going forward.

We didn't know whether that was going to run its course end of February, end of March, end of April. There was just that uncertainty when we last spoke. So it ended up playing out, but as of the middle of March, this is when we basically saw ourselves work that out of the system. And then that combined with as we thought of very strong theater business, which tended to have a shorter lead time from when the shows are announced on sale to play, also augmented the quarter for us. 
It was a particularly -- speaking then on international, it was a particularly strong quarter for international. That business continues to grow well as we follow the concerts globally and build the business in the markets where we have a strong concerts presence and less of a historical Ticketmaster presence. I don't think we have anything structural going out at this point, but certainly, our strategy remains on course to use the concerts as the flywheel and to have ticketing benefit from that activity. 
In terms of Rock in Rio, we have certain options. As you said, nothing has been done at this point. And I don't think we're in a position to comment on what we're going to do or not do until we make a final determination."

So you get a real active, young audience when you're in the kind of the 500 to 6,000 seats. 
They seem to be the new movie theater for every developer. So we have great opportunities to kind of leverage our content for more equity, more revenue, more of the pie in the right development. So I think we're in a really sweet spot where the live theater is a part that a lot of the developers, real estate, neighborhood, city centers, they all want that venue to be part of their attraction in urban centers.

Now we've now seen it play out. It was on the positive end of the spectrum of what we had hoped for. And as we said, as of mid-July, Ticketmaster sold 4 million more concert tickets for shows this year than it sold at this point last year. So that was definitely an unknown for us when we did the call in February. 
Another thing is on the concert side. I've said a few times that the theater side of the business in particular has been strong. And that tends to be shorter lead time. And then I think third is, overall, we've been very happy with the sell-through rates. As Michael mentioned, we've been very strong. With other companies calls and you hear concerns about the economic cycle, that was again unknown to us. And I think that having sell-through rates that are at or above last year's across venue type and across ticket types has been something that's given us maybe still a lot better today than we did a few months ago."

I can't remember the precise number, but you can go back and look at that. The progress has been there year-over-year. 
So a few factors. One, we just continue and look at the demand on the secondary market over the last few years. As much as we've been increasing the P [ 1s ], the secondary business is also been growing. So we know there's $8 billion to $10 billion of opportunities still priced outside of the house from a consumer demand perspective. So we know we got years left and we'll be sitting on this call telling you that we've slowly increased the price. And it's a slower process because the artist has to find that right balance between what he will charge that makes sense for his band and his brand and what the market will bear. That allows us some efficiency, but a great progress in the artist is much more -- the appetite is a lot larger now as we've moved forward and they see that kind of some light on what the artist or what the tickets are selling for. 
So we have a great opportunity to keep pricing upfront. I think we've talked about before that the great advantage of pricing upfront is you also then get some extra growth in the pot to reduce the pricing in the back. A problem in the concert business has never been to sell the first 30 rows. It's can you sell those final 30 rows and get that customer in the house and then they buy a beer and they drive your sponsorship and your data. 
So one of the reasons you see our revenue and our ticket sales continually grow, and we think again this will be a multiyear strategy for us is we've been able to price the house better in the back, lower the price when it's needed to, promote -- do some promotions. Do what you can, yet net overall, the artist is still have a higher growth, higher revenue for the whole house. 
So as more sophisticated pricing has come into effect, price the front-of-house better, price the Tuesday different than a Friday, price the aisle seat different than the middle seat. All of the classic airlines will tell models of dynamic pricing, and all of those strategies have been slowly introduced and implemented. It's been driving our overall revenue as well as our throughput on the show. And then once they get in the show, all of those things we talked about how we monetize them. So we've been driving more tickets. 
I think our sell-through, we've been talking about closing the gap. Again, we have a multiyear run rate of opportunity ahead because at the end of the day, the majority of shows still don't sell out, so we always have a lot of inventory to keep putting another person through the turnstile. And whether it's at 8:01, that seat is worth 0. So as long as between the announcement and 7:59, we figured out how to monetize that customer at any price to get him through the door, the business continues to move. So we've been moving that number up over the last few years. I think 1 or 2 points a year. I think we said in November, we look to that to be a $100 million-plus opportunity as we put more people through the house over the next few years by pricing the house better."

So if you look at our business on a global perspective, historically, our European, Western European, Canada, U.S. and Australia have been the traditional markets of a global business. And you've seen the last 5 years, whether it's South America, whether it's Asia or Eastern Europe, we've been slowly building out the infrastructure in those markets. 
We believe that the -- now that the artist is global in terms of when great drops a single tomorrow, that 19-year-old in Singapore, Columbia and Cape Town knows about it as well as that 1 in Detroit. So it is a fast, expanding global business. Every major city in the world wants to be an entertainment capital and have Drake perform there. The infrastructure is being built up. So you're going to see us continue and be aggressive in Asia, South America, India and Eastern Europe as those markets are becoming, every year, more legitimate. 
I think Asia comment might have been driven by our BTS tour. It's a great success story. We're very proud to be part of that global tour, and that might be where the Asia comment came in. Overall, our Asia business is a growing business. We've been in China, Hong Kong and Singapore for years. We've been continually looking to grow those businesses and we will over time."

Our concerts and sponsorship segments drove this growth as both delivered record first quarter revenue and AOI.
More importantly, we have now booked enough concerts, sold enough tickets and secured enough sponsorship commitments to be confident the company will deliver double-digit AOI growth for the year. We continue to benefit from a global concerts industry that is structurally growing with strong tailwinds for both supply and demand. Our performance is further accelerated by our concert flywheel driving additional profitable growth in our on-site sponsorship and ticketing businesses. 
Starting with the concert business. We had almost 15 million fans attend our concerts during the first quarter, up 22% year-on-year, led by our arena and theater shows, which were each up over 1 million fans. As a result, revenue was up 27%, and we delivered our first positive AOI Q1 in our concerts business. This sets up the year well, and through mid-April, we have sold 49 million tickets for our concerts this year, up 5% year-on-year. At the same time, we have continued shifting to market-based pricing, growing the use of platinum tickets.
Looking at our front-of-the-house tickets, amphitheater pricing is up double digit this year, and both amphitheater and arenas have seen an increase in pricing of over 30% across the past 2 years. Even with this improved pricing, we're not seeing any pullback in demand for concerts as sell-through rates continue to be strong globally across arenas, amphitheaters and stadiums, from the best seats in the front to lawn seats at our amphitheaters.
As we add fans, we continue to improve our on-site experience, which then drives fan spending. While we are just beginning the amphitheater season, I expect us to once again grow average per fan spend by $2 this year in our amphitheaters.
With our global concerts business set to deliver strong AOI growth again, concerts segment continues to be the engine that powers the overall growth of Live Nation.
In what is typically our lowest activity quarter for sponsorship, revenue was up 1% and AOI up 2%.  Through mid-April, we are pacing double digits ahead of last year in committed net revenue, reaching over 80% of our target for the full year. I expect our growth to be driven again by festivals and large strategic sponsors. And we continue adding a number of these new partners, including Verizon in the U.S., Rogers Communications in Canada and Diageo in Europe. As a result, I expect we will deliver double-digit AOI growth in sponsorship again this year.
In the first quarter, Ticketmaster delivered its fourth highest transacted fee-bearing GTV quarter ever, trailing only Q1 2018 and Q4 in 2017 and '18. And while Ticketmaster was impacted in the quarter by a pull-forward of onsales since the fourth quarter of 2018, by mid-March, those sales trends have turned around. And through mid-April, Ticketmaster has sold 4 million more concert tickets for shows this year than at the same time last year. 
Putting aside quarterly fluctuations, every metric including global GTV, ticket sales, clients served and leading digital ticket functionality demonstrates the Ticketmaster is the most effective marketplace to sell tickets to fans. Our road map at Ticketmaster remains very clear and focused: deploy digital ticketing at scale and establish the foundation for direct relationships with our fans, which will improve the fan experience, provide opportunities for content, venue operators and sponsors to deliver greater ongoing value to the live event fan. 
As part of this, we remain on track to have Presence installed at over 500 venues with more than 135 million fans entering via the system this year. And following our successful first year of digital ticketing with the NFL, we are seeing more teams shift to a pure digital model up to 7 teams this year from 2 last year. 
In summary, I expect Ticketmaster for the full year to deliver GTV and AOI growth while significantly expanding our digital ticketing footprint.
I am pleased with our first quarter results as a start to what we expect to be another record year in 2019. All of our key indicators speak to continued strong consumer demand for our concerts: our attendance growth in the first quarter, acceptance of market pricing and solid sales for upcoming shows. As a result, we see an acceleration of our growth in Q2 with overall AOI increase in the high teens and each division delivering double-digit AOI growth for the quarter. The combination of this near-term view plus concert ticket sales for the year, sponsorship commitments and continued success of the Ticketmaster platform gives us confidence that Live Nation will deliver double-digit AOI growth for the full year. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Joe to take you through more additional details."
384687,611073964,1718622,"Live Nation Entertainment, Inc., Q1 2019 Earnings Call, May 02, 2019",2019-05-02,"Earnings Calls","Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Michael. Looking at our business segments. First, concerts. In the first quarter, Live Nation promoted 8,000 concerts for nearly 15 million fans worldwide, increases of 12% and 22%, respectively. Fan growth was strong across both North America and",666,"Thanks, Michael. Looking at our business segments. First, concerts. In the first quarter, Live Nation promoted 8,000 concerts for nearly 15 million fans worldwide, increases of 12% and 22%, respectively. Fan growth was strong across both North America and international markets. We're adding, in particular, by arena show count and fan growth along with increased theater activity. 
Looking to the full year. We expect to grow our fan base in both North America and internationally with arenas, theaters and clubs and festivals leading this growth. Our international markets are looking particularly strong, driven also by a resurgence of stadium shows for 2019, including such artists as BTS, Ed Sheeran and Metallica. In total, we expect overall fan growth for the year in the mid-single digits, which combined with our pricing initiatives and on-site spending programs, we expect will deliver strong double-digit AOI growth for the concert segment. 
Turning to our sponsorship and advertising business. AOI was up 2% for the quarter and revenue was up 1%. Sponsorship is the only segment where we saw a material FX impact in the quarter, and excluding FX, AOI was up 7% and revenue was up 4%. Given over 85% of our sponsorship is recognized in the second through fourth quarters, it is our committed net revenue that is our most important indicator at this point of the year. And as Michael indicated, our committed net revenue is up double digits at over 80% of our target for the year. 
We're seeing consistent growth with both North America and international markets, pacing double digits ahead of this point last year, as are both online advertising and sponsorship. And within sponsorship, festival sponsorship per fan and revenue from strategic sponsors are both projected to be up double digits for the year. This broad growth gives us confidence that we will deliver another year of double-digit AOI growth in sponsorship. 
Finally, ticketing. Ticketmaster's global GTV in the first quarter was $7.6 billion, down 10% year-on-year. Both primary and secondary ticketing GTV were down similarly, and in both cases, concerts activity was the main driver. This is consistent with the general sales pattern we see with secondary where most activity is either immediately following the onsale or in the few weeks leading up to the show. So by accelerating concert onsales into the fourth quarter, we have the same impact on secondary sales.
As Michael indicated, our digital ticketing deployment is proceeding well, and we will evolve it to the next level with the NFL this year, shifting to encrypted barcodes as we continue to give content more control over how tickets are sold and managed. One of the key implications of digital ticketing is our ongoing shift to mobile ticketing with mobile ticket sales accounting for 46% of total ticket sales in the quarter and also driving a 40% increase in our installed app base to over 60 million. These app installs are critical as it gives us a real-time channel to our digital fans, enabling teams, artists, the venues and our brand partners to directly reach these fans.
As Michael noted, we expect we will see growth in fee-bearing GTV for the full year, which will deliver our full year AOI growth for ticketing in the mid-single digits.
In summary, following a successful first quarter, we're shaping up to accelerate this growth in the second quarter. This starts with the increase in concert attendance, particularly in stadiums and theaters during the second quarter. And Q2 results will also benefit from a shift in some of our major festival activity from Q3 into Q2, which helps both concerts and sponsorship. 
Looking at the full year, given the strength of our leading indicators across concerts, sponsorship and ticketing, we are confident that we will again deliver double-digit AOI growth for the full year in the same range as we have grown over the past several years.
I will now turn the call over to Kathy to go through more on our financial results."

Our key financial highlights for the first quarter of 2019. Our revenue was up 17% to $1.7 billion. AOI increased 1% to $115 million. And as of March 31, our total deferred revenue related to future shows was $1.",590,"Thanks, Joe, and good afternoon, everyone. Our key financial highlights for the first quarter of 2019. Our revenue was up 17% to $1.7 billion. AOI increased 1% to $115 million. And as of March 31, our total deferred revenue related to future shows was $1.8 billion, up slightly compared to last year.
The increase in revenue was driven primarily by concerts, which grew by 27% as a result of increased activity in arenas and theaters globally, which also then delivered the increase in AOI for the quarter. Overall, our AOI for the first quarter finished stronger than what we had expected a few months ago due to a few items. In concerts globally, we had a large number of theater shows that performed strongly, and we also saw a shift of some artist performance payments from Q1 into Q2. And in ticketing, our ticket sales accelerated starting in mid-March, as Michael noted.
Our operating loss was $24 million in the first quarter driven by higher depreciation and amortization along with acquisition-related costs. And our net loss for the quarter was $52 million compared to $34 million in the prior year as a result of the higher operating loss.
For the quarter, accretion of redeemable noncontrolling interest was $12 million. For the full year, we currently estimate that this accretion will be approximately $62 million with the remainder for the year fairly consistent across the quarters. For Q1, we had a negative FX impact on revenue and AOI, up about 3%. And based on the rates now, we expect both to be impacted negatively by approximately 1% in the second quarter.
Amortization of non-recoupable ticketing contract advances in 2019 is expected to be in line with the last few years of expense.
Turning to our balance sheet. As of March 31, we had total cash of $2.7 billion, including $848 million in client cash and $1.4 billion in net concert event-related cash, leaving a free cash balance of $382 million. Net cash provided by operating activities was $469 million as compared to $775 million last year, impacted by the shift to ticket sales into the fourth quarter of 2018. Free cash flow adjusted was $3 million driven by the timing of distribution to noncontrolling interest. We currently expect that free cash flow as a percentage of AOI for full year 2019 will be in line with the prior year. 
Our total capital expenditures for the quarter were $62 million with 60% spent on revenue-generating items. We currently expect that our capital expenditures for the full year will be approximately $310 million with more than half on revenue-generating addition. The increase in capital expenditures as compared to last year is driven by concerts as we continue to expand our venue footprint globally and improve our existing venues to drive fan satisfaction, ancillary spend and sponsorship opportunities. 
Our total debt as of March 31 was $2.8 billion with a weighted average cost of 4.3%. We implemented the new lease accounting guidance in the first quarter of 2019, so you will see operating lease assets of $1.1 billion and total operating lease liabilities of $1.2 billion on our balance sheet as of March 31, 2019. These amounts are based on the present value of the remaining minimum lease payments of our various operating leases globally that have terms greater than 1 year. This new lease guidance will not have a material impact to our income statement going forward.

So it ended up playing out, but as of the middle of March, this is when we basically saw ourselves work that out of the system. And then that combined with, as we talked, a very strong theater business, which tended to have a shorter lead time from when the shows are announced to onsale the play, also augmented the quarter for us. 
It was a particularly -- speaking then on international, it was a particularly strong quarter for international. That business continues to grow well as we follow the concerts globally and build the business in the markets where we have a strong concerts presence and less of a historical Ticketmaster presence. I don't think we have anything structural to announce at this point, but certainly, our strategy remains on course to use the concerts as the flywheel and to have ticketing benefit from that activity. 
In terms of Rock in Rio, we have certain options. As you said, nothing has been done at this point. I don't think we're in a position to comment on what we're going to do or not do until we make a final determination."

I guess when you did your fourth quarter, did you not quite have the visibility on that at the time? Or how do you see that playing out versus what you've originally expected?"

So until we saw that play out, we didn't know what that was. 
Now we've now seen it play out. It was on the positive end of the spectrum of what we had hoped for. And as we said, as of mid-July, Ticketmaster sold 4 million more concert tickets for shows this year than it sold at this point last year. So that was definitely an unknown for us when we did the call in February. 
Another thing is on the concert side. I've said a few times that the theater side of the business in particular has been strong. And that tends to be shorter lead time. 
And then I think third is, overall, we've been very happy with the sell-through rates. As Michael mentioned, have been very strong. You listened to other companies' calls and you hear concerns about the economic cycle. That was again an unknown to us. And I think that having sell-through rates that are at or above last year's across venue type and across ticket type has been something that's given us maybe still a lot better today than we did a few months ago."

I can't remember the precise number, but you can go back and look at that. The progress has been there year-over-year. 
So a few factors. One, we just continually look at the demand on the secondary market over the last few years. As much as we've been increasing the P1s, the secondary business has also been growing. So we know there's $8 billion to $10 billion of opportunities still priced outside of the house from a consumer demand perspective. So we know we got years left, and we'll be sitting on this call telling you that we've slowly increased the price. And it's a slower process because the artist has to find that right balance between what he will charge that makes sense for his band and his brand and what the market will bear. There will always be some inefficiency. But a great progress. The artist is much more -- the appetite is a lot larger now as we've moved forward and they see that kind of sunlight of what the artist -- or what the tickets are selling for. 
So we have a great opportunity to keep pricing upfront. I think we've talked about before that the great advantage of pricing upfront is you also then get some extra growth in the plot to reduce the pricing in the back. A problem in the concert business has never been to sell the first 30 rows. It's can you sell those final 30 rows and get that customer in the house and then they buy a beer and they drive your sponsorship and your data. 
So one of the reasons you see our revenue and our ticket sales continually grow, and we think again this will be a multiyear strategy for us, is we've been able to price the house better in the back, lower the price when it's needed to, promote -- do some promotions, do what you can. Yet net overall, the artists still have higher growth, higher revenue for the whole house. 
So as more sophisticated pricing has come into effect, price the front of the house better, price the Tuesday different than a Friday, price the aisle seat different than the middle seat. All of the classic airlines will tell models of dynamic pricing, and all of those strategies have been slowly introduced and implemented. It's been driving our overall revenue as well as our throughput on the show, and then once they get in the show, all of those things we talked about how we monetize them. So we've been driving more tickets. 
I think our sell-through, we've been talking about closing the gap. Again, we have a multiyear runway of opportunity ahead because at the end of the day, the majority of shows still don't sell out. So we always have a lot of inventory to keep putting another person through the turnstile. And whether it's -- at 8:01, that ticket is worth 0. So as long as between the announcement and 7:59, we figured out how to monetize that customer at any price to get him through the door, the business continues to move. So we've been moving that number up over the last few years, I think, 1 or 2 points a year. And I think we said in November, we look to that to be a $100 million-plus opportunity as we put more people through the house over the next few years by pricing the house better."

We're in 42 markets where we have a Live Nation office where we're promoting the show. It is a global but a local business. You have to have boots on the ground to actually execute. 
So if you look at our business on a global perspective, historically, our European -- Western European, Canada, U.S. and Australia have been the traditional markets of a global business. And you've seen the last 5 years, whether it's South America, whether it's Asia or Eastern Europe, we've been slowly building out the infrastructure in those markets. We believe that the -- now that the artist is global in terms of when Drake drops a single tomorrow, that 19-year-old in Singapore, Colombia and Cape Town knows about it as well as that one in Detroit. 
So it is a fast, expanding global business. Every major city in the world wants to be an entertainment capital and have Drake perform there. The infrastructure is being built. So you're going to see us continue to be aggressive in Asia, South America, India and Eastern Europe as those markets are becoming, every year, more legitimate. 
I think the Asia comment might have been driven by our BTS tour. It's a great success story. We're very proud to be part of that global tour, and that might be where the Asia comment came in. Overall, our Asia business is a growing business. We've been in China, Hong Kong and Singapore for years. We've been continually looking to grow those businesses, and we will over time."

Our concerts and sponsorship segments drove this growth a",828,"Good afternoon, and welcome to our first quarter 2019 conference call. 2019 is off to a strong start with our highest first quarter AOI ever at $115 million and with revenue up 17% to $1.7 billion. Our concerts and sponsorship segments drove this growth as both delivered record first quarter revenue and AOI.
More importantly, we have now booked enough concerts, sold enough tickets and secured enough sponsorship commitments to be confident the company will deliver double-digit AOI growth for the year. We continue to benefit from a global concerts industry that is structurally growing with strong tailwinds for both supply and demand. Our performance is further accelerated by our concert flywheel driving additional profitable growth in our on-site sponsorship and ticketing businesses. 
Starting with the concert business. We had almost 15 million fans attend our concerts during the first quarter, up 22% year-on-year, led by our arena and theater shows, which were each up over 1 million fans. As a result, revenue was up 27%, and we delivered our first positive AOI Q1 in our concerts business. This sets up the year well, and through mid-April, we have sold 49 million tickets for our concerts this year, up 5% year-on-year. At the same time, we have continued shifting to market-based pricing, growing the use of Platinum tickets.
Looking at our front-of-the-house tickets, amphitheater pricing is up double digit this year, and both amphitheater and arenas have seen an increase in pricing of over 30% across the past 2 years. Even with this improved pricing, we're not seeing any pullback in demand for concerts as sell-through rates continue to be strong globally across arenas, amphitheaters and stadiums, from the best seats in the front to lawn seats at our amphitheaters.
As we add fans, we continue to improve our on-site experience, which then drives fan spending. While we are just beginning the amphitheater season, I expect us to once again grow average per fan spend by $2 this year in our amphitheaters.
With our global concerts business set to deliver strong AOI growth again, concerts segment continues to be the engine that powers the overall growth of Live Nation.
In what is typically our lowest activity quarter for sponsorship, revenue was up 1% and AOI up 2%.  Through mid-April, we are pacing double digits ahead of last year in committed net revenue, reaching over 80% of our target for the full year. I expect our growth to be driven again by festivals and large strategic sponsors. And we continue adding a number of these new partners, including Verizon in the U.S., Rogers Communications in Canada and Diageo in Europe. As a result, I expect we will deliver double-digit AOI growth in sponsorship again this year.
In the first quarter, Ticketmaster delivered its fourth highest transacted fee-bearing GTV quarter ever, trailing only Q1 2018 and Q4 in 2017 and '18. And while Ticketmaster was impacted in the quarter by a pull-forward of onsales since the fourth quarter of 2018, by mid-March, those sales trends had turned around and through mid-April, Ticketmaster has sold 4 million more concert tickets for shows this year than at the same time last year. 
Putting aside quarterly fluctuations, every metric including global GTV, ticket sales, clients served and leading digital ticket functionality demonstrates that Ticketmaster is the most effective marketplace to sell tickets to fans. Our road map at Ticketmaster remains very clear and focused: deploy digital ticketing at scale and establish the foundation for direct relationships with our fans, which will improve the fan experience, provide opportunities for content, venue operators and sponsors to deliver greater ongoing value to the live event fan. 
As part of this, we remain on track to have Presence installed at over 500 venues with more than 135 million fans entering via this system this year. And following our successful first year of digital ticketing with the NFL, we are seeing more teams shift to a pure digital model, up to 7 teams this year from 2 last year. 
In summary, I expect Ticketmaster, for the full year, to deliver GTV and AOI growth while significantly expanding our digital ticketing footprint.
I am pleased with our first quarter results as a start to what we expect to be another record year in 2019. All of our key indicators speak to continued strong consumer demand for our concerts: our attendance growth in the first quarter, acceptance of market pricing and solid sales for upcoming shows. As a result, we see an acceleration of our growth in Q2 with overall AOI increase in the high teens and each division delivering double-digit AOI growth for the quarter. The combination of this near-term view plus concert ticket sales for the year, sponsorship commitments and continued success of the Ticketmaster platform gives us confidence that Live Nation will deliver double-digit AOI growth for the full year. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Joe to take you through more additional details."

In the first quarter, Live Nation promoted 8,000 concerts for nearly 15 million fans worldwide, increases of 12% and 22%, respectively. Fan growth was strong across both North America and international markets. Led in particular by arena show count and fan growth along with increased theater activity. 
Looking to the full year. We expect to grow our fan base in both North America and internationally with arenas, theaters and clubs and festivals leading this growth. Our international markets are looking particularly strong, driven also by a resurgence of stadium shows for 2019, including such artists as BTS, Ed Sheeran and Metallica. In total, we expect overall fan growth for the year in the mid-single digits, which combined with our pricing initiatives and on-site spending programs, we expect will deliver strong double-digit AOI growth for the concert segment. 
Turning to our sponsorship and advertising business. AOI was up 2% for the quarter and revenue was up 1%. Sponsorship is the only segment where we saw a material FX impact in the quarter, and excluding FX, AOI was up 7% and revenue was up 4%. Given over 85% of our sponsorship is recognized in the second through fourth quarters, it is our committed net revenue that is our most important indicator at this point of the year. And as Michael indicated, our committed net revenue is up double digits at over 80% of our target for the year. 
We're seeing consistent growth with both North America and international markets, pacing double digits ahead of this point last year, as are both online advertising and sponsorship. And within sponsorship, festival sponsorship per fan and revenue from strategic sponsors are both projected to be up double digits for the year. This broad growth gives us confidence that we will deliver another year of double-digit AOI growth in sponsorship. 
Finally, ticketing. Ticketmaster's global GTV in the first quarter was $7.6 billion, down 10% year-on-year. Both primary and secondary ticketing GTV were down similarly, and in both cases, concerts activity was the main driver. This is consistent with the general sales pattern we see with secondary where most activity is either immediately following the onsale or in the few weeks leading up to the show. So by accelerating concert onsales into the fourth quarter, we have the same impact on secondary sales.
As Michael indicated, our digital ticketing deployment is proceeding well, and we will evolve it to the next level with the NFL this year, shifting to encrypted barcodes as we continue to give content more control over how tickets are sold and managed. One of the key implications of digital ticketing is our ongoing shift to mobile ticketing with mobile ticket sales accounting for 46% of total ticket sales in the quarter and also driving a 40% increase in our installed app base to over 60 million. These app installs are critical as it gives us a real-time channel to our digital fans, enabling teams, artists, the venues and our brand partners to directly reach these fans.
As Michael noted, we expect we will see growth in fee-bearing GTV for the full year, which will deliver our full year AOI growth for ticketing in the mid-single digits.
In summary, following a successful first quarter, we're shaping up to accelerate this growth in the second quarter. This starts with increasing concert attendance, particularly in stadiums and theaters during the second quarter. And Q2 results will also benefit from a shift in some of our major festival activity from Q3 into Q2, which helps both concerts and sponsorship. 
Looking at the full year, given the strength of our leading indicators across concerts, sponsorship and ticketing, we are confident that we will again deliver double-digit AOI growth for the full year in the same range as we have grown over the past several years.
I will now turn the call over to Kathy to go through more on our financial results."
384687,611073964,1720528,"Live Nation Entertainment, Inc., Q1 2019 Earnings Call, May 02, 2019",2019-05-02,"Earnings Calls","Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Joe, and good afternoon, everyone. Our key financial highlights for the first quarter of 2019. Our revenue was up 17% to $1.7 billion. AOI increased 1% to $115 million. And as of March 31, our total deferred revenue related to future shows was $1.",590,"Thanks, Joe, and good afternoon, everyone. Our key financial highlights for the first quarter of 2019. Our revenue was up 17% to $1.7 billion. AOI increased 1% to $115 million. And as of March 31, our total deferred revenue related to future shows was $1.8 billion, up slightly compared to last year.
The increase in revenue was driven primarily by concerts, which grew by 27% as a result of increased activity in arenas and theaters globally, which also then delivered the increase in AOI for the quarter. Overall, our AOI for the first quarter finished stronger than what we had expected a few months ago due to a few items. In concerts globally, we had a large number of theater shows that performed strongly, and we also saw a shift of some artist performance payments from Q1 into Q2. And in ticketing, our ticket sales accelerated starting in mid-March, as Michael noted.
Our operating loss was $24 million in the first quarter driven by higher depreciation and amortization along with acquisition-related costs. And our net loss for the quarter was $52 million compared to $34 million in the prior year as a result of the higher operating loss.
For the quarter, accretion of redeemable noncontrolling interest was $12 million. For the full year, we currently estimate that this accretion will be approximately $62 million with the remainder for the year fairly consistent across the quarters. For Q1, we had a negative FX impact on revenue and AOI, up about 3%. And based on the rates now, we expect both to be impacted negatively by approximately 1% in the second quarter.
Amortization of non-recoupable ticketing contracted advances in 2019 is expected to be in line with the last few years of expense.
Turning to our balance sheet. As of March 31, we had total cash of $2.7 billion, including $848 million in client cash and $1.4 billion in net concert event-related cash, leaving a free cash balance of $382 million. Net cash provided by operating activities was $469 million as compared to $775 million last year, impacted by the shift to ticket sales into the fourth quarter of 2018. Free cash flow adjusted was $3 million driven by the timing of distribution to noncontrolling interest. We currently expect that free cash flow as a percentage of AOI for full year 2019 will be in line with the prior year. 
Our total capital expenditures for the quarter were $62 million with 60% spent on revenue-generating items. We currently expect that our capital expenditures for the full year will be approximately $310 million with more than half on revenue-generating addition. The increase in capital expenditures as compared to last year is driven by concerts as we continue to expand our venue footprint globally and improve our existing venues to drive fan satisfaction, ancillary spend and sponsorship opportunities. 
Our total debt as of March 31 was $2.8 billion with a weighted average cost of 4.3%. We implemented the new lease accounting guidance in the first quarter of 2019, so you will see operating lease assets of $1.1 billion and total operating lease liabilities of $1.2 billion on our balance sheet as of March 31, 2019. These amounts are based on the present value of the remaining minimum lease payments of our various operating leases globally that have terms greater than 1 year. This new lease guidance will not have a material impact to our income statement going forward.

We didn't know whether that was going to run its course end of February, end of March, end of April. There was just that uncertainty when we last spoke. So it ended up playing out, but as of the middle of March, this is when we basically saw ourselves work that out of the system. And then that combined with, as we've talked, a very strong theater business, which tended to have a shorter lead time from when the shows are announced to onsale the play, also augmented the quarter for us. 
It was a particularly -- speaking then on international, it was a particularly strong quarter for international. That business continues to grow well as we follow the concerts globally and build the business in the markets where we have a strong concerts presence and less of a historical Ticketmaster presence. I don't think we have anything structural to announce at this point, but certainly, our strategy remains on course to use the concerts as the flywheel and to have ticketing benefit from that activity.

We see those as a real great sweet spot of upcoming talent, huge piece of the youth culture. So it drives our sponsorship. Our data around that segment, those customers tend to go to shows by 6x versus a higher-end show at the arenas, you go 2x. So you get a real active, young audience when you're in the kind of the 500 to 6,000 seats.
They seem to be the new movie theater for every developer. So we have great opportunities to kind of leverage our content for more equity, more revenue, more of the pie in the right development. So I think we're at a really sweet spot where the live theater is the part that a lot of the developers, real estate, neighborhoods, city centers, they all want that venue to be part of their attraction in urban centers.

Now we've now seen it play out. It was on the positive end of the spectrum of what we had hoped for. And as we said, as of mid-July, Ticketmaster has sold 4 million more concert tickets for shows this year than it sold at this point last year. So that was definitely an unknown for us when we did the call in February. 
Another thing is on the concert side. I've said a few times that the theater side of the business in particular has been strong. And that tends to be shorter lead time. 
And then I think third is, overall, we've been very happy with the sell-through rates. As Michael mentioned, they have been very strong. You listen to other companies' calls and you hear concerns about the economic cycle. That was, again, an unknown to us. And I think that having sell-through rates that are at or above last year's across venue type and across ticket type has been something that's given us maybe still a lot better today than we did a few months ago."

I think on kind of our annual Investor Day we do in November, I mean, I had those numbers up on the slide again. I can't remember the precise number, but you can go back and look at that. The progress has been there year-over-year. So a few factors",605,"Yes. I think on kind of our annual Investor Day we do in November, I mean, I had those numbers up on the slide again. I can't remember the precise number, but you can go back and look at that. The progress has been there year-over-year. 
So a few factors. One, we just continually look at the demand on the secondary market over the last few years. As much as we've been increasing the P1s, the secondary business has also been growing. So we know there's $8 billion to $10 billion of opportunities still priced outside of the house from a consumer demand perspective. So we know we got years left, where we'll be sitting on this call telling you that we've slowly increased the price. And it's a slower process because the artist has to find that right balance between what he will charge that makes sense for his band and his brand and what the market will bear. There will always be some inefficiency. But great progress. The artist is much more -- the appetite is a lot larger now as we've moved forward and they see that kind of sunlight of what the artist -- or what the tickets are selling for. 
So we have a great opportunity to keep price in the front. I think we've talked about before that the great advantage of pricing the front is that you also then get some extra growth in the pot to reduce the pricing in the back. A problem in the concert business has never been to sell the first 30 rows, it's can you sell those final 30 rows and get that customer in the house and then they buy a beer and they drive your sponsorship and your data. 
So one of the reasons you see our revenue and our ticket sales continually grow, and we think, again, this will be a multiyear strategy for us, is we've been able to price the house better in the back, lower the price when it's needed to promote -- do some promotions, do what you can. Yet net overall, the artists still have higher growth, higher revenue for the whole house. 
So as more sophisticated pricing has come into effect, price the front of the house better, price the Tuesday different than a Friday, price the aisle seat different than the middle seat. All of the classic airlines will tell models of dynamic pricing, and all of those strategies have been slowly introduced and implemented. It's been driving our overall revenue as well as our throughput on the show, and then once they get in the show, all of those things we talked about how we monetize them. So we've been driving more tickets. 
I think our sell-through, we've been talking about closing the gap. Again, we have a multiyear runway of opportunity ahead because at the end of the day, the majority of shows still don't sell out. So we always have a lot of inventory to keep putting another person through the turnstile. And whether it's -- at 8:01, that ticket is worth 0. So as long as between the announcement and 7:59, we figured out how to monetize that customer at any price to get him through the door, the business continues to move. So we've been moving that number up over the last few years, I think, 1 or 2 points a year. And I think we said in November, we look to that to be a $100 million-plus opportunity as we put more people through the house over the next few years by pricing the house better."

We're in 42 markets where we have a Live Nation office where we're promoting the show. It is a global but a local business. You have to have boots on the ground to actually execute. 
So if you look at our business on a global perspective, historically, our European -- Western European, Canada, U.S. and Australia have been the traditional markets of a global business. And you've seen the last 5 years, whether it's South America, whether it's Asia or Eastern Europe, we've been slowly building out the infrastructure in those markets. We believe that the -- now that the artist is global in terms of when Drake drops a single tomorrow, that 19-year-old in Singapore, Colombia and Cape Town knows about it as well as that one in Detroit. 
So it is a fast expanding global business. Every major city in the world wants to be an entertainment capital and have Drake perform there. The infrastructure is being built. So you're going to see us continue to be aggressive in Asia, South America, India and Eastern Europe as those markets are becoming, every year, more legitimate. 
I think the Asia comment might have been driven by our BTS tour. It's a great success story. We're very proud to be part of that global tour, and that might be where the Asia comment came in. Overall, our Asia business is a growing business. We've been in China, Hong Kong and Singapore for years. We've been continually looking to grow those businesses, and we will over time."

Our concerts and sponsorship segments drove this growth a",828,"Good afternoon, and welcome to our first quarter 2019 conference call. 2019 is off to a strong start with our highest first quarter AOI ever at $115 million and with revenue up 17% to $1.7 billion. Our concerts and sponsorship segments drove this growth as both delivered record first quarter revenue and AOI.
More importantly, we have now booked enough concerts, sold enough tickets and secured enough sponsorship commitments to be confident the company will deliver double-digit AOI growth for the year. We continue to benefit from a global concerts industry that is structurally growing with strong tailwinds for both supply and demand. Our performance is further accelerated by our concert flywheel driving additional profitable growth in our on-site sponsorship and ticketing businesses. 
Starting with the concert business. We had almost 15 million fans attend our concerts during the first quarter, up 22% year-on-year, led by our arena and theater shows, which were each up over 1 million fans. As a result, revenue was up 27%, and we delivered our first positive AOI Q1 in our concerts business. This sets up the year well, and through mid-April, we have sold 49 million tickets for our concerts this year, up 5% year-on-year. At the same time, we have continued shifting to market-based pricing, growing the use of Platinum tickets.
Looking at our front-of-the-house tickets, amphitheater pricing is up double digit this year, and both amphitheater and arenas have seen an increase in pricing of over 30% across the past 2 years. Even with this improved pricing, we're not seeing any pullback in demand for concerts as sell-through rates continue to be strong globally across arenas, amphitheaters and stadiums, from the best seats in the front to lawn seats at our amphitheaters.
As we add fans, we continue to improve our on-site experience, which then drives fan spending. While we are just beginning the amphitheater season, I expect us to once again grow average per fan spend by $2 this year in our amphitheaters.
With our global concerts business set to deliver strong AOI growth again, concerts segment continues to be the engine that powers the overall growth of Live Nation.
In what is typically our lowest activity quarter for sponsorship, revenue was up 1% and AOI up 2%. Through mid-April, we are pacing double digits ahead of last year in committed net revenue, reaching over 80% of our target for the full year. I expect our growth to be driven again by festivals and large strategic sponsors. And we continue adding a number of these new partners, including Verizon in the U.S., Rogers Communications in Canada and Diageo in Europe. As a result, I expect we will deliver double-digit AOI growth in sponsorship again this year.
In the first quarter, Ticketmaster delivered its fourth highest transacted fee-bearing GTV quarter ever, trailing only Q1 2018 and Q4 in 2017 and '18. And while Ticketmaster was impacted in the quarter by a pull-forward of onsales since the fourth quarter of 2018, by mid-March, those sales trends had turned around and through mid-April, Ticketmaster has sold 4 million more concert tickets for shows this year than at the same time last year. 
Putting aside quarterly fluctuations, every metric including global GTV, ticket sales, clients served and leading digital ticket functionality demonstrates that Ticketmaster is the most effective marketplace to sell tickets to fans. Our road map at Ticketmaster remains very clear and focused: deploy digital ticketing at scale and establish the foundation for direct relationships with our fans, which will improve the fan experience, provide opportunities for content, venue operators and sponsors to deliver greater ongoing value to the live event fan. 
As part of this, we remain on track to have Presence installed at over 500 venues with more than 135 million fans entering via this system this year. And following our successful first year of digital ticketing with the NFL, we are seeing more teams shift to a pure digital model, up to 7 teams this year from 2 last year. 
In summary, I expect Ticketmaster, for the full year, to deliver GTV and AOI growth while significantly expanding our digital ticketing footprint.
I am pleased with our first quarter results as a start to what we expect to be another record year in 2019. All of our key indicators speak to continued strong consumer demand for our concerts: our attendance growth in the first quarter, acceptance of market pricing and solid sales for upcoming shows. As a result, we see an acceleration of our growth in Q2 with overall AOI increase in the high teens and each division delivering double-digit AOI growth for the quarter. The combination of this near-term view plus concert ticket sales for the year, sponsorship commitments and continued success of the Ticketmaster platform gives us confidence that Live Nation will deliver double-digit AOI growth for the full year. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Joe to take you through more additional details."
384687,611073964,1724378,"Live Nation Entertainment, Inc., Q1 2019 Earnings Call, May 02, 2019",2019-05-02,"Earnings Calls","Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Michael. Looking at our business segments. First, concerts. In the first quarter, Live Nation promoted 8,000 concerts for nearly 15 million fans worldwide, increases of 12% and 22%, respectively. Fan growth was strong across both North America and",663,"Thanks, Michael. Looking at our business segments. First, concerts. In the first quarter, Live Nation promoted 8,000 concerts for nearly 15 million fans worldwide, increases of 12% and 22%, respectively. Fan growth was strong across both North America and international markets. Led in particular by arena show count and fan growth along with increased theater activity. 
Looking to the full year. We expect to grow our fan base in both North America and internationally with arenas, theaters and clubs and festivals leading this growth. Our international markets are looking particularly strong, driven also by a resurgence of stadium shows for 2019, including such artists as BTS, Ed Sheeran and Metallica. In total, we expect overall fan growth for the year in the mid-single digits, which combined with our pricing initiatives and on-site spending programs, we expect will deliver strong double-digit AOI growth for the concert segment. 
Turning to our sponsorship and advertising business. AOI was up 2% for the quarter and revenue was up 1%. Sponsorship is the only segment where we saw a material FX impact in the quarter, and excluding FX, AOI was up 7% and revenue was up 4%. Given over 85% of our sponsorship is recognized in the second through fourth quarters, it is our committed net revenue that is our most important indicator at this point of the year. And as Michael indicated, our committed net revenue is up double digits at over 80% of our target for the year. 
We're seeing consistent growth with both North America and international markets, pacing double digits ahead of this point last year, as are both online advertising and sponsorship. And within sponsorship, festival sponsorship per fan and revenue from strategic sponsors are both projected to be up double digits for the year. This broad growth gives us confidence that we will deliver another year of double-digit AOI growth in sponsorship. 
Finally, ticketing. Ticketmaster's global GTV in the first quarter was $7.6 billion, down 10% year-on-year. Both primary and secondary ticketing GTV were down similarly, and in both cases, concerts activity was the main driver. This is consistent with the general sales pattern we see with secondary where most activity is either immediately following the onsale or in the few weeks leading up to the show. So by accelerating concert onsales into the fourth quarter, we have the same impact on secondary sales.
As Michael indicated, our digital ticketing deployment is proceeding well, and we will evolve it to the next level with the NFL this year, shifting to encrypted barcodes as we continue to give content more control over how tickets are sold and managed. One of the key implications of digital ticketing is our ongoing shift to mobile ticketing with mobile ticket sales accounting for 46% of total ticket sales in the quarter and also driving a 40% increase in our installed app base to over 60 million. These app installs are critical as it gives us a real-time channel to our digital fans, enabling teams, artists, the venues and our brand partners to directly reach these fans.
As Michael noted, we expect we will see growth in fee-bearing GTV for the full year, which will deliver our full year AOI growth for ticketing in the mid-single digits.
In summary, following a successful first quarter, we're shaping up to accelerate this growth in the second quarter. This starts with increasing concert attendance, particularly in stadiums and theaters during the second quarter. And Q2 results will also benefit from a shift in some of our major festival activity from Q3 into Q2, which helps both concerts and sponsorship. 
Looking at the full year, given the strength of our leading indicators across concerts, sponsorship and ticketing, we are confident that we will again deliver double-digit AOI growth for the full year in the same range as we have grown over the past several years.
I will now turn the call over to Kathy to go through more on our financial results."
384687,611073964,1724378,"Live Nation Entertainment, Inc., Q1 2019 Earnings Call, May 02, 2019",2019-05-02,"Earnings Calls","Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Joe, and good afternoon, everyone. Our key financial highlights for the first quarter of 2019. Our revenue was up 17% to $1.7 billion. AOI increased 1% to $115 million. And as of March 31, our total deferred revenue related to future shows was $1.",590,"Thanks, Joe, and good afternoon, everyone. Our key financial highlights for the first quarter of 2019. Our revenue was up 17% to $1.7 billion. AOI increased 1% to $115 million. And as of March 31, our total deferred revenue related to future shows was $1.8 billion, up slightly compared to last year.
The increase in revenue was driven primarily by concerts, which grew by 27% as a result of increased activity in arenas and theaters globally, which also then delivered the increase in AOI for the quarter. Overall, our AOI for the first quarter finished stronger than what we had expected a few months ago due to a few items. In concerts globally, we had a large number of theater shows that performed strongly, and we also saw a shift of some artist performance payments from Q1 into Q2. And in ticketing, our ticket sales accelerated starting in mid-March, as Michael noted.
Our operating loss was $24 million in the first quarter driven by higher depreciation and amortization along with acquisition-related costs. And our net loss for the quarter was $52 million compared to $34 million in the prior year as a result of the higher operating loss.
For the quarter, accretion of redeemable noncontrolling interest was $12 million. For the full year, we currently estimate that this accretion will be approximately $62 million with the remainder for the year fairly consistent across the quarters. For Q1, we had a negative FX impact on revenue and AOI, up about 3%. And based on the rates now, we expect both to be impacted negatively by approximately 1% in the second quarter.
Amortization of non-recoupable ticketing contracted advances in 2019 is expected to be in line with the last few years of expense.
Turning to our balance sheet. As of March 31, we had total cash of $2.7 billion, including $848 million in client cash and $1.4 billion in net concert event-related cash, leaving a free cash balance of $382 million. Net cash provided by operating activities was $469 million as compared to $775 million last year, impacted by the shift to ticket sales into the fourth quarter of 2018. Free cash flow adjusted was $3 million driven by the timing of distribution to noncontrolling interest. We currently expect that free cash flow as a percentage of AOI for full year 2019 will be in line with the prior year. 
Our total capital expenditures for the quarter were $62 million with 60% spent on revenue-generating items. We currently expect that our capital expenditures for the full year will be approximately $310 million with more than half on revenue-generating addition. The increase in capital expenditures as compared to last year is driven by concerts as we continue to expand our venue footprint globally and improve our existing venues to drive fan satisfaction, ancillary spend and sponsorship opportunities. 
Our total debt as of March 31 was $2.8 billion with a weighted average cost of 4.3%. We implemented the new lease accounting guidance in the first quarter of 2019, so you will see operating lease assets of $1.1 billion and total operating lease liabilities of $1.2 billion on our balance sheet as of March 31, 2019. These amounts are based on the present value of the remaining minimum lease payments of our various operating leases globally that have terms greater than 1 year. This new lease guidance will not have a material impact to our income statement going forward.

We didn't know whether that was going to run its course end of February, end of March, end of April. There was just that uncertainty when we last spoke. So it ended up playing out, but as of the middle of March, this is when we basically saw ourselves work that out of the system. And then that combined with, as we've talked, a very strong theater business, which tended to have a shorter lead time from when the shows are announced to onsale the play, also augmented the quarter for us. 
It was a particularly -- speaking then on international, it was a particularly strong quarter for international. That business continues to grow well as we follow the concerts globally and build the business in the markets where we have a strong concerts presence and less of a historical Ticketmaster presence. I don't think we have anything structural to announce at this point, but certainly, our strategy remains on course to use the concerts as the flywheel and to have ticketing benefit from that activity. 
In terms of Rock in Rio, we have certain options. As you said, nothing has been done at this point. I don't think we're in a position to comment on what we're going to do or not do until we make a final determination."

Obviously, the buildup is later. So ergo, the big surprise, which I'm surprised it was such a big surprise, was in the concerts segment in terms of very strong revenue growth. I guess when you did your fourth quarter, did you not quite have the visibility on that at the time? Or how do you see that playing out versus what you've originally expected?"

Now we've now seen it play out. It was on the positive end of the spectrum of what we had hoped for. And as we said, as of mid-July, Ticketmaster has sold 4 million more concert tickets for shows this year than it sold at this point last year. So that was definitely an unknown for us when we did the call in February. 
Another thing is on the concert side. I've said a few times that the theater side of the business in particular has been strong. And that tends to be shorter lead time. 
And then I think third is, overall, we've been very happy with the sell-through rates. As Michael mentioned, they have been very strong. You listen to other companies' calls and you hear concerns about the economic cycle. That was, again, an unknown to us. And I think that having sell-through rates that are at or above last year's across venue type and across ticket type has been something that's given us maybe still a lot better today than we did a few months ago."

I think on kind of our annual Investor Day we do in November, I mean, I had those numbers up on the slide again. I can't remember the precise number, but you can go back and look at that. The progress has been there year-over-year. So a few factors",605,"Yes. I think on kind of our annual Investor Day we do in November, I mean, I had those numbers up on the slide again. I can't remember the precise number, but you can go back and look at that. The progress has been there year-over-year. 
So a few factors. One, we just continually look at the demand on the secondary market over the last few years. As much as we've been increasing the P1s, the secondary business has also been growing. So we know there's $8 billion to $10 billion of opportunities still priced outside of the house from a consumer demand perspective. So we know we got years left, where we'll be sitting on this call telling you that we've slowly increased the price. And it's a slower process because the artist has to find that right balance between what he will charge that makes sense for his band and his brand and what the market will bear. There will always be some inefficiency. But great progress. The artist is much more -- the appetite is a lot larger now as we've moved forward and they see that kind of sunlight of what the artist -- or what the tickets are selling for. 
So we have a great opportunity to keep price in the front. I think we've talked about before that the great advantage of pricing the front is that you also then get some extra growth in the pot to reduce the pricing in the back. A problem in the concert business has never been to sell the first 30 rows, it's can you sell those final 30 rows and get that customer in the house and then they buy a beer and they drive your sponsorship and your data. 
So one of the reasons you see our revenue and our ticket sales continually grow, and we think, again, this will be a multiyear strategy for us, is we've been able to price the house better in the back, lower the price when it's needed to promote -- do some promotions, do what you can. Yet net overall, the artists still have higher growth, higher revenue for the whole house. 
So as more sophisticated pricing has come into effect, price the front of the house better, price the Tuesday different than a Friday, price the aisle seat different than the middle seat. All of the classic airlines will tell models of dynamic pricing, and all of those strategies have been slowly introduced and implemented. It's been driving our overall revenue as well as our throughput on the show, and then once they get in the show, all of those things we talked about how we monetize them. So we've been driving more tickets. 
I think our sell-through, we've been talking about closing the gap. Again, we have a multiyear runway of opportunity ahead because at the end of the day, the majority of shows still don't sell out. So we always have a lot of inventory to keep putting another person through the turnstile. And whether it's -- at 8:01, that ticket is worth 0. So as long as between the announcement and 7:59, we figured out how to monetize that customer at any price to get him through the door, the business continues to move. So we've been moving that number up over the last few years, I think, 1 or 2 points a year. And I think we said in November, we look to that to be a $100 million-plus opportunity as we put more people through the house over the next few years by pricing the house better."

We're in 42 markets where we have a Live Nation office where we're promoting the show. It is a global but a local business. You have to have boots on the ground to actually execute. 
So if you look at our business on a global perspective, historically, our European -- Western European, Canada, U.S. and Australia have been the traditional markets of a global business. And you've seen the last 5 years, whether it's South America, whether it's Asia or Eastern Europe, we've been slowly building out the infrastructure in those markets. We believe that the -- now that the artist is global in terms of when Drake drops a single tomorrow, that 19-year-old in Singapore, Colombia and Cape Town knows about it as well as that one in Detroit. 
So it is a fast expanding global business. Every major city in the world wants to be an entertainment capital and have Drake perform there. The infrastructure is being built. So you're going to see us continue to be aggressive in Asia, South America, India and Eastern Europe as those markets are becoming, every year, more legitimate. 
I think the Asia comment might have been driven by our BTS tour. It's a great success story. We're very proud to be part of that global tour, and that might be where the Asia comment came in. Overall, our Asia business is a growing business. We've been in China, Hong Kong and Singapore for years. We've been continually looking to grow those businesses, and we will over time."

We delivered strong growth for the quarter with AOI up 23% and revenue up 10%. Each of our businesses contributed to these results with all of them delivering double-digit AOI growth for the quarter. 
We continue to benefit from a strong tailwind in the Live Event experience-based economy of today. The global ticket revenue for our concerts is up 16% for the first half of the year as we continue to see a strong supply of artists touring matched with global consumer demand. And within this, the ticket revenue from concerts outside of our top 100 artists is up 32% for the year, demonstrating that demand for live music is strong and growing from the largest stadiums to local clubs. We have created the most scalable and unparalleled business model in the industry within a platform that brings over 570 million fans in 45 countries to live events each year. With our key metrics in concerts, sponsorships and ticketing all pacing well ahead of last year, I am confident [ that ] 2019, the company will deliver again double-digit AOI growth.
Starting with the concert business through mid-July, we have sold over 73 million tickets for shows this year, up 6% or 4.5 million tickets from the same point last year. This puts us on track to have nearly 100 million fans at attend 38,000 concerts this year. 
In the second quarter, we had 27 million fans attend 10,000 shows, up 7% and 9%, respectively, from last year, and by far, our largest second quarter ever. As a result, for the quarter, we grew AOI by 33%; and revenue, 11%. As we have discussed, our international business has been particularly strong through the first half, growing our fan base by 2.5 million fans, the greatest growth coming from our arenas, stadiums and theaters. Globally, we continue to work with artists to enable them to capture the value from their shows to optimize pricing and Ticketmaster tools such as Platinum, we delivered over 500 million in incremental value to artists since the start of 2018. 
To this, we have seen no reduction in demand and global sell-through rates across stadiums, arenas and amphitheaters is as strong as ever. Further, at our venues, we continue to increase average fan per spend by enhancing the fan experience, providing reasons for them to arrive earlier, spend less time in line and improving the quality of food and beverage offerings. As a result, I expect our ancillary revenue per fan in amphitheaters to grow by $2.50 this year. 
Overall, we continue to see tremendous opportunity for us to grow our global market share, both organically and via targeted acquisitions. Our just-announced acquisition of OCESA in Mexico, one of the top global promoters, continues our mission of building a global fan base of 125 million. All this gives me confidence we'll again deliver double-digit AOI growth in our concerts business this year.
Our sponsorship business leverages our platform of nearly 100 million fans, providing brands a unique opportunity to connect directly with music fans at scale. By continuing to attract new brand partners and expand relationships with existing ones, we grew our AOI by 12% in the second quarter and revenue by 8%. Much of the growth continues to come from large strategic partnerships, all of whom utilize a range of our assets and span multiple years. This group accounts for over 70% of our total sponsorship, and a number of these sponsors has grown double digits this year as we have added companies such as Adobe, Hyundai and Google. As a result, the committed spend by these strategic sponsors is also up double digits through mid-July. 
Globally, festivals, in particular, provide an attractive opportunity for sponsors to engage fans at times when they were receptive to brand messages. And once again, our festival sponsorship is on track for revenue per fan to be up double digits this year. Thanks, in part, to a growing portfolio of marquee festival, including Lollapalooza, Rock in Rio and EDC, which are in particular interest to brand partners. 
Given the attractiveness of our platforms to brand and a double-digit growth and committed net revenue for the year, I expect we will deliver sponsorship AOI growth in the mid- to high teens for the full year. 
Ticketmaster continues to demonstrate that it's the best global ticketing marketplace for venues, teams, artist and fan with fee-bearing GTV growth of 13% at constant currency in the quarter, making our highest second quarter GTV ever. As a result, Ticketmaster's AOI for the quarter was up 20%; and revenue, up 6%.
The addition of major clients such as Event Co in Canada, J Center in the U.S., O2 in Prague and 150 other worldwide further validates that Ticketmaster is content's choice as the most effective ticketing platform in the world with leading technology to service venues, sports and artists with an efficient marketplace that attract and convert ticket buyers. 
Our industry-leading digital ticketing rollout is ahead of schedule with Presence now expected to be [indiscernible] [ double ] over 600 venues this year, including over 80% of major sports, buildings and Live Nation amphitheaters. And as a ticket is increasingly digital, we have focused on ensuring our mobile marketplace are the easiest place for fans to buy and manage their tickets. Because of that, we have seen a continued shift to mobile ticket buying up 22% from the second quarter last year and now account for 45% of global ticket sales to date.
At the same time, we've improved in our customer purchase process with increased conversion both across mobile and desktop. As Ticketmaster continues to be an effective and efficient ticketing solution for content and fans alike, I expect to continue growing its GTV and result in AOI this year and into the future.
In summary, 2019 is on track for the company to deliver double-digit AOI growth along with strong gains and revenue. Each of our businesses is contributing to this success, starting with the concerts as we put on more shows for more fans, then continuing to monetize fans at the concert, sell more tickets to the shows and further deliver value to our sponsors from our platform of nearly 100 million fans. 
With that, I will turn our call over to Joe to take you through more details of our performance this quarter."

Live Nation concerts AOI in the second quarter was up 33%, and revenue was up 11%. Driving that growth, concerts had its highest second quarter attendance ever, and for the first half of the year, we saw fan growth across most of our venue types with arenas, stadiums and theaters, each have over 1 million fans. And as Michael mentioned, we continue to optimize pricing, providing incremental artist revenue of $500 million since the start of [ 2018 ] across all of our shows, driven largely by an increase of over 30% in front-of-house pricing at amphitheaters and arenas globally. 
Looking to the full year. We have already sold over 73 million tickets for shows this year through mid-July, an increase of 6% and we now expect nearly 100 million fans for the full year. Our pipeline of arena and amphitheater shows continues to be very robust with over 5,600 shows booked through mid-July, up 3% compared to this point last year. 
Our international stadiums and arenas are looking particularly strong driven by acts such as Metallica in Europe, Post Malone in Australia and Black Pink in Asia.
While our amphitheaters are not driving potential fan growth this year after attendance growth of over 2.5 million last year, we continue to be very successful in driving ancillary spend per fan. In festival, tickets are up double digits through mid-July, and we expect this to continue for the full year as our 100-plus festivals host over 10 million fans this year.
We expect our theater attendance to be up over 20% for the year, in part benefiting from investments to expand our footprint with new venues such as the film or New Orleans and the observatory venues in Southern California added to our portfolio in the first half of the year.
With good visibility into the full year, based on mid-single-digit growth in global fan attendance and continued operating improvements, we are confident that we will again deliver double-digit growth in concerts AOI for the full year.
Turning to our sponsorship and advertising business. Our sponsorship AOI was up 12% in the second quarter while revenue was up 8%. Most of our growth came from the sponsorship side, fairly evenly split between North America and international markets. As part of the growth in strategic sponsors that Michael mentioned, we have also successfully expanded the breadth of our sponsorship categories with the addition of nontraditional categories such as fashion, beauty and retail, including companies such as American Apparel, Pantene and Asics. 
Additionally, investments in unique sponsored experiences within our venues, including VIP viewing decks and Instagram [indiscernible] installations have drawn new sponsors and increased spending from existing ones. Collectively, this has led to 18% year-to-date growth in sponsored committed net revenue for the year. And based on this progress, we are confident we will deliver mid- to high-teens AOI growth in sponsorship for the full year.
Finally, Ticketmaster. For the second quarter, Ticketmaster AOI was up 20% and revenue up at 6%. Looking at our GTV growth in constant currency, total global fee-bearing GTV was up 13% for the quarter and is now flat for the full year with second quarter growth making up for the full forward from Q1 into Q4 of last year. The increase in global fee-bearing GTV was driven predominantly by a 15% increase in primary GTV. And international was the main driver of our fee-bearing GTV growth, up over 40% for the quarter. 
Concerts activity continues to drive our growth accounting for over 90% of primary GTV growth in the quarter, heavily benefiting from our theaters, festivals and arena activity. Secondary GTV was flat in the second quarter with increased activity in sports, offset by lower concerts volume and overall lower international activity. Based on our results for the first half and our second half pipeline, we expect Ticketmaster to deliver mid-single-digit AOI growth for the full year. 
In summary, Q2 was an outstanding quarter, demonstrating the continued strong supply and demand dynamics across all of our businesses. 
Looking at the third quarter. Comping $50 million in AOI growth last year in Q3 and impacted by some shifts in concert timing into Q2, we expect Q3 to be up mid- to high-single digits. And as we continue driving growth across all of our businesses, we remain confident that 2019 will be another year of record top line and AOI results. 
I will now turn the call over to Kathy to go through more on our financial results."

All of our segments contributed to the increase in revenue with concerts up $259 million or 11%, driven primarily by international arenas and stadiums, along with the global, theater and festival activity. 
Sponsorship was up 8% due to growth from strategic sponsors and festivals in both North America and Europe. And ticketing revenue increased 6% due to higher primary ticket fees. 
Our AOI growth of 23% for the second quarter was again driven by all 3 segments with each delivering double-digit growth for the quarter. Concerts increased by 33%, ticketing was up 20% and sponsorship grew by 12% from the growth drivers discussed above. Our operating income increased by 27% for the second quarter over last year driven by the increase in AOI, which also drove the increase in net income for the quarter to $103 million as compared to $69 million last year. For the quarter, accretion of redeemable noncontrolling interest was $14 million with a diluted earnings per share of $0.41. 
Turning to our balance sheet. As of June 30, we had total cash of $2.3 billion, including $777 million in ticketing client cash and $1.1 billion in net concert event-related cash, leaving free cash of $363 million. Net cash provided by operating activities for the first 6 months was $293 million compared to $520 million last year due to the timing of event-related working capital. 
Free cash flow adjusted for the 6 months was in line with last year at $223 million driven by our AOI increase, the timing of distribution to noncontrolling interest partners and the maintenance capital expenditures for the first half of the year. As of June 30, our total deferred revenue related to future shows was $1.6 billion, consistent with 2018. 
Our total capital expenditures were $139 million for the first 6 months with 57% spent on revenue-generating items. Our total debt as of June 30 was $2.8 billion, and our weighted average cost of debt was 4.3%. For the remainder of 2019, we continue to expect that accretion of redeemable noncontrolling interests will be $62 million for the full year with the remainder fairly evenly split between the remaining quarters. In Q2, we had a negative FX impact on revenue and AOI of about 2%. And based on current rates, we expect them both to be impacted negatively by 1% to 2% in the third quarter. We expect total capital expenditures for 2019 to be approximately $310 million with more than half on revenue-generating CapEx. And we currently expect that free cash flow adjusted for the full year as a percentage of our 2019 AOI will be in the mid-50s. 
Thank you for joining us today. Operator, we will now open the call for questions."

It obviously makes our entry into Brazil, give us some complete kind of an instant office sponsorship division to start building on our own concert business. 
And then as well, you mentioned it, we'll -- as we try to do with all of our bolt-on, our acquisitions, we ultimately look forward to getting synergy. In this case, we don't have Ticketmaster there, and we'll look to launch that to support our services in Brazil from there. 
Also, we don't usually talk about these until we close them because of the size, we did this in this case. So we're not going to give much detail today on the assessment in the numbers. Those will all be out on the 8-K when we actually close the deal. And [indiscernible] is a public company. You can probably go figure it out.

I think sports is in the sixth or seventh inning in terms of how they price the show or their content, how do they maximize it with the right combination of pricing. 
I think music is in a -- the second, third inning on how do we best price our events, how do we price the Thursday show versus a Saturday, an aisle seat versus the middle, at the beginning and the end subscriptions, all the different ways that the artist can engage. So Platinum is a -- I think has been super tool to tell the artist that there's a great way on your onsell to get a higher price for a good seat, and that's been very successful. And I think that it's still early days in the overall business. If you look at how much is still being traded on secondary, I would say there's still a huge opportunity for the artists to keep looking at finding that fine line between with his brand and message needs to be in with his pricing strategy will be, and we still think there is many innings left to capture more. 
And when I say capture more, I always want to remind people, it's capture more, but at sometimes, it's price it less at the back. So it's a holistic strategy right on that dynamic pricing and how do you sell out the house by the time the performer's on stage, and that's a holistic perspective that they're getting smarter every day on."

We delivered strong growth for the quarter with AOI up 23% and revenue up 10%.

We delivered strong growth for the quarter with AOI up 23% and revenue up 10%. Each of our businesses contributed to these results with all of them delivering double-digit AOI growth for the quarter. 
We continue to benefit from a strong tailwind in the Live Event experience-based economy of today. The global ticket revenue for our concerts is up 16% for the first half of the year as we continue to see a strong supply of artists touring matched with global consumer demand. And within this, the ticket revenue from concerts outside of our top 100 artists is up 32% for the year, demonstrating that demand for live music is strong and growing from the largest stadiums to local clubs. We have created the most scalable and unparalleled business model in the industry building a platform that brings over 570 million fans in 45 countries to live events each year. With our key metrics in concerts, sponsorships and ticketing all pacing well ahead of last year, I am confident in 2019 the company will deliver again double-digit AOI growth.
Starting with the concert business. Through mid-July, we have sold over 73 million tickets for shows this year, up 6% or 4.5 million tickets from the same point last year. This puts us on track to have nearly 100 million fans attend 38,000 concerts this year. 
In the second quarter, we had 27 million fans attend 10,000 shows, up 7% and 9%, respectively, from last year, and by far, our largest second quarter ever. As a result, for the quarter, we grew AOI by 33%; and revenue, 11%. As we have discussed, our international business has been particularly strong through the first half, growing our fan base by 2.5 million fans, the greatest growth coming from our arenas, stadiums and theaters. Globally, we continue to work with artists to enable them to capture the value from their shows to optimize pricing and Ticketmaster tools such as Platinum. We delivered over 500 million in incremental value to artists since the start of 2018. 
To this, we have seen no reduction in demand, and global sell-through rates across stadiums, arenas and amphitheaters is as strong as ever. Further, at our venues, we continue to increase average fan per spend by enhancing the fan experience, providing reasons for them to arrive earlier, spend less time in line and improving the quality of food and beverage offerings. As a result, I expect our ancillary revenue per fan in amphitheaters to grow by $2.50 this year. 
Overall, we continue to see tremendous opportunity for us to grow our global market share, both organically and via targeted acquisitions. Our just-announced acquisition of OCESA in Mexico, one of the top global promoters, continues our mission of building a global fan base of 125 million. All this gives me confidence we'll again deliver double-digit AOI growth in our concerts business this year.
Our sponsorship business leverages our platform of nearly 100 million fans, providing brands a unique opportunity to connect directly with music fans at scale. By continuing to attract new brand partners and expand relationships with existing ones, we grew our AOI by 12% in the second quarter and revenue by 8%. Much of the growth continues to come from large strategic partnerships, all of whom utilize a range of our assets and span multiple years. This group accounts for over 70% of our total sponsorship, and a number of these sponsors has grown double digits this year as we have added companies such as Adobe, Hyundai and Google. As a result, the committed spend by these strategic sponsors is also up double digits through mid-July. 
Globally, festivals, in particular, provide an attractive opportunity for sponsors to engage fans at a time when they were receptive to brand messages. And once again, our festival sponsorship is on track for revenue per fan to be up double digits this year, thanks in part to a growing portfolio of marquee festival, including Lollapalooza, Rock in Rio and EDC, which are in particular interest to brand partners. 
Given the attractiveness of our platforms to brand and a double-digit growth and committed net revenue for the year, I expect we will deliver sponsorship AOI growth in the mid- to high teens for the full year. 
Ticketmaster continues to demonstrate that it's the best global ticketing marketplace for venues, teams, artist and fan with fee-bearing GTV growth of 13% at constant currency in the quarter, making our highest second quarter GTV ever. As a result, Ticketmaster's AOI for the quarter was up 20%; and revenue, up 6%.
The addition of major clients such as evenko in Canada, Chase Center in the U.S., O2 in Prague and 150 other worldwide further validates that Ticketmaster is content's choice as the most effective ticketing platform in the world with leading technology to service venues, sports teams and artists with an efficient marketplace that attracts and converts ticket buyers. 
Our industry-leading digital ticketing rollout is ahead of schedule with Presence now expected to be installed at over 600 venues this year, including over 80% of major sports, buildings and Live Nation amphitheaters. 
And as the ticket is increasingly digital, we have focused on ensuring our mobile marketplace are the easiest place for fans to buy and manage their tickets. Because of that, we have seen a continued shift to mobile ticket-buying, up 22% from the second quarter last year and now account for 45% of global ticket sales to date. At the same time, we've improved in our customer purchase process with increased conversion both across mobile and desktop. As Ticketmaster continues to be an effective and efficient ticketing solution for content and fans alike, I expect to continue growing its GTV and resulting AOI this year and into the future.
In summary, 2019 is on track for the company to deliver double-digit AOI growth along with strong gains in revenue. Each of our businesses is contributing to this success, starting with the concerts as we put on more shows for more fans, then continuing to monetize fans at the concert, sell more tickets to the shows and further deliver value to our sponsors from our platform of nearly 100 million fans. 
With that, I will turn our call over to Joe to take you through more details of our performance this quarter."

Getting into our business segments. First, concerts. Live Nation concerts AOI in the second quarter was up 33%, and revenue was up 11%. Driving that growth, concerts had its highest second quarter attendance ever, and for the first half",755,"Thanks, Michael. 
Getting into our business segments. First, concerts. Live Nation concerts AOI in the second quarter was up 33%, and revenue was up 11%. Driving that growth, concerts had its highest second quarter attendance ever, and for the first half of the year, we saw fan growth across most of our venue types with arenas, stadiums and theaters, each up over 1 million fans. And as Michael mentioned, we continue to optimize pricing, providing incremental artist revenue of $500 million since the start of 2018 across all of our shows driven largely by an increase of over 30% in front-of-house pricing at amphitheaters and arenas globally. 
Looking to the full year. We have already sold over 73 million tickets for shows this year through mid-July, an increase of 6%, and we now expect nearly 100 million fans for the full year. Our pipeline of arena and amphitheater shows continues to be very robust with over 5,600 shows booked through mid-July, up 3% compared to this point last year. 
Our international stadiums and arenas are looking particularly strong driven by acts such as Metallica in Europe, Post Malone in Australia, and BLACKPINK in Asia.
While our amphitheaters are not driving substantial fan growth this year after attendance growth of over 2.5 million last year, we continue to be very successful in driving ancillary spend per fan. In festival, tickets are up double digits through mid-July, and we expect this to continue for the full year as our 100-plus festivals host over 10 million fans this year.
We expect our theater attendance to be up over 20% for the year, in part benefiting from investments to expand our footprint with new venues such as the Fillmore in New Orleans and the observatory venues in Southern California added to our portfolio in the first half of the year.
With good visibility into the full year, based on mid-single-digit growth in global fan attendance and continued operating improvements, we are confident that we will again deliver double-digit growth in concerts AOI for the full year.
Turning to our sponsorship and advertising business. Our sponsorship AOI was up 12% in the second quarter while revenue was up 8%. Most of our growth came from the sponsorship side, fairly evenly split between North America and international markets. As part of the growth in strategic sponsors that Michael mentioned, we have also successfully expanded the breadth of our sponsorship categories with the addition of nontraditional categories such as fashion, beauty and retail, including companies such as American Apparel, Pantene and ASICS. 
Additionally, investments in unique sponsored experiences within our venues, including VIP viewing decks and Instagram-worthy installations have drawn new sponsors and increased spending from existing ones. Collectively, this has led to 18% year-to-date growth in sponsor-committed net revenue for the year. And based on this progress, we are confident we will deliver mid- to high-teens AOI growth in sponsorship for the full year.
Finally, Ticketmaster. For the second quarter, Ticketmaster AOI was up 20%, and revenue up at 6%. Looking at our GTV growth in constant currency, total global fee-bearing GTV was up 13% for the quarter and is now flat for the full year, with second quarter growth making up for the full forward from Q1 into Q4 of last year. The increase in global fee-bearing GTV was driven predominantly by a 15% increase in primary GTV, and international was the main driver of our fee-bearing GTV growth, up over 40% for the quarter.  
Concerts activity continues to drive our growth accounting for over 90% of primary GTV growth in the quarter, heavily benefiting from our theaters, festivals and arena activity. Secondary GTV was flat in the second quarter, with increased activity in sports offset by lower concerts volume and overall lower international activity. Based on our results for the first half and our second half pipeline, we expect Ticketmaster to deliver mid-single-digit AOI growth for the full year. 
In summary, Q2 was an outstanding quarter, demonstrating the continued strong supply and demand dynamics across all of our businesses. 
Looking at the third quarter, comping $50 million in AOI growth last year in Q3 and impacted by some shifts in concert timing into Q2, we expect Q3 to be up mid- to high single digits. And as we continue driving growth across all of our businesses, we remain confident that 2019 will be another year of record top line and AOI results. 
I will now turn the call over to Kathy to go through more on our financial results."

Our key financial highlights for the second quarter of 2019. Our revenue was up 10% to $3.2 billion, AOI increased 23% to $319 million, and operating income increased 27% to $172 million. All of our segments contributed to the increase in revenue, with concerts up $259 million or 11% driven primarily by international arenas and stadiums, along with the global, theater and festival activity. 
Sponsorship was up 8% due to growth from strategic sponsors and festivals in both North America and Europe, and ticketing revenue increased 6% due to higher primary ticket fees. 
Our AOI growth of 23% for the second quarter was again driven by all 3 segments, with each delivering double-digit growth for the quarter. Concerts increased by 33%, ticketing was up 20%, and sponsorship grew by 12% from the growth drivers discussed above. Our operating income increased by 27% for the second quarter over last year driven by the increase in AOI, which also drove the increase in net income for the quarter to $103 million as compared to $69 million last year. For the quarter, accretion of redeemable noncontrolling interest was $14 million with a diluted earnings per share of $0.41. 
Turning to our balance sheet. As of June 30, we had total cash of $2.3 billion, including $777 million in ticketing client cash and $1.1 billion in net concert event-related cash, leaving free cash of $363 million. Net cash provided by operating activities for the first 6 months was $293 million compared to $520 million last year due to the timing of event-related working capital. 
Free cash flow adjusted for the 6 months was in line with last year at $223 million driven by our AOI increase, the timing of distributions to noncontrolling interest partners and the maintenance capital expenditures for the first half of the year. As of June 30, our total deferred revenue related to future shows was $1.6 billion, consistent with 2018. 
Our total capital expenditures were $139 million for the first 6 months, with 57% spent on revenue-generating items. Our total debt as of June 30 was $2.8 billion, and our weighted average cost of debt was 4.3%. 
For the remainder of 2019, we continue to expect that accretion of redeemable noncontrolling interests will be $62 million for the full year, with the remainder fairly evenly split between the remaining quarters. 
In Q2, we had a negative FX impact on revenue and AOI of about 2%, and based on current rates, we expect them both to be impacted negatively by 1% to 2% in the third quarter. 
We expect total capital expenditures for 2019 to be approximately $310 million, with more than half on revenue-generating CapEx. And we currently expect that free cash flow adjusted for the full year as a percentage of our 2019 AOI will be in the mid-50s.

It obviously makes our entry into Brazil give us some complete kind of an instant office sponsorship division to start building on our own concert business. 
And then as well, you mentioned it, we'll -- as we try to do with all of our bolt-on, our acquisitions, we ultimately look for ticketing synergy. In this case, we don't have Ticketmaster there, and we'll look to launch that to support our services in Brazil from there. 
OCESA, we don't usually talk about these until we close them because of the size we did this -- in this case. So we're not going to give much details today on OCESA and the numbers. Those will all be out in an 8-K when we actually close the deal. And CIE is a public company, so you can probably go figure it out a lot of the math from the other side. But we're excited. They're a strong business vertical like ourselves, with ticketing venues, sponsorship, festivals and tourings, so -- and they've been our partner for years, and we're excited now to have them part of our platform."

But also we've been -- we've always said one of the great realities of Live Nation is we diversify ourselves on a global and venue platform. So sometimes international happens to be a little hotter than the U.S. Amps are bigger than stadiums or stadiums might be bigger than arenas that year. And that's how we've always diversified ourselves, where 1 may be 50 shows less than the year before but the other segment or the other country happens to be on fire.

I think music is in a -- the second, third inning on how do we best price our event, how do we price a Thursday show versus a Saturday, an aisle seat versus the middle, at the beginning and the end subscriptions, all the different ways that the artist can engage. 
So Platinum is a -- I think been super tool to tell the artist that there's a great way on your on-sale to get a higher price for a good seat. And that's been very successful. And I think that is still early days in the overall business. 
If you look at how much is still being traded on secondary, I would say there's still a huge opportunity for the artists to keep looking at -- finding that fine line between what his brand message needs to be and what his pricing strategy will be. And we still think there's many innings left to capture more. 
And when I say capture more, I always want to remind people, it's capture more, but sometimes, it's price it less than the back. So it's a holistic strategy right on that dynamic, pricing, on how do you sell out the house by the time the performer's on stage.

We delivered strong growth for the quarter with AOI up 23% and revenue up 10%. Each of our businesses contributed to these results with all of them delivering double-digit AOI growth for the quarter. 
We continue to benefit from a strong tailwind in the Live Event experience-based economy of today. The global ticket revenue for our concerts is up 16% for the first half of the year as we continue to see a strong supply of artists touring matched with global consumer demand. And within this, the ticket revenue from concerts outside of our top 100 artists is up 32% for the year, demonstrating that demand for live music is strong and growing from the largest stadiums to local clubs. We have created the most scalable and unparalleled business model in the industry building a platform that brings over 570 million fans in 45 countries to live events each year. With our key metrics in concerts, sponsorships and ticketing all pacing well ahead of last year, I am confident in 2019 the company will deliver again double-digit AOI growth.
Starting with the concert business. Through mid-July, we have sold over 73 million tickets for shows this year, up 6% or 4.5 million tickets from the same point last year. This puts us on track to have nearly 100 million fans attend 38,000 concerts this year. 
In the second quarter, we had 27 million fans attend 10,000 shows, up 7% and 9%, respectively, from last year, and by far, our largest second quarter ever. As a result, for the quarter, we grew AOI by 33%; and revenue, 11%. As we have discussed, our international business has been particularly strong through the first half, growing our fan base by 2.5 million fans, the greatest growth coming from our arenas, stadiums and theaters. Globally, we continue to work with artists to enable them to capture the value from their shows to optimize pricing and Ticketmaster tools such as Platinum. We delivered over 500 million in incremental value to artists since the start of 2018. 
To this, we have seen no reduction in demand, and global sell-through rates across stadiums, arenas and amphitheaters is as strong as ever. Further, at our venues, we continue to increase average fan per spend by enhancing the fan experience, providing reasons for them to arrive earlier, spend less time in line and improving the quality of food and beverage offerings. As a result, I expect our ancillary revenue per fan in amphitheaters to grow by $2.50 this year. 
Overall, we continue to see tremendous opportunity for us to grow our global market share, both organically and via targeted acquisitions. Our just-announced acquisition of OCESA in Mexico, one of the top global promoters, continues our mission of building a global fan base of 125 million. All this gives me confidence we'll again deliver double-digit AOI growth in our concerts business this year.
Our sponsorship business leverages our platform of nearly 100 million fans, providing brands a unique opportunity to connect directly with music fans at scale. By continuing to attract new brand partners and expand relationships with existing ones, we grew our AOI by 12% in the second quarter and revenue by 8%. Much of the growth continues to come from large strategic partnerships, all of whom utilize a range of our assets and span multiple years. This group accounts for over 70% of our total sponsorship, and a number of these sponsors has grown double digits this year as we have added companies such as Adobe, Hyundai and Google. As a result, the committed spend by these strategic sponsors is also up double digits through mid-July. 
Globally, festivals, in particular, provide an attractive opportunity for sponsors to engage fans at a time when they were receptive to brand messages. And once again, our festival sponsorship is on track for revenue per fan to be up double digits this year, thanks in part to a growing portfolio of marquee festival, including Lollapalooza, Rock in Rio and EDC, which are in particular interest to brand partners. 
Given the attractiveness of our platforms to brand and a double-digit growth and committed net revenue for the year, I expect we will deliver sponsorship AOI growth in the mid- to high teens for the full year. 
Ticketmaster continues to demonstrate that it's the best global ticketing marketplace for venues, teams, artist and fan with fee-bearing GTV growth of 13% at constant currency in the quarter, making our highest second quarter GTV ever. As a result, Ticketmaster's AOI for the quarter was up 20%; and revenue, up 6%.
The addition of major clients such as evenko in Canada, Chase Center in the U.S., O2 in Prague and 150 other worldwide further validates that Ticketmaster is content's choice as the most effective ticketing platform in the world with leading technology to service venues, sports teams and artists with an efficient marketplace that attracts and converts ticket buyers. 
Our industry-leading digital ticketing rollout is ahead of schedule with Presence now expected to be installed at over 600 venues this year, including over 80% of major sports, buildings and Live Nation amphitheaters. 
And as the ticket is increasingly digital, we have focused on ensuring our mobile marketplace are the easiest place for fans to buy and manage their tickets. Because of that, we have seen a continued shift to mobile ticket-buying, up 22% from the second quarter last year and now account for 45% of global ticket sales to date. At the same time, we've improved in our customer purchase process with increased conversion both across mobile and desktop. As Ticketmaster continues to be an effective and efficient ticketing solution for content and fans alike, I expect to continue growing its GTV and resulting AOI this year and into the future.
In summary, 2019 is on track for the company to deliver double-digit AOI growth along with strong gains in revenue. Each of our businesses is contributing to this success, starting with the concerts as we put on more shows for more fans, then continuing to monetize fans at the concert, sell more tickets to the shows and further deliver value to our sponsors from our platform of nearly 100 million fans. 
With that, I will turn our call over to Joe to take you through more details of our performance this quarter."

Getting into our business segments. First, concerts. Live Nation concerts AOI in the second quarter was up 33%, and revenue was up 11%. Driving that growth, concerts had its highest second quarter attendance ever, and for the first half",755,"Thanks, Michael. 
Getting into our business segments. First, concerts. Live Nation concerts AOI in the second quarter was up 33%, and revenue was up 11%. Driving that growth, concerts had its highest second quarter attendance ever, and for the first half of the year, we saw fan growth across most of our venue types with arenas, stadiums and theaters, each up over 1 million fans. And as Michael mentioned, we continue to optimize pricing, providing incremental artist revenue of $500 million since the start of 2018 across all of our shows driven largely by an increase of over 30% in front-of-house pricing at amphitheaters and arenas globally. 
Looking to the full year. We have already sold over 73 million tickets for shows this year through mid-July, an increase of 6%, and we now expect nearly 100 million fans for the full year. Our pipeline of arena and amphitheater shows continues to be very robust with over 5,600 shows booked through mid-July, up 3% compared to this point last year. 
Our international stadiums and arenas are looking particularly strong driven by acts such as Metallica in Europe, Post Malone in Australia, and BLACKPINK in Asia.
While our amphitheaters are not driving substantial fan growth this year after attendance growth of over 2.5 million last year, we continue to be very successful in driving ancillary spend per fan. In festival, tickets are up double digits through mid-July, and we expect this to continue for the full year as our 100-plus festivals host over 10 million fans this year.
We expect our theater attendance to be up over 20% for the year, in part benefiting from investments to expand our footprint with new venues such as the Fillmore in New Orleans and the observatory venues in Southern California added to our portfolio in the first half of the year.
With good visibility into the full year, based on mid-single-digit growth in global fan attendance and continued operating improvements, we are confident that we will again deliver double-digit growth in concerts AOI for the full year.
Turning to our sponsorship and advertising business. Our sponsorship AOI was up 12% in the second quarter while revenue was up 8%. Most of our growth came from the sponsorship side, fairly evenly split between North America and international markets. As part of the growth in strategic sponsors that Michael mentioned, we have also successfully expanded the breadth of our sponsorship categories with the addition of nontraditional categories such as fashion, beauty and retail, including companies such as American Apparel, Pantene and ASICS. 
Additionally, investments in unique sponsored experiences within our venues, including VIP viewing decks and Instagram-worthy installations have drawn new sponsors and increased spending from existing ones. Collectively, this has led to 18% year-to-date growth in sponsor-committed net revenue for the year. And based on this progress, we are confident we will deliver mid- to high-teens AOI growth in sponsorship for the full year.
Finally, Ticketmaster. For the second quarter, Ticketmaster AOI was up 20%, and revenue up at 6%. Looking at our GTV growth in constant currency, total global fee-bearing GTV was up 13% for the quarter and is now flat for the full year, with second quarter growth making up for the full forward from Q1 into Q4 of last year. The increase in global fee-bearing GTV was driven predominantly by a 15% increase in primary GTV, and international was the main driver of our fee-bearing GTV growth, up over 40% for the quarter.  
Concerts activity continues to drive our growth accounting for over 90% of primary GTV growth in the quarter, heavily benefiting from our theaters, festivals and arena activity. Secondary GTV was flat in the second quarter, with increased activity in sports offset by lower concerts volume and overall lower international activity. Based on our results for the first half and our second half pipeline, we expect Ticketmaster to deliver mid-single-digit AOI growth for the full year. 
In summary, Q2 was an outstanding quarter, demonstrating the continued strong supply and demand dynamics across all of our businesses. 
Looking at the third quarter, comping $50 million in AOI growth last year in Q3 and impacted by some shifts in concert timing into Q2, we expect Q3 to be up mid- to high single digits. And as we continue driving growth across all of our businesses, we remain confident that 2019 will be another year of record top line and AOI results. 
I will now turn the call over to Kathy to go through more on our financial results."

Our key financial highlights for the second quarter of 2019. Our revenue was up 10% to $3.2 billion, AOI increased 23% to $319 million, and operating income increased 27% to $172 million.

Our key financial highlights for the second quarter of 2019. Our revenue was up 10% to $3.2 billion, AOI increased 23% to $319 million, and operating income increased 27% to $172 million. All of our segments contributed to the increase in revenue, with concerts up $259 million or 11% driven primarily by international arenas and stadiums, along with the global, theater and festival activity. 
Sponsorship was up 8% due to growth from strategic sponsors and festivals in both North America and Europe, and ticketing revenue increased 6% due to higher primary ticket fees. 
Our AOI growth of 23% for the second quarter was again driven by all 3 segments, with each delivering double-digit growth for the quarter. Concerts increased by 33%, ticketing was up 20%, and sponsorship grew by 12% from the growth drivers discussed above. Our operating income increased by 27% for the second quarter over last year driven by the increase in AOI, which also drove the increase in net income for the quarter to $103 million as compared to $69 million last year. For the quarter, accretion of redeemable noncontrolling interest was $14 million with a diluted earnings per share of $0.41. 
Turning to our balance sheet. As of June 30, we had total cash of $2.3 billion, including $777 million in ticketing client cash and $1.1 billion in net concert event-related cash, leaving free cash of $363 million. Net cash provided by operating activities for the first 6 months was $293 million compared to $520 million last year due to the timing of event-related working capital. 
Free cash flow adjusted for the 6 months was in line with last year at $223 million driven by our AOI increase, the timing of distributions to noncontrolling interest partners and the maintenance capital expenditures for the first half of the year. As of June 30, our total deferred revenue related to future shows was $1.6 billion, consistent with 2018. 
Our total capital expenditures were $139 million for the first 6 months, with 57% spent on revenue-generating items. Our total debt as of June 30 was $2.8 billion, and our weighted average cost of debt was 4.3%. 
For the remainder of 2019, we continue to expect that accretion of redeemable noncontrolling interests will be $62 million for the full year, with the remainder fairly evenly split between the remaining quarters. 
In Q2, we had a negative FX impact on revenue and AOI of about 2%, and based on current rates, we expect them both to be impacted negatively by 1% to 2% in the third quarter. 
We expect total capital expenditures for 2019 to be approximately $310 million, with more than half on revenue-generating CapEx. And we currently expect that free cash flow adjusted for the full year as a percentage of our 2019 AOI will be in the mid-50s.

And then as well, you mentioned it, we'll -- as we try to do with all of our bolt-on, our acquisitions, we ultimately look for ticketing synergy. In this case, we don't have Ticketmaster there, and we'll look to launch that to support our services in Brazil from there.

When we gave you the $2 at the beginning of May, that was based on plans in place. Doesn't really had shows to speak of in our amps yet. Now that we've had a fair number of shows, we're comfortable giving more specific guidance based on what are results through the first 1/3 plus of our shows have been. 
As it relates to Presence, 100% agree, Presence is a great opportunity for us to engage fans onsite, and the per-cap spending will absolutely be part of that. But it's not this year. That's -- as we're getting it fully rolled out and the promotion's built, that will be more of a next-year and go-forward opportunity."

I think sports is in the sixth or seventh inning in terms of how do they price the show or their content, how do they maximize it with the right combination of pricing. 
I think music is in a -- the second, third inning on how do we best price our event, how do we price a Thursday show versus a Saturday, an aisle seat versus the middle, at the beginning and the end subscriptions, all the different ways that the artist can engage. 
So Platinum is a -- I think been super tool to tell the artist that there's a great way on your on-sale to get a higher price for a good seat. And that's been very successful. And I think that is still early days in the overall business. 
If you look at how much is still being traded on secondary, I would say there's still a huge opportunity for the artists to keep looking at -- finding that fine line between what his brand message needs to be and what his pricing strategy will be. And we still think there's many innings left to capture more. 
And when I say capture more, I always want to remind people, it's capture more, but sometimes, it's price it less than the back. So it's a holistic strategy right on that dynamic, pricing, on how do you sell out the house by the time the performer's on stage.

So we just want to continually remind that at all levels going to a live show is an incredible experience for the fan. And we're seeing more and more club shows, theaters, small shows. You look at things like Springsteen on Broadway, new ideas, new residencies, Madonna going out there this year doing smaller theaters at a higher price. So I think you're just going to see more and more ways artists will look at traditional venues, smaller venues, unique venues, sizes to keep bringing their art to the consumer in a unique location, and that's huge opportunity for us."

We delivered strong growth for the quarter with AOI up 23% and revenue up 10%. Each of our businesses contributed to these results with all of them delivering double-digit AOI growth for the q",1066,"Good afternoon, and welcome to our second quarter 2019 call. 
We delivered strong growth for the quarter with AOI up 23% and revenue up 10%. Each of our businesses contributed to these results with all of them delivering double-digit AOI growth for the quarter. 
We continue to benefit from a strong tailwind in the Live Event experience-based economy of today. The global ticket revenue for our concerts is up 16% for the first half of the year as we continue to see a strong supply of artists touring matched with global consumer demand. And within this, the ticket revenue from concerts outside of our top 100 artists is up 32% for the year, demonstrating that demand for live music is strong and growing from the largest stadiums to local clubs. We have created the most scalable and unparalleled business model in the industry building a platform that brings over 570 million fans in 45 countries to live events each year. With our key metrics in concerts, sponsorships and ticketing all pacing well ahead of last year, I am confident in 2019 the company will deliver again double-digit AOI growth.
Starting with the concert business. Through mid-July, we have sold over 73 million tickets for shows this year, up 6% or 4.5 million tickets from the same point last year. This puts us on track to have nearly 100 million fans attend 38,000 concerts this year. 
In the second quarter, we had 27 million fans attend 10,000 shows, up 7% and 9%, respectively, from last year, and by far, our largest second quarter ever. As a result, for the quarter, we grew AOI by 33%; and revenue, 11%. As we have discussed, our international business has been particularly strong through the first half, growing our fan base by 2.5 million fans, the greatest growth coming from our arenas, stadiums and theaters. Globally, we continue to work with artists to enable them to capture the value from their shows to optimize pricing and Ticketmaster tools such as Platinum. We delivered over 500 million in incremental value to artists since the start of 2018. 
To this, we have seen no reduction in demand, and global sell-through rates across stadiums, arenas and amphitheaters is as strong as ever. Further, at our venues, we continue to increase average fan per spend by enhancing the fan experience, providing reasons for them to arrive earlier, spend less time in line and improving the quality of food and beverage offerings. As a result, I expect our ancillary revenue per fan in amphitheaters to grow by $2.50 this year. 
Overall, we continue to see tremendous opportunity for us to grow our global market share, both organically and via targeted acquisitions. Our just-announced acquisition of OCESA in Mexico, one of the top global promoters, continues our mission of building a global fan base of 125 million. All this gives me confidence we'll again deliver double-digit AOI growth in our concerts business this year.
Our sponsorship business leverages our platform of nearly 100 million fans, providing brands a unique opportunity to connect directly with music fans at scale. By continuing to attract new brand partners and expand relationships with existing ones, we grew our AOI by 12% in the second quarter and revenue by 8%. Much of the growth continues to come from large strategic partnerships, all of whom utilize a range of our assets and span multiple years. This group accounts for over 70% of our total sponsorship, and a number of these sponsors has grown double digits this year as we have added companies such as Adobe, Hyundai and Google. As a result, the committed spend by these strategic sponsors is also up double digits through mid-July. 
Globally, festivals, in particular, provide an attractive opportunity for sponsors to engage fans at a time when they were receptive to brand messages. And once again, our festival sponsorship is on track for revenue per fan to be up double digits this year, thanks in part to a growing portfolio of marquee festival, including Lollapalooza, Rock in Rio and EDC, which are in particular interest to brand partners. 
Given the attractiveness of our platforms to brand and a double-digit growth and committed net revenue for the year, I expect we will deliver sponsorship AOI growth in the mid- to high teens for the full year. 
Ticketmaster continues to demonstrate that it's the best global ticketing marketplace for venues, teams, artist and fan with fee-bearing GTV growth of 13% at constant currency in the quarter, making our highest second quarter GTV ever. As a result, Ticketmaster's AOI for the quarter was up 20%; and revenue, up 6%.
The addition of major clients such as evenko in Canada, Chase Center in the U.S., O2 in Prague and 150 other worldwide further validates that Ticketmaster is content's choice as the most effective ticketing platform in the world with leading technology to service venues, sports teams and artists with an efficient marketplace that attracts and converts ticket buyers. 
Our industry-leading digital ticketing rollout is ahead of schedule with Presence now expected to be installed at over 600 venues this year, including over 80% of major sports, buildings and Live Nation amphitheaters. 
And as the ticket is increasingly digital, we have focused on ensuring our mobile marketplace are the easiest place for fans to buy and manage their tickets. Because of that, we have seen a continued shift to mobile ticket-buying, up 22% from the second quarter last year and now account for 45% of global ticket sales to date. At the same time, we've improved in our customer purchase process with increased conversion both across mobile and desktop. As Ticketmaster continues to be an effective and efficient ticketing solution for content and fans alike, I expect to continue growing its GTV and resulting AOI this year and into the future.
In summary, 2019 is on track for the company to deliver double-digit AOI growth along with strong gains in revenue. Each of our businesses is contributing to this success, starting with the concerts as we put on more shows for more fans, then continuing to monetize fans at the concert, sell more tickets to the shows and further deliver value to our sponsors from our platform of nearly 100 million fans. 
With that, I will turn our call over to Joe to take you through more details of our performance this quarter."

Getting into our business segments. First, concerts. Live Nation concerts AOI in the second quarter was up 33%, and revenue was up 11%. Driving that growth, concerts had its highest second quarter attendance ever, and for the first half of the year, we saw fan growth across most of our venue types with arenas, stadiums and theaters, each up over 1 million fans. And as Michael mentioned, we continue to optimize pricing, providing incremental artist revenue of $500 million since the start of 2018 across all of our shows driven largely by an increase of over 30% in front-of-house pricing at amphitheaters and arenas globally. 
Looking to the full year. We have already sold over 73 million tickets for shows this year through mid-July, an increase of 6%, and we now expect nearly 100 million fans for the full year. Our pipeline of arena and amphitheater shows continues to be very robust with over 5,600 shows booked through mid-July, up 3% compared to this point last year. 
Our international stadiums and arenas are looking particularly strong driven by acts such as Metallica in Europe, Post Malone in Australia, and BLACKPINK in Asia.
While our amphitheaters are not driving substantial fan growth this year after attendance growth of over 2.5 million last year, we continue to be very successful in driving ancillary spend per fan. In festival, tickets are up double digits through mid-July, and we expect this to continue for the full year as our 100-plus festivals host over 10 million fans this year.
We expect our theater attendance to be up over 20% for the year, in part benefiting from investments to expand our footprint with new venues such as the Fillmore in New Orleans and the observatory venues in Southern California added to our portfolio in the first half of the year.
With good visibility into the full year, based on mid-single-digit growth in global fan attendance and continued operating improvements, we are confident that we will again deliver double-digit growth in concerts AOI for the full year.
Turning to our sponsorship and advertising business. Our sponsorship AOI was up 12% in the second quarter while revenue was up 8%. Most of our growth came from the sponsorship side, fairly evenly split between North America and international markets. As part of the growth in strategic sponsors that Michael mentioned, we have also successfully expanded the breadth of our sponsorship categories with the addition of nontraditional categories such as fashion, beauty and retail, including companies such as American Apparel, Pantene and ASICS. 
Additionally, investments in unique sponsored experiences within our venues, including VIP viewing decks and Instagram-worthy installations have drawn new sponsors and increased spending from existing ones. Collectively, this has led to 18% year-to-date growth in sponsor-committed net revenue for the year. And based on this progress, we are confident we will deliver mid- to high-teens AOI growth in sponsorship for the full year.
Finally, Ticketmaster. For the second quarter, Ticketmaster AOI was up 20%, and revenue up at 6%. Looking at our GTV growth in constant currency, total global fee-bearing GTV was up 13% for the quarter and is now flat for the full year, with second quarter growth making up for the full forward from Q1 into Q4 of last year. The increase in global fee-bearing GTV was driven predominantly by a 15% increase in primary GTV, and international was the main driver of our fee-bearing GTV growth, up over 40% for the quarter.  
Concerts activity continues to drive our growth accounting for over 90% of primary GTV growth in the quarter, heavily benefiting from our theaters, festivals and arena activity. Secondary GTV was flat in the second quarter, with increased activity in sports offset by lower concerts volume and overall lower international activity. Based on our results for the first half and our second half pipeline, we expect Ticketmaster to deliver mid-single-digit AOI growth for the full year. 
In summary, Q2 was an outstanding quarter, demonstrating the continued strong supply and demand dynamics across all of our businesses. 
Looking at the third quarter, comping $50 million in AOI growth last year in Q3 and impacted by some shifts in concert timing into Q2, we expect Q3 to be up mid- to high single digits. And as we continue driving growth across all of our businesses, we remain confident that 2019 will be another year of record top line and AOI results. 
I will now turn the call over to Kathy to go through more on our financial results."

Our key financial highlights for the second quarter of 2019. Our revenue was up 10% to $3.2 billion, AOI increased 23% to $319 million, and operating income increased 27% to $172 million. All of our segments contributed to the increase in revenue, with concerts up $259 million or 11% driven primarily by international arenas and stadiums, along with the global, theater and festival activity. 
Sponsorship was up 8% due to growth from strategic sponsors and festivals in both North America and Europe, and ticketing revenue increased 6% due to higher primary ticket fees. 
Our AOI growth of 23% for the second quarter was again driven by all 3 segments, with each delivering double-digit growth for the quarter. Concerts increased by 33%, ticketing was up 20%, and sponsorship grew by 12% from the growth drivers discussed above. Our operating income increased by 27% for the second quarter over last year driven by the increase in AOI, which also drove the increase in net income for the quarter to $103 million as compared to $69 million last year. For the quarter, accretion of redeemable noncontrolling interest was $14 million with a diluted earnings per share of $0.41. 
Turning to our balance sheet. As of June 30, we had total cash of $2.3 billion, including $777 million in ticketing client cash and $1.1 billion in net concert event-related cash, leaving free cash of $363 million. Net cash provided by operating activities for the first 6 months was $293 million compared to $520 million last year due to the timing of event-related working capital. 
Free cash flow adjusted for the 6 months was in line with last year at $223 million driven by our AOI increase, the timing of distributions to noncontrolling interest partners and the maintenance capital expenditures for the first half of the year. As of June 30, our total deferred revenue related to future shows was $1.6 billion, consistent with 2018. 
Our total capital expenditures were $139 million for the first 6 months, with 57% spent on revenue-generating items. Our total debt as of June 30 was $2.8 billion, and our weighted average cost of debt was 4.3%. 
For the remainder of 2019, we continue to expect that accretion of redeemable noncontrolling interests will be $62 million for the full year, with the remainder fairly evenly split between the remaining quarters. 
In Q2, we had a negative FX impact on revenue and AOI of about 2%, and based on current rates, we expect them both to be impacted negatively by 1% to 2% in the third quarter. 
We expect total capital expenditures for 2019 to be approximately $310 million, with more than half on revenue-generating CapEx. And we currently expect that free cash flow adjusted for the full year as a percentage of our 2019 AOI will be in the mid-50s.

It obviously makes our entry into Brazil give us some complete kind of an instant office sponsorship division to start building on our own concert business. 
And then as well, you mentioned it, we'll -- as we try to do with all of our bolt-on, our acquisitions, we ultimately look for ticketing synergy. In this case, we don't have Ticketmaster there, and we'll look to launch that to support our services in Brazil from there.

I think sports is in the sixth or seventh inning in terms of how do they price the show or their content, how do they maximize it with the right combination of pricing. 
I think music is in a -- the second, third inning on how do we best price our event, how do we price a Thursday show versus a Saturday, an aisle seat versus the middle, at the beginning and the end subscriptions, all the different ways that the artist can engage. 
So Platinum is a -- I think been super tool to tell the artist that there's a great way on your on-sale to get a higher price for a good seat. And that's been very successful. And I think that is still early days in the overall business. 
If you look at how much is still being traded on secondary, I would say there's still a huge opportunity for the artists to keep looking at -- finding that fine line between what his brand message needs to be and what his pricing strategy will be. And we still think there's many innings left to capture more. 
And when I say capture more, I always want to remind people, it's capture more, but sometimes, it's price it less than the back. So it's a holistic strategy right on that dynamic, pricing, on how do you sell out the house by the time the performer's on stage. And that's a holistic perspective that they're getting smarter every day on."

Very few investors even acknowledge it or talk about it. We just want to talk about the A shows. 
So we just want to continually remind that at all levels going to a live show is an incredible experience for the fan. And we're seeing more and more club shows, theaters, small shows. You look at things like Springsteen on Broadway, new ideas, new residencies, Madonna going out there this year doing smaller theaters at a higher price. So I think you're just going to see more and more ways artists will look at traditional venues, smaller venues, unique venues, sizes to keep bringing their art to the consumer in a unique location, and that's huge opportunity for us."

Live Nation delivered its highest AOI quarter ever as we continue to scale our business globally and build on favorable supply demand dynamics for live music. AOI grew 11% in the quart",1132,"Good afternoon, and welcome to our third quarter 2019 conference call. Live Nation delivered its highest AOI quarter ever as we continue to scale our business globally and build on favorable supply demand dynamics for live music. AOI grew 11% in the quarter and 13% year-to-date, outperforming a record Q3 last year and demonstrating the strength of our business model in today's experience-based economy. 
And in response to recent questions about consumer demand, we are seeing fans spending as strong as ever. In September, our amphitheater and arena shows actually closed stronger than shows in September of last year. And our fans spending on site also showed ongoing growth. 
At the center of our flywheel, the demand for live events continues to grow as we have sold 92 million tickets through mid-October, up 6% or 5 million tickets compared to this time last year. And we are on track to nearly 100 million fans attending the show this year. 
And we have translated the fan growth into strong AOI gains on on-site spending, sponsorship and ticketing. As a result, as we wrap up the successful 2019, we are confident that we will delivered double-digit AOI growth for the year. 
Looking at our concerts business, year-to-date, we have had 73 million fans attend over 26,000 concerts, delivering 333 million in AOI, which is up 17% from last year. 
Our international business has been particularly robust this year, delivering much of the fan growth with strong year for stadiums and theaters, while in the U.S., our arena and theater activity was also up. 
As we have grown our show volume and the breath of artists we work with, we've also been more effective in pricing tickets closer to the market value, particularly with the platinum pricing tool. So far this year, we have had over 3,000 arena and amphitheater shows use platinum tickets with a 54% increase in the number of platinum tickets sold per show. 
Looking at our venue operations, we have furthered our focus on the fan experience, improving our hospitality across the board, from our food and beverage offering to our own experience to VIP options. As a result, we have increased our average revenue per fan by $2.50 and our amphitheaters to over $29. We're also increasing fans spending at festivals, theaters and clubs. As we continue building our expertise on on-site execution, we are finding more opportunities to build new venues to take of operations of existing venues. And since the start of this year we have added 36 venues to our portfolio. Ranging from the Brooklyn Bowls in New York and Las Vegas to the Danforth Music Hall in Toronto and Sports Palace in Belgium. As a result, we are confident in the success of our concert flywheel for 2019. We will promote more shows, reach more fans, price more effectively and provide a better fan experience at our venues, which will then drive double-digit AOI growth for the business year. 
Turning to sponsorship. With the first days of Rock in Rio and a strong growth across our entire sponsorship platform, our high-margin sponsorship business delivered 18% AOI growth for the quarter and 13% year-to-date. We are the global leader in music sponsorship, delivering the unique value proposition of nearly 100 million fans on-site from brands looking to make a more direct connection with their customers. As part of this, we continue to innovate new ways for brands to interact with fans on-site at our venues and festivals. With new programs such as the Bud Light branded photo installation at our amphitheaters or the Revlon roller rink at Lollapalooza. As a result, sponsorship revenue has grown 11% year-to-date at our venues while festival sponsorship has grown 31% year-to-date. 
More broadly, growth is driven by our strategic sponsors, all of whom utilize a range of assets and spend multiple years. Revenue from this group, which collectively accounted for 70% of our total sponsorship revenue, has grown 15% year-to-date. With over 95% of our expected sponsorship revenue for 2019 now contracted, we are confident that we will deliver sponsorship AOI growth in the mid-teens for the full year. 
Ticketmaster generated the highest AOI quarter ever, up 20% from last year and was 6% growth year-to-date, as every quarter in 2019 is one of the top 10 GTV quarters ever. This growth continues to provide Ticketmaster scale to invest in the evolution from paper tickets to digital, which is being demanded by venues and content that are seeking greater control of their tickets and looking to develop a more direct connection with fans. 
Our presence for [indiscernible] is pacing ahead of schedule, and we expect digital ticketing to be installed at over 700 venues, representing 120 million tickets by the end of this year. And over 60% of the fans at digital-enabled events now are entering with their mobile devices. And digital adoption is even greater in the NFL with 10 teams have now eliminated paper tickets and over 90% of fans from those games are using their mobile phones to get in. Digital ticketing has expanded our engagement with fans, even Ticketmaster more direct connection, providing for more effective marketing and targeted offers. Ticketmaster app is now regularly in the top 10 ranking for entertainment in the Apple App Store, driving a 30% increase in app downloads this year. This, combined with continued improvements in our mobile web experience, has led to further growth in mobile transactions, now accounting for 46% of ticket purchases globally, up 15% over last year. Digital ticketing is a strong demonstration of what Ticketmaster can be, providing the best ticketing platform for venues by delivering value well beyond the sale of the ticket but, at the same time, giving fans an ever improving mobile-led purchasing and management experience. With these pieces coming together and continued growth in our concerts' activity, I expect we will deliver AOI growth to Ticketmaster in the mid-single digits for the full year. 
As we approach the end of 2019, we are confident that our strong performance will deliver another record year of top line and AOI growth. All of our businesses, concerts, sponsorship and ticketing have delivered growth year-to-date, and based on the key operating metrics, we expect each to deliver record revenue and AOI for the full year. With an early look to next year, our 2020 pipeline is up substantially, with over 1,500 stadium, arena and [indiscernible] shows booked already, up double digits in the same time last year. As we look forward, we continue seeing tremendous opportunity to expand our global concerts and festival business, drive further growth with on-site execution, sponsorship and ticketing. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Joe, who will take you through additional details on the quarter and the divisions."
384687,640840300,1849138,"Live Nation Entertainment, Inc., Q3 2019 Earnings Call, Oct 31, 2019",2019-10-31,"Earnings Calls","Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Michael. Getting into our business segments, first, concerts. Over the combined past 2 quarters, which represent our core concert season, AOI was up 9% and revenue up 2% year-on-year as we grew attendance 73 million fans at over 26,000 shows, up 3",804,"Thanks, Michael. Getting into our business segments, first, concerts. Over the combined past 2 quarters, which represent our core concert season, AOI was up 9% and revenue up 2% year-on-year as we grew attendance 73 million fans at over 26,000 shows, up 3% and 11%, respectively. As we discussed on our second quarter call, timing this year somewhat shifted to Q2 versus Q3, and as a result, for the third quarter, attendance was $2 million lower than last year, resulting in slightly lower revenue in AOI. 
Looking to [indiscernible] though, every indicator we have is of a robust growing business. Our September results actually came in above our expectations as our amphitheater and arena shows both strongly and fans spending remained at high levels. This overperformance in ticket sales in the last 2 weeks before the shows resulted in over $5 million of incremental AOI in our amphitheaters relative to how the shows closed last year, demonstrating the continued strength of the concert business. As Michael said, much of our fan growth this year has come from our international markets, particularly with their stadium lineup. At the same time, we are seeing growing demands throughout our broad portfolio of venue types. Globally, theater shows are our highest growth venues this year as fans continue to find new up-and-coming artists they're excited about. And festivals remain the ultimate fan experience, and with the addition of Rock in Rio, the continued globalization of the Lollapalooza brand and our over 100 other festivals, we expect attendance to be up double digits to over 10 million fans this year. Arenas continue to be the top place to see the biggest shows, and we expect to add another 1 million fans this year as fans came to see such top access, the Backstreet Boys, Ariana Grande and John Mayer. 
For the fourth quarter, we see continued fan growth, again, driven by our theater shows but with AOI growth impacted by the cost structure and a seasonally lower period for concert activity. So looking at the growth this year and an even bigger pipeline of shows for next year, combined with ongoing improvements in our on-site execution, we believe we are well set up for continued growth in concerts. 
Turning to our sponsorship and advertising business. In the third quarter, sponsorship AOI was up 18% and revenue was up 26%, primarily driven by on-site sponsorship as our brand partners continue to recognize the value of engaging with fans at our events. International markets drove the majority of our growth, with the first week of Rock in Rio contributing to our performance this quarter. And given the 14% growth in sponsor committed revenue for the year, I'm confident we will deliver mid-teens AOI growth in sponsorship for the full year. 
Finally, Ticketmaster. For the quarter, Ticketmaster AOI was up 20%, and revenue was up 5%. Global GTV was up 4% for the quarter, driven by fee-bearing GTV, which was up 5%. As with our concerts business, international drove our ticketing world in the quarter with its fee-bearing GTV up 19%. Global lead primary GTV was up 6% for the quarter while secondary GTV was flat. And as in the past, concerts drove most of our primary GTV growth. In secondary, we saw growth in sports, particularly the NFL, the lower activity North America concerts, again, consistent with the concerts timing we have discussed. As another sign of success for the Ticketmaster platform, our open distribution strategy continues selling more tickets for clients off platform, up over 30%, with 15 million tickets sold year-to-date. And to save you the question on margin, yes, we are up a fair bit this quarter due in part to continued improvements in operational areas such as search marketing and also because of some insurance recovery for the data breach issue last year. But our overall focus remains on growing the cash profitability of the ticketing business not being margin-focused, which is how we have consistently grown the business over the past several years and expect to continue being successful going forward. 
In summary, we are confident that 2019 will be another year of record revenue and AOI results overall and for each of our businesses. We are also making progress in completing [indiscernible] acquisition. In August, we submitted the necessary request for approval to the 2 key regulatory agencies in Mexico and are working through their process. And in September, [indiscernible] received shareholder approval for the transaction. And in the timing of the regulatory process, which is basically how many rounds of questions do they need to ask, we expect to complete the transaction between December and February, and we'll provide updates as we have more information to share. 
I will now turn the call over to Kathy to go through more on our financial results."

Our key financial highlights for the third quarter of 2019, our revenue was down 2% to $3.8 billion, AOI increased 11% to $427 million, and operating income increased 11% to $260 million. Our revenue decline in th",828,"Thanks, Joe and good afternoon, everyone. Our key financial highlights for the third quarter of 2019, our revenue was down 2% to $3.8 billion, AOI increased 11% to $427 million, and operating income increased 11% to $260 million. Our revenue decline in the quarter was primarily driven by a foreign exchange negative impact, and without this, our revenue in the quarter was flat to last year. This FX impact largely affected concert, which along with the timing shift in events from Q3 to Q2, drove a 4% decrease in revenue. Sponsorship revenue increased 26% from the addition of the first weekend of Rock in Rio in Brazil and overall growth in our on-site sponsorship program. And ticketing delivered a 5% increase in revenue as strong international activity drove a 4% increase in global GTV. AOI growth was 11% in the third quarter, driven mainly by sponsorship, which was up 18%, and ticketing, which was up 20%, as a result of the higher GTV along with an insurance recovery related to the third-party data breach incident last year that we had not expected to receive in the quarter. This insurance recovery, along with the strength in amphitheater show performance at the end of the quarter, as Joe noted previously, drove our outperformance relative to the AOI guidance we provided in July. Our operating income increased by 11% for the third quarter over last year, driven by the increase in AOI. For the quarter, accretion of redeemable noncontrolling interest was $24 million, and our diluted earnings per share was $0.71. 
Turning to our balance sheet. As of September 30, we had total cash of $1.8 billion, including $747 million in ticketing client cash and $642 million in net concert event-related cash, leaving free cash flow of $406 million. Net cash provided by operating activities for the 9 months was $33 million compared to $256 million last year, primarily due to the timing of when payment obligations redo. Free cash flow adjusted for the 9 months was $531 million, in line with last year's $529 million. Our conversion of AOI to free cash flow this year was reduced by the timing of distribution to our noncontrolling interest partners and an increase in maintenance CapEx. Our total capital expenditures were $225 million for the first 9 months, with $120 million spent on revenue-generating items. We expect total capital expenditures for 2019 to be approximately $325 million, with half going toward revenue-generating CapEx projects. 
As of September 30, our total deferred revenue related to future events was $952 million, an increase of 26% over the $759 million at this point last year. As of September 30, our total debt was $2.8 billion, and our weighted average cost of debt was 4.2%. And in October, we issued $950 million of 4.75% senior notes due 2027 and amended our senior secured credit facility, including a new $950 million term loan b. In addition, we have an undrawn $500 million revolver and a $400 million delayed draw term loan a. The proceeds from these transactions were used to redeem our $250 million of 5.375% senior notes due 2022 and to repay the outstanding balance of our existing term loan. After these repayments and other fees and expenses, we will have $527 million of incremental cash on the balance sheet. This will allow us to meet the cash portion of our purchase price for the OCESA acquisition, along with funding other acquisition opportunities. After this refinancing, our weighted average cost of debt remains at 4.2%, and we estimate that our interest expense will initially increase by approximately $10 million in the fourth quarter as a result of this refinance. 
For the remainder of 2019, we expect negative FX impacts of approximately 2% for revenue and 7% for AOI in the fourth quarter based on current rates. This FX headwind to AOI is largely driven by higher sponsorship activity in Brazil, Australia and New Zealand, which are all projected to be off 7% in the fourth quarter, and the euro and British pound, which are projected to be up 4% to 5%. Revenue has less of an impact as that mix is more heavily weighted to the U.S. We have factored this FX impact into our full year guidance that both Michael and Joe discussed, which takes into consideration our reported year-to-date results and our expectations for the fourth quarter. 
Consistent with where we projected it last quarter, we currently expect that free cash flow adjusted for the full year as a percentage of our 2019 AOI will be in the mid-50s. Our accretion of redeemable noncontrolling interest for the fourth quarter is projected to be approximately $26 million. And as a reminder, as you look forward to 2020, our Rock in Rio Festival, which spans Q3 and Q4 this year, is a biannual festival and will therefore not take place next year.

First of all, in terms of the pace and why is points faster, 2 things. One is I think we've been successful because of how effective it's been both with the NFL as well as our own buildings. We're just seeing tremendous demand by other venues that are saying we don't want to get left behind. We want to shift to digital so we can be getting that consumer data, understanding better control of the ticket as well. And our processes for deploying the systems actually going to the venues, changing the access control systems. We've gotten that working well very quickly. So I think over the course of this year to move our target for installations from 500 to 600, now to 700 installations. 
So in terms of the long-term impact, fairly just for Ticketmaster, it's a fundamentally different value proposition that it provides through its venues now. It's no longer just selling a ticket for providing data service. So that's an important piece of what Ticketmaster is. And then we talked through, there are a multitude of uses that the data will provide. It will support Ticketmaster and our concert business in terms of the effectiveness of their marketing, their ability to provide much more targeted information to fans based on what we think they're interested in. They will be very important to our venue strategy in terms of being able to make offers to people based on what their past behavior is. It will be important for sponsors, for them to directly tie in sponsor segments, customer segments and targets with 100 million people are on-site.

If you look at the average ticket pricing, the $60, average fans go to 2 or 3 shows a year. It's still a very affordable lifetime memory versus a trip or a vacation.

But the ticket take the kids to Taylor Swift's wife to show our strength, it's still a very, very affordable option that we know because they're lifetime moments and Kodak moments in your life, they still make sure they go to that local show at the arena or stadium or amphitheater because it's still incredibly affordable even if they're in a slight pullback on [indiscernible].

And year-over-year, we will make progress with the artists to keep pricing at better, taking some of that high-end opportunity into his pocket as well as lowering the price in the back end to get better full capacity. So overall, we think the show was still a very affordable option in life, cheaper than a good dinner in a big picture with great pricing opportunity given was still ticket is a very low priced option if you compare to an NBA game, a night at the theater, a front-row seat at an NFL game, et cetera.

Obviously, you emphasize some timing issues going into the quarter. The number of events in North America was up 15%. It looks like attendance for that was down close to 20%. So that's a pretty unusual mix for the third quarter. Does that reflect the lack of stadium shows basically? Or is there something else going on?"

It's the mix shift. So if you look at -- just to start, if you look at Q2 and Q3 together, because we told you we were going to have more rate, Q2 this year but those 2 quarters together, the core concerts segment, the concert business is up about 4% on a constant currency. So first of all, you move a few points on the revenue side just because of the currency fluctuation. But really, what's going on, as we've told you over the past 9 months, is we have fewer stadium shows. We have about 30 fewer stadium shows this year than last year. And we've had tremendous growth in our theater shows, in particular, both in North America and internationally. Those stadium shows that we don't have are the highest volume shows and also the highest average ticket price. Your theater shows are going to be a much lower average attendance and also a lower ticket price. So all you're seeing is some mix shift going on. There is across all of the venue types very strong sell-through demand. We talked about platinum tickets, we talked about all of the components. So the performance is very strong across the board. And then as we look at next year, we see a big uptick again in our stadium volume, which is what you get the first read on in the business. So we're doing very good. There's absolutely nothing you should read into other than timing."

Live Nation delivered its highest AOI quarter ever as we continue to scale our business globally and build on favorable supply/demand dynamics for live music. AOI grew 11% in the quart",1133,"Good afternoon, and welcome to our third quarter 2019 conference call. Live Nation delivered its highest AOI quarter ever as we continue to scale our business globally and build on favorable supply/demand dynamics for live music. AOI grew 11% in the quarter and 13% year-to-date, outperforming a record Q3 last year and demonstrating the strength of our business model in today's experience-based economy.
And in response to recent questions about consumer demand, we are seeing fan spending as strong as ever. In September, our amphitheater and arena shows actually closed stronger than shows in September of last year. And our fan spending on site also showed ongoing growth.
At the center of our flywheel, the demand for live events continues to grow as we have sold 92 million tickets through mid-October, up 6% or 5 million tickets compared to this time last year. And we are on track to nearly 100 million fans attending the show this year. And we have translated the fan growth into strong AOI gains on on-site spending, sponsorship and ticketing. As a result, as we wrap up the successful 2019, we are confident that we will deliver double-digit AOI growth for the year.
Looking at our concerts business. Year-to-date, we have had 73 million fans attend over 26,000 concerts, delivering $333 million in AOI, which is up 17% from last year. Our international business has been particularly robust this year, delivering much of the fan growth with a strong year for stadiums and theaters, while in the U.S., our arena and theater activity was also up.
As we have grown our show volume and the breadth of artists we work with, we've also been more effective in pricing tickets closer to the market value, particularly with the platinum pricing tool. So far this year, we have had over 3,000 arena and amphitheater shows use platinum tickets with a 54% increase in the number of platinum tickets sold per show.
Looking at our venue operations. We have furthered our focus on the fan experience, improving our hospitality across the board, from our food and beverage offering to our lawn experience to VIP options. As a result, we have increased our average revenue per fan by $2.50 in our amphitheaters to over $29 while also increasing fan spending at festivals, theaters and clubs.
As we continue building our expertise on on-site execution, we are finding more opportunities to build new venues or take over operations of existing venues. And since the start of this year, we have added 36 venues to our portfolio, ranging from the Brooklyn Bowls in New York and Las Vegas to the Danforth Music Hall in Toronto and Sportpaleis in Belgium. As a result, we are confident in the success of our concert flywheel for 2019. We will promote more shows, reach more fans, price more effectively and provide a better fan experience at our venues, which will then drive double-digit AOI growth for the business this year.
Turning to sponsorship. With the first days of Rock in Rio and a strong growth across our entire sponsorship platform, our high-margin sponsorship business delivered 18% AOI growth for the quarter and 13% year-to-date. We are the global leader in music sponsorship, delivering the unique value proposition of nearly 100 million fans on-site for brands looking to make a more direct connection with their customers.
As part of this, we continue to innovate new ways for brands to interact with fans on-site at our venues and festivals, with new programs such as the Bud Light branded photo installation at our amphitheaters or the Revlon roller rink at Lollapalooza. As a result, sponsorship revenue has grown 11% year-to-date at our venues, while festival sponsorship has grown 31% year-to-date.
More broadly, growth is driven by our strategic sponsors, all of whom utilize a range of assets and span multiple years. Revenue from this group, which collectively accounted for 70% of our total sponsorship revenue, has grown 15% year-to-date. With over 95% of our expected sponsorship revenue for 2019 now contracted, we are confident that we will deliver sponsorship AOI growth in the mid-teens for the full year.
Ticketmaster generated the highest AOI quarter ever, up 20% from last year and was 6% growth year-to-date, as every quarter in 2019 is one of the top 10 GTV quarters ever. This growth continues to provide Ticketmaster the scale to invest in the evolution from paper tickets to digital, which is being demanded by venues and content that are seeking greater control of their tickets and looking to develop a more direct connection with fans.
Our Presence rollout is pacing ahead of schedule, and we expect digital ticketing to be installed at over 700 venues, representing 120 million tickets by the end of this year, and over 60% of the fans at digital-enabled events now are entering with their mobile devices. And digital adoption is even greater in the NFL, where 10 teams have now eliminated paper tickets and over 90% of fans for those games are using their mobile phones to get in.
Digital ticketing has expanded our engagement with fans, giving Ticketmaster a more direct connection, providing for more effective marketing and targeted offers. The Ticketmaster app is now regularly in the top 10 ranking for entertainment in the Apple App Store, driving a 30% increase in app downloads this year. This, combined with continued improvements in our mobile web experience, has led to further growth in mobile transactions, now accounting for 46% of ticket purchases globally, up 15% over last year.
Digital ticketing is a strong demonstration of what Ticketmaster can be, providing the best ticketing platform for venues by delivering value well beyond the sale of the ticket but at the same time giving fans an ever-improving mobile-led purchasing and management experience. With these pieces coming together and continued growth in our concerts activity, I expect we will deliver AOI growth at Ticketmaster in the mid-single digits for the full year.
As we approach the end of 2019, we are confident that our strong performance will deliver another record year of top line and AOI growth. All of our businesses, concerts, sponsorship and ticketing have delivered growth year-to-date. And based on their key operating metrics, we expect each to deliver record revenue and AOI for the full year.
With an early look to next year, our 2020 pipeline is up substantially with over 1,500 stadium, arena and amphitheater shows booked already, up double digits from the same time last year. As we look forward, we continue seeing tremendous opportunity to expand our global concerts and festival business, driving further growth in on-site execution, sponsorship and ticketing.
With that, I will turn the call over to Joe, who will take you through additional details on the quarter and the divisions."
384687,640840300,1849296,"Live Nation Entertainment, Inc., Q3 2019 Earnings Call, Oct 31, 2019",2019-10-31,"Earnings Calls","Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Michael. Getting into our business segments, first, concerts. Over the combined past 2 quarters, which represent our core concert season, AOI was up 9% and revenue up 2% year-on-year as we grew attendance 73 million fans at over 26,000 shows, up 3",807,"Thanks, Michael. Getting into our business segments, first, concerts. Over the combined past 2 quarters, which represent our core concert season, AOI was up 9% and revenue up 2% year-on-year as we grew attendance 73 million fans at over 26,000 shows, up 3% and 11%, respectively. As we discussed on our second quarter call, timing this year somewhat shifted to Q2 versus Q3. And as a result, for the third quarter, attendance was 2 million lower than last year, resulting in slightly lower revenue in AOI. 
Looking at the full season though, every indicator we have is of a robust growing business. Our September results actually came in above our expectations as our amphitheater and arena shows closed strongly, and fan spending remained at high levels. This overperformance in ticket sales in the last 2 weeks before the shows resulted in over $5 million of incremental AOI in our amphitheaters relative to how the shows closed last year, demonstrating the continued strength of the concert business.
As Michael said, much of our fan growth this year has come from our international markets, particularly with their stadium lineup. At the same time, we are seeing growing demands throughout our broad portfolio of venue types. Globally, theater shows are our highest growth venues this year as fans continue to find new up-and-coming artists they're excited about.
And festivals remain the ultimate fan experience. And with the addition of Rock in Rio, the continued globalization of the Lollapalooza brand and our over 100 other festivals, we expect attendance to be up double digits to over 10 million fans this year. Arenas continue to be the top place to see the biggest shows, and we expect to add another 1 million fans this year as fans came to see such top acts as the Backstreet Boys, Ariana Grande and John Mayer.
For the fourth quarter, we see continued fan growth, again, driven by our theater shows but with AOI growth impacted by the cost structure and a seasonally lower period for concert activity. So looking at the growth this year and an even bigger pipeline of shows for next year, combined with ongoing improvements in our on-site execution, we believe we are well set up for continued growth in concerts.
Turning to our sponsorship and advertising business. In the third quarter, sponsorship AOI was up 18% and revenue was up 26%, primarily driven by on-site sponsorship as our brand partners continue to recognize the value of engaging with fans at our events. International markets drove the majority of our growth with the first weekend of Rock in Rio contributing to our performance this quarter. And given the 14% growth in sponsor committed net revenue for the year, I'm confident we will deliver mid-teens AOI growth in sponsorship for the full year.
Finally, Ticketmaster. For the quarter, Ticketmaster AOI was up 20%, and revenue was up 5%. Global GTV was up 4% for the quarter, driven by fee-bearing GTV, which was up 5%.
As with our concerts business, international drove our ticketing growth in the quarter with its fee-bearing GTV up 19%. Globally, primary GTV was up 6% for the quarter while secondary GTV was flat. And as in the past, concerts drove most of our primary GTV growth. In secondary, we saw growth in sports, particularly the NFL, the lower activity in North America concerts, again, consistent with the concerts timing we have discussed.
As another sign of success for the Ticketmaster platform, our open distribution strategy continues selling more tickets for clients off platform, up over 30%, with 15 million tickets sold year-to-date.
And to save you the question on margin, yes, we're up a fair bit this quarter due in part to continued improvements in operational areas such as search marketing and also because of some insurance recovery for the data breach issue last year. But our overall focus remains on growing the cash profitability of the ticketing business, not being margin-focused, which is how we have consistently grown the business over the past several years, and expect to continue being successful going forward.
In summary, we are confident that 2019 will be another year of record revenue and AOI results overall and for each of our businesses. We are also making progress on completing our OCESA acquisition. In August, we submitted the necessary request for approval to the 2 key regulatory agencies in Mexico and are working through their process. And in September, CIE received shareholder approval for the transaction. Pending the timing of the regulatory process, which is basically how many rounds of questions do they need to ask, we expect to complete the transaction between December and February, and we'll provide updates as we have more information to share.
I will now turn the call over to Kathy to go through more on our financial results."

Our key financial highlights for the third quarter of 2019. Our revenue was down 2% to $3.8 billion. AOI increased 11% to $427 million, and operating income increased 11% to $260 million.Our revenue decline in",828,"Thanks, Joe, and good afternoon, everyone. Our key financial highlights for the third quarter of 2019. Our revenue was down 2% to $3.8 billion. AOI increased 11% to $427 million, and operating income increased 11% to $260 million.
Our revenue decline in the quarter was primarily driven by a foreign exchange negative impact, and without this, our revenue in the quarter was flat to last year. This FX impact largely affected concert, which along with the timing shift in events from Q3 to Q2, drove a 4% decrease in revenue. Sponsorship revenue increased 26% from the addition of the first weekend of Rock in Rio in Brazil and overall growth in our on-site sponsorship program. And ticketing delivered a 5% increase in revenue as strong international activity drove a 4% increase in global GTV.
AOI growth was 11% in the third quarter, driven mainly by sponsorship, which was up 18%, and ticketing, which was up 20%, as a result of the higher GTV along with an insurance recovery related to the third-party data breach incident last year that we had not expected to receive in the quarter. This insurance recovery, along with the strength in amphitheater show performance at the end of the quarter, as Joe noted previously, drove our outperformance relative to the AOI guidance we provided in July.
Our operating income increased by 11% for the third quarter over last year, driven by the increase in AOI. For the quarter, accretion of redeemable noncontrolling interest was $24 million, and our diluted earnings per share was $0.71.
Turning to our balance sheet. As of September 30, we had total cash of $1.8 billion, including $747 million in ticketing client cash and $642 million in net concert event-related cash, leaving free cash of $406 million. Net cash provided by operating activities for the 9 months was $33 million compared to $256 million last year, primarily due to the timing of when payment obligations were due. Free cash flow adjusted for the 9 months was $531 million, in line with last year's $529 million.
Our conversion of AOI to free cash flow this year was reduced by the timing of distribution to our noncontrolling interest partners and an increase in maintenance CapEx. Our total capital expenditures were $225 million for the first 9 months with $120 million spent on revenue-generating items. We expect total capital expenditures for 2019 to be approximately $325 million with half going toward revenue-generating CapEx projects.
As of September 30, our total deferred revenue related to future events was $952 million, an increase of 26% over the $759 million at this point last year. As of September 30, our total debt was $2.8 billion, and our weighted average cost of debt was 4.2%.
And in October, we issued $950 million of 4.75% senior notes due 2027 and amended our senior secured credit facility, including a new $950 million term loan B. In addition, we have an undrawn $500 million revolver and a $400 million delayed draw term loan A. The proceeds from these transactions were used to redeem our $250 million of 5.375% senior notes due 2022 and to repay the outstanding balance of our existing term loan.
After these repayments and other fees and expenses, we will have $527 million of incremental cash on the balance sheet. This will allow us to meet the cash portion of our purchase price for the OCESA acquisition, along with funding other acquisition opportunities. After this refinancing, our weighted average cost of debt remains at 4.2%, and we estimate that our interest expense will initially increase by approximately $10 million in the fourth quarter as a result of this refinance.
For the remainder of 2019, we expect negative FX impacts of approximately 2% for revenue and 7% for AOI in the fourth quarter based on current rates. This FX headwind to AOI is largely driven by higher sponsorship activity in Brazil, Australia and New Zealand, which are all projected to be up 7% in the fourth quarter, and the euro and British pound, which are projected to be up 4% to 5%. Revenue has less of an impact as that mix is more heavily weighted to the U.S. We have factored this FX impact into our full year guidance that both Michael and Joe discussed, which takes into consideration our reported year-to-date results and our expectations for the fourth quarter.
Consistent with where we projected it last quarter, we currently expect that free cash flow adjusted for the full year as a percentage of our 2019 AOI will be in the mid-50s. Our accretion of redeemable noncontrolling interest for the fourth quarter is projected to be approximately $26 million. And as a reminder, as you look forward to 2020, our Rock in Rio Festival, which spans Q3 and Q4 this year, is a biannual festival and will therefore not take place next year.

First of all, in terms of the pace and why it's deploying faster, 2 things. One is I think we've been successful because of how effective it's been both with the NFL as well as our own buildings. We're just seeing tremendous demand by other venues that are saying we don't want to get left behind. We want to shift to digital so we can be getting that consumer data, understanding better control of the ticket as well. And our processes for deploying the systems actually going to the venues, changing the access control systems, we've gotten that working well very quickly. So I think that has led us over the course of this year to move our target for installations from 500 to 600 now to 700 installations.
So in terms of the long-term impact, clearly just for Ticketmaster, it's a fundamentally different value proposition that it provides through its venues now. It's no longer just selling a ticket but it is providing an important data service. So that's an important piece of just what Ticketmaster is.
And then we talked through there are a multitude of uses that the data will provide. It will support Ticketmaster and our concert business in terms of the effectiveness of their marketing, their ability to provide much more targeted information to fans based on what we think they're interested in. They'll be very important to our venue strategy in terms of being able to make offers to people based on what their past behavior is. It will be important for sponsors, for them to directly tie in sponsor segments -- customer segments and target [indiscernible] 100 million people are on-site. So the ability to do all of those things over the next several years, I think, will be tremendously important throughout the entire company."

And two is you're continuing the trend of seeing some shift into the fourth quarter in terms of timing and some of the onsales.

The pricing headroom, I think most recent number we've given is we think there's still probably about $1 billion of price arbitrage, if we look at the secondary market as a guide for market value of ticket prices relative to how we price tickets. And we absolutely believe that one of the factors during any economic slowdown is that provides the buffer. And that arbitrage gets eaten away before some of the fundamental demand hits our ticket. So that absolutely is a piece that gives us some greater comfort as we think about different economic cycles.
In terms of digital ticketing, the rollout, I think by the end of this year, we'll have 80% of the major building. One gating factor is just you're not going to have your NBA and NHL teams yet mid-season. So if they didn't shift before the start of the season, they won't shift between now and the end of the year. It would be when they take a break, again, during their next cycle. And then it's just a matter of getting to a lot of the smaller buildings."

Just on pricing, just to give some narrative, the press likes to talk sometimes about the ticket pricing of the high shows. Overall, concerts are at a very affordable price point. If you look at the average ticket pricing, the $60, average fans go to 2 or 3 shows a year. It's still a very affordable lifetime memory versus a trip or a vacation.
So in recession, we see that the consumer may pull back on high ticket items. They may not go on a vacation, may pull back on a new car. But to take his kids to Taylor Swift or his wife to a show or his friend, it's still a very, very affordable option that we know because they're lifetime moments and Kodak moments of your life. They still make sure they go to that local show at the arena or stadium or amphitheater because it's still incredibly affordable even if they're in a slight pullback on their cash spend.
Now I say that it also means we have -- why we believe the ticket is completely still underpriced, like those $8 billion to $10 billion in the secondary market on an ongoing basis, we still think that the front of the house is widely underpriced. And year-over-year, we'll make progress with the artists to keep pricing it better and taking some of that high-end opportunity into his pocket as well as lowering the price in the back end to get better -- full capacity.
So overall, we think the show is still a very affordable option in life, cheaper than a good dinner in a big picture with great pricing opportunity given we still think it is a very low-priced option if you compare it to an NBA game, a night at the theater, a front-row seat at an NFL game, et cetera. So we think concert is underpriced, lots of room for pricing, still affordable to everybody no matter where their economic situation lies. And we think the secondary is the proof that we have upside."

So first of all, you move a few points on the revenue side just because of the currency fluctuation. But really, what's going on, as we've told you over the past 9 months, is we have fewer stadium shows. We have about 30 fewer stadium shows this year than last year. And we've had tremendous growth in our theater shows, in particular, both in North America and internationally. Those stadium shows that we don't have are the highest-volume shows and also the highest average ticket price. Your theater shows are going to be a much lower average attendance and also a lower ticket price.
So all you're seeing is some mix shift going on. There still is, across all of the venue types, very strong sell-through demand. We talked about platinum tickets. We talked about all of the components. So the performance is very strong across the board.

Live Nation delivered its highest AOI quarter ever as we continue to scale our business globally and build on favorable supply/demand dynamics for live music. AOI grew 11% in the quart",1132,"Good afternoon, and welcome to our third quarter 2019 conference call. Live Nation delivered its highest AOI quarter ever as we continue to scale our business globally and build on favorable supply/demand dynamics for live music. AOI grew 11% in the quarter and 13% year-to-date, outperforming a record Q3 last year and demonstrating the strength of our business model in today's experience-based economy.
And in response to recent questions about consumer demand, we are seeing fan spending as strong as ever. In September, our amphitheater and arena shows actually closed stronger than shows in September of last year. And our fan spending on-site also showed ongoing growth.
At the center of our flywheel, the demand for live events continues to grow as we have sold 92 million tickets through mid-October, up 6% or 5 million tickets compared to this time last year. And we are on track to nearly 100 million fans attending the show this year. And we have translated the fan growth into strong AOI gains on on-site spending, sponsorship and ticketing. As a result, as we wrap up the successful 2019, we are confident that we will deliver double-digit AOI growth for the year.
Looking at our concerts business. Year-to-date, we have had 73 million fans attend over 26,000 concerts, delivering $333 million in AOI, which is up 17% from last year. Our international business has been particularly robust this year, delivering much of the fan growth with a strong year for stadiums and theaters, while in the U.S., our arena and theater activity was also up.
As we have grown our show volume and the breadth of artists we work with, we've also been more effective in pricing tickets closer to the market value, particularly with the platinum pricing tool. So far this year, we have had over 3,000 arena and amphitheater shows use platinum tickets with a 54% increase in the number of platinum tickets sold per show.
Looking at our venue operations. We have furthered our focus on the fan experience, improving our hospitality across the board, from our food and beverage offering to our lawn experience to VIP options. As a result, we have increased our average revenue per fan by $2.50 in our amphitheaters to over $29 while also increasing fan spending at festivals, theaters and clubs.
As we continue building our expertise on on-site execution, we are finding more opportunities to build new venues or take over operations of existing venues. And since the start of this year, we have added 36 venues to our portfolio, ranging from the Brooklyn Bowls in New York and Las Vegas to the Danforth Music Hall in Toronto and Sportpaleis in Belgium. As a result, we are confident in the success of our concert flywheel for 2019. We will promote more shows, reach more fans, price more effectively and provide a better fan experience at our venues, which will then drive double-digit AOI growth for the business this year.
Turning to sponsorship. With the first days of Rock in Rio and a strong growth across our entire sponsorship platform, our high-margin sponsorship business delivered 18% AOI growth for the quarter and 13% year-to-date. We are the global leader in music sponsorship, delivering the unique value proposition of nearly 100 million fans on-site for brands looking to make a more direct connection with their customers.
As part of this, we continue to innovate new ways for brands to interact with fans on-site at our venues and festivals, with new programs such as the Bud Light branded photo installation at our amphitheaters or the Revlon roller rink at Lollapalooza. As a result, sponsorship revenue has grown 11% year-to-date at our venues, while festival sponsorship has grown 31% year-to-date.
More broadly, growth is driven by our strategic sponsors, all of whom utilize a range of assets and span multiple years. Revenue from this group, which collectively accounted for 70% of our total sponsorship revenue, has grown 15% year-to-date. With over 95% of our expected sponsorship revenue for 2019 now contracted, we are confident that we will deliver sponsorship AOI growth in the mid-teens for the full year.
Ticketmaster generated the highest AOI quarter ever, up 20% from last year and was 6% growth year-to-date, as every quarter in 2019 is one of the top 10 GTV quarters ever. This growth continues to provide Ticketmaster the scale to invest in the evolution from paper tickets to digital, which is being demanded by venues and content that are seeking greater control of their tickets and looking to develop a more direct connection with fans.
Our Presence rollout is pacing ahead of schedule, and we expect digital ticketing to be installed at over 700 venues, representing 120 million tickets by the end of this year, and over 60% of the fans at digital-enabled events now are entering with their mobile devices. And digital adoption is even greater in the NFL, where 10 teams have now eliminated paper tickets and over 90% of fans for those games are using their mobile phones to get in.
Digital ticketing has expanded our engagement with fans, giving Ticketmaster a more direct connection, providing for more effective marketing and targeted offers. The Ticketmaster app is now regularly in the top 10 ranking for entertainment in the Apple App Store, driving a 30% increase in app downloads this year. This, combined with continued improvements in our mobile web experience, has led to further growth in mobile transactions, now accounting for 46% of ticket purchases globally, up 15% over last year.
Digital ticketing is a strong demonstration of what Ticketmaster can be, providing the best ticketing platform for venues by delivering value well beyond the sale of the ticket but at the same time giving fans an ever-improving mobile-led purchasing and management experience. With these pieces coming together and continued growth in our concerts activity, I expect we will deliver AOI growth at Ticketmaster in the mid-single digits for the full year.
As we approach the end of 2019, we are confident that our strong performance will deliver another record year of top line and AOI growth. All of our businesses, concerts, sponsorship and ticketing have delivered growth year-to-date. And based on their key operating metrics, we expect each to deliver record revenue and AOI for the full year.
With an early look to next year, our 2020 pipeline is up substantially with over 1,500 stadium, arena and amphitheater shows booked already, up double digits from the same time last year. As we look forward, we continue seeing tremendous opportunity to expand our global concerts and festival business, driving further growth in on-site execution, sponsorship and ticketing.
With that, I will turn the call over to Joe, who will take you through additional details on the quarter and the divisions."
384687,640840300,1867744,"Live Nation Entertainment, Inc., Q3 2019 Earnings Call, Oct 31, 2019",2019-10-31,"Earnings Calls","Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Michael. Getting into our business segments, first, concerts. Over the combined past 2 quarters, which represent our core concert season, AOI was up 9% and revenue up 2% year-on-year as we grew attendance 73 million fans at over 26,000 shows, up 3",807,"Thanks, Michael. Getting into our business segments, first, concerts. Over the combined past 2 quarters, which represent our core concert season, AOI was up 9% and revenue up 2% year-on-year as we grew attendance 73 million fans at over 26,000 shows, up 3% and 11%, respectively. As we discussed on our second quarter call, timing this year somewhat shifted to Q2 versus Q3. And as a result, for the third quarter, attendance was 2 million lower than last year, resulting in slightly lower revenue in AOI. 
Looking at the full season though, every indicator we have is of a robust growing business. Our September results actually came in above our expectations as our amphitheater and arena shows closed strongly, and fan spending remained at high levels. This overperformance in ticket sales in the last 2 weeks before the shows resulted in over $5 million of incremental AOI in our amphitheaters relative to how the shows closed last year, demonstrating the continued strength of the concert business.
As Michael said, much of our fan growth this year has come from our international markets, particularly with their stadium lineup. At the same time, we are seeing growing demands throughout our broad portfolio of venue types. Globally, theater shows are our highest growth venues this year as fans continue to find new up-and-coming artists they're excited about.
And festivals remain the ultimate fan experience. And with the addition of Rock in Rio, the continued globalization of the Lollapalooza brand and our over 100 other festivals, we expect attendance to be up double digits to over 10 million fans this year. Arenas continue to be the top place to see the biggest shows, and we expect to add another 1 million fans this year as fans came to see such top acts as the Backstreet Boys, Ariana Grande and John Mayer.
For the fourth quarter, we see continued fan growth, again, driven by our theater shows but with AOI growth impacted by the cost structure and a seasonally lower period for concert activity. So looking at the growth this year and an even bigger pipeline of shows for next year, combined with ongoing improvements in our on-site execution, we believe we are well set up for continued growth in concerts.
Turning to our sponsorship and advertising business. In the third quarter, sponsorship AOI was up 18% and revenue was up 26%, primarily driven by on-site sponsorship as our brand partners continue to recognize the value of engaging with fans at our events. International markets drove the majority of our growth with the first weekend of Rock in Rio contributing to our performance this quarter. And given the 14% growth in sponsor committed net revenue for the year, I'm confident we will deliver mid-teens AOI growth in sponsorship for the full year.
Finally, Ticketmaster. For the quarter, Ticketmaster AOI was up 20%, and revenue was up 5%. Global GTV was up 4% for the quarter, driven by fee-bearing GTV, which was up 5%.
As with our concerts business, international drove our ticketing growth in the quarter with its fee-bearing GTV up 19%. Globally, primary GTV was up 6% for the quarter while secondary GTV was flat. And as in the past, concerts drove most of our primary GTV growth. In secondary, we saw growth in sports, particularly the NFL, the lower activity in North America concerts, again, consistent with the concerts timing we have discussed.
As another sign of success for the Ticketmaster platform, our open distribution strategy continues selling more tickets for clients off platform, up over 30%, with 15 million tickets sold year-to-date.
And to save you the question on margin, yes, we're up a fair bit this quarter due in part to continued improvements in operational areas such as search marketing and also because of some insurance recovery for the data breach issue last year. But our overall focus remains on growing the cash profitability of the ticketing business, not being margin-focused, which is how we have consistently grown the business over the past several years, and expect to continue being successful going forward.
In summary, we are confident that 2019 will be another year of record revenue and AOI results overall and for each of our businesses. We are also making progress on completing our OCESA acquisition. In August, we submitted the necessary request for approval to the 2 key regulatory agencies in Mexico and are working through their process. And in September, CIE received shareholder approval for the transaction. Pending the timing of the regulatory process, which is basically how many rounds of questions do they need to ask, we expect to complete the transaction between December and February, and we'll provide updates as we have more information to share.
I will now turn the call over to Kathy to go through more on our financial results."

Our key financial highlights for the third quarter of 2019. Our revenue was down 2% to $3.8 billion. AOI increased 11% to $427 million, and operating income increased 11% to $260 million.Our revenue decline in",828,"Thanks, Joe, and good afternoon, everyone. Our key financial highlights for the third quarter of 2019. Our revenue was down 2% to $3.8 billion. AOI increased 11% to $427 million, and operating income increased 11% to $260 million.
Our revenue decline in the quarter was primarily driven by a foreign exchange negative impact, and without this, our revenue in the quarter was flat to last year. This FX impact largely affected concert, which along with the timing shift in events from Q3 to Q2, drove a 4% decrease in revenue. Sponsorship revenue increased 26% from the addition of the first weekend of Rock in Rio in Brazil and overall growth in our on-site sponsorship program. And ticketing delivered a 5% increase in revenue as strong international activity drove a 4% increase in global GTV.
AOI growth was 11% in the third quarter, driven mainly by sponsorship, which was up 18%, and ticketing, which was up 20%, as a result of the higher GTV along with an insurance recovery related to the third-party data breach incident last year that we had not expected to receive in the quarter. This insurance recovery, along with the strength in amphitheater show performance at the end of the quarter, as Joe noted previously, drove our outperformance relative to the AOI guidance we provided in July.
Our operating income increased by 11% for the third quarter over last year, driven by the increase in AOI. For the quarter, accretion of redeemable noncontrolling interest was $24 million, and our diluted earnings per share was $0.71.
Turning to our balance sheet. As of September 30, we had total cash of $1.8 billion, including $747 million in ticketing client cash and $642 million in net concert event-related cash, leaving free cash of $406 million. Net cash provided by operating activities for the 9 months was $33 million compared to $256 million last year, primarily due to the timing of when payment obligations were due. Free cash flow adjusted for the 9 months was $531 million, in line with last year's $529 million.
Our conversion of AOI to free cash flow this year was reduced by the timing of distribution to our noncontrolling interest partners and an increase in maintenance CapEx. Our total capital expenditures were $225 million for the first 9 months with $120 million spent on revenue-generating items. We expect total capital expenditures for 2019 to be approximately $325 million with half going toward revenue-generating CapEx projects.
As of September 30, our total deferred revenue related to future events was $952 million, an increase of 26% over the $759 million at this point last year. As of September 30, our total debt was $2.8 billion, and our weighted average cost of debt was 4.2%.
And in October, we issued $950 million of 4.75% senior notes due 2027 and amended our senior secured credit facility, including a new $950 million term loan B. In addition, we have an undrawn $500 million revolver and a $400 million delayed draw term loan A. The proceeds from these transactions were used to redeem our $250 million of 5.375% senior notes due 2022 and to repay the outstanding balance of our existing term loan.
After these repayments and other fees and expenses, we will have $527 million of incremental cash on the balance sheet. This will allow us to meet the cash portion of our purchase price for the OCESA acquisition, along with funding other acquisition opportunities. After this refinancing, our weighted average cost of debt remains at 4.2%, and we estimate that our interest expense will initially increase by approximately $10 million in the fourth quarter as a result of this refinance.
For the remainder of 2019, we expect negative FX impacts of approximately 2% for revenue and 7% for AOI in the fourth quarter based on current rates. This FX headwind to AOI is largely driven by higher sponsorship activity in Brazil, Australia and New Zealand, which are all projected to be up 7% in the fourth quarter, and the euro and British pound, which are projected to be up 4% to 5%. Revenue has less of an impact as that mix is more heavily weighted to the U.S. We have factored this FX impact into our full year guidance that both Michael and Joe discussed, which takes into consideration our reported year-to-date results and our expectations for the fourth quarter.
Consistent with where we projected it last quarter, we currently expect that free cash flow adjusted for the full year as a percentage of our 2019 AOI will be in the mid-50s. Our accretion of redeemable noncontrolling interest for the fourth quarter is projected to be approximately $26 million. And as a reminder, as you look forward to 2020, our Rock in Rio Festival, which spans Q3 and Q4 this year, is a biannual festival and will therefore not take place next year.

Those will be our highest-margin concert venues -- or concert business.
So we've always been expanding and looking at leasing and managing concert venues. We've had a portfolio of theaters and clubs, House of Blues, Fillmores, well over 100 of them now around the world. We've been managing those for the last 15 years and really looking at any concert venue from 500 feet up to amphitheaters, if they're pure-play concert venues where our content can leverage our relationship into multiple revenue streams by managing or leasing or building that music venue.
So on a global basis, we continue to look at them as great returns. And they're the places that our flywheel comes to life, the most leverageable in terms of content sponsorship and ticketing."

And a big part of our revenue hospitality strategy is to continue to make sure we understand the high-end consumer and the hospitality around VIP and servicing that customer well. Our core DNA knows how to put a lot of people through buildings in an efficient manner and service them. We want to get more skill set to understand how to take care of the VIP high-end customer, how best to set up the VIP, what does that VIP flow look like, how best to monetize the customers with a better and higher experience or unique experience. 
So Dave is an expert in the next business in Miami. He's very successful in what he does. He's tested it at the Miami Dolphins stadium with his platform there.

First of all, in terms of the pace and why it's deploying faster, 2 things. One is I think we've been successful because of how effective it's been both with the NFL as well as our own buildings. We're just seeing tremendous demand by other venues that are saying we don't want to get left behind. We want to shift to digital so we can be getting that consumer data, understanding better control of the ticket as well. And our processes for deploying the systems actually going to the venues, changing the access control systems, we've gotten that working well very quickly. So I think that has led us over the course of this year to move our target for installations from 500 to 600 now to 700 installations.
So in terms of the long-term impact, clearly just for Ticketmaster, it's a fundamentally different value proposition that it provides through its venues now. It's no longer just selling a ticket but it is providing an important data service. So that's an important piece of just what Ticketmaster is.
And then we talked through there are a multitude of uses that the data will provide. It will support Ticketmaster and our concert business in terms of the effectiveness of their marketing, their ability to provide much more targeted information to fans based on what we think they're interested in. They'll be very important to our venue strategy in terms of being able to make offers to people based on what their past behavior is. It will be important for sponsors, for them to directly tie in sponsor, segments -- customer segments and targets where a few 100 million people are on-site. So the ability to do all of those things over the next several years, I think, will be tremendously important throughout the entire company."

The pricing headroom, I think most recent number we've given is we think there's still probably about $1 billion of price arbitrage, if we look at the secondary market as a guide for market value of ticket prices relative to how we price tickets. And we absolutely believe that one of the factors during any economic slowdown is that provides the buffer. And that arbitrage gets eaten away before some of the fundamental demand hits our ticket. So that absolutely is a piece that gives us some greater comfort as we think about different economic cycles.
In terms of digital ticketing, the rollout, I think by the end of this year, we'll have 80% of the major building. One gating factor is just you're not going to have your NBA and NHL teams yet mid-season. So if they didn't shift before the start of the season, they won't shift between now and the end of the year. It would be when they take a break, again, during their next cycle. And then it's just a matter of getting to a lot of the smaller buildings."

Just on pricing, just to give some narrative, the press likes to talk sometimes about the ticket pricing of the high shows. Overall, concerts are at a very affordable price point. If you look at the average ticket pricing, the $60, average fans go to 2 or 3 shows a year. It's still a very affordable lifetime memory versus a trip or a vacation.
So in recession, we see that the consumer may pull back on high ticket items. They may not go on a vacation, may pull back on a new car. But to take his kids to Taylor Swift or his wife to a show or his friend, it's still a very, very affordable option that we know because they're lifetime moments and Kodak moments of your life. They still make sure they go to that local show at the arena or stadium or amphitheater because it's still incredibly affordable even if they're in a slight pullback on their cash spend.
Now I say that it also means we have -- why we believe the ticket is completely still underpriced, like those $8 billion to $10 billion in the secondary market on an ongoing basis, we still think that the front of the house is widely underpriced. And year-over-year, we'll make progress with the artists to keep pricing it better and taking some of that high-end opportunity into his pocket as well as lowering the price in the back end to get better -- full capacity.
So overall, we think the show is still a very affordable option in life, cheaper than a good dinner in a big picture with great pricing opportunity given we still think it is a very low-priced option if you compare it to an NBA game, a night at the theater, a front-row seat at an NFL game, et cetera. So we think concert is underpriced, lots of room for pricing, still affordable to everybody no matter where their economic situation lies. And we think the secondary is the proof that we have upside."

The concert business is up about 4% on constant currency.
So first of all, you move a few points on the revenue side just because of the currency fluctuation. But really, what's going on, as we've told you over the past 9 months, is we have fewer stadium shows. We have about 30 fewer stadium shows this year than last year. And we've had tremendous growth in our theater shows, in particular, both in North America and internationally. Those stadium shows that we don't have are the highest-volume shows and also the highest average ticket price. Your theater shows are going to be a much lower average attendance and also a lower ticket price.
So all you're seeing is some mix shift going on. There still is, across all of the venue types, very strong sell-through demand. We talked about platinum tickets. We talked about all of the components. So the performance is very strong across the board. And then as we look at next year, we see a big uptick again in our stadium volume, which is what you get the first read on in the business. So we're doing very good.

Live Nation delivered its highest AOI quarter ever as we continue to scale our business globally and build on favorable supply/demand dynamics for live music.

Live Nation delivered its highest AOI quarter ever as we continue to scale our business globally and build on favorable supply/demand dynamics for live music. AOI grew 11% in the quarter and 13% year-to-date, outperforming a record Q3 last year and demonstrating the strength of our business model in today's experience-based economy.
And in response to recent questions about consumer demand, we are seeing fan spending as strong as ever. In September, our amphitheater and arena shows actually closed stronger than shows in September of last year. And our fan spending on-site also showed ongoing growth.
At the center of our flywheel, the demand for live events continues to grow as we have sold 92 million tickets through mid-October, up 6% or 5 million tickets compared to this time last year. And we are on track to nearly 100 million fans attending the show this year. And we have translated the fan growth into strong AOI gains on on-site spending, sponsorship and ticketing. As a result, as we wrap up the successful 2019, we are confident that we will deliver double-digit AOI growth for the year.
Looking at our concerts business. Year-to-date, we have had 73 million fans attend over 26,000 concerts, delivering $333 million in AOI, which is up 17% from last year. Our international business has been particularly robust this year, delivering much of the fan growth with a strong year for stadiums and theaters, while in the U.S., our arena and theater activity was also up.
As we have grown our show volume and the breadth of artists we work with, we've also been more effective in pricing tickets closer to the market value, particularly with the platinum pricing tool. So far this year, we have had over 3,000 arena and amphitheater shows use platinum tickets with a 54% increase in the number of platinum tickets sold per show.
Looking at our venue operations. We have furthered our focus on the fan experience, improving our hospitality across the board, from our food and beverage offering to our lawn experience to VIP options. As a result, we have increased our average revenue per fan by $2.50 in our amphitheaters to over $29 while also increasing fan spending at festivals, theaters and clubs.
As we continue building our expertise on on-site execution, we are finding more opportunities to build new venues or take over operations of existing venues. And since the start of this year, we have added 36 venues to our portfolio, ranging from the Brooklyn Bowls in New York and Las Vegas to the Danforth Music Hall in Toronto and Sportpaleis in Belgium. As a result, we are confident in the success of our concert flywheel for 2019. We will promote more shows, reach more fans, price more effectively and provide a better fan experience at our venues, which will then drive double-digit AOI growth for the business this year.
Turning to sponsorship. With the first days of Rock in Rio and a strong growth across our entire sponsorship platform, our high-margin sponsorship business delivered 18% AOI growth for the quarter and 13% year-to-date. We are the global leader in music sponsorship, delivering the unique value proposition of nearly 100 million fans on-site for brands looking to make a more direct connection with their customers.
As part of this, we continue to innovate new ways for brands to interact with fans on-site at our venues and festivals, with new programs such as the Bud Light branded photo installation at our amphitheaters or the Revlon roller rink at Lollapalooza. As a result, sponsorship revenue has grown 11% year-to-date at our venues, while festival sponsorship has grown 31% year-to-date.
More broadly, growth is driven by our strategic sponsors, all of whom utilize a range of assets and span multiple years. Revenue from this group, which collectively accounted for 70% of our total sponsorship revenue, has grown 15% year-to-date. With over 95% of our expected sponsorship revenue for 2019 now contracted, we are confident that we will deliver sponsorship AOI growth in the mid-teens for the full year.
Ticketmaster generated the highest AOI quarter ever, up 20% from last year and was 6% growth year-to-date, as every quarter in 2019 is one of the top 10 GTV quarters ever. This growth continues to provide Ticketmaster the scale to invest in the evolution from paper tickets to digital, which is being demanded by venues and content that are seeking greater control of their tickets and looking to develop a more direct connection with fans.
Our Presence rollout is pacing ahead of schedule, and we expect digital ticketing to be installed at over 700 venues, representing 120 million tickets by the end of this year, and over 60% of the fans at digital-enabled events now are entering with their mobile devices. And digital adoption is even greater in the NFL, where 10 teams have now eliminated paper tickets and over 90% of fans for those games are using their mobile phones to get in.
Digital ticketing has expanded our engagement with fans, giving Ticketmaster a more direct connection, providing for more effective marketing and targeted offers. The Ticketmaster app is now regularly in the top 10 ranking for entertainment in the Apple App Store, driving a 30% increase in app downloads this year. This, combined with continued improvements in our mobile web experience, has led to further growth in mobile transactions, now accounting for 46% of ticket purchases globally, up 15% over last year.
Digital ticketing is a strong demonstration of what Ticketmaster can be, providing the best ticketing platform for venues by delivering value well beyond the sale of the ticket but at the same time giving fans an ever-improving mobile-led purchasing and management experience. With these pieces coming together and continued growth in our concerts activity, I expect we will deliver AOI growth at Ticketmaster in the mid-single digits for the full year.
As we approach the end of 2019, we are confident that our strong performance will deliver another record year of top line and AOI growth. All of our businesses, concerts, sponsorship and ticketing have delivered growth year-to-date. And based on their key operating metrics, we expect each to deliver record revenue and AOI for the full year.
With an early look to next year, our 2020 pipeline is up substantially with over 1,500 stadium, arena and amphitheater shows booked already, up double digits from the same time last year. As we look forward, we continue seeing tremendous opportunity to expand our global concerts and festival business, driving further growth in on-site execution, sponsorship and ticketing.
With that, I will turn the call over to Joe, who will take you through additional details on the quarter and the divisions."

Getting into our business segments, first, concerts. Over the combined past 2 quarters, which represent our core concert season, AOI was up 9% and revenue up 2% year-on-year as we grew attendance 73 million fans at over 26,000 shows, up 3",807,"Thanks, Michael. Getting into our business segments, first, concerts. Over the combined past 2 quarters, which represent our core concert season, AOI was up 9% and revenue up 2% year-on-year as we grew attendance 73 million fans at over 26,000 shows, up 3% and 11%, respectively. As we discussed on our second quarter call, timing this year somewhat shifted to Q2 versus Q3. And as a result, for the third quarter, attendance was 2 million lower than last year, resulting in slightly lower revenue in AOI. 
Looking at the full season though, every indicator we have is of a robust growing business. Our September results actually came in above our expectations as our amphitheater and arena shows closed strongly, and fan spending remained at high levels. This overperformance in ticket sales in the last 2 weeks before the shows resulted in over $5 million of incremental AOI in our amphitheaters relative to how the shows closed last year, demonstrating the continued strength of the concert business.
As Michael said, much of our fan growth this year has come from our international markets, particularly with their stadium lineup. At the same time, we are seeing growing demands throughout our broad portfolio of venue types. Globally, theater shows are our highest growth venues this year as fans continue to find new up-and-coming artists they're excited about.
And festivals remain the ultimate fan experience. And with the addition of Rock in Rio, the continued globalization of the Lollapalooza brand and our over 100 other festivals, we expect attendance to be up double digits to over 10 million fans this year. Arenas continue to be the top place to see the biggest shows, and we expect to add another 1 million fans this year as fans came to see such top acts as the Backstreet Boys, Ariana Grande and John Mayer.
For the fourth quarter, we see continued fan growth, again, driven by our theater shows but with AOI growth impacted by the cost structure and a seasonally lower period for concert activity. So looking at the growth this year and an even bigger pipeline of shows for next year, combined with ongoing improvements in our on-site execution, we believe we are well set up for continued growth in concerts.
Turning to our sponsorship and advertising business. In the third quarter, sponsorship AOI was up 18% and revenue was up 26%, primarily driven by on-site sponsorship as our brand partners continue to recognize the value of engaging with fans at our events. International markets drove the majority of our growth with the first weekend of Rock in Rio contributing to our performance this quarter. And given the 14% growth in sponsor committed net revenue for the year, I'm confident we will deliver mid-teens AOI growth in sponsorship for the full year.
Finally, Ticketmaster. For the quarter, Ticketmaster AOI was up 20%, and revenue was up 5%. Global GTV was up 4% for the quarter, driven by fee-bearing GTV, which was up 5%.
As with our concerts business, international drove our ticketing growth in the quarter with its fee-bearing GTV up 19%. Globally, primary GTV was up 6% for the quarter while secondary GTV was flat. And as in the past, concerts drove most of our primary GTV growth. In secondary, we saw growth in sports, particularly the NFL, the lower activity in North America concerts, again, consistent with the concerts timing we have discussed.
As another sign of success for the Ticketmaster platform, our open distribution strategy continues selling more tickets for clients off platform, up over 30%, with 15 million tickets sold year-to-date.
And to save you the question on margin, yes, we're up a fair bit this quarter due in part to continued improvements in operational areas such as search marketing and also because of some insurance recovery for the data breach issue last year. But our overall focus remains on growing the cash profitability of the ticketing business, not being margin-focused, which is how we have consistently grown the business over the past several years, and expect to continue being successful going forward.
In summary, we are confident that 2019 will be another year of record revenue and AOI results overall and for each of our businesses. We are also making progress on completing our OCESA acquisition. In August, we submitted the necessary request for approval to the 2 key regulatory agencies in Mexico and are working through their process. And in September, CIE received shareholder approval for the transaction. Pending the timing of the regulatory process, which is basically how many rounds of questions do they need to ask, we expect to complete the transaction between December and February, and we'll provide updates as we have more information to share.
I will now turn the call over to Kathy to go through more on our financial results."

Our key financial highlights for the third quarter of 2019. Our revenue was down 2% to $3.8 billion. AOI increased 11% to $427 million, and operating income increased 11% to $260 million.
Our revenue decline in the quarter was primarily driven by a foreign exchange negative impact, and without this, our revenue in the quarter was flat to last year. This FX impact largely affected concert, which along with the timing shift in events from Q3 to Q2, drove a 4% decrease in revenue. Sponsorship revenue increased 26% from the addition of the first weekend of Rock in Rio in Brazil and overall growth in our on-site sponsorship program. And ticketing delivered a 5% increase in revenue as strong international activity drove a 4% increase in global GTV.
AOI growth was 11% in the third quarter, driven mainly by sponsorship, which was up 18%, and ticketing, which was up 20%, as a result of the higher GTV along with an insurance recovery related to the third-party data breach incident last year that we had not expected to receive in the quarter. This insurance recovery, along with the strength in amphitheater show performance at the end of the quarter, as Joe noted previously, drove our outperformance relative to the AOI guidance we provided in July.
Our operating income increased by 11% for the third quarter over last year, driven by the increase in AOI. For the quarter, accretion of redeemable noncontrolling interest was $24 million, and our diluted earnings per share was $0.71.
Turning to our balance sheet. As of September 30, we had total cash of $1.8 billion, including $747 million in ticketing client cash and $642 million in net concert event-related cash, leaving free cash of $406 million. Net cash provided by operating activities for the 9 months was $33 million compared to $256 million last year, primarily due to the timing of when payment obligations were due. Free cash flow adjusted for the 9 months was $531 million, in line with last year's $529 million.
Our conversion of AOI to free cash flow this year was reduced by the timing of distribution to our noncontrolling interest partners and an increase in maintenance CapEx. Our total capital expenditures were $225 million for the first 9 months with $120 million spent on revenue-generating items. We expect total capital expenditures for 2019 to be approximately $325 million with half going toward revenue-generating CapEx projects.
As of September 30, our total deferred revenue related to future events was $952 million, an increase of 26% over the $759 million at this point last year. As of September 30, our total debt was $2.8 billion, and our weighted average cost of debt was 4.2%.
And in October, we issued $950 million of 4.75% senior notes due 2027 and amended our senior secured credit facility, including a new $950 million term loan B. In addition, we have an undrawn $500 million revolver and a $400 million delayed draw term loan A. The proceeds from these transactions were used to redeem our $250 million of 5.375% senior notes due 2022 and to repay the outstanding balance of our existing term loan.
After these repayments and other fees and expenses, we will have $527 million of incremental cash on the balance sheet. This will allow us to meet the cash portion of our purchase price for the OCESA acquisition, along with funding other acquisition opportunities. After this refinancing, our weighted average cost of debt remains at 4.2%, and we estimate that our interest expense will initially increase by approximately $10 million in the fourth quarter as a result of this refinance.
For the remainder of 2019, we expect negative FX impacts of approximately 2% for revenue and 7% for AOI in the fourth quarter based on current rates. This FX headwind to AOI is largely driven by higher sponsorship activity in Brazil, Australia and New Zealand, which are all projected to be up 7% in the fourth quarter, and the euro and British pound, which are projected to be up 4% to 5%. Revenue has less of an impact as that mix is more heavily weighted to the U.S. We have factored this FX impact into our full year guidance that both Michael and Joe discussed, which takes into consideration our reported year-to-date results and our expectations for the fourth quarter.
Consistent with where we projected it last quarter, we currently expect that free cash flow adjusted for the full year as a percentage of our 2019 AOI will be in the mid-50s. Our accretion of redeemable noncontrolling interest for the fourth quarter is projected to be approximately $26 million. And as a reminder, as you look forward to 2020, our Rock in Rio Festival, which spans Q3 and Q4 this year, is a biannual festival and will therefore not take place next year.

We think our understanding of the consumer, our level of sophistication associated with pricing, understanding different consumer segments, our ability to execute on-site are all substantially higher.

So we've always been expanding and looking at leasing and managing concert venues. We've had a portfolio of theaters and clubs, House of Blues, Fillmores, well over 100 of them now around the world. We've been managing those for the last 15 years and really looking at any concert venue from 500 feet up to amphitheaters, if they're pure-play concert venues where our content can leverage our relationship into multiple revenue streams by managing or leasing or building that music venue.
So on a global basis, we continue to look at them as great returns. And they're the places that our flywheel comes to life, the most leverageable in terms of content sponsorship and ticketing."

Our core DNA knows how to put a lot of people through buildings in an efficient manner and service them. We want to get more skill set to understand how to take care of the VIP high-end customer, how best to set up the VIP, what does that VIP flow look like, how best to monetize the customers with a better and higher experience or unique experience.

First of all, in terms of the pace and why it's deploying faster, 2 things. One is I think we've been successful because of how effective it's been both with the NFL as well as our own buildings. We're just seeing tremendous demand by other venues that are saying we don't want to get left behind. We want to shift to digital so we can be getting that consumer data, understanding better control of the ticket as well. And our processes for deploying the systems actually going to the venues, changing the access control systems, we've gotten that working well very quickly. So I think that has led us over the course of this year to move our target for installations from 500 to 600 now to 700 installations.
So in terms of the long-term impact, clearly just for Ticketmaster, it's a fundamentally different value proposition that it provides through its venues now. It's no longer just selling a ticket but it is providing an important data service. So that's an important piece of just what Ticketmaster is.
And then we talked through there are a multitude of uses that the data will provide. It will support Ticketmaster and our concert business in terms of the effectiveness of their marketing, their ability to provide much more targeted information to fans based on what we think they're interested in. They'll be very important to our venue strategy in terms of being able to make offers to people based on what their past behavior is. It will be important for sponsors, for them to directly tie in sponsor, segments -- customer segments and targets where a few 100 million people are on-site. So the ability to do all of those things over the next several years, I think, will be tremendously important throughout the entire company."

And we absolutely believe that one of the factors during any economic slowdown is that provides the buffer. And that arbitrage gets eaten away before some of the fundamental demand hits our ticket. So that absolutely is a piece that gives us some greater comfort as we think about different economic cycles.
In terms of digital ticketing, the rollout, I think by the end of this year, we'll have 80% of the major building. One gating factor is just you're not going to have your NBA and NHL teams yet mid-season. So if they didn't shift before the start of the season, they won't shift between now and the end of the year. It would be when they take a break, again, during their next cycle. And then it's just a matter of getting to a lot of the smaller buildings."

Just on pricing, just to give some narrative, the press likes to talk sometimes about the ticket pricing of the high shows. Overall, concerts are at a very affordable price point. If you look at the average ticket pricing, the $60, average fans go to 2 or 3 shows a year. It's still a very affordable lifetime memory versus a trip or a vacation.
So in recession, we see that the consumer may pull back on high ticket items. They may not go on a vacation, may pull back on a new car. But to take his kids to Taylor Swift or his wife to a show or his friend, it's still a very, very affordable option that we know because they're lifetime moments and Kodak moments of your life. They still make sure they go to that local show at the arena or stadium or amphitheater because it's still incredibly affordable even if they're in a slight pullback on their cash spend.
Now I say that it also means we have -- why we believe the ticket is completely still underpriced, like those $8 billion to $10 billion in the secondary market on an ongoing basis, we still think that the front of the house is widely underpriced. And year-over-year, we'll make progress with the artists to keep pricing it better and taking some of that high-end opportunity into his pocket as well as lowering the price in the back end to get better -- full capacity.
So overall, we think the show is still a very affordable option in life, cheaper than a good dinner in a big picture with great pricing opportunity given we still think it is a very low-priced option if you compare it to an NBA game, a night at the theater, a front-row seat at an NFL game, et cetera. So we think concert is underpriced, lots of room for pricing, still affordable to everybody no matter where their economic situation lies. And we think the secondary is the proof that we have upside."

Obviously, you had cited some timing issues going into the quarter. The number of events in North America was up 15%. It looks like attendance for event was down close to 20%. So that's a pretty unusual mix for the third quarter. Does that reflect the lack of stadium shows basically? Or is there something else going on?"

So if you look at -- just to start, if you look at Q2 and Q3 together because we told you we were going to have more weight in Q2 this year, but those 2 quarters together is the core concert segment. The concert business is up about 4% on constant currency.
So first of all, you move a few points on the revenue side just because of the currency fluctuation. But really, what's going on, as we've told you over the past 9 months, is we have fewer stadium shows. We have about 30 fewer stadium shows this year than last year. And we've had tremendous growth in our theater shows, in particular, both in North America and internationally. Those stadium shows that we don't have are the highest-volume shows and also the highest average ticket price. Your theater shows are going to be a much lower average attendance and also a lower ticket price.
So all you're seeing is some mix shift going on. There still is, across all of the venue types, very strong sell-through demand. We talked about platinum tickets. We talked about all of the components. So the performance is very strong across the board. And then as we look at next year, we see a big uptick again in our stadium volume, which is what you get the first read on in the business. So we're doing very good. There's absolutely nothing you should read into this other than timing."
