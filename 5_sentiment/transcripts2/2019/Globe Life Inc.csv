In the fourth quarter, net income was $165 million or $1.45 per share compared to $1.03 billion or $8.71 per share a year ago.

In the fourth quarter, net income was $165 million or $1.45 per share compared to $1.03 billion or $8.71 per share a year ago. As a reminder, in the fourth quarter 2017, we recorded $874 million of net income primarily as a result of remeasuring our per tax assets and liabilities using the lower corporate tax rate.
Net operating income for the quarter was $177 million or $1.56 per share, a per share increase of 26% from a year ago. Excluding the impact of tax reform, we estimate that the growth would have been approximately 8%.
On a GAAP reported basis, return on equity as of December 31 was of 4.3%, and book value per share was $48.11. Excluding unrealized gains and losses on fixed maturities, return on equity was 14.6% and book value per share grew 11% to $44.32. In our life insurance operations, premium revenue increased 3% to $600 million, and life underwriting margin was $168 million, up 5% from a year ago. Growth in underwriting margin exceeded premium growth due to higher margins in Direct Response and our military business. In 2019, we expect life underwriting income to grow around 3% to 5%.
On the health side, premium revenue grew 5% to $257 million, and health underwriting margin was up 6% to $58 million. Growth in underwriting margin exceeded premium growth due to higher margins at Family Heritage and American Income. In 2019, we expect health underwriting income to grow around 2% to 4%.
Administrative expenses were $57 million for the quarter, up 5% from a year ago and in line with our expectations. As a percentage of premium, administrative expenses were 6.7% compared to 6.6% a year ago. For the full year, administrative expenses were $224 million or 6.5% of premium compared to 6.4% in 2017. In 2019, we expect administrative expenses to grow approximately 4% to 5% and to remain around 6.5% premium.
I'll now turn the call over to Larry for his comments on the marketing operations."

At American Income, life premiums were up 7% to $276 million and life underwriting margin was up 5% to $90 million. Net life sales were $54 million, down 2%. The average producing agent count for the fourth quarter was 6936, approximately the same as the year ago quarter but down 2% from the third quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the fourth quarter was 6894. Net life sales for the full year 2018 were flat due to lower growth in agent count and productivity. We have not seen any drop in union leads or the resilient sales.
As I mentioned last quarter, low unemployment across the country is having an impact on our agent growth. We continue to see growth in agent recruiting but we're seeing a drop on and -- for new agents due to unusually high number of other work opportunities. We are confident we can work through this event if unemployment rates persist at historically low levels and we're optimistic about future growth at American Income.
At Liberty National, life premiums were up 1% to $70 million. Our life underwriting margin was down 1% to $18 million. Net life sales increased 6% to $13 million. Net health sales were $6 million, up 9% from the year ago quarter. The average producing agent count for the fourth quarter was 2172, up 3% from a year ago or approximately the same as the third quarter. The producing agent count at Liberty National ended the quarter at 2159. Net life sales for the full year 2018 grew 5%. Net health sales for the full year 2018 grew 8%. The sales increase was driven by increases in agent count and agent productivity.
At our Direct Response operation at Globe Life, life premiums were up 1% to $200 million, and life underwriting margin increased 6% to $39 million. Net life sales were $29 million, the same as the year ago quarter. In the full year 2018, net life sales declined 7%. We continue to refine and adjust our marketing programs in an effort to maximize the profitability of new business.
At Family Heritage, health premiums increased 8% to $70 million, and health underwriting margin increased 15% to $18 million. Net health sales grew 3% to $15 million. The average producing agent count for the fourth quarter was 1129, up 10% from a year ago and up 4% from the third quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the quarter was 1097.
Net health sales for the full year 2018 grew 7%. At United American General Agency, health premiums increased 6% to $97 million. Net health sales were $30 million, up 7% compared to the year ago quarter.
To complete my discussion on the marketing operations, I will now provide some projections. We expect the producing agent count for each agency at the end of 2019 to be at the following ranges:  American Income, 2% to 4% growth; Liberty National, 2% to 11% growth; Family Heritage, 8% to 13% growth. Approximate life net sales trend for the full year 2019 are expected to be as follows: American Income, 4% to 8% growth; Liberty National, 2% to 10% growth; Direct Response, flat to 2% growth. For Direct Response, we expect to begin the year slowly and start to see sustainable growth at some point during the middle of the year.
Health net sales trends for the full year 2019 are expected to be as follows: Liberty National, 4% to 8% growth; Family Heritage, 5% to 9% growth; United American Individual Medicare Supplement, 4% to 8% growth.

First, excess investment income. Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income less required interest on the net policy liabilities and debt, was $62 million, a 7% increase over the year ago quarter. On a per-share basis, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program, excess investment income increased 10%. For the year, excess investment income grew by 2%, 6% on a per-share basis. In 2019, we expect excess investment income to grow around 5%, which would result in per share increase of around 9%.
Now regarding the investment portfolio. Invested assets were $16.6 billion, including $15.8 billion of fixed maturities and amortized costs. Out of the fixed maturities, $15.1 billion on invested rate with an average rating of A- and below investment grade bonds were $666 million compared to $702 million a year ago. The percentage of below investment-grade bonds at fixed maturities is 4.2% compared to 4.7% a year ago. This is the lowest percentage it has been since 2000. With a portfolio leverage of 3.2x compared to peer company average around 7x, the percentage of below investment-grade bonds with equity excluding net unrealized gains of fixed maturities is 13%, which is lower than the average of our peers.
Overall, the total portfolio is rated BBB+, same as the year ago. Bonds rated BBB are 58% of the fixed maturity portfolio, which is high relative to our peers. However, due to our low asset leverage, the percentage of BBBs to equity is line with peer companies. In addition, we have no exposure to higher risk assets such as derivatives or equities and little exposure to commercial mortgages and asset-backed securities.
Finally, we have net unrealized gains with fixed maturity portfolio of $544 million, approximately $225 million lower than the previous quarter due primarily to changes in market interest rates.
Regarding investment yield. In the fourth quarter, we invested $409 million investment-grade fixed maturities, primarily in the industrial, municipal and financial sectors. We invested at an average yield of 5.26% at an average rating of A- and an average life of 23 years. For the entire portfolio, the fourth quarter yield was 5.56%, down 5 basis points from the 5.61% yield in the fourth quarter of 2017. As of December 31, the portfolio yield was approximately 5.55%. Our 2019, at the midpoint of our current guidance, we're assuming an average new lending yield of 5% for the full year. Now I will turn the call over to Frank."

First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position. In the fourth quarter, we spent $122 million to buy 1.5 million Torchmark shares at an average price of $82.11. For the full year 2018, we spent $372",1194,"Thanks, Gary. First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position. In the fourth quarter, we spent $122 million to buy 1.5 million Torchmark shares at an average price of $82.11. For the full year 2018, we spent $372 million of parent company cash to acquire 4.4 million shares at an average price of $84.38. So far in 2019, we have a spent $29 million to purchase 359,000 shares at an average price of $79.56.
These purchases are being made from the parent company's excess cash flow. However, it should be noted that in December, due to significant pullback of the overall stock market, we accelerated approximately $25 million of repurchases from 2019 into 2018. These repurchases were made at an average price of approximately $76 and were paid from cash at the the parent and the issuance of commercial paper. 
The parent ended the year with liquid assets of approximately $41 million. In addition to these liquid assets, the parent will generate excess cash flow in 2019. The parent company's excess cash flow as we define as results primarily from the dividends received by the parent from its subsidiaries less the interest paid on debt and the dividends paid to Torchmark shareholders. While our 2018 statutory earnings have not yet been finalized, we expect excess cash flow in 2019 to be in the range of $350 million to $370 million. That's included in the assets on hand at the beginning of the year, we currently expect to have around $390 million to $410 million of cash and liquid assets available to the parent.
We anticipate using around $15 million of our 2019 excess cash flow to pay for the accelerated share repurchases by reducing commercial paper. That will leave around $375 million to $395 million available to the parent during the year, including the normal $50 million of parent assets we expect to retain. As noted on previous calls, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. If market conditions are favorable and absent alternatives with the higher value to the shareholders, we expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those funds.
Now regarding capital levels at our insurance subsidiaries. Our goal is to maintain capital at levels necessary to support our current ratings. After discussions with the rating agencies and as noted on the last call, Torchmark intends to target consolidated RBC ratio in the range of 300% to 325%. Although we have not finalized our 2018 statutory financial statements, we anticipate that our consolidated RBC ratio will be within that range at around 315% to 320%. For 2019, we expect the target ratio will remain in the 300% to 320% range.
As has been previously discussed, the National Association of Insurance Commissions, or the NAIC, is considering a change in the capital factors that relate to fixed maturity investments. These factors are commonly referred to as C1 factors. At this time, it is unclear when any of such changes might as there was not included on the agenda at the NAIC's leaders meeting. As such, we do not expect the implementation of any new C1 factors to occur before year-end 2020. If implemented, the new C1 factors would generally increase the amount of required capital for fixed maturity investments. Using our fixed maturity portfolio as of year-end 2018, we have estimated that the impact of the new factors would result in 30 to 35 point reduction in RBC percentage, requiring additional capital in the range of $175 million to $190 million to retain the same RBC percentage as before the change. Given our current incremental borrowing capacity as the holding company of approximately $475 million and our cash flow generation capabilities within our insurance operations, we are confident we will have the necessary resources to provide the additional capital if needed. Furthermore, any additional borrowings to fund the additional capital should not adversely impact earnings as the additional capital would be invested by the insurance companies in long-duration assets.
Given the maturity of the current credit cycle and the possibility that our fixed maturity portfolio experience some downgrades in the coming years, we have also stressed stress that the impact of downturn of the economy to have on our statutory capital and related RBC percentage. In this test, we utilize the same ratings migration and default rates that actually occurred in the 3-year period of 2008 through 2010 as published in Moody's annual default study. Under this severe scenario, our RBC ratio could decrease over the 3-year period by approximately 40 to 45 points, requiring approximately $200 million to $225 million to retain the same RBC percentage as before the downturn.
Again, our incremental borrowing capacity is well in excess of additional capital necessary, especially given the likelihood that any ratings migrations and defaults would likely occur over a period of time. Even more importantly, the parent company's ability to generate well over $300 million in excess cash flows on an annual basis provides additional confidence that we would have the liquidity necessary to address any capital needs in an economic downturn. As previously noted, the earnings impact of financing additional capital should not be significant since any proceeds will be invested in long-duration assets.
Next, a few comments on our operations. With respect to our Direct Response operations, the underwriting margin as a percent of premium in the quarter was 19% compared to 18% in the year ago quarter due to slightly favorable claims in the current quarter as well as lower amortization due to a fluctuation. The underwriting margin percentage for the full year 2018 was 17.8%, towards the higher end of the range provided on our last call. For 2019, we are estimating the underwriting percentage, margin percentage for the Direct Response to be approximately the same as in 2018 with a range between 17% and 18%. We also expect the underwriting margin percentage to be seasonally lower in the first 2 quarters versus the second half of the year.
With respect to our stock compensation expense, we anticipate an increase during the fourth quarter this year compared to last year, primarily attributable to the decrease in the tax rate and excess tax benefits in 2018. However, the expense for the fourth quarter was higher than we anticipated due to lower excess tax benefits than expected. The lower excess tax benefits right direct result of lower stock price in December, which greatly reduced the number of options exercised by our employees in the quarter. For 2019, at the midpoint of our guidance, we currently anticipate the expense to be a proximally the same as they have 2018. This is higher than our previous guidance and is primarily attributable to lower projections of excess tax benefits for the year.
Finally, with respect to our earnings guidance for 2019, we are projecting net operating income per share will be in the range of $6.50 to $6.70 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The $6.60 midpoint of this guidance is unchanged from our previous guidance.

I just wonder come under that kind of a stress scenario and then you layer on C1 factor changes, how do you think -- I mean, have you guys had conversations with the rating agencies as to how you think they would respond in that kind of scenario. do you think new incremental borrowings is sure up capital at the insurance that these would be that stable rating?"

We talk on earlier calls, they like to see debt-to-capital ratio be no greater than 30% to support our existing ratings. So the one thing that gives us hope for is as we think about some of the downgrades and default that they really should occur over a period of time. And as we take a look at the growth of our overall capital over a period of time should continue to grow. If we were to borrow $400 million, say, in the end of 2019, given our projected growth in our overall his socks and stockholders equity, we would still be a little less than 28% in a debt-to-cap ratio. So that's kind of assuming really worse case and all that's happened now. If that it happens over a period of several years, that our debt to cap ratio will be coming down from its current levels and gives even more capacity and I think, and I'd say that not from a standpoint that we want to use up all debt capacity but I think from a rating agency perspective that they would have comfort without getting too close to that maximum amount."

As a reminder, in the fourth quarter 2017, we recorded $874 million of net income primarily as a result of remeasuring our per tax assets and liabilities using the lower corporate tax rate.
Net operating income for the quarter was $177 million or $1.56 per share, a per share increase of 26% from a year ago. Excluding the impact of tax reform, we estimate that the growth would have been approximately 8%.
On a GAAP reported basis, return on equity as of December 31 was 4.3%, and book value per share was $48.11. Excluding unrealized gains and losses on fixed maturities, return on equity was 14.6% and book value per share grew 11% to $44.32. 
In our life insurance operations, premium revenue increased 3% to $600 million, and life underwriting margin was $168 million, up 5% from a year ago. Growth in underwriting margin exceeded premium growth due to higher margins in Direct Response and our military business. In 2019, we expect life underwriting income to grow around 3% to 5%.
On the health side, premium revenue grew 5% to $257 million, and health underwriting margin was up 6% to $58 million. Growth in underwriting margin exceeded premium growth due to higher margins at Family Heritage and American Income. In 2019, we expect health underwriting income to grow around 2% to 4%.
Administrative expenses were $57 million for the quarter, up 5% from a year ago and in line with our expectations. As a percentage of premium, administrative expenses were 6.7% compared to 6.6% a year ago. For the full year, administrative expenses were $224 million or 6.5% of premium, compared to 6.4% in 2017.

The average producing agent count for the fourth quarter was 6,936, approximately the same as the year-ago quarter, but down 2% from the third quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the fourth quarter was 6,894. 
Net life sales for the full year 2018 were flat due to the lack growth in agent count and productivity. We have not seen any drop in union leads or the resilient sales.
As I mentioned last quarter, low unemployment across the country is having an impact on our agent growth. We continue to see growth in agent recruiting, but we are seeing a dropoff in retention of new agents due to unusually high number of other work opportunities. We are confident we can work through this event if unemployment rates persist at these historically low levels, and we're optimistic about future growth at American Income.
At Liberty National, life premiums were up 1% to $70 million. Our life underwriting margin was down 1% to $18 million. Net life sales increased 6% to $13 million. And net health sales were $6 million, up 9% from the year-ago quarter. The average producing agent count for the fourth quarter was 2,172, up 3% from a year ago, but approximately the same as the third quarter. The producing agent count at Liberty National ended the quarter at 2,159. 
Net life sales for the full year of 2018 grew 5%. Net health sales for the full year of 2018 grew 8%. The sales increase was driven by increases in agent count and agent productivity.
At our Direct Response operation at Globe Life, life premiums were up 1% to $200 million, and life underwriting margin increased 6% to $39 million. Net life sales were $29 million, the same as the year-ago quarter. For the full year 2018, net life sales declined 7%. We continue to refine and adjust our marketing programs in an effort to maximize the profitability of new business.
At Family Heritage, health premiums increased 8% to $70 million, and health underwriting margin increased 15% to $18 million. Net health sales grew 3% to $15 million. The average producing agent count for the fourth quarter was 1,129, up 10% from a year ago and up 4% from the third quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the quarter was 1,097.
Net health sales for the full year 2018 grew 7%. At United American General Agency, health premiums increased 6% to $97 million. Net health sales were $30 million, up 7% compared to the year-ago quarter.
To complete my discussion on the marketing operations, I will now provide some projections. We expect the producing agent count for each agency at the end of 2019 to be at the following ranges:  American Income, 2% to 4% growth; Liberty National, 2% to 11% growth; Family Heritage, 8% to 13% growth. Approximate life net sales trends for the full year 2019 are expected to be as follows: American Income, 4% to 8% growth; Liberty National, 2% to 10% growth; Direct Response, flat to 2% growth. For Direct Response, we expect to begin the year slowly and start to see sustainable growth at some point during the middle of the year.
Health net sales trends for the full year 2019 are expected to be as follows: Liberty National, 4% to 8% growth; Family Heritage, 5% to 9% growth; United American Individual Medicare Supplement, 4% to 8% growth.

First, excess investment income. 
Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income less required interest on the net policy liabilities and debt, was $62 million, a 7% increase over the year-ago quarter. On a per-share basis reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program, excess investment income increased 10%. For the year, excess investment income grew by 2%; 6% on a per-share basis. In 2019, we expect excess investment income to grow around 5%, which would result in a per-share increase of around 9%.
Now regarding the investment portfolio. Invested assets were $16.6 billion, including $15.8 billion of fixed maturities and amortized costs. Out of the fixed maturities, $15.1 billion were investment grade with an average rating of A-, and below investment grade bonds were $666 million compared to $702 million a year ago. The percentage of below investment-grade bonds at fixed maturities is 4.2% compared to 4.7% a year ago. This is the lowest this percentage has been since 2000. With a portfolio leverage of 3.2x compared to peer company average of around 7x, the percentage of below investment-grade bonds of equity excluding net unrealized gains of fixed maturities is 13%, which is lower than the average of our peers.
Overall, the total portfolio is rated BBB+, same as the year ago. Bonds rated BBB are 58% of the fixed maturity portfolio, which is high relative to our peers. However, due to our low asset leverage, the percentage of BBBs to equity is in line with peer companies. In addition, we have no exposure to higher risk assets such as derivatives or equities, and little exposure to commercial mortgages and asset-backed securities.
Finally, we have net unrealized gains on the fixed maturity portfolio of $544 million, approximately $225 million lower than the previous quarter, due primarily to changes in market interest rates.
Regarding investment yield. In the fourth quarter, we invested $409 million in investment-grade fixed maturities, primarily in the industrial, municipal and financial sectors. We invested at an average yield of 5.26% at average rating of A- and an average life of 23 years. For the entire portfolio, the fourth quarter yield was 5.56%, down 5 basis points from the 5.61% yield in the fourth quarter of 2017. As of December 31, the portfolio yield was approximately 5.55%. For 2019, at the midpoint of our current guidance, we're assuming an average new money yield of 5% for the full year.

308916,599415219,1648475,"Torchmark Corporation, Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Feb 06, 2019",2019-02-06,"Earnings Calls","Globe Life Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Gary. First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position. In the fourth quarter, we spent $122 million to buy 1.5 million Torchmark shares at an average price of $82.11. For the full year 2018, we spent $3",1198,"Thanks, Gary. First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position. 
In the fourth quarter, we spent $122 million to buy 1.5 million Torchmark shares at an average price of $82.11. For the full year 2018, we spent $372 million of parent company cash to acquire 4.4 million shares at an average price of $84.38. So far in 2019, we have a spent $29 million to purchase 359,000 shares at an average price of $79.56.
These purchases are being made from the parent company's excess cash flow. However, it should be noted that in December, due to the significant pullback of the overall stock market, we accelerated approximately $25 million of repurchases from 2019 into 2018. These repurchases were made at an average price of approximately $76 and were paid from cash at the parent and the issuance of commercial paper. 
The parent ended the year with liquid assets of approximately $41 million. In addition to these liquid assets, the parent will generate excess cash flow in 2019. The parent company's excess cash flow, as we define it, results primarily from the dividends received by the parent from its subsidiaries less the interest paid on debt and the dividends paid to Torchmark shareholders. While our 2018 statutory earnings have not yet been finalized, we expect excess cash flow in 2019 to be in the range of $350 million to $370 million. Thus, included in the assets on-hand at the beginning of the year, we currently expect to have around $390 million to $410 million of cash and liquid assets available to the parent.
We anticipate using around $15 million of our 2019 excess cash flow to pay for the accelerated share repurchases by reducing commercial paper. That will leave around $375 million to $395 million available to the parent during the year, including the normal $50 million of parent assets we expect to retain. As noted on previous calls, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. If market conditions are favorable and absent alternatives with the higher value to the shareholders, we expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those funds.
Now regarding capital levels at our insurance subsidiaries. Our goal is to maintain capital at levels necessary to support our current ratings. After discussions with the rating agencies and as noted on the last call, Torchmark intends to target a consolidated RBC ratio in the range of 300% to 320%. Although we have not finalized our 2018 statutory financial statements, we anticipate that our consolidated RBC ratio will be within that range at around 315% to 320%. For 2019, we expect the target ratio will remain in the 300% to 320% range.
As has been previously discussed, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, or the NAIC, is considering a change in the capital factors that relate to fixed maturity investments. These factors are commonly referred to as C1 factors. At this time, it is unclear when any such changes might be implemented as it was not included on the agenda at the NAIC's latest meeting. As such, we do not expect the implementation of any new C1 factors to occur before year-end 2020. If implemented, the new C1 factors would generally increase the amount of required capital for fixed maturity investments. Using our fixed maturity portfolio as of year-end 2018, we have estimated that the impact of the new factors would result in a 30- to 35-point reduction in our RBC percentage, requiring additional capital in the range of $175 million to $190 million to retain the same RBC percentage as before the change. Given our current incremental borrowing capacity at the holding company of approximately $475 million and our cash flow generation capabilities within our insurance operations, we are confident we will have the necessary resources to provide the additional capital if needed. Furthermore, any additional borrowings to fund the additional capital should not adversely impact earnings as the additional capital would be invested by the insurance companies in long-duration assets.
Given the maturity of the current credit cycle and the possibility that our fixed maturity portfolio could experience some downgrades or defaults in the coming years, we have also stress-tested the impact a downturn in the economy could have on our statutory capital and related RBC percentage. In this test, we utilized the same ratings migration and default rates that actually occurred in the 3-year period of 2008 through 2010, as published in Moody's annual default study. Under this severe scenario, our RBC ratio could decrease over the 3-year period by approximately 40 to 45 points, requiring approximately $200 million to $225 million to retain the same RBC percentage as before the downturn.
Again, our incremental borrowing capacity is well in excess of the additional capital necessary, especially given the likelihood that any ratings migrations and defaults would likely occur over a period of time. Even more importantly, the parent company's ability to generate well over $300 million in excess cash flows on an annual basis provides additional confidence that we would have the liquidity necessary to address any capital needs in an economic downturn. As previously noted, the earnings impact of financing additional capital should not be significant since any proceeds will be invested in long-duration assets.
Next, a few comments on our operations. With respect to our Direct Response operations, the underwriting margin as a percent of premium in the quarter was 19% compared to 18% in the year-ago quarter due to slightly favorable claims in the current quarter as well as lower amortization due to a fluctuation. The underwriting margin percentage for the full year 2018 was 17.8%, towards the higher end of the range provided on our last call. For 2019, we are estimating the underwriting percentage -- margin percentage for the Direct Response to be approximately the same as in 2018, with a range between 17% and 18%. We also expect the underwriting margin percentage to be seasonally lower in the first 2 quarters versus the second half of the year.
With respect to our stock compensation expense, we anticipate an increase during the fourth quarter this year compared to last year, primarily attributable to the decrease in the tax rate and excess tax benefits in 2018. However, the expense for the fourth quarter was higher than we anticipated due to lower excess tax benefits than expected. The lower excess tax benefits were a direct result of the lower stock price in December, which greatly reduced the number of options exercised by our employees in the quarter. For 2019, at the midpoint of our guidance, we currently anticipate the expense to be approximately the same as in 2018. This is higher than our previous guidance and is primarily attributable to lower projections of excess tax benefits for the year.
Finally, with respect to our earnings guidance for 2019, we are projecting net operating income per share will be in the range of $6.50 to $6.70 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The $6.60 midpoint of this guidance is unchanged from our previous guidance.

And as we talked on earlier calls, they like to see that debt-to-cap ratio be no greater than 30% to support our existing ratings. So the one thing that gives us comfort is as we think about some of the downgrades and default, that they really should occur over a period of time. And as we take a look at the growth of our overall capital over a period of time, it should continue to grow. If we were to borrow $400 million, say, at the end of 2019, given our projected growth in our overall stockholders' equity, we would still be a little less than 28% in a debt-to-cap ratio. So that's kind of assuming, really worse case, that all this happened now. If that happens over a period of several years, that our debt to cap ratio will be coming down from its current levels and gives us even more capacity. And I think -- and I say that not from a standpoint that we want to use up all that capacity, but I think from a rating agency perspective, that they would have comfort without that we're not getting too close to that maximum amount."

In the fourth quarter, net income was $165 million or $1.45 per share, compared to $1.03 billion or $8.71 per share a year ago. As a reminder, in the fourth quarter 2017, we recorded $874 million of net income primarily as a result of remeasuring our per tax assets and liabilities using the lower corporate tax rate.
Net operating income for the quarter was $177 million or $1.56 per share, a per share increase of 26% from a year ago. Excluding the impact of tax reform, we estimate that the growth would have been approximately 8%.
On a GAAP reported basis, return on equity as of December 31 was 4.3%, and book value per share was $48.11. Excluding unrealized gains and losses on fixed maturities, return on equity was 14.6% and book value per share grew 11% to $44.32. 
In our life insurance operations, premium revenue increased 3% to $600 million, and life underwriting margin was $168 million, up 5% from a year ago. Growth in underwriting margin exceeded premium growth due to higher margins in Direct Response and our military business. In 2019, we expect life underwriting income to grow around 3% to 5%.
On the health side, premium revenue grew 5% to $257 million, and health underwriting margin was up 6% to $58 million. Growth in underwriting margin exceeded premium growth due to higher margins at Family Heritage and American Income. In 2019, we expect health underwriting income to grow around 2% to 4%.
Administrative expenses were $57 million for the quarter, up 5% from a year ago and in line with our expectations. As a percentage of premium, administrative expenses were 6.7% compared to 6.6% a year ago. For the full year, administrative expenses were $224 million or 6.5% of premium, compared to 6.4% in 2017. In 2019, we expect administrative expenses to grow approximately 4% to 5% and to remain around 6.5% of premium.
I will now turn the call over to Larry for his comments on the marketing operations."

At American Income, life premiums were up 7% to $276 million, and life underwriting margin was up 5% to $90 million. Net life sales were $54 million, down 2%.

At American Income, life premiums were up 7% to $276 million, and life underwriting margin was up 5% to $90 million. Net life sales were $54 million, down 2%. The average producing agent count for the fourth quarter was 6,936, approximately the same as the year-ago quarter, but down 2% from the third quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the fourth quarter was 6,894. 
Net life sales for the full year 2018 were flat due to the lack of growth in agent count and productivity. We have not seen any drop in union leads or the resilient sales.
As I mentioned last quarter, low unemployment across the country is having an impact on our agent growth. We continue to see growth in agent recruiting, but we are seeing a dropoff in retention of new agents due to the unusually high number of other work opportunities. We are confident we can work through this even if unemployment rates persist at these historically low levels, and we're optimistic about future growth at American Income.
At Liberty National, life premiums were up 1% to $70 million. Our life underwriting margin was down 1% to $18 million. Net life sales increased 6% to $13 million. And net health sales were $6 million, up 9% from the year-ago quarter. The average producing agent count for the fourth quarter was 2,172, up 3% from a year ago, but approximately the same as the third quarter. The producing agent count at Liberty National ended the quarter at 2,159. 
Net life sales for the full year of 2018 grew 5%. Net health sales for the full year of 2018 grew 8%. The sales increase was driven by increases in agent count and agent productivity.
At our Direct Response operation at Globe Life, life premiums were up 1% to $200 million, and life underwriting margin increased 6% to $39 million. Net life sales were $29 million, the same as the year-ago quarter. For the full year 2018, net life sales declined 7%. We continue to refine and adjust our marketing programs in an effort to maximize the profitability of new business.
At Family Heritage, health premiums increased 8% to $70 million, and health underwriting margin increased 15% to $18 million. Net health sales grew 3% to $15 million. The average producing agent count for the fourth quarter was 1,129, up 10% from a year ago and up 4% from the third quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the quarter was 1,097.
Net health sales for the full year 2018 grew 7%. At United American General Agency, health premiums increased 6% to $97 million. Net health sales were $30 million, up 7% compared to the year-ago quarter.
To complete my discussion on the marketing operations, I will now provide some projections. We expect the producing agent count for each agency at the end of 2019 to be at the following ranges:  American Income, 2% to 4% growth; Liberty National, 2% to 11% growth; Family Heritage, 8% to 13% growth. Approximate life net sales trends for the full year 2019 are expected to be as follows: American Income, 4% to 8% growth; Liberty National, 2% to 10% growth; Direct Response, flat to 2% growth. For Direct Response, we expect to begin the year slowly and then start to see sustainable growth at some point during the middle of the year.
Health net sales trends for the full year 2019 are expected to be as follows: Liberty National, 4% to 8% growth; Family Heritage, 5% to 9% growth; United American Individual Medicare Supplement, 4% to 8% growth.

308916,599415219,1648556,"Torchmark Corporation, Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Feb 06, 2019",2019-02-06,"Earnings Calls","Globe Life Inc.","Executives","I want to spend a few minutes discussing our investment operations. First, excess investment income. Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income less required interest on the net policy liabilities and debt, was $62 million, a 7%",423,"I want to spend a few minutes discussing our investment operations. First, excess investment income. 
Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income less required interest on the net policy liabilities and debt, was $62 million, a 7% increase over the year-ago quarter. On a per-share basis reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program, excess investment income increased 10%. For the year, excess investment income grew by 2%; 6% on a per-share basis. In 2019, we expect excess investment income to grow around 5%, which would result in a per-share increase of around 9%.
Now regarding the investment portfolio. Invested assets were $16.6 billion, including $15.8 billion of fixed maturities and amortized costs. Of the fixed maturities, $15.1 billion were investment grade with an average rating of A-, and below investment grade bonds were $666 million compared to $702 million a year ago. The percentage of below investment-grade bonds at fixed maturities is 4.2% compared to 4.7% a year ago. This is the lowest this percentage has been since 2000. With a portfolio leverage of 3.2x compared to peer company average of around 7x, the percentage of below investment-grade bonds of equity excluding net unrealized gains of fixed maturities is 13%, which is lower than the average of our peers.
Overall, the total portfolio is rated BBB+, same as a year ago. Bonds rated BBB are 58% of the fixed maturity portfolio, which is high relative to our peers. However, due to our low asset leverage, the percentage of BBBs to equity is in line with peer companies. In addition, we have no exposure to higher risk assets such as derivatives or equities, and little exposure to commercial mortgages and asset-backed securities.
Finally, we have net unrealized gains in the fixed maturity portfolio of $544 million, approximately $225 million lower than the previous quarter, due primarily to changes in market interest rates.
Regarding investment yield. In the fourth quarter, we invested $409 million in investment-grade fixed maturities, primarily in the industrial, municipal and financial sectors. We invested at an average yield of 5.26% at average rating of A- and an average life of 23 years. For the entire portfolio, the fourth quarter yield was 5.56%, down 5 basis points from the 5.61% yield in the fourth quarter of 2017. As of December 31, the portfolio yield was approximately 5.55%. For 2019, at the midpoint of our current guidance, we're assuming an average new money yield of 5% for the full year. 
Now I will turn the call over to Frank."
308916,599415219,1648556,"Torchmark Corporation, Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Feb 06, 2019",2019-02-06,"Earnings Calls","Globe Life Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Gary. First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position. In the fourth quarter, we spent $122 million to buy 1.5 million Torchmark shares at an average price of $82.11. For the full year 2018, we spent $3",1198,"Thanks, Gary. First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position. 
In the fourth quarter, we spent $122 million to buy 1.5 million Torchmark shares at an average price of $82.11. For the full year 2018, we spent $372 million of parent company cash to acquire 4.4 million shares at an average price of $84.38. So far in 2019, we have spent $29 million to purchase 359,000 shares at an average price of $79.56.
These purchases are being made from the parent company's excess cash flow. However, it should be noted that in December, due to the significant pullback of the overall stock market, we accelerated approximately $25 million of repurchases from 2019 into 2018. These repurchases were made at an average price of approximately $76 and were paid from cash at the parent and the issuance of commercial paper. 
The parent ended the year with liquid assets of approximately $41 million. In addition to these liquid assets, the parent will generate excess cash flow in 2019. The parent company's excess cash flow, as we define it, results primarily from the dividends received by the parent from its subsidiaries less the interest paid on debt and the dividends paid to Torchmark shareholders. While our 2018 statutory earnings have not yet been finalized, we expect excess cash flow in 2019 to be in the range of $350 million to $370 million. Thus, included in the assets on hand at the beginning of the year, we currently expect to have around $390 million to $410 million of cash and liquid assets available to the parent.
We anticipate using around $15 million of our 2019 excess cash flow to pay for the accelerated share repurchases by reducing commercial paper. That will leave around $375 million to $395 million available to the parent during the year, including the normal $50 million of parent assets we expect to retain. As noted on previous calls, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. If market conditions are favorable and absent alternatives with the higher value to the shareholders, we expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those funds.
Now regarding capital levels at our insurance subsidiaries. Our goal is to maintain capital at levels necessary to support our current ratings. After discussions with the rating agencies and as noted on the last call, Torchmark intends to target a consolidated RBC ratio in the range of 300% to 320%. Although we have not finalized our 2018 statutory financial statements, we anticipate that our consolidated RBC ratio will be within that range at around 315% to 320%. For 2019, we expect the target ratio will remain in the 300% to 320% range.
As has been previously discussed, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, or the NAIC, is considering a change in the capital factors that relate to fixed maturity investments. These factors are commonly referred to as C1 factors. At this time, it is unclear when any such changes might be implemented as it was not included on the agenda at the NAIC's latest meeting. As such, we do not expect the implementation of any new C1 factors to occur before year-end 2020. If implemented, the new C1 factors would generally increase the amount of required capital for fixed maturity investments. Using our fixed maturity portfolio as of year-end 2018, we have estimated that the impact of the new factors would result in a 30- to 35-point reduction in our RBC percentage, requiring additional capital in the range of $175 million to $190 million to retain the same RBC percentage as before the change. Given our current incremental borrowing capacity at the holding company of approximately $475 million and our cash flow generation capabilities within our insurance operations, we are confident we will have the necessary resources to provide the additional capital if needed. Furthermore, any additional borrowings to fund the additional capital should not adversely impact earnings as the additional capital would be invested by the insurance companies in long-duration assets.
Given the maturity of the current credit cycle and the possibility that our fixed maturity portfolio could experience some downgrades or defaults in the coming years, we have also stress-tested the impact a downturn in the economy could have on our statutory capital and related RBC percentage. In this test, we utilized the same ratings migration and default rates that actually occurred in the 3-year period of 2008 through 2010, as published in Moody's annual default study. Under this severe scenario, our RBC ratio could decrease over the 3-year period by approximately 40 to 45 points, requiring approximately $200 million to $225 million to retain the same RBC percentage as before the downturn.
Again, our incremental borrowing capacity is well in excess of the additional capital necessary, especially given the likelihood that any ratings migrations and defaults would likely occur over a period of time. Even more importantly, the parent company's ability to generate well over $300 million in excess cash flows on an annual basis provides additional confidence that we would have the liquidity necessary to address any capital needs in an economic downturn. As previously noted, the earnings impact of financing additional capital should not be significant since any proceeds will be invested in long-duration assets.
Next, a few comments on our operations. With respect to our Direct Response operations, the underwriting margin as a percent of premium in the quarter was 19% compared to 18% in the year-ago quarter due to slightly favorable claims in the current quarter as well as lower amortization due to a fluctuation. The underwriting margin percentage for the full year 2018 was 17.8%, towards the higher end of the range provided on our last call. For 2019, we are estimating the underwriting percentage -- margin percentage for the Direct Response to be approximately the same as in 2018, with a range between 17% and 18%. We also expect the underwriting margin percentage to be seasonally lower in the first 2 quarters versus the second half of the year.
With respect to our stock compensation expense, we anticipate an increase during the fourth quarter this year compared to last year, primarily attributable to the decrease in the tax rate and excess tax benefits in 2018. However, the expense for the fourth quarter was higher than we anticipated due to lower excess tax benefits than expected. The lower excess tax benefits were a direct result of the lower stock price in December, which greatly reduced the number of options exercised by our employees in the quarter. For 2019, at the midpoint of our guidance, we currently anticipate the expense to be approximately the same as in 2018. This is higher than our previous guidance and is primarily attributable to lower projections of excess tax benefits for the year.
Finally, with respect to our earnings guidance for 2019, we are projecting net operating income per share will be in the range of $6.50 to $6.70 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The $6.60 midpoint of this guidance is unchanged from our previous guidance.

And as we talked on earlier calls, they like to see that debt-to-cap ratio be no greater than 30% to support our existing ratings. So the one thing that gives us comfort is as we think about some of the downgrades and default, that they really should occur over a period of time. And as we take a look at the growth of our overall capital over a period of time, it should continue to grow. If we were to borrow $400 million, say, at the end of 2019, given our projected growth in our overall stockholders' equity, we would still be a little less than 28% in a debt-to-cap ratio. So that's kind of assuming, really worse case, that all this happened now. If that happens over a period of several years, that our debt-cap ratio will be coming down from its current levels and gives us even more capacity. And I think -- and I say that not from a standpoint that we want to use up all that capacity, but I think from a rating agency perspective, that they would have comfort that we're not getting too close to that maximum amount."

I think there's a difference in the 3 agencies, too, is that American Income is located in urban areas, versus the other 2 companies have a more rural presence. Internet recruiting is a much bigger -- higher for recruiting at American Income than the other 2 agencies. Why it seems low in employment is that those resumes continue to be contacted by other potential employers, and so the drop we've seen in the catch has been 3-month retention, not 12-month retention. What we're encouraged by is that we saw an increase in recruiting at American Income of 6% in 2018. Unfortunately, the terminations of those new agents was just above that level, that's why we did not have agency growth. I think we'll see this settle down.

And it does take a couple of years before the profits of the new sales and of the higher sales pay back that front-year investment. And then it takes several years. Ultimately, you end up -- totally negates it over a period of 7 or 8 years.

In the fourth quarter, net income was $165 million or $1.45 per share, compared to $1.03 billion or $8.71 per share a year ago. As a reminder, in the fourth quarter 2017, we recorded $874 million of net income primarily as a result of remeasuring our per tax assets and liabilities using the lower corporate tax rate.
Net operating income for the quarter was $177 million or $1.56 per share, a per share increase of 26% from a year ago. Excluding the impact of tax reform, we estimate that the growth would have been approximately 8%.
On a GAAP reported basis, return on equity as of December 31 was 4.3%, and book value per share was $48.11. Excluding unrealized gains and losses on fixed maturities, return on equity was 14.6% and book value per share grew 11% to $44.32. 
In our life insurance operations, premium revenue increased 3% to $600 million, and life underwriting margin was $168 million, up 5% from a year ago. Growth in underwriting margin exceeded premium growth due to higher margins in Direct Response and our military business. In 2019, we expect life underwriting income to grow around 3% to 5%.
On the health side, premium revenue grew 5% to $257 million, and health underwriting margin was up 6% to $58 million. Growth in underwriting margin exceeded premium growth due to higher margins at Family Heritage and American Income. In 2019, we expect health underwriting income to grow around 2% to 4%.
Administrative expenses were $57 million for the quarter, up 5% from a year ago and in line with our expectations. As a percentage of premium, administrative expenses were 6.7% compared to 6.6% a year ago. For the full year, administrative expenses were $224 million or 6.5% of premium, compared to 6.4% in 2017. In 2019, we expect administrative expenses to grow approximately 4% to 5% and to remain around 6.5% of premium.

The average producing agent count for the fourth quarter was 6,936, approximately the same as the year-ago quarter, but down 2% from the third quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the fourth quarter was 6,894. 
Net life sales for the full year 2018 were flat due to the lack of growth in agent count and productivity. We have not seen any drop in union leads or the resilient sales.
As I mentioned last quarter, low unemployment across the country is having an impact on our agent growth. We continue to see growth in agent recruiting, but we are seeing a dropoff in retention of new agents due to the unusually high number of other work opportunities. We are confident we can work through this even if unemployment rates persist at these historically low levels, and we're optimistic about future growth at American Income.
At Liberty National, life premiums were up 1% to $70 million. Our life underwriting margin was down 1% to $18 million. Net life sales increased 6% to $13 million. And net health sales were $6 million, up 9% from the year-ago quarter. The average producing agent count for the fourth quarter was 2,172, up 3% from a year ago, but approximately the same as the third quarter. The producing agent count at Liberty National ended the quarter at 2,159. 
Net life sales for the full year of 2018 grew 5%. Net health sales for the full year of 2018 grew 8%. The sales increase was driven by increases in agent count and agent productivity.
At our Direct Response operation at Globe Life, life premiums were up 1% to $200 million, and life underwriting margin increased 6% to $39 million. Net life sales were $29 million, the same as the year-ago quarter. For the full year 2018, net life sales declined 7%. We continue to refine and adjust our marketing programs in an effort to maximize the profitability of new business.
At Family Heritage, health premiums increased 8% to $70 million, and health underwriting margin increased 15% to $18 million. Net health sales grew 3% to $15 million. The average producing agent count for the fourth quarter was 1,129, up 10% from a year ago and up 4% from the third quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the quarter was 1,097.
Net health sales for the full year 2018 grew 7%. At United American General Agency, health premiums increased 6% to $97 million. Net health sales were $30 million, up 7% compared to the year-ago quarter.
To complete my discussion on the marketing operations, I will now provide some projections. We expect the producing agent count for each agency at the end of 2019 to be at the following ranges: American Income, 2% to 4% growth; Liberty National, 2% to 11% growth; Family Heritage, 8% to 13% growth. Approximate life net sales trends for the full year 2019 are expected to be as follows: American Income, 4% to 8% growth; Liberty National, 2% to 10% growth; Direct Response, flat to 2% growth. For Direct Response, we expect to begin the year slowly and then start to see sustainable growth at some point during the middle of the year.
Health net sales trends for the full year 2019 are expected to be as follows: Liberty National, 4% to 8% growth; Family Heritage, 5% to 9% growth; United American Individual Medicare Supplement, 4% to 8% growth.

Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income less required interest on the net policy liabilities and debt, was $62 million, a 7%",423,"I want to spend a few minutes discussing our investment operations. First, excess investment income. 
Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income less required interest on the net policy liabilities and debt, was $62 million, a 7% increase over the year-ago quarter. On a per-share basis reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program, excess investment income increased 10%. For the year, excess investment income grew by 2%; 6% on a per-share basis. In 2019, we expect excess investment income to grow around 5%, which would result in a per-share increase of around 9%.
Now regarding the investment portfolio. Invested assets were $16.6 billion, including $15.8 billion of fixed maturities and amortized costs. Of the fixed maturities, $15.1 billion were investment grade with an average rating of A-, and below investment grade bonds were $666 million compared to $702 million a year ago. The percentage of below investment-grade bonds at fixed maturities is 4.2% compared to 4.7% a year ago. This is the lowest this percentage has been since 2000. With a portfolio leverage of 3.2x compared to peer company average of around 7x, the percentage of below investment-grade bonds of equity excluding net unrealized gains of fixed maturities is 13%, which is lower than the average of our peers.
Overall, the total portfolio is rated BBB+, same as a year ago. Bonds rated BBB are 58% of the fixed maturity portfolio, which is high relative to our peers. However, due to our low asset leverage, the percentage of BBBs to equity is in line with peer companies. In addition, we have no exposure to higher risk assets such as derivatives or equities, and little exposure to commercial mortgages and asset-backed securities.
Finally, we have net unrealized gains in the fixed maturity portfolio of $544 million, approximately $225 million lower than the previous quarter, due primarily to changes in market interest rates.
Regarding investment yield. In the fourth quarter, we invested $409 million in investment-grade fixed maturities, primarily in the industrial, municipal and financial sectors. We invested at an average yield of 5.26% at average rating of A- and an average life of 23 years. For the entire portfolio, the fourth quarter yield was 5.56%, down 5 basis points from the 5.61% yield in the fourth quarter of 2017. As of December 31, the portfolio yield was approximately 5.55%. For 2019, at the midpoint of our current guidance, we're assuming an average new money yield of 5% for the full year.

308916,599415219,1649977,"Torchmark Corporation, Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Feb 06, 2019",2019-02-06,"Earnings Calls","Globe Life Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Gary. First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position. In the fourth quarter, we spent $122 million to buy 1.5 million Torchmark shares at an average price of $82.11. For the full year 2018, we spent $3",1198,"Thanks, Gary. First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position. 
In the fourth quarter, we spent $122 million to buy 1.5 million Torchmark shares at an average price of $82.11. For the full year 2018, we spent $372 million of parent company cash to acquire 4.4 million shares at an average price of $84.38. So far in 2019, we have spent $29 million to purchase 359,000 shares at an average price of $79.56.
These purchases are being made from the parent company's excess cash flow. However, it should be noted that in December, due to the significant pullback of the overall stock market, we accelerated approximately $25 million of repurchases from 2019 into 2018. These repurchases were made at an average price of approximately $76 and were paid from cash at the parent and the issuance of commercial paper. 
The parent ended the year with liquid assets of approximately $41 million. In addition to these liquid assets, the parent will generate excess cash flow in 2019. The parent company's excess cash flow, as we define it, results primarily from the dividends received by the parent from its subsidiaries less the interest paid on debt and the dividends paid to Torchmark shareholders. While our 2018 statutory earnings have not yet been finalized, we expect excess cash flow in 2019 to be in the range of $350 million to $370 million. Thus, included in the assets on hand at the beginning of the year, we currently expect to have around $390 million to $410 million of cash and liquid assets available to the parent.
We anticipate using around $15 million of our 2019 excess cash flow to pay for the accelerated share repurchases by reducing commercial paper. That will leave around $375 million to $395 million available to the parent during the year, including the normal $50 million of parent assets we expect to retain. As noted on previous calls, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. If market conditions are favorable and absent alternatives with the higher value to the shareholders, we expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those funds.
Now regarding capital levels at our insurance subsidiaries. Our goal is to maintain capital at levels necessary to support our current ratings. After discussions with the rating agencies and as noted on the last call, Torchmark intends to target a consolidated RBC ratio in the range of 300% to 320%. Although we have not finalized our 2018 statutory financial statements, we anticipate that our consolidated RBC ratio will be within that range at around 315% to 320%. For 2019, we expect the target ratio will remain in the 300% to 320% range.
As has been previously discussed, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, or the NAIC, is considering a change in the capital factors that relate to fixed maturity investments. These factors are commonly referred to as C1 factors. At this time, it is unclear when any such changes might be implemented as it was not included on the agenda at the NAIC's latest meeting. As such, we do not expect the implementation of any new C1 factors to occur before year-end 2020. If implemented, the new C1 factors would generally increase the amount of required capital for fixed maturity investments. Using our fixed maturity portfolio as of year-end 2018, we have estimated that the impact of the new factors would result in a 30- to 35-point reduction in our RBC percentage, requiring additional capital in the range of $175 million to $190 million to retain the same RBC percentage as before the change. Given our current incremental borrowing capacity at the holding company of approximately $475 million and our cash flow generation capabilities within our insurance operations, we are confident we will have the necessary resources to provide the additional capital if needed. Furthermore, any additional borrowings to fund the additional capital should not adversely impact earnings as the additional capital would be invested by the insurance companies in long-duration assets.
Given the maturity of the current credit cycle and the possibility that our fixed maturity portfolio could experience some downgrades or defaults in the coming years, we have also stress-tested the impact a downturn in the economy could have on our statutory capital and related RBC percentage. In this test, we utilized the same ratings migration and default rates that actually occurred in the 3-year period of 2008 through 2010, as published in Moody's annual default study. Under this severe scenario, our RBC ratio could decrease over the 3-year period by approximately 40 to 45 points, requiring approximately $200 million to $225 million to retain the same RBC percentage as before the downturn.
Again, our incremental borrowing capacity is well in excess of the additional capital necessary, especially given the likelihood that any ratings migrations and defaults would likely occur over a period of time. Even more importantly, the parent company's ability to generate well over $300 million in excess cash flows on an annual basis provides additional confidence that we would have the liquidity necessary to address any capital needs in an economic downturn. As previously noted, the earnings impact of financing additional capital should not be significant since any proceeds will be invested in long-duration assets.
Next, a few comments on our operations. With respect to our Direct Response operations, the underwriting margin as a percent of premium in the quarter was 19% compared to 18% in the year-ago quarter due to slightly favorable claims in the current quarter as well as lower amortization due to a fluctuation. The underwriting margin percentage for the full year 2018 was 17.8%, towards the higher end of the range provided on our last call. For 2019, we are estimating the underwriting percentage -- margin percentage for the Direct Response to be approximately the same as in 2018, with a range between 17% and 18%. We also expect the underwriting margin percentage to be seasonally lower in the first 2 quarters versus the second half of the year.
With respect to our stock compensation expense, we anticipate an increase during the fourth quarter this year compared to last year, primarily attributable to the decrease in the tax rate and excess tax benefits in 2018. However, the expense for the fourth quarter was higher than we anticipated due to lower excess tax benefits than expected. The lower excess tax benefits were a direct result of the lower stock price in December, which greatly reduced the number of options exercised by our employees in the quarter. For 2019, at the midpoint of our guidance, we currently anticipate the expense to be approximately the same as in 2018. This is higher than our previous guidance and is primarily attributable to lower projections of excess tax benefits for the year.
Finally, with respect to our earnings guidance for 2019, we are projecting net operating income per share will be in the range of $6.50 to $6.70 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The $6.60 midpoint of this guidance is unchanged from our previous guidance.

And as we talked on earlier calls, they like to see that debt-to-cap ratio be no greater than 30% to support our existing ratings. So the one thing that gives us comfort is as we think about some of the downgrades and default, that they really should occur over a period of time. And as we take a look at the growth of our overall capital over a period of time, it should continue to grow. If we were to borrow $400 million, say, at the end of 2019, given our projected growth in our overall stockholders' equity, we would still be a little less than 28% in a debt-to-cap ratio. So that's kind of assuming, really worse case, that all this happened now. If that happens over a period of several years, that our debt-cap ratio will be coming down from its current levels and gives us even more capacity. And I think -- and I say that not from a standpoint that we want to use up all that capacity, but I think from a rating agency perspective, that they would have comfort that we're not getting too close to that maximum amount."

Internet recruiting is a much bigger -- higher for recruiting at American Income than the other 2 agencies. Why it seems low in employment is that those resumes continue to be contacted by other potential employers, and so the drop we've seen in the catch has been 3-month retention, not 12-month retention. What we're encouraged by is that we saw an increase in recruiting at American Income of 6% in 2018.

At Liberty National, life premiums were up 2% to $71 million while life underwriting margin was up 10% to $18 million. Net life sales increased 8% to $12 million and net health sales were $6 million, up 12% from the year ago quarter.
The sales growth was driven by increases in both agent count and productivity. The average producing agent count for the first quarter was 2,179, up 4% from the year ago quarter but approximately the same as the fourth quarter. The producing agent count at Liberty National ended the quarter 2,297.
At our Direct Response operation at Globe Life, life premiums were up 3% to $218 million and life underwriting margin increased 11% to $37 million. Net life sales were $32 million, up 1% from the year ago quarter. In recent years, we have focused primarily on maximizing profit dollars while adjusting our marketing efforts to stabilize margins. As we go forward, we expect to grow both sales and profits.
At Family Heritage, health premiums increased 8% to $71 million and health underwriting margin increased 14% to $18 million. Net health sales were down 3% to $13 million. The average producing agent count for the first quarter was 1,002, up 1% from the year ago quarter but down 11% from the fourth quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the quarter was 1,020.
At United American General Agency, health premiums increased 9% to $103 million. Net health sales were $15 million, up 5% compared to the year ago quarter.
To complete my discussion on marketing operations, I will now provide some projections. Approximate net life sales for the full year 2019 are expected to be as follows: American Income, 5% to 9% growth; Liberty National, 7% to 11% growth; Direct Response, flat to 2% growth. Approximate net health sales for the full year 2019 are expected to be as follows: Liberty National, 6% to 10% growth; Family Heritage, 2% to 6% growth; United American Individual Medicare Supplement, 4% to 8% growth.
I will now turn the call back to Gary."

First, excess investment income.Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income less required interest on net policy liabilities, was $66 million, a 6% increase over the",405,"I will spend a few minutes discussing our investment operations. First, excess investment income.
Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income less required interest on net policy liabilities, was $66 million, a 6% increase over the year ago quarter. On a per-share basis, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program, excess investment income increased 9%. For the full year, we expect excess investment income to grow by about 5%, which would result in a per-share increase of around 9%.
Regarding investment portfolio. Invested assets were $16.9 billion, including $16 billion of fixed maturities at amortized costs. Of the fixed maturities, $15.3 billion are investment-grade with an average rating of A-, and below investment-grade bonds were $671 million compared to $688 million a year ago. The percentage of below investment-grade bonds at fixed maturities is 4.2% compared to 4.5% a year ago. Overall, the total portfolio is rated BBB+, same as a year ago. 
Bonds rated BBB are 57% of the fixed maturities portfolio, which is high relative to our peers. However, we have no exposure to higher-risk assets such as derivatives or equities and little exposure to commercial mortgages and asset-backed securities.
Finally, we have net unrealized gains in the fixed maturity portfolio of $1.2 billion, $691 million higher than the previous quarter due primarily to changes in market interest rates. 
investment yield, in the first quarter, we invested $451 million in investment-grade fixed maturities, primarily in municipal and financial sectors. We invested at an average yield of 4.88%, an average rating of A+ and an average life of 28 years.
For the entire portfolio, the first quarter yield was 5.53%, down 5 basis points from the 5.58% yield in the first quarter of 2018. As of March 31, the portfolio yield was approximately 5.51%. For 2019, the average new money yield assume that the midpoint of our guidance is 4.90% for the full year.
While we would like to see higher interest rates going forward, Torchmark is driving a lower-for-longer interest rate environment. A continued low interest rate environment will impact our income statement and not the GAAP or excess to our balance sheets since we primarily sell noninterest and protection products accounted for under FAS 60. While we would benefit from higher interest rates, Torchmark will continue to earn substantial excess investment income due to an extended low interest rate environment.
Now I'll turn the call over to Frank."
308916,609962652,1701033,"Torchmark Corporation, Q1 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 18, 2019",2019-04-18,"Earnings Calls","Globe Life Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Gary. First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position.The parent ended the year with liquid assets of $41 million. In addition to these liquid assets, the parent will generate excess cash flow in 2019.",626,"Thanks, Gary. First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position.
The parent ended the year with liquid assets of $41 million. In addition to these liquid assets, the parent will generate excess cash flow in 2019. With parent company's excess cash flow, as we define it, results primarily from the dividends received by the parent from its subsidiaries less the interest paid on debt and the dividends paid to Torchmark shareholders. We anticipate our excess cash flow in 2019 will be the range of $365 million to $375 million. Thus, including the assets on hand at the beginning of the year, we currently expect to have around $405 million to $415 million available to the parent during the year.
As discussed on the prior call, we accelerated $25 million of 2019 repurchases of Torchmark stock into December 2018 with commercial paper and parent cash. We plan to utilize $50 million of the 2019 excess cash flow to reduce a commercial paper for those repurchases. As such, we expect to have approximately $390 million to $400 million to be available to the parent for other uses, including the $50 million of liquid assets we normally retain at the parent.
In the first quarter, we spent $89 million to buy 1.1 million Torchmark shares at an average price of $81.32. So far in April, we have spent $11 million to purchase 131,000 shares at an average price of $84.61. Thus, for the full year through today, we expect $100 million of parent company cash to acquire more than 1 million shares at an average price of $81.68.
Excluding the $100 million spent on repurchases so far this year and the $50 million we plan on retaining at the parent, we will have approximately $240 million to $250 million of excess cash flow available to the parent for the remainder of the year.
As noted on previous calls, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. If market conditions are favorable and absent alternatives with higher value to our shareholders, we expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those funds.
Now regarding capital levels at our insurance subsidiaries. Our goal is to maintain capital at levels necessary to support our current ratings. As discussed on our previous calls, Torchmark intends to target a consolidated company action-level RBC ratio in the range of 300% to 320%. At December 31, 2018, our consolidated RBC ratio was 326%, slightly greater than the high point of our range. The increased RBC ratio was primarily attributable to slightly lower required capital and higher statutory earnings than anticipated.
At this RBC ratio, we have approximately $129 million of capital at the insurance subsidiary over the amount required at the low end of our consolidated RBC target of 300%. This excess capital, along with the $50 million of assets held at the parent, provide approximately $179 million that are available to fund possible needs in the insurance companies should they arise.
In addition, due to the fact that deferred tax assets were in place in 2018 with marketable securities purchased with capital contributions, the quality of our capital has substantially improved.
Finally, with respect to our earnings guidance for 2019. We are projecting that our operating income per share will be in the range of $6.61 to $6.75 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The $6.68 midpoint of this guidance reflects an $0.08 increase over the prior quarter midpoint of $6.60, primarily attributable to an improved outlook on our underwriting results due to lower policy obligations that's anticipated in the first quarter largely attributable to our life insurance operations.

On a GAAP reported basis, return on equity as of March 31 was 12.9% and book value per share was $54.13. Excluding unrealized gains and losses on fixed maturities, return on equity was 14.7% and book value per share grew 11% to $45.45.
In our life insurance operations, premium revenue increased 4% to $624 million, and life underwriting margin was $170 million, up 10% from a year ago. Growth in underwriting margin exceeded premium growth due to higher margins in all distribution channels. For the year, we expect life underwriting income to grow around 4% to 6%.
On the health side, premium revenue increased 6% to $267 million, and health underwriting margin also grew 6% to $62 million. For the year, we expect health underwriting income to grow around 3% to 5%.
Administrative expenses were $59 million for the quarter, up 7% from a year ago and in line with our expectations.

The average producing agent count for the first quarter was 6,865, up 1% from the year ago quarter but down 1% from the fourth quarter. However, the producing agent count at the end of the first quarter was 7,233.
At Liberty National, life premiums were up 2% to $71 million while life underwriting margin was up 10% to $18 million. Net life sales increased 8% to $12 million and net health sales were $6 million, up 12% from the year ago quarter.
The sales growth was driven by increases in both agent count and productivity. The average producing agent count for the first quarter was 2,179, up 4% from the year ago quarter but approximately the same as the fourth quarter. The producing agent count at Liberty National ended the quarter at 2,297.
At our Direct Response operation at Globe Life, life premiums were up 3% to $218 million and life underwriting margin increased 11% to $37 million. Net life sales were $32 million, up 1% from the year ago quarter. In recent years, we have focused primarily on maximizing profit dollars while adjusting our marketing efforts to stabilize margins. As we go forward, we expect to grow both sales and profits.
At Family Heritage, health premiums increased 8% to $71 million and health underwriting margin increased 14% to $18 million. Net health sales were down 3% to $13 million.

First, excess investment income.
Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income less required interest on net policy liabilities and debt, was $66 million, a 6% increase over the year ago quarter. On a per-share basis, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program, excess investment income increased 9%. For the full year, we expect excess investment income to grow by about 5%, which would result in a per-share increase of around 9%.
Regarding the investment portfolio. Invested assets were $16.9 billion, including $16 billion of fixed maturities at amortized cost. Of the fixed maturities, $15.3 billion are investment-grade with an average rating of A-, and below investment-grade bonds were $671 million compared to $688 million a year ago. The percentage of below investment-grade bonds at fixed maturities is 4.2% compared to 4.5% a year ago. Overall, the total portfolio is rated BBB+, same as a year ago. 
Bonds rated BBB are 57% of the fixed maturity portfolio, which is higher relative to our peers. However, we have no exposure to higher-risk assets such as derivatives or equities and little exposure to commercial mortgages and asset-backed securities.
Finally, we have net unrealized gains in the fixed maturity portfolio of $1.2 billion, $691 million higher than the previous quarter due primarily to changes in market interest rates. 
As to investment yield, in the first quarter, we invested $451 million in investment-grade fixed maturities, primarily in municipal and financial sectors. We invested at an average yield of 4.88%, an average rating of A+ and an average life of 28 years.
For the entire portfolio, the first quarter yield was 5.53%, down 5 basis points from the 5.58% yield in the first quarter of 2018. As of March 31, the portfolio yield was approximately 5.51%. For 2019, the average new money yield assumed at the midpoint of our guidance is 4.90% for the full year.
While we would like to see higher interest rates going forward, Torchmark is driving a lower-for-longer interest rate environment. A continued low interest rate environment will impact our income statement but not the GAAP or statutory balance sheets since we primarily sell noninterest-sensitive protection products accounted for under FAS 60. While we would benefit from higher interest rates, Torchmark will continue to earn substantial excess investment income in an extended low interest rate environment.
Now I'll turn the call over to Frank."
308916,609962652,1701094,"Torchmark Corporation, Q1 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 18, 2019",2019-04-18,"Earnings Calls","Globe Life Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Gary. First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position.The parent ended the year with liquid assets of $41 million. In addition to these liquid assets, the parent will generate excess cash flow in 2019.",625,"Thanks, Gary. First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position.
The parent ended the year with liquid assets of $41 million. In addition to these liquid assets, the parent will generate excess cash flow in 2019. The parent company's excess cash flow, as we define it, results primarily from the dividends received by the parent from its subsidiaries less the interest paid on debt and the dividends paid to Torchmark shareholders. We anticipate our excess cash flow in 2019 will be the range of $365 million to $375 million. Thus, including the assets on hand at the beginning of the year, we currently expect to have around $405 million to $415 million available to the parent during the year.
As discussed on the prior call, we accelerated $25 million of 2019 repurchases of Torchmark stock into December 2018 with commercial paper and parent cash. We plan to utilize $50 million of the 2019 excess cash flow to reduce the commercial paper for those repurchases. As such, we expect to have approximately $390 million to $400 million to be available to the parent for other uses, including the $50 million of liquid assets we normally retain at the parent.
In the first quarter, we spent $89 million to buy 1.1 million Torchmark shares at an average price of $81.32. So far in April, we have spent $11 million to purchase 131,000 shares at an average price of $84.61. Thus, for the full year through today, have spent $100 million of parent company cash to acquire more than 1 million shares at an average price of $81.68.
Excluding the $100 million spent on repurchases so far this year and the $50 million we plan on retaining at the parent, we will have approximately $240 million to $250 million of excess cash flow available to the parent for the remainder of the year.
As noted on previous calls, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. If market conditions are favorable and absent alternatives with higher value to our shareholders, we expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those funds.
Now regarding capital levels at our insurance subsidiaries. Our goal is to maintain capital at levels necessary to support our current ratings. As discussed on our previous call, Torchmark intends to target a consolidated company action-level RBC ratio in the range of 300% to 320%. At December 31, 2018, our consolidated RBC ratio was 326%, slightly greater than the high point of our range. The increased RBC ratio was primarily attributable to slightly lower required capital and higher statutory earnings than anticipated.
At this RBC ratio, we have approximately $129 million of capital at the insurance subsidiary over the amount required at the low end of our consolidated RBC target of 300%. This excess capital, along with the $50 million of assets held at the parent, provide approximately $179 million that are available to fund possible needs in the insurance companies should they arise.
In addition, due to the fact that deferred tax assets were replaced in 2018 with marketable securities purchased with capital contributions, the quality of our capital has substantially improved.
Finally, with respect to our earnings guidance for 2019. We are projecting that our operating income per share will be in the range of $6.61 to $6.75 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The $6.68 midpoint of this guidance reflects an $0.08 increase over the prior quarter midpoint of $6.60, primarily attributable to an improved outlook on our underwriting results due to lower policy obligations than anticipated in the first quarter largely attributable to our life insurance operations.

In our life insurance operations, premium revenue increased 4% to $624 million, and life underwriting margin was $170 million, up 10% from a year ago.

However, the producing agent count at the end of the first quarter was 7,233.
At Liberty National, life premiums were up 2% to $71 million while life underwriting margin was up 10% to $18 million. Net life sales increased 8% to $12 million and net health sales were $6 million, up 12% from the year ago quarter.
The sales growth was driven by increases in both agent count and productivity. The average producing agent count for the first quarter was 2,179, up 4% from the year ago quarter but approximately the same as the fourth quarter. The producing agent count at Liberty National ended the quarter at 2,297.
At our Direct Response operation at Globe Life, life premiums were up 3% to $218 million and life underwriting margin increased 11% to $37 million. Net life sales were $32 million, up 1% from the year ago quarter. In recent years, we have focused primarily on maximizing profit dollars while adjusting our marketing efforts to stabilize margins. As we go forward, we expect to grow both sales and profits.
At Family Heritage, health premiums increased 8% to $71 million and health underwriting margin increased 14% to $18 million. Net health sales were down 3% to $13 million.

First, excess investment income.
Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income less required interest on net policy liabilities and debt, was $66 million, a 6% increase over the year ago quarter. On a per-share basis, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program, excess investment income increased 9%. For the full year, we expect excess investment income to grow by about 5%, which would result in a per-share increase of around 9%.
Regarding the investment portfolio. Invested assets were $16.9 billion, including $16 billion of fixed maturities at amortized cost. Of the fixed maturities, $15.3 billion are investment-grade with an average rating of A-, and below investment-grade bonds were $671 million compared to $688 million a year ago. The percentage of below investment-grade bonds at fixed maturities is 4.2% compared to 4.5% a year ago. Overall, the total portfolio is rated BBB+, same as a year ago. 
Bonds rated BBB are 57% of the fixed maturity portfolio, which is high relative to our peers. However, we have no exposure to higher-risk assets such as derivatives or equities and little exposure to commercial mortgages and asset-backed securities.
Finally, we have net unrealized gains in the fixed maturity portfolio of $1.2 billion, $691 million higher than the previous quarter due primarily to changes in market interest rates. 
As to investment yield, in the first quarter, we invested $451 million in investment-grade fixed maturities, primarily in the municipal and financial sectors. We invested at an average yield of 4.88%, an average rating of A+ and an average life of 28 years.
For the entire portfolio, the first quarter yield was 5.53%, down 5 basis points from the 5.58% yield in the first quarter of 2018. As of March 31, the portfolio yield was approximately 5.51%. For 2019, the average new money yield assumed at the midpoint of our guidance is 4.90% for the full year.
While we would like to see higher interest rates going forward, Torchmark can thrive in a lower-for-longer interest rate environment. A continued low interest rate environment will impact our income statement but not the GAAP or our statutory balance sheets since we primarily sell noninterest-sensitive protection products accounted for under FAS 60. While we would benefit from higher interest rates, Torchmark will continue to earn substantial excess investment income in an extended low interest rate environment.
Now I'll turn the call over to Frank."
308916,609962652,1701247,"Torchmark Corporation, Q1 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 18, 2019",2019-04-18,"Earnings Calls","Globe Life Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Gary. First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position.The parent ended the year with liquid assets of $41 million. In addition to these liquid assets, the parent will generate excess cash flow in 2019.",626,"Thanks, Gary. First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position.
The parent ended the year with liquid assets of $41 million. In addition to these liquid assets, the parent will generate excess cash flow in 2019. The parent company's excess cash flow, as we define it, results primarily from the dividends received by the parent from its subsidiaries less the interest paid on debt and the dividends paid to Torchmark shareholders. We anticipate our excess cash flow in 2019 will be the range of $365 million to $375 million. Thus, including the assets on hand at the beginning of the year, we currently expect to have around $405 million to $415 million available to the parent during the year.
As discussed on the prior call, we accelerated $25 million of 2019 repurchases of Torchmark stock into December 2018 with commercial paper and parent cash. We plan to utilize $50 million of the 2019 excess cash flow to reduce the commercial paper for those repurchases. As such, we expect to have approximately $390 million to $400 million to be available to the parent for other uses, including the $50 million of liquid assets we normally retain at the parent.
In the first quarter, we spent $89 million to buy 1.1 million Torchmark shares at an average price of $81.32. So far in April, we have spent $11 million to purchase 131,000 shares at an average price of $84.61. Thus, for the full year through today, we have spent $100 million of parent company cash to acquire more than 1 million shares at an average price of $81.68.
Excluding the $100 million spent on repurchases so far this year and the $50 million we plan on retaining at the parent, we will have approximately $240 million to $250 million of excess cash flow available to the parent for the remainder of the year.
As noted on previous calls, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. If market conditions are favorable and absent alternatives with higher value to our shareholders, we expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those funds.
Now regarding capital levels at our insurance subsidiaries. Our goal is to maintain capital at levels necessary to support our current ratings. As discussed on our previous call, Torchmark intends to target a consolidated company action-level RBC ratio in the range of 300% to 320%. At December 31, 2018, our consolidated RBC ratio was 326%, slightly greater than the high point of our range. The increased RBC ratio was primarily attributable to slightly lower required capital and higher statutory earnings than anticipated.
At this RBC ratio, we have approximately $129 million of capital at the insurance subsidiary over the amount required at the low end of our consolidated RBC target of 300%. This excess capital, along with the $50 million of assets held at the parent, provide approximately $179 million that are available to fund possible needs in the insurance companies should they arise.
In addition, due to the fact that deferred tax assets were replaced in 2018 with marketable securities purchased with capital contributions, the quality of our capital has substantially improved.
Finally, with respect to our earnings guidance for 2019. We are projecting that net operating income per share will be in the range of $6.61 to $6.75 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The $6.68 midpoint of this guidance reflects an $0.08 increase over the prior quarter midpoint of $6.60, primarily attributable to an improved outlook on our underwriting results due to lower policy obligations than anticipated in the first quarter, largely attributable to our life insurance operations.

The sales growth was driven by increases in both agent count and productivity.

First, excess investment income.
Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income less required interest on net policy liabilities and debt, was $66 million, a 6% increase over the year ago quarter. On a per-share basis, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program, excess investment income increased 9%. For the full year, we expect excess investment income to grow by about 5%, which would result in a per-share increase of around 9%.
Regarding the investment portfolio. Invested assets were $16.9 billion, including $16 billion of fixed maturities at amortized cost. Of the fixed maturities, $15.3 billion are investment-grade with an average rating of A-, and below investment-grade bonds were $671 million compared to $688 million a year ago. The percentage of below investment-grade bonds at fixed maturities is 4.2% compared to 4.5% a year ago. Overall, the total portfolio is rated BBB+, same as a year ago. 
Bonds rated BBB are 57% of the fixed maturity portfolio, which is high relative to our peers. However, we have no exposure to higher-risk assets such as derivatives or equities and little exposure to commercial mortgages and asset-backed securities.
Finally, we have net unrealized gains in the fixed maturity portfolio of $1.2 billion, $691 million higher than the previous quarter due primarily to changes in market interest rates. 
As to investment yield, in the first quarter, we invested $451 million in investment-grade fixed maturities, primarily in the municipal and financial sectors. We invested at an average yield of 4.88%, an average rating of A+ and an average life of 28 years.
For the entire portfolio, the first quarter yield was 5.53%, down 5 basis points from the 5.58% yield in the first quarter of 2018. As of March 31, the portfolio yield was approximately 5.51%. For 2019, the average new money yield assumed at the midpoint of our guidance is 4.90% for the full year.
While we would like to see higher interest rates going forward, Torchmark can thrive in a lower-for-longer interest rate environment. A continued low interest rate environment will impact our income statement but not the GAAP or our statutory balance sheets since we primarily sell noninterest-sensitive protection products accounted for under FAS 60. While we would benefit from higher interest rates, Torchmark will continue to earn substantial excess investment income in an extended low interest rate environment.
Now I'll turn the call over to Frank."
308916,609962652,1704457,"Torchmark Corporation, Q1 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 18, 2019",2019-04-18,"Earnings Calls","Globe Life Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Gary. First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position.The parent ended the year with liquid assets of $41 million. In addition to these liquid assets, the parent will generate excess cash flow in 2019.",626,"Thanks, Gary. First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position.
The parent ended the year with liquid assets of $41 million. In addition to these liquid assets, the parent will generate excess cash flow in 2019. The parent company's excess cash flow, as we define it, results primarily from the dividends received by the parent from its subsidiaries less the interest paid on debt and the dividends paid to Torchmark shareholders. We anticipate our excess cash flow in 2019 will be the range of $365 million to $375 million. Thus, including the assets on hand at the beginning of the year, we currently expect to have around $405 million to $415 million available to the parent during the year.
As discussed on the prior call, we accelerated $25 million of 2019 repurchases of Torchmark stock into December 2018 with commercial paper and parent cash. We plan to utilize $50 million of the 2019 excess cash flow to reduce the commercial paper for those repurchases. As such, we expect to have approximately $390 million to $400 million to be available to the parent for other uses, including the $50 million of liquid assets we normally retain at the parent.
In the first quarter, we spent $89 million to buy 1.1 million Torchmark shares at an average price of $81.32. So far in April, we have spent $11 million to purchase 131,000 shares at an average price of $84.61. Thus, for the full year through today, we have spent $100 million of parent company cash to acquire more than 1 million shares at an average price of $81.68.
Excluding the $100 million spent on repurchases so far this year and the $50 million we plan on retaining at the parent, we will have approximately $240 million to $250 million of excess cash flow available to the parent for the remainder of the year.
As noted on previous calls, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. If market conditions are favorable and absent alternatives with higher value to our shareholders, we expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those funds.
Now regarding capital levels at our insurance subsidiaries. Our goal is to maintain capital at levels necessary to support our current ratings. As discussed on our previous call, Torchmark intends to target a consolidated company action-level RBC ratio in the range of 300% to 320%. At December 31, 2018, our consolidated RBC ratio was 326%, slightly greater than the high point of our range. The increased RBC ratio was primarily attributable to slightly lower required capital and higher statutory earnings than anticipated.
At this RBC ratio, we have approximately $129 million of capital at the insurance subsidiary over the amount required at the low end of our consolidated RBC target of 300%. This excess capital, along with the $50 million of assets held at the parent, provide approximately $179 million that are available to fund possible needs in the insurance companies should they arise.
In addition, due to the fact that deferred tax assets were replaced in 2018 with marketable securities purchased with capital contributions, the quality of our capital has substantially improved.
Finally, with respect to our earnings guidance for 2019. We are projecting that net operating income per share will be in the range of $6.61 to $6.75 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The $6.68 midpoint of this guidance reflects an $0.08 increase over the prior quarter midpoint of $6.60, primarily attributable to an improved outlook on our underwriting results due to lower policy obligations than anticipated in the first quarter, largely attributable to our life insurance operations.

On the health side, premium revenue grew 6% to $266 million and health underwriting margin was up 1% to $60 million. Growth in premium exceeded underwriting margin growth primarily due to lower margins at United American. For the year, we expect count underwriting income to grow around 3% to 4%.

Net life sales were $34 million, down 2% from the year ago quarter. Year-to-date, sales were flat. As we go forward, we expect to grow our sales and profits. 
At Family Heritage, health premiums increased 8% to $73 million, and health underwriting margin increased 14% to $18 million. Net health sales were up 9% to $17 million due primarily to increased agent productivity.

First, excess investment income. Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income less required interest on net positive -- in debt was $65 million, an 8% increase over the year ago quarter. 
On a per-share basis, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program, excess investment income increased 12%. Year-to-date, excess investment income is up 7% in dollars to 10% per share. For the full year 2019, we expect excess investment income to grow about 5%, which will result in a per share increase around 8% to 9%.
Invested assets are $16.9 billion, including $16 billion of fixed maturities at amortized costs. Now the fixed maturities, $15.3 billion on investment grade with an average rating of A- and below investment grade bonds are $646 million compared to $688 million a year ago. The percentage of below investment-grade bonds to fixed maturities is 4.0% compared to 4.5% a year ago. This is the lowest this ratio has been in the last 20 years.
Overall, the total portfolio is rated BBB+, same as the year ago quarter. Bonds rated BBB are 56% of the fixed maturity portfolio as compared to 58% at the end of 2018. While this ratio is higher relative to our peers, we have no exposure to higher risk assets such as derivatives or equities and little exposure to commercial mortgages and asset-backed securities. We believe that BBB securities provide us the best risk-adjusted capital adjusted returns due in large part of our unique ability to hold the securities for maturity regardless of the fluctuations in interest rates or equity markets.
Finally, we have net unrealized gains for the fixed maturity portfolio of $2 billion, $715 million higher than the previous quarter due primarily to changes in market interest rates. 
Regarding investment yield, in the second quarter, we invested $253 million in investment-grade fixed maturities primarily in the financial and industrial sectors. We invested at an average yield of 4.95%, an average rating of A- and an average life of 29 years. For the entire portfolio, the second quarter yield was 5.50%, down 7 basis points from the 5.57% yield in the second quarter of 2019.
As of June 30, the portfolio yield was approximately 5.50%. At the midpoint of our guidance, we are assuming an average new lending rate of around 4.5% for the remainder of 2019.
While we would like to see how interest rates going forward, we can private lower to longer interest rate environment. Extended low interest rates will not impact the GAAP or statutory balance sheets under current accounting rules since we sell noninterest protected products. While our net investment income will be impacted by the continued lower interest rate environment, our excess investment income will still grow. It just won't grow at the same rate as the invested assets.

We anticipate our excess cash flow in 2019 to be in the range of $365 million to $375 million. Thus, including the assets on hand at the beginning of the year, we currently expect to have around $405 million to $415 million available to the parent during the year.
As discussed on prior calls, we accelerated the repurchases of $25 million of Torchmark's stock into December 2018 with commercial paper and parent cash. We have utilized $15 million of the 2019 excess cash flow to reduce the commercial paper for those repurchases. As such, we expect to have approximately $390 million to $400 million to be available to the parent for other uses, including the $50 million of liquid assets we normally retain at the parent.
In the second quarter, we spent $85.4 million to buy 979,000 Torchmark shares at an average price of $87.18. Including the $88.6 million spent for repurchases in the first quarter and the $16 million spent so far in July, we have spent $190 million of parent company thus does far in 2019 to acquire more than 2.2 million shares at an average price of $84.67. Taking into account the $190 million spent on year-to-date repurchases and the $50 million we plan on retaining at the parent, we will have approximately $150 million to $160 million of excess cash flow available to the parent for the remainder of the year.
As noted on previous calls, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. If market conditions are favorable and absent alternatives higher value to our shareholders, we expected share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those stocks.
Now regarding capital levels at our insurance subsidiaries. Our goal is to maintain capital at levels necessary to support our current rates. As discussed on our previous call, Torchmark intends to target a consolidate company action level RBC ratio in the range of 300% to 320% for 2019.
Finally, with respect to our earnings guidance. We are projecting the net operating income per share will be in the range of $6.67 to $6.77 for the year-end December 31, 2019. The $6.72 midpoint of this guidance reflects a $0.04 increase over the prior quarter midpoint of $6.68 primarily attributable to the favorable underwriting result in the second quarter and an improved outlook on life underwriting income for the second half of the year. These positive adjustments are offset somewhat by slightly lower expectations of excess investment income and health underwriting income for the remaining part of the year.
Those are my comments. I will now turn the call back to Larry."

We announced yesterday that Torchmark will be renamed Globe Life Inc. on August 8. We will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange as GL. The name change reflects the company's commitment to an enterprise-wide brand alignment to enhance sales and recruit to improve, name recognition. We chose the Globe Life name to capitalize on the running investments we've made in recent years at Globe Life Asset Insurance Company. These investments have increased more fame recognition and improved sales in Texas and the surrounding states. All the individual insurance subsidiaries will continue to exist as legal entities and retain their unique cultures and marked initiatives who have all eventually used and take advantage of the Globe Life brand. Our operating companies have been successful using their own brands. Despite a lack in name recognition of our strategic recruits and respected customers, we expect unified brand name and resilient name recognition to expand that success. Over time, branding will significantly enhance our ability to recruit agents and reach new customers.
We expect this initiative to evolve over a number of years and create a strong unified brand. As we go forward, we will maintain our usual disciplined approach to expense management to ensure branding has a positive effect on recruiting, sales and underwriting income.
Lastly, we announced earlier today that Globe Life is the official life insurance of the Dallas Cowboys. We are excited about this new relationship. It provides a great opportunity to strengthen Globe Life's brand recognition in a cost-effective manner. Those are our comments. We will open the call up for questions."

So way gives you confidence that things or the inside or that things are going to get better in the second half? And then secondly on American Income, there were a lot of concerns last year on how the strong economy was going to affect your ability to go through it and also just how your sales are going to be affected by the Supreme Court decision related to unions.

With respect to American Income, the Supreme Court decision has had no effect on our sales or recruiting on persistency. I think the third question has to do with agent retention. And what we've seen in agent retention is that in the first and second quarter, the increase in agent counts such as reflect an increase in year-over-year recruiting. The short term is positive such as terminations and slowdown compared to the new agent appointments. For the year, our guidance will be in agent count between 7200 and 7,500, and we expect that, that will be the case of the sales growth equal the agent growth in the second quarter, and that's because new agents are generally less productive and then for several months compared to -- agents."

Now on our life insurance operations, premium revenue increased 5% to $631 million and life underwriting margin was $175 million, up 9% from a year ago.

On the health side, premium revenue grew 6% to $266 million and health underwriting margin was up 1% to $60 million.

For the full year 2019, we expect excess investment income to grow about 5%, which will result in a per share increase of around 8% to 9%.
Invested assets are $16.9 billion, including $16 billion of fixed maturities at amortized cost. On the fixed maturities, $15.3 billion are investment grade with an average rating of A-, and below investment-grade bonds are $646 million compared to $688 million a year ago. The percentage of below investment-grade bonds to fixed maturities is 4.0% compared to 4.5% a year ago. This is the lowest this ratio has been in the last 20 years.
Overall, the total portfolio is rated BBB+, same as the year ago quarter. Bonds rated BBB are 56% of the fixed maturity portfolio as compared to 58% at the end of 2018. While this ratio is higher relative to our peers, we have no exposure to higher risk assets such as derivatives or equities and little exposure to commercial mortgages and asset-backed securities. 
We believe the BBB securities provide us the best risk-adjusted, capital-adjusted returns due in large part to our unique ability to hold the securities to maturity regardless of the fluctuations in interest rates or equity markets.
Finally, we have net unrealized gains in the fixed maturity portfolio of $2 billion, $715 million higher than the previous quarter due primarily to changes in market interest rates.  
Regarding investment yield, in the second quarter, we invested $253 million in investment-grade fixed maturities primarily in the financial and industrial sectors. We invested at an average yield of 4.95%, an average rating of A- and an average life of 29 years. 
For the entire portfolio, the second quarter yield was 5.50%, down 7 basis points from the 5.57% yield in the second quarter of 2019. As of June 30, the portfolio yield was approximately 5.50%. At the midpoint of our guidance, we're assuming an average new money rate of around 4.5% for the remainder of 2019.
While we would like to see higher interest rates going forward, we can thrive at a lower-for-longer interest rate environment. Extended low interest rates will not impact the GAAP or statutory balance sheets under current accounting rules since we sell noninterest-sensitive protection products. While our net investment income will be impacted in the continuing low interest rate environment, our excess investment income will still grow, it just won't grow at the same rate as the invested assets.
Now I'll turn the call over to Frank."
308916,629810132,1779069,"Torchmark Corporation, Q2 2019 Earnings Call, Jul 25, 2019",2019-07-25,"Earnings Calls","Globe Life Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Gary. First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position. The parent began the year with liquid assets of $41 million. In addition to these liquid assets, the parent is generating excess cash flow in 2019. T",516,"Thanks, Gary. First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position. The parent began the year with liquid assets of $41 million. In addition to these liquid assets, the parent is generating excess cash flow in 2019. The parent company's excess cash flow, as we define it, results primarily from the dividends received by the parent from its subsidiaries less the interest paid on debt and of the dividends paid to Torchmark shareholders. 
We anticipate our excess cash flow in 2019 to be in the range of $365 million to $375 million. Thus, including the assets on hand at the beginning of the year, we currently expect to have around $405 million to $415 million available to the parent during the year.
As discussed on prior calls, we accelerated the repurchases of $25 million of Torchmark's stock into December 2018 with commercial paper and parent cash. We had utilized $15 million of the 2019 excess cash flow to reduce the commercial paper for those repurchases. As such, we expect to have approximately $390 million to $400 million to be available to the parent for other uses, including the $50 million of liquid assets we normally retain at the parent.
In the second quarter, we spent $85.4 million to buy 979,000 Torchmark shares at an average price of $87.18. Including the $88.6 million spent for repurchases in the first quarter and the $16 million spent so far in July, we have spent $190 million of parent company cash thus far in 2019 to acquire more than 2.2 million shares at an average price of $84.67. 
Taking into account the $190 million spent on year-to-date repurchases and the $50 million we plan on retaining at the parent, we will have approximately $150 million to $160 million of excess cash flow available to the parent for the remainder of the year.
As noted on previous calls, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. If market conditions are favorable and absent alternatives with higher value to our shareholders, we expected share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those funds.
Now regarding capital levels at our insurance subsidiaries. Our goal is to maintain capital at levels necessary to support our current rates. As discussed on our previous call, Torchmark intends to target a consolidated company action level RBC ratio in the range of 300% to 320% for 2019.
Finally, with respect to our earnings guidance. We are projecting the net operating income per share will be in the range of $6.67 to $6.77 for the year-end December 31, 2019. The $6.72 midpoint of this guidance reflects a $0.04 increase over the prior quarter midpoint of $6.68, primarily attributable to the favorable underwriting result in the second quarter and an improved outlook on life underwriting income for the second half of the year. These positive adjustments are offset somewhat by slightly lower expectations of excess investment income and health underwriting income for the remaining part of the year.
Those are my comments. I will now turn the call back to Larry."

We announced yesterday that Torchmark will be renamed Globe Life Inc. on August 8. We will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange as GL. The name change reflects the company's commitment to an enterprise-wide brand alignment to enhance sales and recruitment to improve, name recognition. 
We chose the Globe Life name to capitalize on the branding investments we've made in recent years at Globe Life and Accident Insurance Company. These investments have increased Globe's name recognition, and improved sales in Texas and the surrounding states. All the individual insurance subsidiaries will continue to exist as legal entities and retain their unique cultures and market niches and will all eventually use and take advantage of the Globe Life brand. 
Our operating companies have been successful using their own brands. Despite a lack of name recognition among agent recruits and prospective customers, we expect unified brand name and resilient name recognition to expand that success. Over time, branding will significantly enhance our ability to recruit agents and reach new customers.
We expect this initiative to evolve over a number of years and create a strong unified brand. As we go forward, we will maintain our usual disciplined approach to expense management to ensure branding has a positive effect on recruiting, sales and underwriting income.
Lastly, we announced earlier today that Globe Life is now the official life insurance of the Dallas Cowboys. We are excited about this new relationship. It provides a great opportunity to strengthen Globe Life's brand recognition in a cost-effective manner. 
Those are our comments. We will open the call up for questions."

With respect to American Income, the Supreme Court decision has had no effect on our sales, our recruiting or our persistency. 
Jimmy, I think the third question had to do with agent retention. And what we've seen on agent retention is that in the first and second quarter, the increase in agent count seems to reflect an increase in our year-over-year recruiting. The short term is positive since terminations have slowed down compared to the new agent appointments. But for the year, our guidance will be -- in agent count is between 7,200 and 7,500, and we expect that, that will be the case. But the sales growth didn't equal the agent growth in the second quarter, and that's because new agents are generally less productive and then for several months as compared to veteran agents."

Now on our life insurance operations, premium revenue increased 5% to $631 million and life underwriting margin was $175 million, up 9% from a year ago. Growth in underwriting margin exceeded premium growth due to a higher percentage of premium margins in all distribution channels. For the year, we expect life underwriting income to grow around 6% to 7%.
On the health side, premium revenue grew 6% to $266 million and health underwriting margin was up 1% to $60 million. Growth in premium exceeded underwriting margin growth primarily due to lower margins at United American. For the year, we expect health underwriting income to grow around 3% to 4%.  
Administrative expenses were $59 million for the quarter, up 7% from a year ago and in line with our expectations.

At American Income, life premiums were up 7% to $288 million and life underwriting margin was up 9% to $97 million. Net life sales were $61 million, up 2%. The average producing agent count for the second quarter was 7,364, up 4% from the year ago quarter and up 7% from the first quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the second quarter was 7,477.  
At Liberty National, life premiums were up 3% to $71 million and life underwriting margin was up 6% to $18 million. Health premiums were down 1% to $47 million and the health underwriting margin was down 4% to $12 million. Net life sales increased 4% to $13 million and net health sales were $6 million, up 11% from the year ago quarter. The sales growth was driven primarily by agent count growth. 
The average producing agent count for the second quarter was 2,290, up 5% from the year ago quarter and up 5% from the first quarter. The producing agent count at Liberty National ended the quarter 2,390. 
In our Direct Response operation at Globe Life, life insurance were up 4% to $217 million and life underwriting margin increased 9% to $39 million. Net life sales were $34 million, down 2% from the year ago quarter. Year-to-date, sales are flat. As we go forward, we expect to grow both sales and profits.  
At Family Heritage, health premiums increased 8% to $73 million and health underwriting margin increased 14% to $18 million. Net health sales were up 9% to $17 million due primarily to increased agent productivity. The average producing agent count for the second quarter was 1,081, up 3% from the year ago quarter and up 8% from the first quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the quarter was 1,089.
At United American General Agency, health premiums increased 9% to $102 million. Our margins declined 8% to $14 million. Net health sales were $17 million, up 24% compared to the year ago quarter.
To complete my discussion of the market operations, I will now provide some projections. We expect the producing agent count for each agency at the end of 2019 to be in the following ranges: American Income, 7,200 to 7,500; Liberty National, 2,300 to 2,500; Family Heritage, 1,175 to 1,225.
Approximate net life sales for the full year 2019 are expected to be as follows: American Income, 5% to 9% growth; Liberty National, 9% to 13% growth; Direct Response, flat to 2% growth.  
Approximate net health sales for the full year 2019 are expected to be as follows: Liberty National, 7% to 11% growth; Family Heritage, 3% to 7% growth; United American individual Medicare Supplement, 7% to 13% growth.
I'll now turn the call back to Gary."
308916,629810132,1781355,"Torchmark Corporation, Q2 2019 Earnings Call, Jul 25, 2019",2019-07-25,"Earnings Calls","Globe Life Inc.","Executives","I want to spend a few minutes discussing our investment operations. First, excess investment income. Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income less required interest on net policy liabilities and debt, was $65 million, an 8% incre",485,"I want to spend a few minutes discussing our investment operations. First, excess investment income. Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income less required interest on net policy liabilities and debt, was $65 million, an 8% increase over the year ago quarter.  
On a per-share basis, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program, excess investment income increased 12%. Year-to-date, excess investment income is up 7% in dollars to 10% per share. For the full year 2019, we expect excess investment income to grow about 5%, which will result in a per share increase of around 8% to 9%.
Invested assets are $16.9 billion, including $16 billion of fixed maturities at amortized cost. Of the fixed maturities, $15.3 billion are investment grade with an average rating of A-, and below investment-grade bonds are $646 million compared to $688 million a year ago. The percentage of below investment-grade bonds to fixed maturities is 4.0% compared to 4.5% a year ago. This is the lowest this ratio has been in the last 20 years.
Overall, the total portfolio is rated BBB+, same as the year ago quarter. Bonds rated BBB are 56% of the fixed maturity portfolio as compared to 58% at the end of 2018. While this ratio is higher relative to our peers, we have no exposure to higher risk assets such as derivatives or equities and little exposure to commercial mortgages and asset-backed securities. 
We believe the BBB securities provide us the best risk-adjusted, capital-adjusted returns due in large part to our unique ability to hold the securities to maturity regardless of the fluctuations in interest rates or equity markets.
Finally, we have net unrealized gains in the fixed maturity portfolio of $2 billion, $715 million higher than the previous quarter due primarily to changes in market interest rates.  
Regarding investment yield, in the second quarter, we invested $253 million in investment-grade fixed maturities primarily in the financial and industrial sectors. We invested at an average yield of 4.95%, an average rating of A- and an average life of 29 years. 
For the entire portfolio, the second quarter yield was 5.50%, down 7 basis points from the 5.57% yield in the second quarter of 2018. As of June 30, the portfolio yield was approximately 5.50%. At the midpoint of our guidance, we're assuming an average new money rate of around 4.5% for the remainder of 2019.
While we would like to see higher interest rates going forward, we can thrive at a lower-for-longer interest rate environment. Extended low interest rates will not impact the GAAP or statutory balance sheets under current accounting rules since we sell noninterest-sensitive protection products. While our net investment income will be impacted in the continuing low interest rate environment, our excess investment income will still grow, it just won't grow at the same rate as the invested assets.
Now I'll turn the call over to Frank."
308916,629810132,1781355,"Torchmark Corporation, Q2 2019 Earnings Call, Jul 25, 2019",2019-07-25,"Earnings Calls","Globe Life Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Gary. First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position. The parent began the year with liquid assets of $41 million. In addition to these liquid assets, the parent is generating excess cash flow in 2019. T",517,"Thanks, Gary. First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position. The parent began the year with liquid assets of $41 million. In addition to these liquid assets, the parent is generating excess cash flow in 2019. The parent company's excess cash flow, as we define it, results primarily from the dividends received by the parent from its subsidiaries less the interest paid on debt and of the dividends paid to Torchmark shareholders. 
We anticipate our excess cash flow in 2019 to be in the range of $365 million to $375 million. Thus, including the assets on hand at the beginning of the year, we currently expect to have around $405 million to $415 million available to the parent during the year.
As discussed on prior calls, we accelerated the repurchases of $25 million of Torchmark's stock into December 2018 with commercial paper and parent cash. We had utilized $15 million of the 2019 excess cash flow to reduce the commercial paper for those repurchases. As such, we expect to have approximately $390 million to $400 million to be available to the parent for other uses, including the $50 million of liquid assets we normally retain at the parent.
In the second quarter, we spent $85.4 million to buy 979,000 Torchmark shares at an average price of $87.18. Including the $88.6 million spent for repurchases in the first quarter and the $16 million spent so far in July, we have spent $190 million of parent company cash thus far in 2019 to acquire more than 2.2 million shares at an average price of $84.67. 
Taking into account the $190 million spent on year-to-date repurchases and the $50 million we plan on retaining at the parent, we will have approximately $150 million to $160 million of excess cash flow available to the parent for the remainder of the year.
As noted on previous calls, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. If market conditions are favorable and absent alternatives with higher value to our shareholders, we expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those funds.
Now regarding capital levels at our insurance subsidiaries. Our goal is to maintain capital at levels necessary to support our current rates. As discussed on our previous call, Torchmark intends to target a consolidated company action level RBC ratio in the range of 300% to 320% for 2019.
Finally, with respect to our earnings guidance. We are projecting the net operating income per share will be in the range of $6.67 to $6.77 for the year-end December 31, 2019. The $6.72 midpoint of this guidance reflects a $0.04 increase over the prior quarter midpoint of $6.68, primarily attributable to the favorable underwriting result in the second quarter and an improved outlook on life underwriting income for the second half of the year. These positive adjustments are offset somewhat by slightly lower expectations of excess investment income and health underwriting income for the remaining part of the year.
Those are my comments. I will now turn the call back to Larry."

We announced yesterday that Torchmark will be renamed Globe Life Inc. on August 8. We will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange as GL. The name change reflects the company's commitment to an enterprise-wide brand alignment to enhance sales and recruitment to improve, name recognition. 
We chose the Globe Life name to capitalize on the branding investments we've made in recent years at Globe Life and Accident Insurance Company. These investments have increased Globe's name recognition, and improved sales in Texas and the surrounding states. All the individual insurance subsidiaries will continue to exist as legal entities and retain their unique cultures and market niches and will all eventually use and take advantage of the Globe Life brand. 
Our operating companies have been successful using their own brands. Despite a lack of name recognition among agent recruits and prospective customers, we expect unified brand name and resilient name recognition to expand that success. Over time, branding will significantly enhance our ability to recruit agents and reach new customers.
We expect this initiative to evolve over a number of years and create a strong unified brand. As we go forward, we will maintain our usual disciplined approach to expense management to ensure branding has a positive effect on recruiting, sales and underwriting income.
Lastly, we announced earlier today that Globe Life is now the official life insurance of the Dallas Cowboys. We are excited about this new relationship. It provides a great opportunity to strengthen Globe Life's brand recognition in a cost-effective manner. 
Those are our comments. We will open the call up for questions."

With respect to American Income, the Supreme Court decision has had no effect on our sales, our recruiting or our persistency. 
Jimmy, I think the third question had to do with agent retention. And what we've seen on agent retention is that in the first and second quarter, the increase in agent count seems to reflect an increase in our year-over-year recruiting. The short term is positive since terminations have slowed down compared to the new agent appointments. But for the year, our guidance will be -- in agent count is between 7,200 and 7,500, and we expect that, that will be the case. But the sales growth didn't equal the agent growth in the second quarter, and that's because new agents are generally less productive in their first several months as compared to veteran agents."

In the second quarter, net income was $187 million or $1.67 per share compared to $184 million or $1.59 per share a year ago.

In the second quarter, net income was $187 million or $1.67 per share compared to $184 million or $1.59 per share a year ago. Net operating income for the quarter was $187 million or $1.67 per share, a per share increase of 11% from a year ago.
On a GAAP reported basis, return on equity as of June 30 was 12.3% and book value per share was $60.22. Excluding unrealized gains/losses on fixed maturities, return on equity was 14.6% and book value per share grew 10% to $46.43.
Now on our life insurance operations, premium revenue increased 5% to $631 million and life underwriting margin was $175 million, up 9% from a year ago. Growth in underwriting margin exceeded premium growth due to a higher percentage of premium margins in all distribution channels. For the year, we expect life underwriting income to grow around 6% to 7%.
On the health side, premium revenue grew 6% to $266 million and health underwriting margin was up 1% to $60 million. Growth in premium exceeded underwriting margin growth primarily due to lower margins at United American. For the year, we expect health underwriting income to grow around 3% to 4%. 
Administrative expenses were $59 million for the quarter, up 7% from a year ago and in line with our expectations. As a percentage of premium, administrative expenses were 6.6% compared to 6.5% a year ago. For the full year, we expect administrative expenses to grow approximately 6% and to remain around 6.6% of premium compared to 6.5% in 2018.
I will now turn the call over to Larry for his comments on the marketing operations."

The producing agent count at the end of the second quarter was 7,477. 
At Liberty National, life premiums were up 3% to $71 million and life underwriting margin was up 6% to $18 million. Health premiums were down 1% to $47 million and the health underwriting margin was down 4% to $12 million. Net life sales increased 4% to $13 million and net health sales were $6 million, up 11% from the year ago quarter. The sales growth was driven primarily by agent count growth. 
The average producing agent count for the second quarter was 2,290, up 5% from the year ago quarter and up 5% from the first quarter. The producing agent count at Liberty National ended the quarter 2,390. 
In our Direct Response operation at Globe Life, life insurance were up 4% to $217 million and life underwriting margin increased 9% to $39 million. Net life sales were $34 million, down 2% from the year ago quarter. Year-to-date, sales are flat. As we go forward, we expect to grow both sales and profits. 
At Family Heritage, health premiums increased 8% to $73 million and health underwriting margin increased 14% to $18 million. Net health sales were up 9% to $17 million due primarily to increased agent productivity. The average producing agent count for the second quarter was 1,081, up 3% from the year ago quarter and up 8% from the first quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the quarter was 1,089.
At United American General Agency, health premiums increased 9% to $102 million. Our margins declined 8% to $14 million. Net health sales were $17 million, up 24% compared to the year ago quarter.
To complete my discussion of the market operations, I will now provide some projections. We expect the producing agent count for each agency at the end of 2019 to be in the following ranges: American Income, 7,200 to 7,500; Liberty National, 2,300 to 2,500; Family Heritage, 1,175 to 1,225.
Approximate net life sales for the full year 2019 are expected to be as follows: American Income, 5% to 9% growth; Liberty National, 9% to 13% growth; Direct Response, flat to 2% growth. 
Approximate net health sales for the full year 2019 are expected to be as follows: Liberty National, 7% to 11% growth; Family Heritage, 3% to 7% growth; United American individual Medicare Supplement, 7% to 13% growth.

First, excess investment income. Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income less required interest on net policy liabilities and debt, was $65 million, an 8% increase over the year ago quarter. 
On a per-share basis, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program, excess investment income increased 12%. Year-to-date, excess investment income is up 7% in dollars to 10% per share. For the full year 2019, we expect excess investment income to grow about 5%, which will result in a per share increase of around 8% to 9%.
Invested assets are $16.9 billion, including $16 billion of fixed maturities at amortized cost. Of the fixed maturities, $15.3 billion are investment grade with an average rating of A-, and below investment-grade bonds are $646 million compared to $688 million a year ago. The percentage of below investment-grade bonds to fixed maturities is 4.0% compared to 4.5% a year ago. This is the lowest this ratio has been in the last 20 years.
Overall, the total portfolio is rated BBB+, same as the year ago quarter. Bonds rated BBB are 56% of the fixed maturity portfolio as compared to 58% at the end of 2018. While this ratio is higher relative to our peers, we have no exposure to higher risk assets such as derivatives or equities and little exposure to commercial mortgages and asset-backed securities. 
We believe the BBB securities provide us the best risk-adjusted, capital-adjusted returns due in large part to our unique ability to hold the securities to maturity regardless of the fluctuations in interest rates or equity markets.
Finally, we have net unrealized gains in the fixed maturity portfolio of $2 billion, $715 million higher than the previous quarter due primarily to changes in market interest rates. 
Regarding investment yield, in the second quarter, we invested $253 million in investment-grade fixed maturities primarily in the financial and industrial sectors. We invested at an average yield of 4.95%, an average rating of A- and an average life of 29 years. 
For the entire portfolio, the second quarter yield was 5.50%, down 7 basis points from the 5.57% yield in the second quarter of 2018. As of June 30, the portfolio yield was approximately 5.50%. At the midpoint of our guidance, we're assuming an average new money rate of around 4.5% for the remainder of 2019.
While we would like to see higher interest rates going forward, we can thrive at a lower-for-longer interest rate environment. Extended low interest rates will not impact the GAAP or statutory balance sheets under current accounting rules since we sell noninterest-sensitive protection products. While our net investment income will be impacted in the continuing low interest rate environment, our excess investment income will still grow, it just won't grow at the same rate as the invested assets.
Now I'll turn the call over to Frank."
308916,629810132,1782846,"Torchmark Corporation, Q2 2019 Earnings Call, Jul 25, 2019",2019-07-25,"Earnings Calls","Globe Life Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Gary. First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position. The parent began the year with liquid assets of $41 million. In addition to these liquid assets, the parent is generating excess cash flow in 2019. T",517,"Thanks, Gary. First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position. The parent began the year with liquid assets of $41 million. In addition to these liquid assets, the parent is generating excess cash flow in 2019. The parent company's excess cash flow, as we define it, results primarily from the dividends received by the parent from its subsidiaries less the interest paid on debt and of the dividends paid to Torchmark shareholders. 
We anticipate our excess cash flow in 2019 to be in the range of $365 million to $375 million. Thus, including the assets on hand at the beginning of the year, we currently expect to have around $405 million to $415 million available to the parent during the year.
As discussed on prior calls, we accelerated the repurchases of $25 million of Torchmark's stock into December 2018 with commercial paper and parent cash. We had utilized $15 million of the 2019 excess cash flow to reduce the commercial paper for those repurchases. As such, we expect to have approximately $390 million to $400 million to be available to the parent for other uses, including the $50 million of liquid assets we normally retain at the parent.
In the second quarter, we spent $85.4 million to buy 979,000 Torchmark shares at an average price of $87.18. Including the $88.6 million spent for repurchases in the first quarter and the $16 million spent so far in July, we have spent $190 million of parent company cash thus far in 2019 to acquire more than 2.2 million shares at an average price of $84.67. 
Taking into account the $190 million spent on year-to-date repurchases and the $50 million we plan on retaining at the parent, we will have approximately $150 million to $160 million of excess cash flow available to the parent for the remainder of the year.
As noted on previous calls, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. If market conditions are favorable and absent alternatives with higher value to our shareholders, we expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those funds.
Now regarding capital levels at our insurance subsidiaries. Our goal is to maintain capital at levels necessary to support our current rates. As discussed on our previous call, Torchmark intends to target a consolidated company action level RBC ratio in the range of 300% to 320% for 2019.
Finally, with respect to our earnings guidance. We are projecting the net operating income per share will be in the range of $6.67 to $6.77 for the year-end December 31, 2019. The $6.72 midpoint of this guidance reflects a $0.04 increase over the prior quarter midpoint of $6.68, primarily attributable to the favorable underwriting result in the second quarter and an improved outlook on life underwriting income for the second half of the year. These positive adjustments are offset somewhat by slightly lower expectations of excess investment income and health underwriting income for the remaining part of the year.
Those are my comments. I will now turn the call back to Larry."

We announced yesterday that Torchmark will be renamed Globe Life Inc. on August 8. We will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange as GL. The name change reflects the company's commitment to an enterprise-wide brand alignment to enhance sales and recruitment to improve, name recognition. 
We chose the Globe Life name to capitalize on the branding investments we've made in recent years at Globe Life and Accident Insurance Company. These investments have increased Globe's name recognition and improved sales in Texas and the surrounding states. All the individual insurance subsidiaries will continue to exist as legal entities and retain their unique cultures and market niches and will all eventually use and take advantage of the Globe Life brand. 
Our operating companies have been successful using their own brands. Despite a lack of name recognition among agent recruits and prospective customers, we expect unified brand name and resilient name recognition to expand that success. Over time, branding will significantly enhance our ability to recruit agents and reach new customers.
We expect this initiative to evolve over a number of years and create a strong unified brand. As we go forward, we will maintain our usual disciplined approach to expense management to ensure branding has a positive effect on recruiting, sales and underwriting income.
Lastly, we announced earlier today that Globe Life is now the official life insurance of the Dallas Cowboys. We are excited about this new relationship. It provides a great opportunity to strengthen Globe Life's brand recognition in a cost-effective manner. 
Those are our comments. We will open the call up for questions."

With respect to American Income, the Supreme Court decision has had no effect on our sales, our recruiting or our persistency. 
Jimmy, I think the third question had to do with agent retention. And what we've seen on agent retention is that in the first and second quarter, the increase in agent count seems to reflect an increase in our year-over-year recruiting. The short term is positive since terminations have slowed down compared to the new agent appointments. But for the year, our guidance will be -- in agent count is between 7,200 and 7,500, and we expect that, that will be the case. But the sales growth didn't equal the agent growth in the second quarter, and that's because new agents are generally less productive in their first several months as compared to veteran agents."

And I guess there's some headwinds that I think are facing the industry in general, which is system upgrades, improving tech and dealing with the new accounting standards and all of the time and effort that's probably going into converting, even though I know it got pushed back a year. With all these things going on and just like the scale of Torchmark, I would think that maybe some of those expenses might impact you guys a bit more than some of the bigger life insurers. Are you feeling any of that? Is that already in numbers and the run rate that you're kind of showing us today? Any anticipation of any of those expenses increasing over the next year or 2?"

On a GAAP reported basis, return on equity as of September 30 was 12% and book value per share was $65.96. Excluding unrealized gains and losses on fixed maturities, return on equity was 14.7% and book value per share grew 10% to $47.58.
In our life insurance operations, premium revenue increased 4% to $631 million, and life underwriting margin was $181 million, up 8% from a year ago. Growth in underwriting margin exceeded premium growth due to higher margin percentages in all distributional channels. For the year, we expect life underwriting income to grow around 7% to 8%.
On the health side, premium revenue grew 5% to $269 million and health underwriting margin was up 1% to $61 million. Growth in premium exceeded underwriting margin growth primarily due to lower margin percentage at United American. For the year, we expect health underwriting income to grow around 3% to 4%. 
Administrative expenses were $61 million for the quarter, up 8.5% from a year ago. As a percentage of premium, administrative expenses were 6.7% compared to 6.5% a year ago. For the full year, we expect administrative expenses to grow approximately 6% and to be around 6.6% to 6.7% of premium compared to 6.5% in 2018.

I'm going through the results of each of our distribution channels. I'll start by saying we're especially pleased with the year-to-date agent count growth we've seen across all 3 of our exclusive agencies. 
At American Income, life premiums were up 7% to $293 million and life underwriting margin was up 9% to $100 million. Net life sales were $60 million, up 9%. The sales growth was driven primarily by agent count growth. The average producing agent count for the third quarter was 7578, up 7% from the year ago quarter and up 3% from the second quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the third quarter were 7770.
At Liberty National, life premiums were up 2% to $72 million and the underwriting margin was up 12% to $19 million. Net life sales increased 12% to $13 million and the net full sales were $6 million, up 8% from the year ago quarter. The sales growth was driven primarily by agent count growth. The average producing agent count for the third quarter was 2398, up 10% from year ago quarter and up 5% from the second quarter. The producing agent count at Liberty National ended the quarter at 2421. 
In our Direct Response operation in both life, life premiums were up 2% to $212 million and life underwriting margin increased 5% to $41 million. Net life sales were $30 million, down 1% from a year ago quarter. Year-to-date, sales were down 1% due primarily to a decrease in juvenile life insurance volume. At family heritage, health premiums increased 7% to $74 million and health underwriting margin increased 12% to $19 million. Net health sales were up 9% to $18 million due to an increase in both agent count and agent productivity. The average producing agent count for the third quarter was 1135, up 5% from both the year ago quarter and the second quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the quarter was 1236.
At United American General Agency, health premiums increased 8% to $103 million. Our margins declined 10% to $14 million. Net health sales were $16 million, up 25% compared to the year ago quarter.
To complete my discussion on the marketing operations, I will now provide some projections. We expect the producing agent count for each agency to be in the following ranges for the full year 2019: American Income, 7350 to 7450; Liberty National, 2300 to 2400; Family Heritage, 1210 to 1230.
Approximate net life sales are expected to be as follows: American Income for the full year 2019, 6% to 7% growth; for 2020, 5% to 9% growth. Liberty National for the full year 2019, 8% to 10% growth; for 2020, 6% to 10% growth. Direct Response for the full year 2019, down 2% to flat; for 2020, down 3% to 1% growth. 
Approximate net health sales are expected to be as follows: Liberty National for the full year 2019, 7% to 9% growth; for 2020, 6% to 10% growth. Family Heritage for the full year 2019, 5% to 7% growth; for 2020, 5% to 9% growth. United American individual Medicare settlement for the full year 2019, 8% to 12% growth; for 2020, relatively flat.

First, excess investment income.

First, excess investment income. Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income less required interest on net cost on liability and debt, was $65 million, a 5% increase over the year ago quarter. On a per share basis, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program, excess investment income increased 7%.
For the full year, we expect excess investment income to grow by about 5%, which will result in a per share increase of around 8.5%.
Regarding the investment portfolio. Investment assets were $17.2 billion, including $16.2 billion of fixed maturities and amortized costs. As of fixed maturities, $15.6 billion are investment grade with an average rating of A-. And below investment grade bonds were $623 million compared to $682 million a year ago. The percentage of below investment-grade bonds of fixed maturities is 3.8% compared to 4.4% a year ago. This is the lowest this ratio has been in the last 20 years. Overall, the total portfolio is rated A- compared to BBB+ a year ago. This is the first time the overall portfolio rating has been A- since 2016.
Bonds rated BBB were 56% of the fixed maturity portfolio as compared to 58% at the end of 2018. While this ratio is higher relative to our peers, we have no exposure to higher-risk assets such as derivatives or equities and low exposure to commercial mortgages in asset-backed securities. We believe BBB security is provide us the best risk-adjusted capital adjusted returns due in large part of our unique ability to hold securities to maturity regardless of fluctuations in interest rates or equity markets.
Finally, we have net unrealized gains with fixed maturity portfolio as of $2.6 billion, $638 million higher than the previous quarter due primarily to changes in market interest rates.
Regarding investment yield. In the third quarter, we invested $409 million in investment-grade fixed maturities primarily in the financial, industrial and municipal sectors. We invested at an average yield of 4.12%, an average rating of A and average life of 29 years. For the entire portfolio, the third quarter yield was 5.47%, down 9 basis points from the 5.5% -- 5.56% yield in the third quarter 2019. As of September 30, the portfolio yield was approximately 5.45%. 
At the midpoint of our guidance, we are assuming a new minimum rate of around 4% in the fourth quarter and a weighted average rate of 4.25% in 2020. At these new money rates, we expect the annual yield on the portfolio to be around 5.49% in 2019 and 5.38% in 2020.
While we would like to see higher interest rates going forward, Globe Life is driving for lower interest rate environment. Extended low interest rates will not impact the GAAP for statutory balance sheets under current accounting rules since we interest protection products.
While net investment income to a lesser extent will be impacted in the continuing low interest rate environment, investment income will still grow and just won't grow at the same rate as the invested assets. Fortunately, the impact of lower new money rates on our investment income is somewhat limited as we expect to have an average turnover of less than 2% per year in our investment portfolio over the next 4 years.
Now I'll turn the call over to Frank."

The parent began the year with liquid assets of $41 million. In addition, as is the normal for Globe Life, the parent will generate excess cash flow in 2019. The parent company's excess cash flow, as we define it, results primarily from the dividends received by the parent from its subsidiaries, less the interest paid on debt and the dividends paid to Globe Life's shareholders. We anticipate our excess cash flow in 2019 to be approximately $375 million. Thus, including the assets on hand at the beginning of the year, we currently expect to have around $415 million available to the parent during the year. 
As discussed in our prior calls, we accelerated the repurchases of $25 million of Globe Life stock into December 2018 with commercial paper and parent cash. We have utilized $15 million of the 2019 excess cash flow to reduce the commercial paper for those repurchases, leaving approximately $400 million available to the parent, including the $50 million of liquid assets we normally retain at the parent.
In the third quarter, we spent $83 million to buy 933,000 Globe Life shares as average price of $89.26. So far in October, we have spent $25 million to purchase 265,000 shares at an average price of $93.50. Thus, for the full year through today, we spent $282 million of parent company cash to acquire more than 3.3 million shares at an average price of $86.33.
Taking into account the $282 million spent year-to-date, we now have around $118 million of available cash, of which $50 million will be retained at the parent, leaving approximately $68 million for use in the remainder of the fourth quarter. Looking forward to 2020, we preliminarily estimate that the excess cash flow available to the parent will be in the range of $365 million to $385 million.
As noted on previous calls, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. If market conditions are favorable and asset alternatives with higher value to our shareholders, we expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those funds.
Now regarding capital levels at our insurance subsidiaries. Our goal is to maintain capital at levels necessary to support our current ratings. As discussed on our previous calls, Globe Life intends to target a consolidated company action level RBC ratio in the range of 300% to 320% for 2019. 
Finally, with respect to our earnings guidance for 2019 and 2020. Our third quarter earnings was slightly higher than we anticipated primarily due to favorable life fluctuations during the quarter plus a onetime $1.2 million consent fee received on the force exchange in one of our bond holdings. As a result, we are now projecting net operating income per share will be in the range of $6.71 to $6.77 for the year ended December 31, 2019, a $0.02 increase as the $6.74 midpoint of this range over the prior quarter midpoint of $6.72. 
For 2020, we are projecting the net operating income per share will be in the range of $7 to $7.30, a 6% increase from the midpoint from 2019. Growth will be -- in 2020 due to the lower interest rate environment, which we currently expect to continue through 2020.

In our life insurance operations, premium revenue increased 4% to $631 million, and life underwriting margin was $181 million, up 8% from a year ago.

On the health side, premium revenue grew 5% to $269 million and health underwriting margin was up 1% to $61 million.

At United American General Agency, health premiums increased 8% to $103 million. Our margins declined 10% to $14 million. Net health sales were $16 million, up 25% compared to the year ago quarter.
To complete my discussion of the marketing operations, I will now provide some projections. We expect the producing agent count for each agency to be in the following ranges for the full year 2019: American Income, 7,350 to 7,450; Liberty National, 2,300 to 2,400; Family Heritage, 1,210 to 1,230.
Approximate net life sales are expected to be as follows: American Income for the full year 2019, 6% to 7% growth; for 2020, 5% to 9% growth. Liberty National for the full year 2019, 8% to 10% growth; for 2020, 6% to 10% growth. Direct Response for the full year 2019, down 2% to flat; for 2020, down 3% to 1% growth.

I will now turn the call back to Gary."
308916,641029496,1838765,"Globe Life Inc., Q3 2019 Earnings Call, Oct 24, 2019",2019-10-24,"Earnings Calls","Globe Life Inc.","Executives","I want to spend a few minutes discussing our investment operations. First, excess investment income. Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income less required interest on net policy liabilities and debt, was $65 million, a 5% increa",559,"I want to spend a few minutes discussing our investment operations. First, excess investment income. Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income less required interest on net policy liabilities and debt, was $65 million, a 5% increase over the year ago quarter. 
On a per-share basis, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program, excess investment income increased 7%. For the full year, we expect excess investment income to grow by about 5%, which would result in a per share increase of around 8.5%.
Regarding the investment portfolio. Investment assets are $17.2 billion, including $16.2 billion of fixed maturities and amortized cost. Of the fixed maturities, $15.6 billion are investment grade with an average rating of A-, and below investment-grade bonds are $623 million compared to $682 million a year ago. The percentage of below investment-grade bonds to fixed maturities is 3.8% compared to 4.4% a year ago. This is the lowest this ratio has been in the last 20 years. 
Overall, the total portfolio is rated A- compared to BBB+ a year ago. This is the first time the overall portfolio rating has been A- since 2016. Bonds rated BBB are 56% of the fixed maturity portfolio as compared to 58% at the end of 2018. While this ratio is higher relative to our peers, we have no exposure to higher-risk assets such as derivatives or equities and little exposure to commercial mortgages in asset-backed securities. 
We believe BBB securities provide us the best risk-adjusted, capital-adjusted returns due in large part to our unique ability to hold securities to maturity regardless of fluctuations in interest rates or equity markets.
Finally, we have net unrealized gains in the fixed maturity portfolio of $2.6 billion, $638 million higher than the previous quarter due primarily to changes in market interest rates.
Regarding investment yield, in the third quarter, we invested $409 million in investment-grade fixed maturities primarily in the financial, industrial and municipal sectors. We invested at an average yield of 4.12%, an average rating of A and an average life of 29 years. 
For the entire portfolio, the third quarter yield was 5.47%, down 9 basis points from the 5.5% -- 5.56% yield in the third quarter 2018. As of September 30, the portfolio yield was approximately 5.45%. At the midpoint of our guidance, we are assuming a new rate of around 4% in the fourth quarter and a weighted average rate of 4.25% in 2020. At these new money rates, we expect the annual yield on the portfolio to be around 5.49% in 2019 and 5.38% in 2020.
While we would like to see higher interest rates going forward, Globe Life can thrive in a lower-for-longer interest rate environment. Extended low interest rates will not impact the GAAP or statutory balance sheets under the current accounting rules since we sell noninterest-sensitive protection products.
While net investment income, to a lesser extent pinched expense, will be impacted in a continuing low interest rate environment, investment income will still grow, it just won't grow at the same rate as the invested assets. Fortunately, the impact of lower new money rates on our investment income is somewhat limited as we expect to have an average turnover of less than 2% per year in our investment portfolio over the next 4 years.
Now I'll turn the call over to Frank."

First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position. The parent began the year with liquid assets of $41 million. In addition, as is the norm for Globe Life, the parent will generate excess cash flow in",571,"Thanks, Gary. First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position. The parent began the year with liquid assets of $41 million. In addition, as is the norm for Globe Life, the parent will generate excess cash flow in 2019. The parent company's excess cash flow, as we define it, results primarily from the dividends received by the parent from its subsidiaries less the interest paid on debt and the dividends paid to Globe Life's shareholders. 
We anticipate our excess cash flow in 2019 to be approximately $375 million. Thus, including the assets on hand at the beginning of the year, we currently expect to have around $415 million available to the parent during the year. 
As discussed in our prior calls, we accelerated the repurchases of $25 million of Globe Life stock into December 2018 with commercial paper and parent cash. We have utilized $15 million of the 2019 excess cash flow to reduce the commercial paper for those repurchases, leaving approximately $400 million available to the parent, including the $50 million of liquid assets we normally retain at the parent.
In the third quarter, we spent $83 million to buy 933,000 Globe Life shares at an average price of $89.26. So far in October, we have spent $25 million to purchase 265,000 shares at an average price of $93.50. Thus, for the full year through today, we have spent $282 million of parent company cash to acquire more than 3.3 million shares at an average price of $86.33.
Taking into account the $282 million spent year-to-date, we now have around $118 million of available cash, of which $50 million will be retained at the parent, leaving approximately $68 million for use in the remainder of the fourth quarter. Looking forward to 2020, we preliminarily estimate that the excess cash flow available to the parent will be in the range of $365 million to $385 million.
As noted on previous calls, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. If market conditions are favorable and absent alternatives with higher value to our shareholders, we expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those funds.
Now regarding capital levels at our insurance subsidiaries. Our goal is to maintain capital at levels necessary to support our current ratings. As discussed on our previous calls, Globe Life intends to target a consolidated company action level RBC ratio in the range of 300% to 320% for 2019. 
Finally, with respect to our earnings guidance for 2019 and 2020. Our third quarter earnings were slightly higher than we anticipated primarily due to favorable life claim fluctuations during the quarter plus a onetime $1.2 million consent fee received on the forced exchange of one of our bond holdings. As a result, we are now projecting net operating income per share will be in the range of $6.71 to $6.77 for the year ended December 31, 2019, a $0.02 increase at the $6.74 midpoint of this range over the prior quarter midpoint of $6.72. 
For 2020, we are projecting the net operating income per share will be in the range of $7 to $7.30, a 6% increase at the midpoint from 2019. Growth will be impeded in 2020 due to the lower interest rate environment, which we currently expect to continue through 2020.

And the impact on the margin has been -- the underwriting margin going from 33% to 33.6%. That doesn't sound like a big change over $1 billion for the premium, so it does make quite a bit of change for our growth in earnings. The margins for this quarter were over 28% for the overall life business. We think that's going to revert back and we're looking for underwriting margin for the full year to be around 27.9%, right at 28%. And our early thoughts on 2020 are that it will still be in that same range. What we have seen is with increased or improved mortality, especially at American Income and also Direct Response over the last couple of years, we don't think we'll see improvement going forward, but we think we'll maintain the profit margins and where we are for this year.

In our life insurance operations, premium revenue increased 4% to $631 million, and life underwriting margin was $181 million, up 8% from a year ago.

On the health side, premium revenue grew 5% to $269 million and health underwriting margin was up 1% to $61 million.

  At American Income, life premiums were up 7% to $293 million and life underwriting margin was up 9% to $100 million. Net life sales were $60 million, up 9%. The sales growth was driven primarily by agent count growth. The average producing agent count for the third quarter was 7,578, up 7% from the year ago quarter and up 3% from the second quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the third quarter was 7,770.
At Liberty National, life premiums were up 2% to $72 million and the underwriting margin was up 12% to $19 million. Net life sales increased 12% to $13 million and the net health sales were $6 million, up 8% from the year ago quarter. The sales growth was driven primarily by agent count growth. The average producing agent count for the third quarter was 2,398, up 10% from the year ago quarter and up 5% from the second quarter. The producing agent count at Liberty National ended the quarter at 2,421. 
  
  At our Direct Response operation at Globe Life, life premiums were up 2% to $212 million and life underwriting margin increased 5% to $41 million. Net life sales were $30 million, down 1% from the year ago quarter. Year-to-date, sales were down 1% due primarily to a decrease in juvenile life insurance mailing volume. 
At Family Heritage, health premiums increased 7% to $74 million and health underwriting margin increased 12% to $19 million. Net health sales were up 9% to $18 million due to an increase in both agent count and agent productivity. The average producing agent count for the third quarter was 1,135, up 5% from both the year ago quarter and the second quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the quarter was 1,236.
At United American General Agency, health premiums increased 8% to $103 million. Our margins declined 10% to $14 million. Net health sales were $16 million, up 25% compared to the year ago quarter.
To complete my discussion of the marketing operations, I will now provide some projections. We expect the producing agent count for each agency to be in the following ranges for the full year 2019: American Income, 7,350 to 7,450; Liberty National, 2,300 to 2,400; Family Heritage, 1,210 to 1,230.
Approximate net life sales are expected to be as follows: American Income for the full year 2019, 6% to 7% growth; for 2020, 5% to 9% growth. Liberty National for the full year 2019, 8% to 10% growth; for 2020, 6% to 10% growth. Direct Response for the full year 2019, down 2% to flat; for 2020, down 3% to 1% growth. 
  
  Approximate net health sales are expected to be as follows: Liberty National for the full year 2019, 7% to 9% growth; for 2020, 6% to 10% growth. Family Heritage for the full year 2019, 5% to 7% growth; for 2020, 5% to 9% growth.

First, excess investment income. Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income less required interest on net policy liabilities and debt, was $65 million, a 5% increase over the year ago quarter. 
On a per-share basis, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program, excess investment income increased 7%. For the full year, we expect excess investment income to grow by about 5%, which would result in a per share increase of around 8.5%.
Regarding the investment portfolio. Invested assets are $17.2 billion, including $16.2 billion of fixed maturities and amortized cost. Of the fixed maturities, $15.6 billion are investment grade with an average rating of A-, and below investment-grade bonds are $623 million compared to $682 million a year ago. The percentage of below investment-grade bonds to fixed maturities is 3.8% compared to 4.4% a year ago. This is the lowest this ratio has been in the last 20 years. 
Overall, the total portfolio is rated A- compared to BBB+ a year ago. This is the first time the overall portfolio rating has been A- since 2016. Bonds rated BBB are 56% of the fixed maturity portfolio as compared to 58% at the end of 2018. While this ratio is high relative to our peers, we have no exposure to higher-risk assets such as derivatives or equities and little exposure to commercial mortgages in asset-backed securities. 
We believe BBB securities provide us the best risk-adjusted, capital-adjusted returns due in large part to our unique ability to hold securities to maturity regardless of fluctuations in interest rates or equity markets.
Finally, we have net unrealized gains in the fixed maturity portfolio of $2.6 billion, $638 million higher than the previous quarter due primarily to changes in market interest rates.
Regarding investment yield, in the third quarter, we invested $409 million in investment-grade fixed maturities primarily in the financial, industrial and municipal sectors. We invested at an average yield of 4.12%, an average rating of A and an average life of 29 years. 
For the entire portfolio, the third quarter yield was 5.47%, down 9 basis points from the 5.5% -- 5.56% yield in the third quarter 2018. As of September 30, the portfolio yield was approximately 5.45%. At the midpoint of our guidance, we are assuming a new money rate of around 4% in the fourth quarter and a weighted average rate of 4.25% in 2020. At these new money rates, we expect the annual yield on the portfolio to be around 5.49% in 2019 and 5.38% in 2020.
While we would like to see higher interest rates going forward, Globe Life can thrive in a lower-for-longer interest rate environment. Extended low interest rates will not impact the GAAP or statutory balance sheets under the current accounting rules since we sell noninterest-sensitive protection products.
While net investment income, to a lesser extent pinched expense, will be impacted in a continuing low interest rate environment, investment income will still grow, it just won't grow at the same rate as the invested assets. Fortunately, the impact of lower new money rates on our investment income is somewhat limited as we expect to have an average turnover of less than 2% per year in our investment portfolio over the next 4 years.
Now I'll turn the call over to Frank."

First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position. The parent began the year with liquid assets of $41 million. In addition, as is the norm for Globe Life, the parent will generate excess cash flow in 2019. The parent company's excess cash flow, as we define it, results primarily from the dividends received by the parent from its subsidiaries less the interest paid on debt and the dividends paid to Globe Life's shareholders. 
We anticipate our excess cash flow in 2019 to be approximately $375 million. Thus, including the assets on hand at the beginning of the year, we currently expect to have around $415 million available to the parent during the year. 
  
  As discussed in our prior calls, we accelerated the repurchases of $25 million of Globe Life stock into December 2018 with commercial paper and parent cash. We have utilized $15 million of the 2019 excess cash flow to reduce the commercial paper for those repurchases, leaving approximately $400 million available to the parent, including the $50 million of liquid assets we normally retain at the parent.
In the third quarter, we spent $83 million to buy 933,000 Globe Life shares at an average price of $89.26. So far in October, we have spent $25 million to purchase 265,000 shares at an average price of $93.50. Thus, for the full year through today, we have spent $282 million of parent company cash to acquire more than 3.3 million shares at an average price of $86.33.
Taking into account the $282 million spent year-to-date, we now have around $118 million of available cash, of which $50 million will be retained at the parent, leaving approximately $68 million for use in the remainder of the fourth quarter. Looking forward to 2020, we preliminarily estimate that the excess cash flow available to the parent will be in the range of $365 million to $385 million.
As noted on previous calls, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. If market conditions are favorable and absent alternatives with higher value to our shareholders, we expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those funds.
Now regarding capital levels at our insurance subsidiaries. Our goal is to maintain capital at levels necessary to support our current ratings. As discussed on our previous calls, Globe Life intends to target a consolidated company action level RBC ratio in the range of 300% to 320% for 2019. 
  
  Finally, with respect to our earnings guidance for 2019 and 2020. Our third quarter earnings were slightly higher than we anticipated primarily due to favorable life claim fluctuations during the quarter plus a onetime $1.2 million consent fee received on the forced exchange of one of our bond holdings. As a result, we are now projecting net operating income per share will be in the range of $6.71 to $6.77 for the year ended December 31, 2019, a $0.02 increase at the $6.74 midpoint of this range over the prior quarter midpoint of $6.72. 
  
  For 2020, we are projecting the net operating income per share will be in the range of $7 to $7.30, a 6% increase at the midpoint from 2019. Growth will be impeded in 2020 due to the lower interest rate environment, which we currently expect to continue through 2020.

Across the board, we did have better mortality than expected. I think the bigger surprise is at Liberty. And in that one we're thinking maybe a fluctuation because the policy obligation there, the ratio there, 33.7, is lower than we've seen in quite some time. At American Income, we saw improvement there, but we think that -- we see improvement in mortality over the last several quarters at American Income. And the impact on the margin has been -- the underwriting margin going from 33% to 33.6%. That doesn't sound like a big change over $1 billion worth of premium, so it does make quite a bit of change to our growth in earnings. The margins for this quarter were over 28% for the overall life business. We think that's going to revert back and we're looking for underwriting margin for the full year to be around 27.9%, right at 28%. And our early thoughts on 2020 are that it we'll still be in that same range. What we have seen is with increased or improved mortality, especially at American Income and also Direct Response over the last couple of years, we don't think we'll see improvement going forward, but we think we'll maintain the profit margins and where we are for this year.

I'll just be interested to hear your take on that business model versus yours and what you're doing to -- this resulted and you're not feeling pressure from agents leaving for that kind of a gig? Or any color that you could provide on what's allowing you to strengthen your agent recruiting here?"

So typically, we're the only agent in that home and so there's not a competition from other agents nor is there digital competition, in a sense that this is a need that's filled. People aren't looking to buy life insurance. You're really explaining the need and people buy insurance after they understand the need. So I think there will be a place for life insurance agents as we go forward. The other thing is we're selling smaller face policies. And there's not real competition in that part of the market because other agencies or other companies can't control expenses. And expense control is so important in who you're writing lower face policies. So for both expense control and for the market that we serve, I think the agents fill an important niche to that market."

In our life insurance operations, premium revenue increased 4% to $631 million, and life underwriting margin was $181 million, up 8% from a year ago. Growth in underwriting margin exceeded premium growth due to higher margin percentages in all distribution channels. For the year, we expect life underwriting income to grow around 7% to 8%.
On the health side, premium revenue grew 5% to $269 million and health underwriting margin was up 1% to $61 million. Growth in premium exceeded underwriting margin growth primarily due to lower margin percentage at United American. For the year, we expect health underwriting income to grow around 3% to 4%. 
Administrative expenses were $61 million for the quarter, up 8.5% from a year ago. As a percentage of premium, administrative expenses were 6.7% compared to 6.5% a year ago.

I'm going to go through the results of each of our distribution channels. I'll start by saying we're especially pleased with the year-to-date agent count growth we've seen across all 3 of our exclusive agencies. 
At American Income, life premiums were up 7% to $293 million and life underwriting margin was up 9% to $100 million. Net life sales were $60 million, up 9%. The sales growth was driven primarily by agent count growth. The average producing agent count for the third quarter was 7,578, up 7% from the year ago quarter and up 3% from the second quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the third quarter was 7,770.
At Liberty National, life premiums were up 2% to $72 million and the underwriting margin was up 12% to $19 million. Net life sales increased 12% to $13 million and the net health sales were $6 million, up 8% from the year ago quarter. The sales growth was driven primarily by agent count growth. The average producing agent count for the third quarter was 2,398, up 10% from the year ago quarter and up 5% from the second quarter. The producing agent count at Liberty National ended the quarter at 2,421. 
At our Direct Response operation at Globe Life, life premiums were up 2% to $212 million and life underwriting margin increased 5% to $41 million. Net life sales were $30 million, down 1% from the year ago quarter. Year-to-date, sales were down 1% due primarily to a decrease in juvenile life insurance mailing volume. 
At Family Heritage, health premiums increased 7% to $74 million and health underwriting margin increased 12% to $19 million. Net health sales were up 9% to $18 million due to an increase in both agent count and agent productivity. The average producing agent count for the third quarter was 1,135, up 5% from both the year ago quarter and the second quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the quarter was 1,236.
At United American General Agency, health premiums increased 8% to $103 million. Our margins declined 10% to $14 million. Net health sales were $16 million, up 25% compared to the year ago quarter.
To complete my discussion of the marketing operations, I will now provide some projections. We expect the producing agent count for each agency to be in the following ranges for the full year 2019: American Income, 7,350 to 7,450; Liberty National, 2,300 to 2,400; Family Heritage, 1,210 to 1,230.
Approximate net life sales are expected to be as follows: American Income for the full year 2019, 6% to 7% growth; for 2020, 5% to 9% growth. Liberty National for the full year 2019, 8% to 10% growth; for 2020, 6% to 10% growth. Direct Response for the full year 2019, down 2% to flat; for 2020, down 3% to 1% growth. 
Approximate net health sales are expected to be as follows: Liberty National for the full year 2019, 7% to 9% growth; for 2020, 6% to 10% growth. Family Heritage for the full year 2019, 5% to 7% growth; for 2020, 5% to 9% growth. United American individual Medicare Supplement for the full year 2019, 8% to 12% growth; for 2020, relatively flat.
I will now turn the call back to Gary."
308916,641029496,1842628,"Globe Life Inc., Q3 2019 Earnings Call, Oct 24, 2019",2019-10-24,"Earnings Calls","Globe Life Inc.","Executives","I want to spend a few minutes discussing our investment operations.

First, excess investment income. Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income less required interest on net policy liabilities and debt, was $65 million, a 5% increase over the year ago quarter. 
On a per-share basis, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program, excess investment income increased 7%. For the full year, we expect excess investment income to grow by about 5%, which would result in a per share increase of around 8.5%.
Regarding the investment portfolio. Invested assets are $17.2 billion, including $16.2 billion of fixed maturities and amortized cost. Of the fixed maturities, $15.6 billion are investment grade with an average rating of A-, and below investment-grade bonds are $623 million compared to $682 million a year ago. The percentage of below investment-grade bonds to fixed maturities is 3.8% compared to 4.4% a year ago. This is the lowest this ratio has been in the last 20 years. 
Overall, the total portfolio is rated A- compared to BBB+ a year ago. This is the first time the overall portfolio rating has been A- since 2016. Bonds rated BBB are 56% of the fixed maturity portfolio as compared to 58% at the end of 2018. While this ratio is high relative to our peers, we have no exposure to higher-risk assets such as derivatives or equities and little exposure to commercial mortgages in asset-backed securities. 
We believe BBB securities provide us the best risk-adjusted, capital-adjusted returns due in large part to our unique ability to hold securities to maturity regardless of fluctuations in interest rates or equity markets.
Finally, we have net unrealized gains in the fixed maturity portfolio of $2.6 billion, $638 million higher than the previous quarter due primarily to changes in market interest rates.
Regarding investment yield, in the third quarter, we invested $409 million in investment-grade fixed maturities primarily in the financial, industrial and municipal sectors. We invested at an average yield of 4.12%, an average rating of A and an average life of 29 years. 
For the entire portfolio, the third quarter yield was 5.47%, down 9 basis points from the 5.5% -- 5.56% yield in the third quarter 2018. As of September 30, the portfolio yield was approximately 5.45%. At the midpoint of our guidance, we are assuming a new money rate of around 4% in the fourth quarter and a weighted average rate of 4.25% in 2020. At these new money rates, we expect the annual yield on the portfolio to be around 5.49% in 2019 and 5.38% in 2020.
While we would like to see higher interest rates going forward, Globe Life can thrive in a lower-for-longer interest rate environment. Extended low interest rates will not impact the GAAP or statutory balance sheets under the current accounting rules since we sell noninterest-sensitive protection products.
While net investment income, to a lesser extent pinched expense, will be impacted in a continuing low interest rate environment, investment income will still grow, it just won't grow at the same rate as the invested assets. Fortunately, the impact of lower new money rates on our investment income is somewhat limited as we expect to have an average turnover of less than 2% per year in our investment portfolio over the next 4 years.
Now I'll turn the call over to Frank."

First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position. The parent began the year with liquid assets of $41 million. In addition, as is the norm for Globe Life, the parent will generate excess cash flow in 2019. The parent company's excess cash flow, as we define it, results primarily from the dividends received by the parent from its subsidiaries less the interest paid on debt and the dividends paid to Globe Life's shareholders. 
We anticipate our excess cash flow in 2019 to be approximately $375 million. Thus, including the assets on hand at the beginning of the year, we currently expect to have around $415 million available to the parent during the year. 
As discussed in our prior calls, we accelerated the repurchases of $25 million of Globe Life stock into December 2018 with commercial paper and parent cash. We have utilized $15 million of the 2019 excess cash flow to reduce the commercial paper for those repurchases, leaving approximately $400 million available to the parent, including the $50 million of liquid assets we normally retain at the parent.
In the third quarter, we spent $83 million to buy 933,000 Globe Life shares at an average price of $89.26. So far in October, we have spent $25 million to purchase 265,000 shares at an average price of $93.50. Thus, for the full year through today, we have spent $282 million of parent company cash to acquire more than 3.3 million shares at an average price of $86.33.
Taking into account the $282 million spent year-to-date, we now have around $118 million of available cash, of which $50 million will be retained at the parent, leaving approximately $68 million for use in the remainder of the fourth quarter. Looking forward to 2020, we preliminarily estimate that the excess cash flow available to the parent will be in the range of $365 million to $385 million.
As noted on previous calls, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. If market conditions are favorable and absent alternatives with higher value to our shareholders, we expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those funds.
Now regarding capital levels at our insurance subsidiaries. Our goal is to maintain capital at levels necessary to support our current ratings. As discussed on our previous calls, Globe Life intends to target a consolidated company action level RBC ratio in the range of 300% to 320% for 2019. 
Finally, with respect to our earnings guidance for 2019 and 2020. Our third quarter earnings were slightly higher than we anticipated primarily due to favorable life claim fluctuations during the quarter plus a onetime $1.2 million consent fee received on the forced exchange of one of our bond holdings. As a result, we are now projecting net operating income per share will be in the range of $6.71 to $6.77 for the year ended December 31, 2019, a $0.02 increase at the $6.74 midpoint of this range over the prior quarter midpoint of $6.72. 
For 2020, we are projecting the net operating income per share will be in the range of $7 to $7.30, a 6% increase at the midpoint from 2019. Growth will be impeded in 2020 due to the lower interest rate environment, which we currently expect to continue through 2020. Those are my comments.

Across the board, we did have better mortality than expected. I think the bigger surprise is at Liberty. And in that one we're thinking maybe a fluctuation because the policy obligation there, the ratio there, 33.7, is lower than we've seen in quite some time. At American Income, we saw improvement there, but we think that -- we see improvement in mortality over the last several quarters at American Income. And the impact on the margin has been -- the underwriting margin going from 33% to 33.6%. That doesn't sound like a big change over $1 billion worth of premium, so it does make quite a bit of change to our growth in earnings. The margins for this quarter were over 28% for the overall life business. We think that's going to revert back and we're looking for underwriting margin for the full year to be around 27.9%, right at 28%. And our early thoughts on 2020 are that it we'll still be in that same range. What we have seen is with increased or improved mortality, especially at American Income and also Direct Response over the last couple of years, we don't think we'll see improvement going forward, but we think we'll maintain the profit margins and where we are for this year. So again we think we'll be right around 28% for the year and we think that, that will hold in 2020 as well."
