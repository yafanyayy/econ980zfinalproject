Thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter and year-end call. It was great to have so many of you here last month for our Investor Day, and we appreciate your interest in and support of Extra Space Storage.2018",585,"Thank you, Jeff, and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter and year-end call. It was great to have so many of you here last month for our Investor Day, and we appreciate your interest in and support of Extra Space Storage.
2018 was another solid year. Same-store revenue was in line with expectations. Our diversified portfolio and best-in-class platform are maintaining very high occupancies, while producing positive rate growth, despite a challenging environment with new supply in many markets. 
Expenses were also generally in line with expectations, with the exception of a couple of uncontrollable expenses, which hit in the first half of the year. Our team stepped up and did a great job with controllable expenses, especially in the last 2 quarters, and found ways to offset some of the expense growth through savings and efficiencies. 
Our same-store NOI grew 4% for the year despite a challenging operating environment.  Same-store NOI was enhanced by our strong external growth from third-party management and off-market acquisitions, resulting in core FFO growth of 6.6%, which was above the high end of our annual guidance.
Looking forward to 2019, many of the themes are similar to 2018. We continue to seek new supply delivered in many markets. The rate of deliveries has started to slow. And while we still believe new the openings in 2019 will be lower than in 2018, we expect to impact new supply to be greater due to the cumulative impact of several years of elevated development.
These concerns are the same concerns we discussed on our call a year ago. However, there are also some encouraging themes from last year that will continue into 2019. First, the economic continues to be healthy. Second, we are in a need-based industry with steady demand and solid fundamentals. Third, concerns about declining use of storage due to millennials, disruptive new businesses or otherwise are proving to be ill-founded. And fourth, large operators continue to have a significant technology advantage over most of the industry.
As a result, occupancy remains very strong and we have positive rate growth in most markets. We have a geographically diverse portfolio and a platform built to drive traffic to our stores, our website and our call center. 
In short, Extra Space is well prepared to navigate today's competitive landscape.
The challenges presented by new supply also continued to bring us opportunities. In 2018, we added 153 stores to our third-party platform and continue to have a robust pipeline for 2019. We invested $580 million in acquisitions, $145 million of which was invested in certificate of occupancy or development fields.
We were successful at finding accretive acquisition opportunities to our partners and other relationships before they were exposed to the broader market. 84% of all 2018 acquisition volume was completed through off-market transactions. This off-market acquisition trend has continued into 2019, as we recently completed the buyout of one of our joint venture partners in 12 properties in Los Angeles and the Bay Area. These are well-located, purpose-built properties that we developed ourselves in the early 2000 in top-tier infill markets with true barriers of entry. Extra Space realized $72.8 million promote in the joint venture to the transaction, which was applied to the purchase price.
While 2019 will not be without its challenges, we are making the necessary investments to strengthen our platform and support our growth, while maintaining operational excellence in the current environment. 
I would now like to turn the time over to Scott."

Core FFO includes $0.02 adjustment",374,"Thanks, Joe, and hello, everyone. Our core FFO for the quarter was $1.22 per share, and our core FFO for the year was $4.67 per share, ahead of our guidance. The was primarily due to property performance and G&A savings. Core FFO includes $0.02 adjustment for the write-off of deferred financing costs related to the prepayment of notes payable to trust. We continue to evolve our balance sheet, which is never been stronger. 
During the quarter, we amended our credit facility, accessed our ATM and increased our unencumbered pool, which now stands at $5.6 billion. These efforts are part of our goal to further diversify our capital structure, latter our maturities and minimize our average interest rate, while extending the average term. This will ensure that we continue to have capacity to fund future growth through multiple sources of capital.
Last night, we provided guidance in annual assumptions for 2019. Our new same-store pool increased by 38 stores to a total of 821. Same-store revenue is expected to increase 2% to 3% in 2019. As Joe mentioned, we believe the impact from new supply will be greater in 2019 than it was in 2018. The level of this impact will depend on the timing of deliveries and the speed of absorption in impacted markets, specifically the major Florida and Texas markets.
Our guidance also assumes some revenue growth moderation in markets not heavily impacted by new supply. This is due to multiple years of outsized growth resulting in tough comps. Same-store expense growth is expected to increase 3.75% to 4.75%. The increase in expenses is primarily driven by outsized growth in property taxes and marketing spend. Our revenue and expense guidance results in NOI growth of 1.25% to 2.75%.
Our full year core FFO is estimated to be $4.73 to $4.83 per share. Our 2019 -- in 2019, we anticipate total dilution of $0.23 from value add and C of O acquisitions, up $0.03 from 2018. We recognize the short-term headwind has cause to our core FFO growth rate, but believe the investment in these lease-up stores continues to improve the quality of the portfolio and generates long-term value for our shareholders.

Thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter and year-end call. It was great to have so many of you here last month for our Investor Day, and we appreciate your interest in and support of Extra Space Storage.2018",585,"Thank you, Jeff, and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter and year-end call. It was great to have so many of you here last month for our Investor Day, and we appreciate your interest in and support of Extra Space Storage.
2018 was another solid year. Same-store revenue was in line with expectations. Our diversified portfolio and best-in-class platform are maintaining very high occupancies, while producing positive rate growth, despite a challenging environment with new supply in many markets. 
Expenses were also generally in line with expectations, with the exception of a couple of uncontrollable expenses, which hit in the first half of the year. Our team stepped up and did a great job with controllable expenses, especially in the last 2 quarters and found ways to offset some of the expense growth through savings and efficiencies. 
Our same-store NOI grew 4% for the year despite a challenging operating environment. Same-store NOI was enhanced by our strong external growth from third-party management and off-market acquisitions, resulting in core FFO growth of 6.6%, which was above the high end of our annual guidance.
Looking forward to 2019, many of the themes are similar to 2018. We continue to see new supply delivered in many markets. The rate of deliveries has started to slow. And while we still believe new openings in 2019 will be lower than in 2018, we expect the impact of new supply to be greater due to the cumulative impact of several years of elevated development.
These concerns are the same concerns we discussed on our call a year ago. However, there are also some encouraging themes from last year that will continue into 2019. First, the economy continues to be healthy. Second, we are in a need-based industry with steady demand and solid fundamentals. Third, concerns about declining use of storage due to millennials, disruptive new businesses or otherwise are proving to be ill-founded. And fourth, large operators continue to have a significant technology advantage over most of the industry.
As a result, occupancy remains very strong and we have positive rate growth in most markets. We have a geographically diverse portfolio and a platform built to drive traffic to our stores, our website and our call center. 
In short, Extra Space is well prepared to navigate today's competitive landscape.
The challenges presented by new supply also continued to bring us opportunities. In 2018, we added 153 stores to our third-party platform and continue to have a robust pipeline for 2019. We invested $580 million in acquisitions, $145 million of which was invested in Certificate of Occupancy or development fields.
We were successful at finding accretive acquisition opportunities through our partners and other relationships before they were exposed to the broader market. 84% of all 2018 acquisition volume was completed through off-market transactions. This off-market acquisition trend has continued into 2019, as we recently completed the buyout of one of our joint venture partners in 12 properties in Los Angeles and the Bay Area. These are well-located, purpose-built properties that we developed ourselves in the early 2000 in top-tier infill markets with true barriers to entry. Extra Space realized $72.8 million promote in the joint venture through the transaction, which was applied to the purchase price.
While 2019 will not be without its challenges, we are making the necessary investments to strengthen our platform and support our growth, while maintaining operational excellence in the current environment.

The beat was primarily due to property performance and G&A savings. Core FFO includes $0.02 adjustment for the write-off of deferred financing costs related to the prepayment of notes payable to trust. We continue to evolve our balance sheet, which has never been stronger. 
During the quarter, we amended our credit facility, accessed our ATM and increased our unencumbered pool, which now stands at $5.6 billion. These efforts are part of our goal to further diversify our capital structure, latter our maturities and minimize our average interest rate while extending the average term. This will ensure that we continue to have capacity to fund future growth through multiple sources of capital.
Last night, we provided guidance and annual assumptions for 2019. Our new same-store pool increased by 38 stores to a total of 821. Same-store revenue is expected to increase 2% to 3% in 2019. As Joe mentioned, we believe the impact from new supply will be greater in 2019 than it was in 2018. The level of this impact will depend on the timing of deliveries and the speed of absorption in impacted markets, specifically the major Florida and Texas markets.
 
Our guidance also assumes some revenue growth moderation in markets not heavily impacted by new supply. This is due to multiple years of outsized growth resulting in tough comps. 
Same-store expense growth is expected to increase 3.75% to 4.75%. The increase in expenses is primarily driven by outsized growth in property taxes and marketing spend. Our revenue and expense guidance results in NOI growth of 1.25% to 2.75%.
Our full year core FFO is estimated to be $4.73 to $4.83 per share. Our 2019 -- in 2019, we anticipate total dilution of $0.23 from value add and C of O acquisitions, up $0.03 from 2018. We recognize the short-term headwind as causes to our core FFO growth rate, but believe the investment in these lease-up stores continues to improve the quality of the portfolio and generates long-term value for our shareholders.

Thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter and year-end call. It was great to have so many of you here last month for our Investor Day, and we appreciate your interest in and support of Extra Space Storage.
2018 was another solid year. Same-store revenue was in line with expectations. Our diversified portfolio and best-in-class platform are maintaining very high occupancies, while producing positive rate growth, despite a challenging environment with new supply in many markets. 
Expenses were also generally in line with expectations, with the exception of a couple of uncontrollable expenses, which hit in the first half of the year. Our team stepped up and did a great job with controllable expenses, especially in the last 2 quarters and found ways to offset some of the expense growth through savings and efficiencies. 
Our same-store NOI grew 4% for the year despite a challenging operating environment. Same-store NOI was enhanced by our strong external growth from third-party management and off-market acquisitions, resulting in core FFO growth of 6.6%, which was above the high end of our annual guidance.
Looking forward to 2019, many of the themes are similar to 2018. We continue to see new supply delivered in many markets. The rate of deliveries has started to slow. And while we still believe new openings in 2019 will be lower than in 2018, we expect the impact of new supply to be greater due to the cumulative impact of several years of elevated development.
These concerns are the same concerns we discussed on our call a year ago. However, there are also some encouraging themes from last year that will continue into 2019. First, the economy continues to be healthy. Second, we are in a need-based industry with steady demand and solid fundamentals. Third, concerns about declining use of storage due to millennials, disruptive new businesses or otherwise are proving to be ill-founded. And fourth, large operators continue to have a significant technology advantage over most of the industry.
As a result, occupancy remains very strong and we have positive rate growth in most markets. We have a geographically diverse portfolio and a platform built to drive traffic to our stores, our website and our call center. 
In short, Extra Space is well prepared to navigate today's competitive landscape.
The challenges presented by new supply also continued to bring us opportunities. In 2018, we added 153 stores to our third-party platform and continue to have a robust pipeline for 2019. We invested $580 million in acquisitions, $145 million of which was invested in Certificate of Occupancy or development deals.
We were successful at finding accretive acquisition opportunities through our partners and other relationships before they were exposed to the broader market. 84% of all 2018 acquisition volume was completed through off-market transactions. This off-market acquisition trend has continued into 2019, as we recently completed the buyout of one of our joint venture partners in 12 properties in Los Angeles and the Bay Area. These are well-located, purpose-built properties that we developed ourselves in the early 2000 in top-tier infill markets with true barriers to entry. Extra Space realized $72.8 million promote in the joint venture through the transaction, which was applied to the purchase price.
While 2019 will not be without its challenges, we are making the necessary investments to strengthen our platform and support our growth, while maintaining operational excellence in the current environment.

The beat was primarily due to property performance and G&A savings. Core FFO includes $0.02 adjustment for the write-off of deferred financing costs related to the prepayment of notes payable to trust. We continue to evolve our balance sheet, which has never been stronger. 
During the quarter, we amended our credit facility, accessed our ATM and increased our unencumbered pool, which now stands at $5.6 billion. These efforts are part of our goal to further diversify our capital structure, latter our maturities and minimize our average interest rate while extending the average term. This will ensure that we continue to have capacity to fund future growth through multiple sources of capital.
Last night, we provided guidance and annual assumptions for 2019. Our new same-store pool increased by 38 stores to a total of 821. Same-store revenue is expected to increase 2% to 3% in 2019. As Joe mentioned, we believe the impact from new supply will be greater in 2019 than it was in 2018. The level of this impact will depend on the timing of deliveries and the speed of absorption in impacted markets, specifically the major Florida and Texas markets.
 
Our guidance also assumes some revenue growth moderation in markets not heavily impacted by new supply. This is due to multiple years of outsized growth resulting in tough comps. 
Same-store expense growth is expected to increase 3.75% to 4.75%. The increase in expenses is primarily driven by outsized growth in property taxes and marketing spend. Our revenue and expense guidance results in NOI growth of 1.25% to 2.75%.
Our full year core FFO is estimated to be $4.73 to $4.83 per share. Our 2019 -- in 2019, we anticipate total dilution of $0.23 from value add and C of O acquisitions, up $0.03 from 2018. We recognize the short-term headwind this causes to our core FFO growth rate, but believe the investment in these lease-up stores continues to improve the quality of the portfolio and generates long-term value for our shareholders.

Thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter and year-end call. It was great to have so many of you here last month for our Investor Day, and we appreciate your interest in and support of Extra Space Storage.2018",585,"Thank you, Jeff, and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter and year-end call. It was great to have so many of you here last month for our Investor Day, and we appreciate your interest in and support of Extra Space Storage.
2018 was another solid year. Same-store revenue was in line with expectations. Our diversified portfolio and best-in-class platform are maintaining very high occupancies, while producing positive rate growth, despite a challenging environment with new supply in many markets. 
Expenses were also generally in line with expectations, with the exception of a couple of uncontrollable expenses, which hit in the first half of the year. Our team stepped up and did a great job with controllable expenses, especially in the last 2 quarters and found ways to offset some of the expense growth through savings and efficiencies. 
Our same-store NOI grew 4% for the year despite a challenging operating environment. Same-store NOI was enhanced by our strong external growth from third-party management and off-market acquisitions, resulting in core FFO growth of 6.6%, which was above the high end of our annual guidance.
Looking forward to 2019, many of the themes are similar to 2018. We continue to see new supply delivered in many markets. The rate of deliveries has started to slow. And while we still believe new openings in 2019 will be lower than in 2018, we expect the impact of new supply to be greater due to the cumulative impact of several years of elevated development.
These concerns are the same concerns we discussed on our call a year ago. However, there are also some encouraging themes from last year that will continue into 2019. First, the economy continues to be healthy. Second, we are in a need-based industry with steady demand and solid fundamentals. Third, concerns about declining use of storage due to millennials, disruptive new businesses or otherwise are proving to be ill-founded. And fourth, large operators continue to have a significant technology advantage over most of the industry.
As a result, occupancy remains very strong and we have positive rate growth in most markets. We have a geographically diverse portfolio and a platform built to drive traffic to our stores, our website and our call center. 
In short, Extra Space is well prepared to navigate today's competitive landscape.
The challenges presented by new supply also continued to bring us opportunities. In 2018, we added 153 stores to our third-party platform and continue to have a robust pipeline for 2019. We invested $580 million in acquisitions, $145 million of which was invested in Certificate of Occupancy or development deals.
We were successful at finding accretive acquisition opportunities through our partners and other relationships before they were exposed to the broader market. 84% of all 2018 acquisition volume was completed through off-market transactions. This off-market acquisition trend has continued into 2019, as we recently completed the buyout of one of our joint venture partners in 12 properties in Los Angeles and the Bay Area. These are well-located, purpose-built properties that we developed ourselves in the early 2000 in top-tier infill markets with true barriers to entry. Extra Space realized $72.8 million promote in the joint venture through the transaction, which was applied to the purchase price.
While 2019 will not be without its challenges, we are making the necessary investments to strengthen our platform and support our growth, while maintaining operational excellence in the current environment. 
I would now like to turn the time over to Scott."

Our core FFO for the quarter was $1.22 per share and our core FFO for the year was $4.67 per share, ahead of our guidance. The beat was primarily due to property performance and G&A savings. Core FFO includes $0.02 adjust",375,"Thanks, Joe, and hello, everyone. Our core FFO for the quarter was $1.22 per share and our core FFO for the year was $4.67 per share, ahead of our guidance. The beat was primarily due to property performance and G&A savings. Core FFO includes $0.02 adjustment for the write-off of deferred financing costs related to the prepayment of notes payable to trust. We continue to evolve our balance sheet, which has never been stronger. 
During the quarter, we amended our credit facility, accessed our ATM and increased our unencumbered pool, which now stands at $5.6 billion. These efforts are part of our goal to further diversify our capital structure, latter our maturities and minimize our average interest rate while extending the average term. This will ensure that we continue to have capacity to fund future growth through multiple sources of capital.
Last night, we provided guidance and annual assumptions for 2019. Our new same-store pool increased by 38 stores to a total of 821. Same-store revenue is expected to increase 2% to 3% in 2019. As Joe mentioned, we believe the impact from new supply will be greater in 2019 than it was in 2018. The level of this impact will depend on the timing of deliveries and the speed of absorption in impacted markets, specifically the major Florida and Texas markets.
 
Our guidance also assumes some revenue growth moderation in markets not heavily impacted by new supply. This is due to multiple years of outsized growth resulting in tough comps. 
Same-store expense growth is expected to increase 3.75% to 4.75%. The increase in expenses is primarily driven by outsized growth in property taxes and marketing spend. Our revenue and expense guidance results in NOI growth of 1.25% to 2.75%.
Our full year core FFO is estimated to be $4.73 to $4.83 per share. Our 2019 -- in 2019, we anticipate total dilution of $0.23 from value add and C of O acquisitions, up $0.03 from 2018. We recognize the short-term headwind this causes to our core FFO growth rate, but believe the investment in these lease-up stores continues to improve the quality of the portfolio and generates long-term value for our shareholders.

Thank you for joining us for our first quarter call and for your interest in Extra Space Storage. We had a good first good quarter with positive rate growth and higher occupancies, resulting in same-store revenue growth of 4.2% and same-s",448,"Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our first quarter call and for your interest in Extra Space Storage. We had a good first good quarter with positive rate growth and higher occupancies, resulting in same-store revenue growth of 4.2% and same-store NOI growth of 4.8%. This contributed to better-than-expected FFO growth, which was $0.02 above the top end of our guidance. 
Performance continues to be steady despite new supply and we are well positioned heading into the summer leasing season. While we are very pleased with the better-than-expected first quarter results, our views for the balance of 2019 remains generally unchanged. We still believe 2018 was likely the high watermark for total deliveries, and we expect 2019 deliveries to be only modestly lower. 
Further, we expect that total impact on performance from new supply to be greater in 2019 than it was in 2018 due to the cumulative impact of several years of elevated development. We are seeing this impact in the lease up of our C of O stores. Lease up has slowed from a pace that was well above pro formas in 2015 through '17 to trend that today are more in line with historic norms and with our underwriting. 
That being said, our people and our systems are working hard to maximize performance in a challenging operating environment. Our digital marketing platform continues to drive qualified traffic to our stores. We have maintained occupancies above the market averages and MSAs with new supply, but it comes at a cost. Cost-per-click are elevated due to a competitive bidding environment and we are choosing to pull the advertising lever harder in order to ensure web visibility. 
In the current environment, large operators like Extra Space are best positioned for success on the web. In the quarter, we invested $270 million in acquisitions. We continue to have success acquiring properties to off market transactions. For example, and as we mentioned last quarter, we bought a joint venture partner's interest in 12 properties in Los Angeles and the Bay Area for $192 million. We continue to explore other opportunities to enhance shareholder returns to mutually beneficial partnerships. 
We also continue to see significant growth in our third-party management platform. In the quarter, we added 46 stores, while only 2 stores left to platform both due a property sale. Additions to our third-party platform continue to be a mix of newly constructed and existing properties, bringing high-quality stores into our system as well as additional income. Between our third-party program and our JV stores, we have 805 managed stores with a strong remaining pipeline for the year. 
I would now like to turn the time over to Scott."

Our core FFO for the quarter was $1.16 per share exceeding the high end of our guidance by $0.02. The beat was primarily due to stronger-than-expected same-store property performance and lower than anticipated G&A and income tax expenses. We continue to see solid performance in the majority of our markets. 
Revenue growth was primarily driven by growth. Discounts were also down as a percentage of revenue in Q1, providing a modest tailwind that we don't necessarily expect in future quarters. Our same-store revenue growth includes the change in benefit of 30 basis points in the quarter and we anticipate that it will provide a benefit of 15 to 20 basis points for the full year. This quarter, we've added an additional disclosure to our financial supplemental showing the third year of same-store pool performance. This disclosure should help further reconcile differences in same-store pool definitions in the industry. 
Same-store expenses were mixed bag with increases in property tax and marketing spend, which were partially offset by savings in payroll and utilities expense. We expect continued pressure on property taxes and marketing expense, but we're comfortable with our ability to operate within our guidance. 
We've not made changes to our annual same-store revenue expense or NOI guidance, which imply moderating revenue growth. As we said in our last call, the moderation will result -- will be a result of increased impact of new supply, along with the difficult comps in the markets that have performed well above the portfolio average for multiple years. We've increased our full year core FFO guidance to $4.76 to $4.85 per share, which includes the $0.02 beat from the first quarter. We also made minor changes to our G&A interest expense, income tax and share count guidance. 
Our FFO guidance includes $0.07 of dilution from value add acquisitions and an additional $0.16 of dilution from our C of O stores, for a total dilution of $0.23, which is not changed from our initial guidance. We believe these acquisitions provide significant long-term value for our shareholders and improve the overall quality of our portfolio. 
With that, let's turn it over to Towanda to start our Q&A."

Thank you for joining us for our first quarter call and for your interest in Extra Space Storage. We had a good first good quarter with positive rate growth and high occupancies, resulting in same-store revenue growth of 4.2% and same-sto",448,"Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our first quarter call and for your interest in Extra Space Storage. We had a good first good quarter with positive rate growth and high occupancies, resulting in same-store revenue growth of 4.2% and same-store NOI growth of 4.8%. This contributed to better-than-expected FFO growth, which was $0.02 above the top end of our guidance.
Performance continues to be steady despite new supply and we are well positioned heading into the summer leasing season. While we are very pleased with the better-than-expected first quarter results, our views for the balance of 2019 remain generally unchanged. We still believe 2018 was likely the high watermark for total deliveries, and we expect 2019 deliveries to be only modestly lower.
Further, we expect the total impact on performance from new supply to be greater in 2019 than it was in 2018 due to the cumulative impact of several years of elevated development. We are seeing this impact in the lease up of our C of O stores. Lease up has slowed from a pace that was well above pro formas in 2015 to '17 to trends that today are more in line with historic norms and with our underwriting.
That being said, our people and our systems are working hard to maximize performance in a challenging operating environment. Our digital marketing platform continues to drive qualified traffic to our stores. We have maintained occupancies above the market averages and MSAs with new supply, but it comes at a cost. Cost-per-click are elevated due to a competitive bidding environment and we are choosing to pull the advertising lever harder in order to ensure web visibility.
In the current environment, large operators, like Extra Space, are best positioned for success on the web. In the quarter, we invested $270 million in acquisitions. We continue to have success acquiring properties through off market transactions. For example, and as we mentioned last quarter, we bought a joint venture partner's interest in 12 properties in Los Angeles and the Bay Area for $192 million. We continue to explore other opportunities to enhance shareholder returns through mutually beneficial partnerships.
We also continue to see significant growth in our third-party management platform. In the quarter, we added 46 stores, while only 2 stores left the platform both due to property sale. Additions to our third-party platform continue to be a mix of newly constructed and existing properties, bringing high-quality stores into our system as well as additional income. Between our third-party program and our JV stores, we have 805 managed stores with a strong remaining pipeline for the year.
I would now like to turn the time over to Scott."

Our core FFO for the quarter was $1.16 per share, exceeding the high end of our guidance by $0.02. The beat was primarily due to stronger-than-expected same-store property performance and lower-than-anticipated G&A and income tax expenses. We continue to see solid performance in the majority of our markets.
Revenue growth was primarily driven by achieved street rate growth. Discounts were also down as a percentage of revenue in Q1, providing a modest tailwind that we don't necessarily expect in future quarters. Our same-store revenue growth includes a change in pool benefit of 30 basis points in the quarter and we anticipate that it will provide a benefit of 15 to 20 basis points for the full year. This quarter, we've added an additional disclosure to our financial supplemental showing a third-year of same-store pool performance. This disclosure should help further reconcile differences in same-store pool definitions in the industry.
Same-store expenses were mixed bag, with increases in property tax and marketing spend, which were partially offset by savings in payroll and utilities expense. We expect continued pressure on property tax and marketing expense, but we are comfortable with our ability to operate within our guidance.
We have not made material -- we have not made changes to our annual same-store revenue expense or NOI guidance, which imply moderating revenue growth. As we said in our last call, the moderation will result -- will be a result of increased impact of new supply, along with the difficult comps in markets that have performed well above the portfolio average for multiple years. We've increased our full year core FFO guidance to $4.76 to $4.85 per share, which includes the $0.02 beat from the first quarter. We also made minor changes to our G&A interest expense, income tax and share count guidance.
Our FFO guidance includes $0.07 of dilution from value-add acquisitions and an additional $0.16 of dilution from our C of O stores, for total dilution of $0.23, which has not changed from our initial guidance. We believe these acquisitions provide significant long-term value for our shareholders and improve the overall quality of our portfolio.
With that, let's turn it over to Towanda to start our Q&A."

Thank you for joining us for our first quarter call and for your interest in Extra Space Storage. We had a good first good quarter with positive rate growth and high occupancies, resulting in same-store revenue growth of 4.2% and same-sto",446,"Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our first quarter call and for your interest in Extra Space Storage. We had a good first good quarter with positive rate growth and high occupancies, resulting in same-store revenue growth of 4.2% and same-store NOI growth of 4.8%. This contributed to better-than-expected FFO growth, which was $0.02 above the top end of our guidance.
Performance continues to be steady despite new supply and we are well positioned heading into the summer leasing season. While we are very pleased with the better-than-expected first quarter results, our views for the balance of 2019 remain generally unchanged. We still believe 2018 was likely the high-water mark for total deliveries, and we expect 2019 deliveries to be only modestly lower.
Further, we expect the total impact on performance from new supply to be greater in 2019 than it was in 2018 due to the cumulative impact of several years of elevated development. We are seeing this impact in the lease-up of our C of O stores. Lease-up has slowed from a pace that was well above pro formas in 2015 through '17, to trends that today are more in line with historic norms and with our underwriting.
That being said, our people and our systems are working hard to maximize performance in a challenging operating environment. Our digital marketing platform continues to drive qualified traffic to our stores. We have maintained occupancies above the market averages and MSAs with new supply, but it comes at a cost. Cost-per-click are elevated due to a competitive bidding environment and we are choosing to pull the advertising lever harder in order to ensure web visibility.
In the current environment, large operators, like Extra Space, are best positioned for success on the web. In the quarter, we invested $270 million in acquisitions. We continue to have success acquiring properties through off-market transactions. For example, and as we mentioned last quarter, we bought a joint venture partner's interest in 12 properties in Los Angeles and the Bay Area for $192 million. We continue to explore other opportunities to enhance shareholder returns through mutually beneficial partnerships.
We also continue to see significant growth in our third-party management platform. In the quarter, we added 46 stores, while only 2 stores left the platform both due to a property sale. Additions to our third-party platform continue to be a mix of newly constructed and existing properties, bringing high-quality stores into our system as well as additional income. Between our third-party program and our JV stores, we have 805 managed stores with a strong remaining pipeline for the year.

Our core FFO for the quarter was $1.16 per share, exceeding the high end of our guidance by $0.02. The beat was primarily due to stronger-than-expected same-store property performance and lower-than-anticipated G&A and income tax expenses. We continue to see solid performance in the majority of our markets.
Revenue growth was primarily driven by a [ cheap ] street rate growth. Discounts were also down as a percentage of revenue in Q1, providing a modest tailwind that we don't necessarily expect in future quarters. Our same-store revenue growth includes a change in pool benefit of 30 basis points in the quarter and we anticipate that it will provide a benefit of 15 to 20 basis points for the full year. This quarter, we've added an additional disclosure to our financial supplemental showing a third-year of same-store pool performance. This disclosure should help further reconcile differences in same-store pool definitions in the industry.
Same-store expenses were a mixed bag, with increases in property tax and marketing spend, which were partially offset by savings in payroll and utilities expense. We expect continued pressure on property tax and marketing expense, but we are comfortable with our ability to operate within our guidance.
We have not made material -- we have not made changes to our annual same-store revenue expense or NOI guidance, which imply moderating revenue growth. As we said in our last call, the moderation will result -- will be a result of increased impact of new supply, along with the difficult comps in markets that have performed well above the portfolio average for multiple years. We've increased our full year core FFO guidance to $4.76 to $4.85 per share, which includes the $0.02 beat from the first quarter. We also made minor changes to our G&A, interest expense, income tax and share count guidance.
Our FFO guidance includes $0.07 of dilution from value-add acquisitions and an additional $0.16 of dilution from our C of O stores, for total dilution of $0.23, which has not changed from our initial guidance. We believe these acquisitions provide significant long-term value for our shareholders and improve the overall quality of our portfolio.
With that, let's turn it over to Towanda to start our Q&A."

Thank you for joining us for our first quarter call and for your interest in Extra Space Storage. We had a good first good quarter with positive rate growth and high occupancies, resulting in same-store revenue growth of 4.2% and same-sto",446,"Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our first quarter call and for your interest in Extra Space Storage. We had a good first good quarter with positive rate growth and high occupancies, resulting in same-store revenue growth of 4.2% and same-store NOI growth of 4.8%. This contributed to better-than-expected FFO growth, which was $0.02 above the top end of our guidance.
Performance continues to be steady despite new supply and we are well positioned heading into the summer leasing season. While we are very pleased with the better-than-expected first quarter results, our views for the balance of 2019 remain generally unchanged. We still believe 2018 was likely the high-water mark for total deliveries, and we expect 2019 deliveries to be only modestly lower.
Further, we expect the total impact on performance from new supply to be greater in 2019 than it was in 2018 due to the cumulative impact of several years of elevated development. We are seeing this impact in the lease-up of our C of O stores. Lease-up has slowed from a pace that was well above pro formas in 2015 through '17, to trends that today are more in line with historic norms and with our underwriting.
That being said, our people and our systems are working hard to maximize performance in a challenging operating environment. Our digital marketing platform continues to drive qualified traffic to our stores. We have maintained occupancies above the market averages and MSAs with new supply, but it comes at a cost. Cost-per-click are elevated due to a competitive bidding environment and we are choosing to pull the advertising lever harder in order to ensure web visibility.
In the current environment, large operators, like Extra Space, are best positioned for success on the web. In the quarter, we invested $270 million in acquisitions. We continue to have success acquiring properties through off-market transactions. For example, and as we mentioned last quarter, we bought a joint venture partner's interest in 12 properties in Los Angeles and the Bay Area for $192 million. We continue to explore other opportunities to enhance shareholder returns through mutually beneficial partnerships.
We also continue to see significant growth in our third-party management platform. In the quarter, we added 46 stores, while only 2 stores left the platform both due to a property sale. Additions to our third-party platform continue to be a mix of newly constructed and existing properties, bringing high-quality stores into our system as well as additional income. Between our third-party program and our JV stores, we have 805 managed stores with a strong remaining pipeline for the year.
I would now like to turn the time over to Scott."

Our core FFO for the quarter was $1.16 per share, exceeding the high end of our guidance by $0.02. The beat was primarily due to stronger-than-expected same-store property performance and lower-than-anticipated G&A and income tax expenses. We continue to see solid performance in the majority of our markets.
Revenue growth was primarily driven by a [ cheap ] street rate growth. Discounts were also down as a percentage of revenue in Q1, providing a modest tailwind that we don't necessarily expect in future quarters. Our same-store revenue growth includes a change in pool benefit of 30 basis points in the quarter and we anticipate that it will provide a benefit of 15 to 20 basis points for the full year. This quarter, we've added an additional disclosure to our financial supplemental showing a third-year of same-store pool performance. This disclosure should help further reconcile differences in same-store pool definitions in the industry.
Same-store expenses were a mixed bag, with increases in property tax and marketing spend, which were partially offset by savings in payroll and utilities expense. We expect continued pressure on property tax and marketing expense, but we are comfortable with our ability to operate within our guidance.
We have not made material -- we have not made changes to our annual same-store revenue expense or NOI guidance, which imply moderating revenue growth. As we said in our last call, the moderation will result -- will be a result of increased impact of new supply, along with the difficult comps in markets that have performed well above the portfolio average for multiple years. We've increased our full year core FFO guidance to $4.76 to $4.85 per share, which includes the $0.02 beat from the first quarter. We also made minor changes to our G&A, interest expense, income tax and share count guidance.
Our FFO guidance includes $0.07 of dilution from value-add acquisitions and an additional $0.16 of dilution from our C of O stores, for total dilution of $0.23, which has not changed from our initial guidance. We believe these acquisitions provide significant long-term value for our shareholders and improve the overall quality of our portfolio.
With that, let's turn it over to Towanda to start our Q&A."

I recognize this is maybe a little dated, but if I look at your discounting trends from your last slide deck and assume those more or less carry through the first quarter, it looks like there's perhaps maybe call it a 40 basis point give or take benefit to revenue growth from the lower discounting as a percentage of revenues relative to last year on a dollar basis.

Thank you for joining us for our second quarter call and for your interest in Extra Space Storage. We had a solid quarter with positive rate growth and healthy occupancy in a competitive summer leasing season. Same-store revenue and NOI both increased by 3.9%, exceeding our estimates.
This property outperformance contributed to better-than-expected FFO growth of 6.1%, which was $0.02 above the top end of for guidance. We are pleased with our results in the first half of the year and the success of our team and best-in-class platform have had mitigating the impact felt from new supply.
In order to achieve this performance, we increased our advertising spend significantly on a year-over-year basis. And we do not expect the increased advertising spend to abate anytime soon. As anticipated, we have seen the timing of expected delivery slip on many developments.
As these delayed projects deliver and begin their lease up, we expect additional moderation in the back half of the year. However, while the market will continue to be very competitive, large operators with diversified portfolios and sophisticated systems, like Extra Space Storage, are best position to navigate this supply sector.
We continue to actively explore external growth opportunities that present attractive risk, reward metrics. Widely marketed acquisitions are still very expensive, however, we continue to find success acquiring off-market acquisitions through long-standing relationships.
During the quarter, we purchased a non-marketed 11 property portfolio in a joint venture structure for $228 million. We have also acquired 1 Certificate of Occupancy project and completed 1 development for a total investment by the company of $57 million.
We have also executed innovated capital-wide opportunities to enhance shareholder returns. In the quarter, we closed our first net lease transaction with WP Carey, which will include 36 total assets, including 5 New York City assets that are new to our platform. We are gaining traction in our bridged lending program and our third-party management platform continues to see significant growth. In the quarter, we added 48 managed stores, bringing our 6-month total to 94 stores. Between our third-party program in our JV platform, we now manage 838 stores with the strong pipeline for the back half of the year. I would now like to turn the time over to Scott."

Our core FFO for the quarter was a $1.22 per share, exceeding the high end of our guidance by $0.02. The beat was primarily due to stronger-than-expected property performance and standard insurance income. Revenue growth was driven by increased street rates, with lower discounts also providing a tailwind. Year-over-year occupancy declined marginally in June, but we have already seen that bounce back in July, and today our occupancy GAAP is approximately 30 basis points below this time last year.
This is in line with our annual expectations. Like last quarter, same-store expenses were mixed bag, with increases in property taxes and marketing spend, which were partially offset by savings in payroll and utilities expense.
We view our elevated paid search and digital spend as one lever to drive revenue growth. However, pay per click advertising is expensive, especially in markets impacted by new supply.
Now turning to the balance sheet. We continue to have access to multiple sources of capital, and during the quarter, we accessed our ATM and issued approximately $100 million in equity. Subsequent to quarter end, we completed a transaction that converted $500 million of secured debt to unsecured debt and extended the term.
For many years, we have been laddering our maturities and increasing the size of pool to strengthen our balance sheet. The quality of our balance sheet was recently recognized by S&P Global when assigned a BBB flat rating. This is another step in our overall balance sheet evolution.
Due to our outperformance in the first half of the year, we have raised our annual same-store guidance to 2.5% to 3.25%. As Joe mentioned, we still expect moderation in the back half of the year as we feel the additional impact from new supply. We also increased the bottom end of our expense guidance due to elevated marketing spend, resulting in the annual range of 4% to 4.75%.
These changes result in raised annual same-store NOI guidance of 1.75% to 3%. We raised our full year core FFO guidance to $4.79 to $4.87 per share, which includes the $0.02 beat from the second quarter. Our core FFO guidance includes $0.07 of dilution from value-add acquisitions and an additional $0.16 of dilution from C of O stores, for total dilution of $0.23, which is unchanged from our initial guidance. We believe these acquisitions will provide significant long-term value for our shareholders and improve the overall quality of our portfolio.
With that, let's turn it over to Jason to start our Q&A."

We feel like that's better than lowering rates. However, we still feel like discounts are effective. If you look at why our discounts are lower year-over-year, part of the reason is because our rentals were down slightly. And so that causes your discounts to be down slightly. And then in addition, we have changed our rental, our discount policy such that we do not discount at certain levels of occupancy. And so for instances on the last year, we're not going to offer a discount on something like that. So some small tweaks in the discounting kind of policy or procedure as well as lower rental volumes is also caused discounting to be down.

We are pleased with our results in the first half of the year and the success our team and best-in-class platform have had mitigating the impact felt from new supply.

However, while the market will continue to be very competitive, large operators with diversified portfolios and sophisticated systems, like Extra Space Storage, are best positioned to navigate the supply cycle.
We continue to actively explore external growth opportunities that present attractive risk/reward metrics. Widely marketed acquisitions are still very expensive. However, we continue to find success acquiring off-market acquisitions through long-standing relationships.
During the quarter, we purchased a nonmarketed 11 property portfolio in a joint venture structure for $228 million. We also acquired 1 Certificate of Occupancy project and completed 1 development for a total investment by the company of $57 million.
We have also executed innovative capital-light opportunities to enhance shareholder returns. In the quarter, we closed our first net lease transaction with W.P. Carey, which will include 36 total assets including 5 New York City assets that are new to our platform. We are gaining traction in our bridge-lending program and our third-party management platform continues to see significant growth. In the quarter, we added 48 managed stores bringing our 6-month total to 94 stores. Between our third-party program and our JV platform, we now manage 838 stores with the strong pipeline for the back half of the year.
I would now like to turn the time over to Scott."

Our core FFO for the quarter was a $1.22 per share, exceeding the high end of our guidance by $0.02. The beat was primarily due to stronger-than-expected property performance and tenant insurance income. Revenue growth",425,"Thank you, Joe, and hello, everyone. Our core FFO for the quarter was a $1.22 per share, exceeding the high end of our guidance by $0.02. The beat was primarily due to stronger-than-expected property performance and tenant insurance income. Revenue growth was driven by increased street rates, with lower discounts also providing a tailwind. Year-over-year occupancy declined marginally in June, but we have already seen that bounce back in July, and today our occupancy gap is approximately 30 basis points below this time last year. This is in line with our annual expectations.
Like last quarter, same-store expenses were a mixed bag, with increases in property taxes and marketing spend which were partially offset by savings in payroll and utilities expense.
We view our elevated paid search and digital spend as one lever to drive revenue growth. However, pay per click advertising is expensive, especially in markets impacted by new supply.
Now turning to the balance sheet. We continue to have access to multiple sources of capital, and during the quarter, we accessed our ATM and issued approximately $100 million in equity. Subsequent to quarter-end, we completed a transaction that converted $500 million of secured debt to unsecured debt and extended the term.
For many years, we have been laddering our maturities and increasing the size of our unencumbered pool to strengthen our balance sheet. The quality of our balance sheet was recently recognized by S&P Global when they assigned a BBB flat rating. This is another step in our overall balance sheet evolution.
Due to our outperformance in the first half of the year, we have raised our annual same-store guidance to 2.5% to 3.25%. As Joe mentioned, we still expect moderation in the back half of the year as we feel the additional impact from new supply. We also increased the bottom end of our expense guidance due to elevated marketing spend, resulting in an annual range of 4% to 4.75%. These changes result in raised annual same-store NOI guidance of 1.75% to 3%.
We raised our full year core FFO guidance to $4.79 to $4.87 per share, which includes the $0.02 beat from the second quarter. Our core FFO guidance includes $0.07 of dilution from value-add acquisitions and an additional $0.16 of dilution from C of O stores, for total dilution of $0.23, which is unchanged from our initial guidance. We believe these acquisitions will provide significant long-term value for our shareholders and improve the overall quality of our portfolio.
With that, let's turn it over to Jason to start our Q&A."

So there's lots of equity keeping prices high, and we're trying to remain disciplined.

I just want to circle back on the topic of discounting. And if I understand correctly from prior comments and comments that were made last quarter, it sounds like the dollar value of discounting has been sort of lower than you had originally expected. While at the same time, the marketing spend online has been quite a bit higher. I'm just wondering if those 2 events are related, because we've heard similar trends from other large operators as well. I'm just wondering if there is sort of a tradeoff that a dollar is better spent today with online marketing rather than trying to attract a customer with a promotion with the first month rent."

I would tell you that it's sum of both, meaning we have made a conscious choice to spend more on marketing, obviously. We feel like that's better than lowering rates. However, we still feel like discounts are effective. If you look at why our discounts are lower year-over-year, part of the reason is because our rentals were down slightly. And so that causes your discounts to be down slightly. And then in addition, we have changed our rental, our discount policy such that we do not discount at certain levels of occupancy. And so -- for instances, on a last year, no, we're not going to offer a discount on something like that. So some small tweaks in the discounting kind of policy or procedure as well as lower rental volumes has also caused discounting to be down. And then also a conscious decision to spend more on marketing."

Thank you for joining us for our second quarter call and for your interest in Extra Space Storage. We had a solid quarter with positive rate growth and healthy occupancy in a competitive summer leasing season. Same-store revenue and NOI both increased by 3.9%, exceeding our estimates. This property outperformance contributed to better-than-expected FFO growth of 6.1%, which was $0.02 above the top end of our guidance.
We are pleased with our results in the first half of the year and the success our team and best-in-class platform have had mitigating the impact felt from new supply. In order to achieve this performance, we increased our advertising spend significantly on a year-over-year basis. And we do not expect the increased advertising spend to abate anytime soon.
As anticipated, we have seen the timing of expected deliveries slip on many developments. As these delayed projects deliver and begin their lease-up, we expect additional moderation in the back half of the year. However, while the market will continue to be very competitive, large operators with diversified portfolios and sophisticated systems, like Extra Space Storage, are best positioned to navigate the supply cycle.
We continue to actively explore external growth opportunities that present attractive risk/reward metrics. Widely marketed acquisitions are still very expensive. However, we continue to find success acquiring off-market acquisitions through long-standing relationships.
During the quarter, we purchased a nonmarketed 11 property portfolio in a joint venture structure for $228 million. We also acquired 1 Certificate of Occupancy project and completed 1 development for a total investment by the company of $57 million.
We have also executed innovative capital-light opportunities to enhance shareholder returns. In the quarter, we closed our first net lease transaction with W.P. Carey, which will include 36 total assets including 5 New York City assets that are new to our platform. We are gaining traction in our bridge lending program and our third-party management platform continues to see significant growth. In the quarter, we added 48 managed stores, bringing our 6-month total to 94 stores. Between our third-party program and our JV platform, we now manage 838 stores with the strong pipeline for the back half of the year.
I would now like to turn the time over to Scott."

Our core FFO for the quarter was $1.22 per share, exceeding the high end of our guidance by $0.02. The beat was primarily due to stronger-than-expected property performance and tenant insurance income. Revenue growth was driven by increased street rates, with lower discounts also providing a tailwind. Year-over-year occupancy declined marginally in June, but we have already seen that bounce back in July, and today our occupancy gap is approximately 30 basis points below this time last year. This is in line with our annual expectations.
Like last quarter, same-store expenses were a mixed bag, with increases in property taxes and marketing spend which were partially offset by savings in payroll and utilities expense.
We view our elevated paid search and digital spend as one lever to drive revenue growth. However, pay-per-click advertising is expensive, especially in markets impacted by new supply.
Now turning to the balance sheet. We continue to have access to multiple sources of capital, and during the quarter, we accessed our ATM and issued approximately $100 million in equity. Subsequent to quarter end, we completed a transaction that converted $500 million of secured debt to unsecured debt and extended the term.
For many years, we have been laddering our maturities and increasing the size of our unencumbered pool to strengthen our balance sheet. The quality of our balance sheet was recently recognized by S&P Global when they assigned a BBB flat rating. This is another step in our overall balance sheet evolution.
Due to our outperformance in the first half of the year, we have raised our annual same-store guidance to 2.5% to 3.25%. As Joe mentioned, we still expect moderation in the back half of the year as we feel the additional impact from new supply. We also increased the bottom end of our expense guidance due to elevated marketing spend, resulting in an annual range of 4% to 4.75%. These changes result in raised annual same-store NOI guidance of 1.75% to 3%.
We raised our full year core FFO guidance to $4.79 to $4.87 per share, which includes the $0.02 beat from the second quarter. Our core FFO guidance includes $0.07 of dilution from value-add acquisitions and an additional $0.16 of dilution from C of O stores, for total dilution of $0.23, which is unchanged from our initial guidance. We believe these acquisitions will provide significant long-term value for our shareholders and improve the overall quality of our portfolio.
With that, let's turn it over to Jason to start our Q&A."

Thank you for joining us for our second quarter call and for your interest in Extra Space Storage. We had a solid quarter with positive rate growth and healthy occupancy in a competitive summer leasing season. Same-store revenue and NOI both increased by 3.9%, exceeding our estimates. This property outperformance contributed to better-than-expected FFO growth of 6.1%, which was $0.02 above the top end of our guidance.
We are pleased with our results in the first half of the year and the success our team and best-in-class platform have had mitigating the impact felt from new supply. In order to achieve this performance, we increased our advertising spend significantly on a year-over-year basis. And we do not expect the increased advertising spend to abate anytime soon.
As anticipated, we have seen the timing of expected deliveries slip on many developments. As these delayed projects deliver and begin their lease-up, we expect additional moderation in the back half of the year. However, while the market will continue to be very competitive, large operators with diversified portfolios and sophisticated systems, like Extra Space Storage, are best positioned to navigate the supply cycle.
We continue to actively explore external growth opportunities that present attractive risk/reward metrics. Widely marketed acquisitions are still very expensive. However, we continue to find success acquiring off-market acquisitions through long-standing relationships.
During the quarter, we purchased a nonmarketed 11 property portfolio in a joint venture structure for $228 million. We also acquired 1 Certificate of Occupancy project and completed 1 development for a total investment by the company of $57 million.
We have also executed innovative capital-light opportunities to enhance shareholder returns. In the quarter, we closed our first net lease transaction with W.P. Carey, which will include 36 total assets including 5 New York City assets that are new to our platform. We are gaining traction in our bridge lending program and our third-party management platform continues to see significant growth. In the quarter, we added 48 managed stores, bringing our 6-month total to 94 stores. Between our third-party program and our JV platform, we now manage 838 stores with the strong pipeline for the back half of the year.
I would now like to turn the time over to Scott."

Our core FFO for the quarter was $1.22 per share, exceeding the high end of our guidance by $0.02. The beat was primarily due to stronger-than-expected property performance and tenant insurance income. Revenue growth was driven by increased street rates, with lower discounts also providing a tailwind. Year-over-year occupancy declined marginally in June, but we have already seen that bounce back in July, and today our occupancy gap is approximately 30 basis points below this time last year. This is in line with our annual expectations.
Like last quarter, same-store expenses were a mixed bag, with increases in property taxes and marketing spend which were partially offset by savings in payroll and utilities expense.
We view our elevated paid search and digital spend as one lever to drive revenue growth. However, pay-per-click advertising is expensive, especially in markets impacted by new supply.
Now turning to the balance sheet. We continue to have access to multiple sources of capital, and during the quarter, we accessed our ATM and issued approximately $100 million in equity. Subsequent to quarter end, we completed a transaction that converted $500 million of secured debt to unsecured debt and extended the term.
For many years, we have been laddering our maturities and increasing the size of our unencumbered pool to strengthen our balance sheet. The quality of our balance sheet was recently recognized by S&P Global when they assigned a BBB flat rating. This is another step in our overall balance sheet evolution.
Due to our outperformance in the first half of the year, we have raised our annual same-store guidance to 2.5% to 3.25%. As Joe mentioned, we still expect moderation in the back half of the year as we feel the additional impact from new supply. We also increased the bottom end of our expense guidance due to elevated marketing spend, resulting in an annual range of 4% to 4.75%. These changes result in raised annual same-store NOI guidance of 1.75% to 3%.
We raised our full year core FFO guidance to $4.79 to $4.87 per share, which includes the $0.02 beat from the second quarter. Our core FFO guidance includes $0.07 of dilution from value-add acquisitions and an additional $0.16 of dilution from C of O stores, for total dilution of $0.23, which is unchanged from our initial guidance. We believe these acquisitions will provide significant long-term value for our shareholders and improve the overall quality of our portfolio.
With that, let's turn it over to Jason to start our Q&A."

Thank you for joining us for our third quarter call and for your interest in Extra Space Storage. We completed another busy and competitive leasing season. The sector headlines coming out of the summer are the same themes we have been hearing for much of the year. Many markets are feeling the headwind of new supply, and digital advertising is as expensive as we have ever seen it. 
External growth through traditional acquisitions is challenging due to capital flows into the sector. We also continue to see pressure on multiple expense line items, including property taxes. And despite these headwinds, we had another solid quarter allowing us to increase our annual guidance.
As expected, we have started to experience the increased moderation in the second half of the year, which was projected in our guidance. However, our diversified portfolio, sophisticated platform and strong operations team continue to be resilient. 
We continued our pricing power with in-place customers and have maintained very strong occupancies at our properties. We also continue to actively explore external growth opportunities that present attractive risk-adjusted returns. In addition to our acquisitions, we added 5 new stores to the platform in New York City through a previously announced net lease transaction with W.P. Carey. We also closed several bridge loans and expect to complete over $100 million in total originations in our first year with approximately $45 million of the balances held by Extra Space. 
Yesterday, we closed $150 million preferred equity investment with SmartStop with an additional $50 million committed for investment in the next 12 months. The investment has a dividend of 6.25%, which begins to escalate after year 5. This investment is a senior to significant amount of common equity and this strengthens our ongoing relationship with SmartStop. 
Our third-party management platform continues to see exceptional growth. In the quarter, we added 42 mandate stores, bringing our year-to-date total to 136. Between our third-party program in our JV stores, we had 877 managed stores, with a strong remaining pipeline for Q4 and for 2020. 
I would now like to turn the time over to Scott Stubbs, our CFO."

Our Core FFO for the quarter was a $1.24 per share consensus 1 penny below the high-end of our guidance. This was due to delays in completion of several solar projects and the related tax credits, resulting in higher income tax expense. These tax credits will be recognized next year once these projects are completed. 
Rental and tenant insurance revenue outperformed expectations. Revenue growth was primarily driven by achieved rate growth with lower discounts also providing a benefit. Year-over-year occupancy bounced back in Q3 and was flat at quarter end. Like last year, same-store expenses were elevated due to increases in property tax and marketing expense. 
We continue to be pleased with the quality of our balance sheet and access to all types of capital. During the quarter, we accessed our ATM and achieved slightly over $100 million in equity at an average price of $119.30 per share. 
Year-to-date, we've issued just over $200 million on our ATM. These funds were used for acquisitions and reduce the balances on our revolving lines. During the quarter, we also exercised in the accordion feature in our credit facility. This transaction provided several benefits. 
First, it reduced interest cost. Second, it converted $500 million in secured debt to unsecured. And third, it extended the average term. 
Subsequent to quarter end, we completed a $300 million 10-year private placement transaction at the rate of 3.47%, further enhancing our unencumbered property pool. Due to a property our performance year-to-date, we have raised our annual same-store guidance to 3% to 3.5%. We revised our expense guidance to an annual range of 4.5% to 5%. 
These changes result in annual same-store NOI guidance of 2.25% to 3%, a 25 basis point increase at the midpoint. We're also raising our Core FFO guidance to $4.84 to $4.87 per share. Our FFO guidance includes $0.07 of dilution from value-added acquisitions and an additional $0.16 of dilution from C of O stores for a total dilution of $0.23, which is unchanged from our initial guidance. 
With that, let's turn it over to Norma to start our Q&A."

And in this point in the market cycle, we're very focused on risk. So my comments on the introduction about capital flows and difficulty finding deals, really focuses on traditional marketed deals. What the deal gets out to the market and the broker has that, and there's many, many builders, I think, it's very difficult for us to be that high bidder and captured the deal. That being said, we been very active on the acquisition side through the end of the third quarter, we purchased $362 million. We've invested $362 million in acquisitions. We have another $52 million, $50 million, $52 million under contract to close this year. We hope to find a couple other deals. In addition, we'll do a little over $100 million in our program. We did the net lease deal, which had no capital outplay, but a good return.

Thank you for joining us for our third quarter call and for your interest in Extra Space Storage. We completed another busy and competitive leasing season. The sector headlines coming out of the summer are the same themes we have been hearing for much of the year. Many markets are feeling the headwind of new supply, and digital advertising is as expensive as we have ever seen it.
External growth through traditional acquisitions is challenging due to capital flows into the sector. We also continue to see pressure on multiple expense line items, including property taxes. And despite these headwinds, we had another solid quarter allowing us to increase our annual guidance.
As expected, we have started to experience the increased moderation in the second half of the year, which was projected in our guidance. However, our diversified portfolio, sophisticated platform and strong operations team continue to be resilient.
We continued our pricing power with in-place customers and have maintained very strong occupancies at our properties. We also continue to actively explore external growth opportunities that present attractive risk-adjusted returns. In addition to our acquisitions, we added 5 new stores to the platform in New York City through a previously announced net lease transaction with W.P. Carey. We also closed several bridge loans and expect to complete over $100 million in total originations in our first year with approximately $45 million of the balances held by Extra Space.
Yesterday, we closed $150 million preferred equity investment with SmartStop with an additional $50 million committed for investment in the next 12 months. The investment has a dividend of 6.25%, which begins to escalate after year 5. This investment is senior to a significant amount of common equity and strengthens our ongoing relationship with SmartStop.
Our third-party management platform continues to see exceptional growth. In the quarter, we added 42 managed stores, bringing our year-to-date total to 136. Between our third-party program and our JV stores, we have 877 managed stores, with a strong remaining pipeline for Q4 and for 2020.

Our Core FFO for the quarter was $1.24 per share, meeting consensus but $0.01 below the high end of our guidance. This was due to delays in completion of several solar projects and the related tax credits, resulting in higher income tax expense. These tax credits will be recognized next year once these projects are completed.
Rental and tenant insurance revenue outperformed expectations. Revenue growth was primarily driven by achieved rate growth with lower discount usage also providing a benefit. Year-over-year occupancy bounced back in Q3 and was flat at quarter end. Like last year, same-store expenses were elevated due to increases in property tax and marketing expense.
We continue to be pleased with the quality of our balance sheet and our access to all types of capital. During the quarter, we accessed our ATM and achieved slightly over $100 million in equity at an average price of $119.30 per share. Year-to-date, we have issued just over $200 million on our ATM. These funds were used for acquisitions and to reduce the balances on our revolving lines.
During the quarter, we also exercised the accordion feature in our credit facility. This transaction provided several benefits: first, it reduced interest cost; second, it converted $500 million in secured debt to unsecured; and third, it extended the average term.
Subsequent to quarter end, we completed a $300 million 10-year private placement transaction at the rate of 3.47%, further enhancing our unencumbered property pool. Due to our property outperformance year-to-date, we have raised our annual same-store guidance to 3% to 3.5%. We revised our expense guidance to an annual range of 4.5% to 5%.
These changes result in annual same-store NOI guidance of 2.25% to 3%, a 25 basis point increase at the midpoint. We are also raising our core FFO guidance to $4.84 to $4.87 per share. Our FFO guidance includes $0.07 of dilution from value-add acquisitions and an additional $0.16 of dilution from C of O stores for a total dilution of $0.23, which is unchanged from our initial guidance.
With that, let's turn it over to Norma to start our Q&A."

And so during the quarter, we decreased rates and we increased our occupancy. So we went from being down 60 basis points to being flat at the end of the quarter. And then today, we're actually 10 basis points ahead in October. So lowering rates obviously helps.

So wondering if that's dried up a little here and therefore -- even if temporarily and therefore, maybe SmartStop deal a little more compelling, which, from a return perspective, it's fine at the 6.25%, but when we just compare that to where you've been able to buy and stabilize that and even the same with your C of O deals that has generally been higher.

First to your last point, I think relative return always goes with relative risk. So yes, this is a 6.25% dividend payment, but it is ahead of hundreds of millions of dollars, significant amount of common equity. So the return may not be as good as doing a C of O deal, but the risk is significantly less. And in this point in the market cycle, we are very focused on risk.
So my comments on the introduction about capital flows and difficulty finding deals really focuses on traditional marketed deals. Once the deal gets out to the market and broker has it, and there's many, many bidders, I think it's very difficult for us to be that high bidder and capture that deal. That being said, we've been very active on the acquisition side. Through the end of the third quarter, we purchased $362 million. We've invested $362 million in acquisitions. We have another $52 million -- $50 million, $52 million under contract to close this year. We hope to find a couple other deals. In addition, we'll do a little over $100 million in our bridge loan program. We did the net lease deal, which has no capital outplay, but a good return. So while we haven't been able to purchase a lot in the market by having good relationships, buying things from our JV partners or management plus finding creative deals, we've been able to have, what I think is, a good year on the growth front."

But that being said, I think the wage pressure we're seeing in this country with the low unemployment is going to override that at least in the short term, at least next year. And also, we put a high value on our people. And whether it's the data scientists here in Salt Lake City or the folks in the store who are face-to-face with the customer every day. And we are a business that has very high operating margins. So the incremental cost of having a very high quality employee in front of the customers versus losing 1 or 2 rentals a month, it's to us that's an easy equation. And we want to make sure we have good and high-quality people in our stores. And if that means we're going to see some pressure on the wage side then that's a trade we're willing to make."

With respect to why do something in a joint venture versus wholly owned, joint ventures do a number of things for us. One is they spread risk, and if we have smaller dollar investment in a particular asset. Secondly, it enhances returns in a couple ways. One is we get all the tenant insurance on a smaller investment base than 100% owned. We get a management fee. In many of them, we get the opportunity to earn or promote down the road.

Thank you for joining us for our third quarter call and for your interest in Extra Space Storage. We completed another busy and competitive leasing season. The sector headlines coming out of the summer are the same themes we have been hearing for much of the year. Many markets are feeling the headwind of new supply, and digital advertising is as expensive as we have ever seen it.
External growth through traditional acquisitions is challenging due to capital flows into the sector. We also continue to see pressure on multiple expense line items, including property taxes. And despite these headwinds, we had another solid quarter allowing us to increase our annual guidance.
As expected, we have started to experience the increased moderation in the second half of the year, which was projected in our guidance. However, our diversified portfolio, sophisticated platform and strong operations team continued to be resilient.
We continued our pricing power with in-place customers and have maintained very strong occupancies at our properties. We also continue to actively explore external growth opportunities that present attractive risk-adjusted returns. In addition to our acquisitions, we added 5 new stores to the platform in New York City through a previously announced net lease transaction with W.P. Carey. We also closed several bridge loans and expect to complete over $100 million in total originations in our first year with approximately $45 million of the balances held by Extra Space.
Yesterday, we closed $150 million preferred equity investment with SmartStop with an additional $50 million committed for investment in the next 12 months. The investment has a dividend of 6.25%, which begins to escalate after year 5. This investment is senior to a significant amount of common equity and strengthens our ongoing relationship with SmartStop.
Our third-party management platform continues to see exceptional growth. In the quarter, we added 42 managed stores, bringing our year-to-date total to 136. Between our third-party program and our JV stores, we have 877 managed stores, with a strong remaining pipeline for Q4 and for 2020.
I would now like to turn the time over to Scott Stubbs, our CFO."

Our Core FFO for the quarter was $1.24 per share, meeting consensus but $0.01 below the high end of our guidance. This was due to delays in completion of several solar projects and the related tax credits, resulting in higher income tax expense. These tax credits will be recognized next year once these projects are completed.
Rental and tenant insurance revenue outperformed expectations. Revenue growth was primarily driven by achieved rate growth with lower discount usage also providing a benefit. Year-over-year occupancy bounced back in Q3 and was flat at quarter end. Like last year, same-store expenses were elevated due to increases in property tax and marketing expense.
We continue to be pleased with the quality of our balance sheet and our access to all types of capital. During the quarter, we accessed our ATM and achieved slightly over $100 million in equity at an average price of $119.30 per share. Year-to-date, we have issued just over $200 million on our ATM. These funds were used for acquisitions and to reduce the balances on our revolving lines.
During the quarter, we also exercised the accordion feature in our credit facility. This transaction provided several benefits: first, it reduced interest cost; second, it converted $500 million in secured debt to unsecured; and third, it extended the average term.
Subsequent to quarter end, we completed a $300 million 10-year private placement transaction at the rate of 3.47%, further enhancing our unencumbered property pool. Due to our property outperformance year-to-date, we have raised our annual same-store guidance to 3% to 3.5%. We revised our expense guidance to an annual range of 4.5% to 5%.
These changes result in annual same-store NOI guidance of 2.25% to 3%, a 25 basis point increase at the midpoint. We are also raising our core FFO guidance to $4.84 to $4.87 per share. Our FFO guidance includes $0.07 of dilution from value-add acquisitions and an additional $0.16 of dilution from C of O stores for a total dilution of $0.23, which is unchanged from our initial guidance.
With that, let's turn it over to Norma to start our Q&A."

And so during the quarter, we decreased rates and we increased our occupancy. So we went from being down 60 basis points to being flat at the end of the quarter. And then today, we're actually 10 basis points ahead in October. So lowering rates obviously helps. Now when I talk about lowering rates, I'm saying our achieved rate was actually lower during the third quarter. At the end of the quarter and where we are today is our achieved rates are actually slightly negative year-over-year. Our achieved rates are slightly negative to the tune of low single digits."

First to your last point, I think relative return always goes with relative risk. So yes, this is a 6.25% dividend payment, but it is ahead of hundreds of millions of dollars, significant amount of common equity. So the return may not be as good as doing a CO deal, but the risk is significantly less. And in this point in the market cycle, we are very focused on risk.
So my comments on the introduction about capital flows and difficulty finding deals really focuses on traditional marketed deals. Once the deal gets out to the market and broker has it, and there's many, many bidders, I think it's very difficult for us to be that high bidder and capture that deal. That being said, we've been very active on the acquisition side. Through the end of the third quarter, we purchased $362 million. We've invested $362 million in acquisitions. We have another $52 million -- $50 million, $52 million under contract to close this year. We hope to find a couple other deals. In addition, we'll do a little over $100 million in our bridge loan program. We did the net lease deal, which has no capital outplay, but a good return. So while we haven't been able to purchase a lot in the market by having our good relationships, buying things from our JV partners or management plus finding creative deals, we've been able to have, what I think is, a good year on the growth front."

So some of those rates are lower. And then I think our highest rates so far has been LIBOR plus 440. So plus or minus LIBOR plus 400. The return to us depends on whether we use our debt partner to take the A piece, if you will, in which case we can be up to LIBOR plus 800, 900 on our piece.
And I think the last question was how much will -- we will do that. I think that's meant to be seen. The type of volume we're talking about right now is very comfortable for us given our different avenues of capital.

And what is really gratifying to me is, as I look back, is how the year has played out as we expected. We went into this year knowing we would face headwinds from new supply and that we would have to be nimble and creative to address the challenges in those particular markets. We went into the year knowing that traditional acquisitions would be difficult due to capital flows into the sector and we would have to be innovative to create accretive growth opportunities, and I think we've done that. And we went into the year knowing that expecting to have continued growth in our third-party management business and as we just talked about we've had a great year in that front.
The 2 surprises we've had this year is the higher marketing expenses. And we've had to deal with that and maintain performance in spite of those increased costs. And the second surprise has been the moderation in revenue growth has taken longer to occur. And that's benefited us and allowed us to increase our guidance. So looking back over the 10 months, I'm very happy and proud that our systems and teams has handled environment that the machine has worked, and we've been able to put up the performance that we have so far, and we expect to for the remainder of the year.

Thank you for joining us for our third quarter call and for your interest in Extra Space Storage. We completed another busy and competitive leasing season. The sector headlines coming out of the summer are the same themes we have been hearing for much of the year. Many markets are feeling the headwind of new supply, and digital advertising is as expensive as we have ever seen it.
External growth through traditional acquisitions is challenging due to capital flows into the sector. We also continue to see pressure on multiple expense line items, including property taxes. And despite these headwinds, we had another solid quarter allowing us to increase our annual guidance.
As expected, we have started to experience the increased moderation in the second half of the year, which was projected in our guidance. However, our diversified portfolio, sophisticated platform and strong operations team continued to be resilient.
We continued our pricing power with in-place customers and have maintained very strong occupancies at our properties. We also continue to actively explore external growth opportunities that present attractive risk-adjusted returns. In addition to our acquisitions, we added 5 new stores to the platform in New York City through a previously announced net lease transaction with W.P. Carey. We also closed several bridge loans and expect to complete over $100 million in total originations in our first year with approximately $45 million of the balances held by Extra Space.
Yesterday, we closed $150 million preferred equity investment with SmartStop with an additional $50 million committed for investment in the next 12 months. The investment has a dividend of 6.25%, which begins to escalate after year 5. This investment is senior to a significant amount of common equity and strengthens our ongoing relationship with SmartStop.
Our third-party management platform continues to see exceptional growth. In the quarter, we added 42 managed stores, bringing our year-to-date total to 136. Between our third-party program and our JV stores, we have 877 managed stores, with a strong remaining pipeline for Q4 and for 2020.
I would now like to turn the time over to Scott Stubbs, our CFO."

Our Core FFO for the quarter was $1.24 per share, meeting consensus but $0.01 below the high end of our guidance. This was due to delays in completion of several solar projects and the related tax credits, resulting in higher income tax expense. These tax credits will be recognized next year once these projects are completed.
Rental and tenant insurance revenue outperformed expectations. Revenue growth was primarily driven by achieved rate growth with lower discount usage also providing a benefit. Year-over-year occupancy bounced back in Q3 and was flat at quarter end. Like last year, same-store expenses were elevated due to increases in property tax and marketing expense.
We continue to be pleased with the quality of our balance sheet and our access to all types of capital. During the quarter, we accessed our ATM and achieved slightly over $100 million in equity at an average price of $119.30 per share. Year-to-date, we have issued just over $200 million on our ATM. These funds were used for acquisitions and to reduce the balances on our revolving lines.
During the quarter, we also exercised the accordion feature in our credit facility. This transaction provided several benefits: first, it reduced interest cost; second, it converted $500 million in secured debt to unsecured; and third, it extended the average term.
Subsequent to quarter end, we completed a $300 million 10-year private placement transaction at the rate of 3.47%, further enhancing our unencumbered property pool. Due to our property outperformance year-to-date, we have raised our annual same-store guidance to 3% to 3.5%. We revised our expense guidance to an annual range of 4.5% to 5%.
These changes result in annual same-store NOI guidance of 2.25% to 3%, a 25 basis point increase at the midpoint. We are also raising our core FFO guidance to $4.84 to $4.87 per share. Our FFO guidance includes $0.07 of dilution from value-add acquisitions and an additional $0.16 of dilution from C of O stores for a total dilution of $0.23, which is unchanged from our initial guidance.
With that, let's turn it over to Norma to start our Q&A."

First to your last point, I think relative return always goes with relative risk. So yes, this is a 6.25% dividend payment, but it is ahead of hundreds of millions of dollars, significant amount of common equity. So the return may not be as good as doing a CO deal, but the risk is significantly less. And in this point in the market cycle, we are very focused on risk.
So my comments on the introduction about capital flows and difficulty finding deals really focuses on traditional marketed deals. Once the deal gets out to the market and broker has it, and there's many, many bidders, I think it's very difficult for us to be that high bidder and capture that deal. That being said, we've been very active on the acquisition side. Through the end of the third quarter, we purchased $362 million. We've invested $362 million in acquisitions. We have another $52 million -- $50 million, $52 million under contract to close this year. We hope to find a couple other deals. In addition, we'll do a little over $100 million in our bridge loan program. We did the net lease deal, which has no capital outplay, but a good return. So while we haven't been able to purchase a lot in the market by having our good relationships, buying things from our JV partners or management plus finding creative deals, we've been able to have, what I think is, a good year on the growth front."

We would underwrite stronger rent growth in Los Angeles than in Dallas, for example. So I can't give you -- we don't have a menu that we pick all of our assumptions off that's creating on a deal-by-deal basis based on the specific submarket opportunity. And we're lucky to have 1,800 stores and have a lot of data about what goes on in these markets. So we feel we can underwrite very accurately.
With respect to why do something in a joint venture versus wholly owned, joint ventures do a number of things for us. One is they spread risk, and if we have smaller dollar investment in a particular asset. Secondly, it enhances returns in a couple ways. One is we get all the tenant insurance on a smaller investment base than 100% owned. We get a management fee. In many of them, we get the opportunity to earn or promote down the road. So our return levels are higher in a joint venture."

But we've been putting that type of capital into our properties for a number of years now. And we think we have benefited in terms of performance from those capital investments.
And in terms of the management business, Public Storage is a good manager. They know how to run properties. CubeSmart is a good manager. They know how to run properties. We have good competitors on that side. We don't get every piece of business, but we hold our pricing which is more expensive than our competitors because we want to remain a profitable business and we've been able to keep growing this business. We've added 136 stores gross through the end of the third quarter. We've lost 43 stores, but 25 of those 43, we purchased store or became net leases, so they just shifted on the platform. So 3 quarters, we've added 93 stores. And our pipeline looks very similar going forward.

We went into this year knowing we would face headwinds from new supply and that we would have to be nimble and creative to address the challenges in those particular markets. We went into the year knowing that traditional acquisitions would be difficult due to capital flows into the sector and we would have to be innovative to create accretive growth opportunities, and I think we've done that. And we went into the year knowing that expecting to have continued growth in our third-party management business and as we just talked about we've had a great year in that front.
The 2 surprises we've had this year is the higher marketing expenses. And we've had to deal with that and maintain performance in spite of those increased costs. And the second surprise has been the moderation in revenue growth has taken longer to occur. And that's benefited us and allowed us to increase our guidance.
