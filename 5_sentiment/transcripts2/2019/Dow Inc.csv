Thank you for joining us to discuss the financial results for the Material Science Division within Dow DuPont. We're making this call available via webcast, and we have prepared slides to supplement our comments during this call. They are posted on the Investor Relations section of Dow's website and through the link to our webcast. 
Speaking on the call today are Jim Fitterling, Dow's Chief Executive Officer; and Howard Ungerleider, President and Chief Financial Officer. 
Please read the forward-looking statement disclaimers contained in the earnings news release and slides. During our call, we will meet forward-looking statements regarding our expectations or predictions about the future. Because these statements are based on current assumptions and factors that involve risks and uncertainties, our actual performance and results may differ materially from our forward-looking statements. 
Dow's Form 10 as well as our Form 10-K include detailed discussions of the principal risks and uncertainties, which may cause such differences. Unless otherwise specified, all historical financial measures presented today and all financials where applicable exclude significant items. 
We'll also refer to non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and other associated disclosures are contained in the Dow DuPont earnings release and on the Dow DuPont and Dow website. 
And as a reminder, because Dow operated as the Material Science Division of Dow DuPont through the end of the first quarter of 2019, the financial results shared during this call are based on the Material Science Division's financial performance as disclosed earlier today in Dow DuPont's earnings release series. 
On Slide 2, you'll see our agenda for the call. We will start with an overview of the first quarter performance of the Material Science Division of Dow DuPont. We will also discuss the results for each of our operating segments. Then we'll move into a financial overview of the quarter, which will also include some comments on modeling guidance. And finally, we will close with a discussion on our go-forward views. There will be plenty of time for your questions. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim."

I want to start by acknowledging the incredible accomplishments achieved by the Dow team to get us through our successful separation from Dow DuPont on April 1. I want to thank every member of team Do",930,"Thank you, Neal, and thanks, everyone, for joining us. I want to start by acknowledging the incredible accomplishments achieved by the Dow team to get us through our successful separation from Dow DuPont on April 1. I want to thank every member of team Dow for all they did over the past 3.5 years to execute one of the largest and most complex spin in the history of corporate America. We are now fully operating as a standalone independent Dow with a streamlined and focused business portfolio that is well positioned to operate more productively, invest more prudently, grow more profitably and deliver higher returns to shareholders. 
With that, let's them turn to our performance in the quarter on Slide 3. The Material Science Division of Dow DuPont recorded top and bottom line results in line with the updated guidance we provided a few weeks ago. During the quarter, the resilience of the Dow portfolio was on display as we were able to moderate the impact of year-over-year margin compression in siloxane, isocyanates and polyethylene products, which impacted our core business results and our equity earnings. 
We mitigated the headwinds in 3 ways: first, our continued demand growth in our differentiated applications was noteworthy, including silicones, polyurethane systems and packaging. This end market growth is an important highlight of the quarter as it reflects the ongoing strength we see from the consumer, and it speaks to our product and technology differentiation, customer relationships and value chain participation. This is not a new phenomenon for us as we have been growing in these applications for some time, and we continue to maintain our positive view of the fundamentals in this value chain. I will come back to this point later in the call.  
Second, we continued to drive our cost reduction actions. We delivered more than $125 million of incremental cost synergies in the quarter, taking our cumulative savings since merger closed [indiscernible] $1 billion, and we also removed the first $40 million of stranded costs in the quarter. We remain on track to deliver the incremental $600 million of savings this year. And third, we continued to benefit from our new U.S. Gulf Coast investments, which all ran high rates in the quarter and contributed approximately 500 million pounds of additional polyethylene volume versus the same quarter last year. 
Finally, during the quarter, we established the initial shareholder return targets for Dow. We confirmed an industry-leading annual dividend payout of $2.1 billion and announced a $3 billion open share repurchase program. Our commitment to shareholder returns was something we first outlined at our Investor Day in November last year, and it is a top priority of the Board and the Dow management team. 
Turning to our segment results. On Slide 4, Performance Materials & Coatings operating EBITDA was $481 million, down 18% from the year ago period, primarily driven by lower prices for siloxane and the shipping restrictions from a Performance Monomers facility in Deer Park, Texas due to a tank farm fire at a nearby third-party facility. Consumer solution sales were flat with the year ago period as gains in volume and local price were offset by currency headwind in EMEA and Asia Pacific. The business achieved broad-based local price and volume gains for silicones products. Those gains were offset by price declines in the siloxane. 
To put things in perspective, siloxane's prices within China in the first quarter were approximately 30% below the peak pricing of the third quarter of 2018. But as we look ahead, we are encouraged that siloxane's pricing stabilized as we completed the first quarter. 
Coatings & Performance Monomers sales were also down primarily due to the shedding of lower-margin business as well as weather-related events, which shifted seasonal demand in the construction industry in the U.S., Canada and EMEA. 
On Slide 5, industrial intermediates and infrastructure operating EBITDA was $448 million, down 31% from the year ago period, primarily to the margin compression in isocyanates and MEG, which impacted both our core business results and equity earnings. 
Polyurethanes and CIV delivered higher volume in all regions, but this was more than offset by lower isocyanates pricing. As I mentioned in my opening, our polyurethane systems growth was the highlight, expanding year-over-year about 2x global GDP. 
Industrial Solutions reported lower sales on reduced local price and currency headwinds. However, the business grew volume in EMEA, U.S. and Canada in industrial, oil and gas applications as well as on strong demand for [indiscernible] fluid, lubricants and fuels. 
On Slide 6, operating EBITDA for the packaging and specialty plastic segment was $993 million, down 24% from the year ago period. The key driver here was compression in integrated polyethylene margin. However, we were able to offset more than $100 million of this headwind through cost synergy savings, increased supply from growth projects and lower commissioning and startup costs. The packaging and specialty plastics business grew volume on higher demand in Asia Pacific and EMEA, supported by our new capacity add. From an end market perspective, our growth was led by Industrial & Consumer Packaging and flexible fanciful food and specialty packaging, 2 core sectors for our packaging franchise. 
And finally, the decline in Hydrocarbons & Energy sales was primarily due to 2 factors. The first was our increased ethylene integration from startups of our new derivative asset and the second was our tilt towards max ethane cracking in the U.S. Gulf Coast, which reduced coproduct sales in the quarter. 
I'll now turn it over to Howard to discuss our 
overall financial performance and our modeling guidance."

Turning to Slide 7. Sales declined 10% to $10.8 billion in line with our guidance. Volume grew 1% with demand growth in many of our core businesses, including polyurethanes, Industrial Solutions, Consumer Solutions and packaging and specialty plastics. These gains more than offset a decline in Coatings & Performance Monomers and a double-digit decline in Hydrocarbons & Energy. And as Jim mentioned, the hydrocarbons decline was primarily due to lower sales of coal products. Excluding the Hydrocarbons & Energy business, the Material Science Division grew volume year-over-year by approximately 3%. Local price was down 9%, largely driven by lower prices in isocyanates, siloxanes and polyethylene. Currency decreased sales 2% primarily driven by a stronger U.S. dollar against the euro. Operating EBITDA for the quarter was $1.9 billion, down 24% versus the year ago period and also in line with our guidance. The key driver of the decline was margin compression in polyethylene as well as isocyanates and siloxanes, and these factors, along with lower MEG prices, also drove our equity earnings decline. But importantly, we were able to offset a portion of this with cost synergies, contributions from new capacity ads and growth in the more differentiated portions of our portfolio. 
Now while Dow is not a standalone company in the first quarter, we were able to estimate our cash flow metrics on a new Dow basis. Free cash flow in the quarter was approximately $600 million or $200 million lower than the prior year period, primarily driven by reduced earnings, partly offset by a capacity reservation payment from ME globally related to our Texas 9 cracker expansion, which will support [indiscernible] new facility [indiscernible], Texas. 
We also made further progress toward our targeted capital structure just after the quarter ended. We received the $2 billion deleveraging payment from Dow DuPont. And as we said we would, we used that cash to pay down a portion of Dow [indiscernible] term loan. That pay down was executed in early April, so you'll see it reflected in our second quarter financial statements. This brings the Dow Corning term loan balance to $2.5 billion. 
And finally, as Jim mentioned, we also put in place our initial shareholder return targets. In early April, Dow's Board of Directors declared a second quarter dividend of $0.70 per share, and we established a $3 billion open share repurchase program, a portion of which was designated under Rule 10b51, which involved a prearranged trading plan. 
Given our stock performance and spin, we have not yet repurchased any shares under the program. The the 10b51 is expected to expire in June. And from that point, we plan to be opportunistic with our share repurchases and will be disciplined with how we allocate our excess cash, taking into consideration all our priorities, including the dividend and deleveraging, to reach our targeted capital structure. 
As we said before, our target is to return approximately 65% of our operating net income to our owners across the economic cycle. Within that, the dividend is our top priority for returning cash and share repurchases at the flywheel. 
We're currently targeting share repurchases of approximately $500 million for the remainder of the year. This is our base case target and does not take into account any additional nonoperational cash inflows. 
Let's now take a closer look at the contributions from our joint ventures on Slide 8. During our Investor Day last year, we made a commitment to provide more transparency on our JV results. And today, we're providing those details. This slide gives you more granularity on the performance of what we call our principal JVs, our 3 most meaningful joint ventures, which account for the vast majority of Dow's equity earnings. 
Including all JVs, equity losses for the quarter were $10 million compared to equity earnings of $208 million in the year ago period. The reduction was primarily driven by margin compression in MEG at Kuwait joint venture and isocyanates at the Sadara joint venture. And as is typical in the first quarter, we also received annual dividends from many of our JVs, which totaled more than [ $750 ] million of cash inflow in the quarter. 
Now before I turn to our modeling guidance, I would like to review some of the reporting changes that we're making now that we've completed our spin. This was another commitment we made, and we are moving quickly to the new reporting. 
Slide 9 provides an initial look at the details to help you reconcile these changes and how they'll impact our historical results. There are 3 key changes that will impact our financial reporting and the way we discuss our results. First, as of our next quarterly report, we will switch to EBIT as our primary profit metric to reinforce the message that capital is not free, but we will still provide all the details for EBITDA as well for those of you who want to conveniently track it. And as we shift to EBIT as our primary metric, we will also include the impact of foreign exchange in our definition of EBIT, which is how Dow historically defined our profit metric before the Dow DuPont merger. 
Second, we will transition to full market-based transfer pricing. This change will have an impact on the profit across our operating segment but will be net neutral to total EBIT at the enterprise level. 
And third, we will also incorporate the impact of the new contracts and service agreements we will have with DuPont and Corteva. We plan to file a voluntary 8-K later this quarter by mid-June, which will provide you with quarterly recap of our operating segment results incorporating these changes. Until then, you see on Slide 9 the estimates of what to expect for a few historical periods so that you can begin to incorporate these impacts into your models. While there are quite a few changes that we're putting in place, the net the impact to historical EBITDA and EBIT is relatively modest. 
Moving to modeling guidance on Slide 10. Given the current environment and the fact that we've just spun out as an independent company, we have provided our modeling guidance today on a sequential basis versus the first quarter of 2019. For those of you who prefer to look at the year-over-year comparison, you'll find a similar slide with that view in the appendix of today's debt. 
On a sequential basis, we see overall demand remaining healthy in consumer and packaging end markets, which will continue benefit businesses like our silicones, polyurethane systems and plastics businesses. 
We're also now seeing margin stabilized, and in a few areas such as polyethylene, NDI and siloxanes, we're seeing the early signs of price increases starting with Asia Pacific. It's too early to tell how much fraction we'll see in the second quarter, but these developing trends are a positive indicator for the second half of the year. 
We're also entering the typical seasonal high period for our turnaround of activity, which will be a headwind sequentially. We expect turnaround spending in the second quarter to be approximately $200 million higher than the first quarter or about even with our spending in the second quarter of last year. These are planned turnarounds that are scheduled in advance for crackers were on a roughly 8-year turnaround cycle and for derivative plans that's approximately every 3 to 5 years. 
We will also be impacted by a fire that occurred at a third-party storage facility near our Deer Park, Texas site, which is limiting our ability to shipment [indiscernible]. Our current assessment is that this limitation will continue through the second quarter and will result in approximately a $40 million impact sequentially. 
I'll now turn it back to Jim."
9830660,608199486,1717607,"Dow Inc., Q1 2019 Earnings Call, May 02, 2019",2019-05-02,"Earnings Calls","Dow Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Howard. Let's turn to Slide 11 and the outlook. Global economy is still expanding, albeit at a slower pace [ than ] 2018. We're seeing strength in the overall consumer confidence and spending supported by a strong labor market and wage growth. M",1196,"Thanks, Howard. 
Let's turn to Slide 11 and the outlook. Global economy is still expanding, albeit at a slower pace [ than ] 2018. We're seeing strength in the overall consumer confidence and spending supported by a strong labor market and wage growth. Manufacturing activity also continues to expand in support of this demand. 
But the trends are not synchronized globally. The U.S. remains a bright spot, while the EU and China are expanding at a more modest rate. And while personal consumption remains healthy, spending on big-ticket items, such as automobiles and home purchases and builds, remains tepid in some geographies. Additionally, ongoing trade negotiations remain front and center around much of the world. We think that a positive trade outcome could be a catalyst for increased economic activity. But that said, our plans as always are focused on what we can control. 
Looking more specifically at our portfolio, we see early signs of stabilization and improvement in our key fundamental indicators. After several months of inventory destocking in many of our value chain, we saw inventory levels settled in the mid-to-late first quarter on normal demand seasonality. While we still see prices down year-over-year in areas like MDI and siloxane, they have stabilized sequentially, and we see the opportunity to regain margin with price increases underway. We expect the MDI fundamentals to be balanced through 2021. And in siloxane, we expect overall operating rates to remain high in the near term as demand continues to outpace supply. 
The global ethylene market is relatively balanced on a regional basis today with some links in the U.S. Gulf Coast. We expect polyethylene demand to outstrip the recent ethylene supply additions starting in the second half of 2019. Our view of the cycle has been consistent for several years, short and shallow, and we see no reason to change that view. 
In feedstocks, the naphtha to ethane spread is widening again after the large contraction in the fourth quarter of 2018. In some areas like Europe, this may be a near term headwind to margins. But over the medium term, it should be constructive to our product spread. Also, the risk of an ethane price spike in 2019  has vastly reduced due to new NGL infrastructure capacity coming online coupled with delayed ethylene capacity ads as well as the turnaround fees in the second quarter. 
The result is a significant reduction in the market's forward view of ethane prices for the year. We still expect near-term ethane prices to be somewhat volatile as the industry works through the timing of new ethane demand versus supply. But fundamentally, we expect upward pricing pressure to be moderate and spikes, if any, to be short-lived. We a see realized example of this in the back half of 2018. And I think what surprised many people outside of our industry was how quickly these energy and feedstock markets changed, which is something that is often underestimated. And additionally, people underestimate how quickly Dow's access can shift. 
We have leading feedstock flexibility and commercial capability to adjust quickly to these markets, and we have full chain integration and a differentiated portfolio to further mitigate the impact of the swing. 
With that point, as I mentioned before, our focus on increasing the consumer-driven bias of our portfolio is paying off, particularly in consumer care, packaging and infrastructure sectors. There are a few examples on Slide 12. 
In our silicones franchise, we have prioritized the growing use of our siloxane toward on our performance, silicones business, where we can convert that siloxane into differentiated silicones that provide our customers with tremendous value and use. And our efforts are delivering. Every quarter since we brought this franchise into our portfolio, we have driven silicones growth that has outpaced global GDP. And consequently, our teams are unlocking incremental capacity to continue to meet growing customer demand. So far this year, we've already completed 4 debottleneck projects, and we have more than a dozen still on deck with incremental expansions in every geography. 
Another example is in our polyurethanes business. The business has been able to partly dampen the impact of isocyanates margin compression with continued above GDP growth in systems application in furniture, bedding, white goods and other durable goods. As a result, our polyurethanes business has now achieved year-over-year demand growth for 23 consecutive quarters. 
And finally, in packaging and specialty plastics, we've been growing volume for several quarters on our strength in Industrial & Consumer Packaging and Flexible Food & Specialty Packaging. These are parts of the value chain where we are the proven market leader. And while our global asset base, our new capacity and expertise in local markets have enabled us to place [indiscernible] efficiently in the market and deliver them with the highest value application. 
The common thread across these examples is their connection to the consumer and everyday life. And for us, this is another indicator that consumer spending remains healthy, and that benefits the Dow portfolio. 
I'll close with a quick recap on our near-term priorities on Slide 13. These are the same priorities that we've shared with you over the past several months, and I'm proud of the progress that we're making against each. But there is still work to do. While we see the early signs of improvement in our value chain, it is still early days. That's why our focus remains on being very disciplined with where we allocate our capital and our resources. 
Nothing has changed in our mindset of preferentially driving lower risk, faster payback projects while keeping our CapEx well within D&A levels. 
We made substantial progress against our cost synergy capture and stranded costs removal target, but they still have work to do. Our focus on a lean cost structure is still very much in place, and we will deliver the $600 million of incremental savings this year. And as you've seen over the past few months and today, we're committed to a best owner mindset and an enhanced level of disclosure. 
To wrap up, first, I cannot be proud of our team for working through all the complexities of our successful separation from Dow Dupont. Team Dow embraces challenge and took it head on. Second, the resilience of our portfolio showed through in the quarter, notably in our consumer-driven businesses where we can take advantage of our innovation and differentiation. And third, we believe that the fundamentals in our key value chains are beginning to stabilize. And as we look through the second quarter, we see early signs of inflection points that could materialize in the middle of the year. 
Going forward, our capital allocation and discipline focus on higher return on invested capital, incremental investment while keeping CapEx at or below D&A levels is the right approach in this environment. And the Dow team remains focused on the actions within our control, capturing cost synergy savings and removing stranded costs, growing our differentiated positions, running our assets efficiently and continuing to be disciplined resource and capital allocators to drive value growth within each of our businesses and across the company. 
Now I'll turn it to Neal to open the Q&A."

I would say I think what's happening, there have been many reports out there about the value creation in petrochemicals. It's been one of the sectors over the last decade, 14, 15 years it's created some high value. So I think people are interested in that. There are very different driving forces for everybody. Our driving force for our strategy is to grow with those consumer-driven differentiated markets. And so we'll be focused on developing products like performance silicones, better packaging products, polyurethane systems. Our industrial solutions will go downstream, working on coatings. Both our architectural and industrial coatings portfolios, our thesis portfolios to continue to grow that business. 
And then, of course, we'll look at the back integration is that a better make versus buy decision, where is the best place for us to be, is it U.S. Gulf Coast where you've got this tremendous NGL advantage and ethane advantage and where we can tie into the flexibility that we have and benefit from that. And that's a different driving force obviously than someone who's looking at maybe a future market that speak oil and looking at the where are they going to do with different barrels of oil. 
There are different chemistries out there. There's a lot of things going on. There's different strategies, partnerships around the world. So you might think the oil and do partnerships. You might make acquisitions. But in most cases today, the industry has shifted to cracking lighter. And so if you're going to make acquisitions to think that you're going to convert oil to petrochemicals, in most cases, you would be making acquisitions that are today probably NGL cracking. 
So I think there are a lot of things that have to pay out. I feel good about our investments and our position. We took advantage of the first wave of shale. We were up first. We got our projects done on time. We got them done under budget, and they're going to be the most efficient capital projects in that cycle."

And really, the only thing that we called out is the specific headwinds from the turnaround costs. The core earnings I expect to be up. So performance material and coatings, I think, we're going to see sales moving up. Siloxane's pricings have stabilized and started to move up. So that's going to help. Silicones pricing has held up well, and the issue there is just getting more capacity online to support that. So we had 4 debottlenecks in the quarter that came online, and we've got 12 new incremental projects for downstream silicones coming online through the year. 
In industrial intermediates, the big drag on industrial intermediates was really equity earnings, and it was ethylene glycol from the Kuwait joint venture. The core business is growing there. Now we've announced some our [indiscernible] capacity. That won't come on in second quarter. That's a longer-term bet. But they're going to be up 3% to 5% in sales. And packaging, especially plastics, is going to be up 3% to 5% in sales, and it's going to benefit from, obviously, the pricing that we're seeing coming through in April. A good start [indiscernible] with that and build that momentum. And then also the better cost position we see on ethane. 2 fracs came up in the quarter, and so they'll come up ahead of the ethylene capacity, and that's really what's put that ethane future's curve down. So I believe you're going to see the core earnings move up sequentially, Vincent. And we just called out the turnaround so make sure everybody understood that the magnitude of that cost will be in the second quarter."

I expect MDI is going to continue to tighten through the year. I think you've got 2 things happening. The consumer-driven side of the business, so our systems business, where you had end markets like furniture, bedding, some level of white goods, durable goods, that business, some cold storage, cold chain business, has been relatively good. Where we see obviously you some things have been a little bit slower are housing starts and housing sales. So that's kind of slowed. And so you've got also automotive, and automotive is a lot of content for polyurethanes. So some of the big-ticket items are also big demand pull items in that chain. So I'd say the consumer strength is really showing up in the numbers, 2x GDP for the systems growth, and that's without the big-ticket items pulling. So as we get through the year, I think you're going to start to see automotive pick up. 
I would say in Europe right now, automotive is weak, and there's probably the biggest inventory of finished autos out on the lot and at the dealers that has to be worked through. So I'd say Europe sentiment right now is it's going to take a little bit longer to work that through. 
The U.S. is relatively okay. I'd say North America is relatively okay. 
And China is relatively okay. 
So I think as the year progresses, we're going to see those bigger-ticket items pull through a little bit more. 
On TDI, as we said before, I think TDI is going to be long for most of the year. So we're not putting into our outlook any big increases in TDI prices or margins. Mostly the improvement will be on MDI."

Now what we've seen through the quarter is obviously the inventory levels have started to improve in China. The demand pull, as you mentioned, hasn't yet kicked in. This is one of the areas in the China trade agreement. If you know, textiles had some tariffs coming back into the United States. That really put the brakes on some of the exports out of China, and that kind of backed up some of that capacity. So as we get this trade agreement through and we see what happens, if that gives a little bit more confidence to the textiles industry in China to be able to move some material in here, then that would be immediately visible in the marketplace, and that might give us some momentum on ethylene glycol pricing. The PET side of the equation is continued to be strong. So we really need the polyester side to pick up to see that pricing move. 
And I would also say that typically, when we pull out of one of these compression periods, PE and ethylene glycol is what you start to see [indiscernible] PE turn here in the month of April.

Thailand was always on Asia growth play and continues to be that. And where we have strategic interests together, we'll look at that.

In total, our sales volumes were up double digits year-over-year, so we continue to grow there, and it's across the board. It's all the businesses polyurethane, packaging, Consumer Solutions, obviously. 
We don't have as much coatings exposure in China. We don't have too many facilities for coatings over there. And we don't have as much Industrial Solutions exposure. Most of that is exports out of Gulf Coast and out of Sadara. But I still feel good about the demand growth, and it continues to look good. 
I think the operating rates are probably been held down because of the cost curve and because of where somethings are on the cost curve. There's just a big advantage in the U.S. Gulf Coast on the NGLs, and that's probably what's held them down. 
I think most of the environmental things are related to the incidents that have happened. And so you have a couple of explosions and fires that typically always cause another relook at the industry and who's a credible operator and can operate safely and also who can operate at scale and return. 
I think the biggest challenge has been the pricing compression that we saw in the fourth quarter. And so as we see in margins recover, you may start to see people take a look in China again at whether they can have a good investment there and long term make some money there. But it's the feedstock challenge. That's the toughest part of that. It's hard to find a good competitive feedstock there. And I think that's why you see most of the oil majors looking, and it's mostly refinery integration discussion that you see happening. You see some ethane discussion, but that requires a lot of CapEx to build ships to take ethane out of the U.S. Gulf Coast. There's really not anywhere else in the world that you can get the ethane export. And if you start to drive that price up too high, then you're going to be looking back at naphtha as an alternative."

On the ethylene side, you're right. Because there hasn't been as much derivative capacity, that ethylene has been backed up. And once you see in the [indiscernible] people are adjusting ethylene plant operating rates really to the derivative downstream operating rates. And derivatives are continuing to run hard in the U.S. Gulf Coast. So that's why we announced things like our isocyanates is capacity expansions down in the Gulf Coast to convert more of that material. That's a high return to Abilene. I think by 2020, you're going to see that derivative demand is going to start the pull that access ethylene that's out there. You're also got a little bit of research and right now can they not too many places that you can shape ethylene out, and one of them just have a large fire. And so that's cause a little bit more constraints. And so you've seen a lot of that margin in the short term disappear out of the ethylene part of the chain. But PE is holding up good, so I think if you think where we are in the cycle here and why we still say short and shallow is because PE margins are relatively strong and we're seeing pricing coming back in April and polyethylene, so I think that's a good trend."

Speaking on the call today are Jim Fitterling, Dow's Chief Executive Officer; and Howard Ungerleider, President and Chief Financial Officer. 
Please read the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the earnings news release and slides. During our call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding our expectations or predictions about the future. Because these statements are based on current assumptions and factors that involve risks and uncertainties, our actual performance and results may differ materially from our forward-looking statements. 
Dow's Form 10 as well as our Form 10-K include detailed discussions of the principal risks and uncertainties, which may cause such differences. Unless otherwise specified, all historical financial measures presented today and all financials, where applicable, exclude significant items. 
We'll also refer to non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and other associated disclosures are contained in the DowDuPont earnings release and on the DowDuPont and Dow websites. 
And as a reminder, because Dow operated as the Materials Science Division of DowDuPont through the end of the first quarter of 2019, the financial results shared during this call are based on the Materials Science Division's financial performance as disclosed earlier today in DowDuPont's earnings release. 
On Slide 2, you'll see our agenda for the call. We will start with an overview of the first quarter performance of the Materials Science Division of DowDuPont. We will also discuss the results for each of our operating segments. Then we'll move into a financial overview of the quarter, which will also include some comments on modeling guidance. And finally, we will close with a discussion on our go-forward views. There will be plenty of time for your questions. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim."

I want to start by acknowledging the incredible accomplishments achieved by the Dow team to get us through our successful separation from DowDuPont on April 1. I want to thank every member of team Dow",926,"Thank you, Neal, and thanks, everyone, for joining us. I want to start by acknowledging the incredible accomplishments achieved by the Dow team to get us through our successful separation from DowDuPont on April 1. I want to thank every member of team Dow for all they did over the past 3.5 years to execute one of the largest and most complex spins in the history of corporate America. We are now fully operating as a stand-alone independent Dow with a streamlined and focused business portfolio that is well positioned to operate more productively, invest more prudently, grow more profitably and deliver higher returns to shareholders. 
With that, let's turn to our performance in the quarter on Slide 3. The Materials Science Division of DowDuPont reported top and bottom line results in line with the updated guidance we provided a few weeks ago. During the quarter, the resilience of the Dow portfolio was on display as we were able to moderate the impact of year-over-year margin compression in siloxanes, isocyanates and polyethylene products, which impacted our core business results and our equity earnings. 
We mitigated the headwinds in 3 ways: first, our continued demand growth in our differentiated applications was noteworthy, including silicones, polyurethane systems and packaging. This end market growth is an important highlight of the quarter as it reflects the ongoing strength we see from the consumer, and it speaks to our product and technology differentiation, customer relationships and value chain participation. This is not a new phenomenon for us as we have been growing in these applications for some time, and we continue to maintain our positive view of the fundamentals in these value chains. I will come back to this point later in the call.  
Second, we continued to drive our cost reduction actions. We delivered more than $125 million of incremental cost synergies in the quarter, taking our cumulative savings, since merger close, to nearly $1 billion. And we also removed the first $40 million of stranded costs in the quarter. We remain on track to deliver the incremental $600 million of savings this year. 
And third, we continued to benefit from our new U.S. Gulf Coast investments, which all ran at high rates in the quarter and contributed approximately 500 million pounds of additional polyethylene volume versus the same quarter last year. 
Finally, during the quarter, we established the initial shareholder return targets for Dow. We confirmed an industry-leading annual dividend payout of $2.1 billion and announced a $3 billion open share repurchase program. Our commitment to shareholder returns was something we first outlined at our Investor Day in November last year, and it is a top priority of the Board and the Dow management team. 
Turning to our segment results. On Slide 4, Performance Materials & Coatings operating EBITDA was $481 million, down 18% from the year ago period, primarily driven by lower prices for siloxanes and shipping restrictions from our Performance Monomers facility in Deer Park, Texas due to a tank farm fire at a nearby third-party facility. Consumer Solutions sales were flat with the year ago period as gains in volume and local price were offset by currency headwinds in EMEA and Asia Pacific. The business achieved broad-based local price and volume gains for silicones products. Those gains were offset by price declines in siloxanes. 
To put things in perspective, siloxanes' prices in China in the first quarter were approximately 30% below the peak pricing of the third quarter of 2018. But as we look ahead, we are encouraged that siloxanes pricing stabilized as we completed the first quarter. 
Coatings & Performance Monomers sales were also down primarily due to the shedding of lower-margin business as well as weather-related events, which shifted seasonal demand in the construction industry in the U.S., Canada and EMEA. 
On Slide 5, Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure operating EBITDA was $448 million, down 31% from the year ago period, primarily due to margin compression in isocyanates and MEG, which impacted both our core business results and equity earnings. 
Polyurethanes & CAV delivered higher volume in all regions, but this was more than offset by lower isocyanates pricing. As I mentioned in my opening, our polyurethane systems growth was the highlight, expanding year-over-year about 2x global GDP. 
Industrial Solutions reported lower sales on reduced local price and currency headwinds. However, the business grew volume in EMEA, U.S. and Canada in industrial, oil and gas applications as well as on strong demand for deicing fluids, lubricants and fuels. 
On Slide 6, operating EBITDA for the Packaging & Specialty Plastics segment was $993 million, down 24% from the year ago period. The key driver here was compression in integrated polyethylene margin. However, we were able to offset more than $100 million of this headwind through cost synergy savings, increased supply from growth projects and lower commissioning and startup costs. The Packaging & Specialty Plastics business grew volume on higher demand in Asia Pacific and EMEA, supported by our new capacity add. From an end market perspective, our growth was led by Industrial & Consumer Packaging and Flexible Food & Specialty Packaging, 2 core sectors for our packaging franchise. 
And finally, the decline in Hydrocarbons & Energy sales was primarily due to 2 factors: the first was our increased ethylene integration from startups of our new derivative asset; and the second was our tilt towards max ethane cracking in the U.S. Gulf Coast, which reduced coproduct sales in the quarter. 
I'll now turn it over to Howard to discuss our 
overall financial performance and our modeling guidance."

Turning to Slide 7. Sales declined 10% to $10.8 billion, in line with our guidance. Volume grew 1% with demand growth in many of our core businesses, including polyurethanes, Industrial Solutions, Consumer Solutions and Packaging & Specialty Plastics. These gains more than offset a decline in Coatings & Performance Monomers and a double-digit decline in Hydrocarbons & Energy. And as Jim mentioned, the hydrocarbons decline was primarily due to lower sales of coproducts. Excluding the Hydrocarbons & Energy business, the Materials Science Division grew volume year-over-year by approximately 3%. Local price was down 9%, largely driven by lower prices in isocyanates, siloxanes and polyethylene. Currency decreased sales 2% primarily driven by a stronger U.S. dollar against the euro. Operating EBITDA for the quarter was $1.9 billion, down 24% versus the year ago period and also in line with our guidance. The key driver of the decline was margin compression in polyethylene as well as isocyanates and siloxanes. And these factors, along with lower MEG prices, also drove our equity earnings decline. But importantly, we were able to offset a portion of this with cost synergies, contributions from new capacity adds and growth in the more differentiated portions of our portfolio. 
Now while Dow is not a stand-alone company in the first quarter, we were able to estimate our cash flow metrics on a new Dow basis. Free cash flow in the quarter was approximately $600 million or $200 million lower than the prior year period, primarily driven by reduced earnings, partly offset by a capacity reservation payment from MEGlobal related to our Texas-9 cracker expansion, which will support MEGlobal's new facility Freeport, Texas. 
We also made further progress toward our targeted capital structure just after the quarter ended. We received the $2 billion deleveraging payment from DowDuPont. And as we said we would, we used that cash to pay down a portion of the Dow Corning term loan. That pay down was executed in early April, so you'll see it reflected in our second quarter financial statements. This brings the Dow Corning term loan balance to $2.5 billion. 
And finally, as Jim mentioned, we also put in place our initial shareholder return targets. In early April, Dow's Board of Directors declared a second quarter dividend of $0.70 per share. And we established a $3 billion open share repurchase program, a portion of which was designated under Rule 10b5-1, which involved a prearranged trading plan. 
Given our stock performance and spin, we have not yet repurchased any shares under the program. The the 10b5-1 is expected to expire in June. And from that point, we plan to be opportunistic with our share repurchases and will be disciplined with how we allocate our excess cash, taking into consideration all our priorities, including the dividend and deleveraging, to reach our targeted capital structure. 
As we said before, our target is to return approximately 65% of our operating net income to our owners across the economic cycle. Within that, the dividend is our top priority for returning cash and share repurchases are the flywheel. 
We're currently targeting share repurchases of approximately $500 million for the remainder of the year. This is our base case target and does not take into account any additional nonoperational cash inflows. 
Let's now take a closer look at the contributions from our joint ventures on Slide 8. During our Investor Day last year, we made a commitment to provide more transparency on our JV results. And today, we're providing those details. This slide gives you more granularity on the performance of what we call our principal JVs, our 3 most meaningful joint ventures, which account for the vast majority of Dow's equity earnings. 
Including all JVs, equity losses for the quarter were $10 million compared to equity earnings of $208 million in the year ago period. The reduction was primarily driven by margin compression in MEG at the Kuwait joint ventures and isocyanates at the Sadara joint venture. And as is typical in the first quarter, we also received annual dividends from many of our JVs, which totaled more than $750 million of cash inflow in the quarter. 
Now before I turn to our modeling guidance, I would like to review some of the reporting changes that we're making now that we've completed our spin. This was another commitment we made, and we are moving quickly to the new reporting. 
Slide 9 provides an initial look at the details to help you reconcile these changes and how they'll impact our historical results. There are 3 key changes that will impact our financial reporting and the way we discuss our results. First, as of our next quarterly report, we will switch to EBIT as our primary profit metric to reinforce the message that capital is not free. But we will still provide all the details for EBITDA as well for those of you who want to continue to track it. And as we shift to EBIT as our primary metric, we will also include the impact of foreign exchange in our definition of EBIT, which is how Dow historically defined our profit metric before the DowDuPont merger. 
Second, we will transition to full market-based transfer pricing. This change will have an impact on the profit across our operating segment, but it will be net neutral to total EBIT at the enterprise level. 
And third, we will also incorporate the impact of the new contracts and service agreements we will have with DuPont and Corteva. We plan to file a voluntary 8-K later this quarter by mid-June, which will provide you with quarterly recaps of our operating segment results incorporating these changes. Until then, you see on Slide 9 the estimates of what to expect for a few historical periods so that you can begin to incorporate these impacts into your models. While there are quite a few changes that we're putting in place, the net impact at historical EBITDA and EBIT is relatively modest. 
Moving to modeling guidance on Slide 10. Given the current environment and the fact that we've just spun out as an independent company, we have provided our modeling guidance today on a sequential basis versus the first quarter of 2019. For those of you who prefer to look at the year-over-year comparison, you'll find a similar slide with that view in the appendix of today's deck. 
On a sequential basis, we see overall demand remaining healthy in consumer and packaging end markets, which will continue to benefit businesses like our silicones, polyurethane systems and plastics businesses. 
We're also now seeing margins stabilize. And in a few areas such as polyethylene, [ NDI ] and siloxanes, we're seeing the early signs of price increases starting with Asia Pacific. It's too early to tell how much traction we'll see in the second quarter, but these developing trends are a positive indicator for the second half of the year. 
We're also entering the typical seasonal high period for our turnaround activity, which will be a headwind sequentially. We expect our turnaround spending in the second quarter to be approximately $200 million higher than the first quarter or about even with our spending in the second quarter of last year. These are planned turnarounds that are scheduled in advance for crackers who are on a roughly 8-year turnaround cycle and for derivative plants that's approximately every 3 to 5 years. 
We will also be impacted by a fire that occurred at a third-party storage facility near our Deer Park, Texas site, which is limiting our ability to ship material. Our current assessment is that this limitation will continue through the second quarter and will result in approximately a $40 million impact sequentially. 
I'll now turn it back to Jim."

We're seeing strength in the overall consumer confidence and spending supported by a strong labor market and wage growth. Manufacturing activity also continues to expand in support of this demand. 
But the trends are not synchronized globally. The U.S. remains a bright spot, while the EU and China are expanding at a more modest rate. And while personal consumption remains healthy, spending on big-ticket items, such as automobiles and home purchases and builds, remains tepid in some geographies. Additionally, ongoing trade negotiations remain front and center around much of the world. We think that a positive trade outcome could be a catalyst for increased economic activity. But that said, our plans as always are focused on what we can control. 
Looking more specifically at our portfolio, we see early signs of stabilization and improvement in our key fundamental indicators. After several months of inventory destocking in many of our value chain, we saw inventory levels settled in the mid-to-late first quarter on normal demand seasonality. While we still see prices down year-over-year in areas like MDI and siloxanes, they have stabilized sequentially, and we see the opportunity to regain margin with price increases underway. We expect MDI fundamentals to be balanced through 2021. And in siloxanes, we expect overall operating rates to remain high in the near term as demand continues to outpace supply. 
The global ethylene market is relatively balanced on a regional basis today with some links in the U.S. Gulf Coast. We expect polyethylene demand to outstrip the recent ethylene supply additions starting in the second half of 2019. Our view of the cycle has been consistent for several years, short and shallow, and we see no reason to change that view. 
In feedstocks, the naphtha-to-ethane spread is widening again after the large contraction in the fourth quarter of 2018. In some areas like Europe, this may be a near term headwind to margins. But over the medium term, it should be constructive to our product spreads. Also, the risk of an ethane price spike in 2019  has vastly reduced due to new NGL infrastructure capacity coming online, coupled with delayed ethylene capacity adds as well as the turnaround season in the second quarter. 
The result is a significant reduction in the market's forward view of ethane prices for the year. We still expect near-term ethane prices to be somewhat volatile as the industry works through the timing of new ethane demand versus supply. But fundamentally, we expect upward pricing pressure to be moderate and spikes, if any, to be short-lived. We saw a realized example of this in the back half of 2018. And I think what surprised many people outside of our industry was how quickly these energy and feedstock markets changed, which is something that is often underestimated. And additionally, people underestimate how quickly Dow's assets can shift. 
We have leading feedstock flexibility and commercial capability to adjust quickly to these markets, and we have full chain integration and a differentiated portfolio to further mitigate the impact of the swings. 
To that point, as I mentioned before, our focus on increasing the consumer-driven bias of our portfolio is paying off, particularly in consumer care, packaging and infrastructure sectors. There are a few examples on Slide 12. 
In our silicones franchise, we have prioritized the growing use of our siloxanes toward our performance silicones business, where we can convert that siloxane into differentiated silicones that provide our customers with tremendous value and use. And our efforts are delivering. Every quarter since we brought this franchise into our portfolio, we have driven silicones growth that has outpaced global GDP. And consequently, our teams are unlocking incremental capacity to continue to meet growing customer demand. So far this year, we have already completed 4 debottleneck projects, and we have more than a dozen still on deck with incremental expansions in every geography. 
Another example is in our polyurethanes business. The business has been able to partly dampen the impact of isocyanates margin compressions with continued above GDP growth in systems applications in furniture, bedding, white goods and other durable goods. As a result, our polyurethanes business has now achieved year-over-year demand growth for 23 consecutive quarters. 
And finally, in Packaging & Specialty Plastics, we've been growing volume for several quarters on our strength in Industrial & Consumer Packaging and Flexible Food & Specialty Packaging. These are parts of the value chain where we are the proven market leader. And for our global asset base, our new capacity and expertise in local markets have enabled us to place new pounds efficiently in the market and deliver them with the highest value application. 
The common thread across these examples is their connection to the consumer and everyday life. And for us, this is another indicator that consumer spending remains healthy. And that benefits the Dow portfolio. 
I'll close with a quick recap on our near-term priorities on Slide 13. These are the same priorities that we've shared with you over the past several months, and I'm proud of the progress that we're making against each. But there is still work to do. While we see the early signs of improvement in our value chain, it is still early days. That's why our focus remains on being very disciplined with where we allocate our capital and our resources. 
Nothing has changed in our mindset of preferentially driving lower risk, faster payback projects while keeping our CapEx well within D&A levels. 
We've made substantial progress against our cost synergy capture and stranded cost removal targets, but we still have work to do. Our focus on a lean cost structure is still very much in place, and we will deliver the $600 million of incremental savings this year. And as you've seen over the past few months and today, we're committed to a best owner mindset and an enhanced level of disclosure. 
To wrap up, first, I could not be prouder of our team for working through all the complexities of our successful separation from DowDupont. Team Dow embraces challenge and took it head on. Second, the resilience of our portfolio showed through in the quarter, notably in our consumer-driven businesses where we can take advantage of our innovation and differentiation. And third, we believe that the fundamentals in our key value chains are beginning to stabilize. And as we look through the second quarter, we see early signs of inflection points that could materialize in the middle of the year. 
Going forward, our capital allocation and disciplined focus on higher return on invested capital, incremental investments, while keeping CapEx at or below D&A levels, is the right approach in this environment. And the Dow team remains focused on the actions within our control, capturing cost synergy savings and removing stranded costs, growing our differentiated positions, running our assets efficiently and continuing to be disciplined resource and capital allocators to drive value growth within each of our businesses and across the company.

That's what we've guided in the forecast. And then we just called out the turnaround expenses because, sequentially, they're higher. Our turnaround expenses are about the same as they were second quarter last year, but they are higher than first quarter, and that's just because of timing. As you know, some of these turnarounds, crackers are on 8-year cycles, and some of these derivative plants are on 3- to 5-year cycles. This is the time of year to take them. And I think in this market environment, we decided to do them in second quarter or not try to push anything out."

I would say I think what's happening, there've been many reports out there about the value creation in petrochemicals. It's been one of the sectors over the last decade, 14, 15 years that's created some high value. So I think people are interested in that. There are different driving forces for everybody. Our driving force for our strategy is to grow with those consumer-driven differentiated markets. And so we'll be focused on developing products like performance silicones, better packaging products, polyurethane systems. Our Industrial Solutions will go downstream, working on coatings. Both our architectural and industrial coatings portfolios, our adhesives portfolios to continue to grow that business. 
And then, of course, we'll look at the back integration. Is that a better make versus buy decision? Where is the best place for us to be? Is it U.S. Gulf Coast where you've got this tremendous NGL advantage and ethane advantage and where we can tie into the flexibility that we have and benefit from that. And that's a different driving force obviously than someone who's looking at maybe a future market that speak oil and looking at what are they going to do with different barrels of oil. 
There are different chemistries out there. There's a lot of things going on. There's different strategies, partnerships around the world. So you might take the oil and do partnerships. You might make acquisitions. But in most cases today, the industry has shifted to cracking lighter. And so if you're going to make acquisitions to think that you're going to convert oil to petrochemicals, in most cases, you would be making acquisitions that are today probably NGL cracking. 
So I think there are a lot of things that have to play out. I feel good about our investments and our position. We took advantage of the first wave of shale. We were up first. We got our projects done on time. We got them done under budget, and they're going to be the most efficient capital projects in that cycle."

And really, the only thing that we called out is the specific headwinds from the turnaround costs. The core earnings I expect to be up. So Performance Material & Coatings, I think, we're going to see sales moving up. Siloxanes pricings have stabilized and started to move up, so that's going to help. Silicones pricing has held up well, and the issue there is just getting more capacity online to support that. So we had 4 debottlenecks in the quarter that came online, and we've got 12 new incremental projects for downstream silicones coming online through the year. 
In industrial intermediates, the big drag on industrial intermediates was really equity earnings, and it was ethylene glycol from the Kuwait joint ventures. The core business is growing there. Now we've announced some alkoxylates capacity. That won't come on in second quarter. That's a longer-term bet, but they're going to be up 3% to 5% in sales. And Packaging & Specialty Plastics is going to be up 3% to 5% in sales, and it's going to benefit from, obviously, the pricing that we're seeing coming through in April. And good to start the quarter with that and build that momentum. And then also the better cost positions we've seen on ethane. 2 fracs came up in the quarter, and so they'll come up ahead of the ethylene capacity. And that's really what's put that ethane future's curve down. So I believe you're going to see the core earnings move up sequentially, Vincent. And we just called out the turnarounds to make sure everybody understood what the magnitude of that cost would be in the second quarter."

Some things had backed up at the end of fourth quarter '18, as you know, in the U.S. Gulf. And so we saw some of that stabilize through the quarter.

As soon as that 8-K gets published, then we can be in the market because -- with an open program as opposed to the 10b5. 
The 10b5 was set up based on the feedback that Dow's stock could trade with substantial churn in volatility immediately postspin. So we put the algorithm in place to take advantage of the opportunistic intrinsic value, and the Dow stock traded very well. And so as a result so far, that hasn't kicked in. But like I said, the 10b51 is there until we get the 8-K out. Once we get the 8-K out, we'll be in the open market.

I expect MDI is going to continue to tighten through the year. I think you've got 2 things happening. The consumer-driven side of the business, so our systems business, where you had end markets like furniture, bedding, some level of white goods, durable goods, that business, some cold storage, cold chain businesses, has been relatively good. Where we see obviously you some things have been a little bit slower are housing starts and housing sales. So that's kind of slowed. And so you've got also automotive, and automotive is a lot of content for polyurethanes. So some of the big-ticket items are also big-demand pull items in that chain. So I'd say the consumer strength is really showing up in the numbers, 2x GDP for the systems growth, and that's without the big-ticket items pulling. So as we get through the year, I think you're going to start to see automotive pick up. 
I would say in Europe right now, automotive is weak, and there's probably the biggest inventory of finished autos out on the lots and at the dealers that has to be worked through. So I'd say Europe sentiment right now is it's going to take a little bit longer to work that through. 
The U.S. is relatively okay. North -- I'd say North America is relatively okay.  And China's relatively okay.  So I think as the year progresses, we're going to see those bigger-ticket items pull through a little bit more. 
On TDI, as we said before, I think TDI is going to be long for most of the year. So we're not putting into our outlook any big increases in TDI prices or margins. Mostly the improvement will be on MDI."

And if you look at the year-over-year pricing, it's quite a bit down. Now what we've seen through the quarter is obviously the inventory levels have started to improve in China. The demand pull, as you mentioned, hasn't yet kicked in. This is one of the areas in the China trade agreement. If you know, textiles had some tariffs coming back into the United States. That really put the brakes on some of the exports out of China, and that kind of backed up some of that capacity. So as we get this trade agreement through and we see what happens, if that gives a little bit more confidence to the textiles industry in China to be able to move some material in here, then that would be immediately visible in the marketplace. So that might give us some momentum on ethylene glycol pricing. The PET side of the equation has continued to be strong. So we really need the polyester side to pick up to see that pricing move. 
And I would also say that typically, when we pull out of one of these compression periods, [ PE ] and ethylene glycol is what you start to see turn. We've seen [ PE ] turn here in the month of April. So I think we could probably see also some cost push on the ethylene side in China that may start to move things up a little bit."

It was a way to put together at the time when we did it, obviously, the world's largest ethylene glycol business together with the Kuwaiti. So MEGlobal is continuing to grow in that format and that structure, and that's been positive for us. And they've been also able to participate and continue that growth down in the U.S. Gulf Coast. So I think that's good. They clearly were already marketing ethylene glycol and carbide set that JV up obviously on its own to market the polyethylene so we don't do anything together there other than be an equity investor in polyethylene. 
Thailand was always an Asia growth play and continues to be that. And where we have strategic interests together, we'll look at that. And where we've got lines of business there that may be strategic to one of us and not the other, we'll look at options there. But both of those JVs are sustainable.

In total, our sales volumes were up double digits year-over-year, so we continue to grow there, and it's across the board. It's in all the businesses: polyurethanes, packaging, Consumer Solutions, obviously. 
We don't have as much coatings exposure in China. We don't have too many facilities for coatings over there, and we don't have as much Industrial Solutions exposure. Most of that is exports out of Gulf Coast and out of Sadara. But I still feel good about the demand growth, and it continues to look good. 
I think the operating rates are probably been held down because of the cost curve and because of where some things are on the cost curves. There's just a big advantage in the U.S. Gulf Coast on the NGLs, and that's probably what's held them down. 
I think most of the environmental things are related to the incidents that have happened. And so you've had a couple of explosions and fires that typically always cause another relook at the industry and who's a credible operator and can operate safely and also who can operate at scale and return. 
I think the biggest challenge has been the pricing compression that we saw in the fourth quarter. And so as we see those margins recover, you may start to see people take a look in China again at whether they can have a good investment there and, long term, make some money there. But it's the feedstock challenge. That's the toughest part of that. It's hard to find a good competitive feedstock there, and I think that's why you see most of the oil majors looking. And it's mostly refinery integration discussion that you see happening. You see some ethane discussion, but that requires a lot of CapEx to build ships to take ethane out of the U.S. Gulf Coast. There's really not anywhere else in the world that you can get ethane export. And if you start to drive that price up too high, then you're going to be looking back at naphtha as an alternative."

On the ethylene side, you're right. Because there hasn't been as much derivative capacity, that ethylene's been backed up. And what you see in the first quarter is people adjusting ethylene plant operating rates really to the derivative downstream operating rates. And derivatives are continuing to run hard in the U.S. Gulf Coast. So that's why we announced things like alkoxylates yield capacity expansions down in the Gulf Coast to convert more of that material. That's a high return to ethylene. I think by 2020, you're going to see that derivative demand's going to start to pull that excess ethylene that's out there. You also got a little bit of restrictions right now. There are not too many places that you can ship ethylene out, and one of them just had a large fire. And so that's caused us a little bit of more constraints. And so you've seen a lot of that margin in the short term disappear out of the ethylene part of the chain. But [ PE ] is holding up good, so I think if you think where we are in the cycle here and why we still say short and shallow is because [ PE ] margins are relatively strong.

Thank you for joining us to discuss the financial results for the Materials Science Division within DowDuPont. We're making this call available via webcast, and we have prepared slides to supplement our comments during this conference call. They are posted on the Investor Relations section of Dow's website and through the link to our webcast. 
Speaking on the call today are Jim Fitterling, Dow's Chief Executive Officer; and Howard Ungerleider, President and Chief Financial Officer. 
Please read the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the earnings news release and slides. During our call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding our expectations or predictions about the future. Because these statements are based on current assumptions and factors that involve risks and uncertainties, our actual performance and results may differ materially from our forward-looking statements. 
Dow's Form 10 as well as our Form 10-K include detailed discussions of the principal risks and uncertainties, which may cause such differences. Unless otherwise specified, all historical financial measures presented today and all financials, where applicable, exclude significant items. 
We'll also refer to non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and other associated disclosures are contained in the DowDuPont earnings release and on the DowDuPont and Dow websites. 
And as a reminder, because Dow operated as the Materials Science Division of DowDuPont through the end of the first quarter of 2019, the financial results shared during this call are based on the Materials Science Division's financial performance as disclosed earlier today in DowDuPont's earnings release. 
On Slide 2, you'll see our agenda for the call. We will start with an overview of the first quarter performance of the Materials Science Division of DowDuPont. We will also discuss the results for each of our operating segments. Then we'll move into a financial overview of the quarter, which will also include some comments on modeling guidance. And finally, we will close with a discussion on our go-forward views. There will be plenty of time for your questions. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim."

I want to start by acknowledging the incredible accomplishments achieved by the Dow team to get us through our successful separation from DowDuPont on April 1. I want to thank every member of team Dow",926,"Thank you, Neal, and thanks, everyone, for joining us. I want to start by acknowledging the incredible accomplishments achieved by the Dow team to get us through our successful separation from DowDuPont on April 1. I want to thank every member of team Dow for all they did over the past 3.5 years to execute one of the largest and most complex spins in the history of corporate America. We are now fully operating as a stand-alone independent Dow with a streamlined and focused business portfolio that is well positioned to operate more productively, invest more prudently, grow more profitably and deliver higher returns to shareholders. 
With that, let's turn to our performance in the quarter on Slide 3. The Materials Science Division of DowDuPont reported top and bottom line results in line with the updated guidance we provided a few weeks ago. During the quarter, the resilience of the Dow portfolio was on display as we were able to moderate the impact of year-over-year margin compression in siloxanes, isocyanates and polyethylene products, which impacted our core business results and our equity earnings. 
We mitigated the headwinds in 3 ways: first, our continued demand growth in our differentiated applications was noteworthy, including silicones, polyurethane systems and packaging. This end market growth is an important highlight of the quarter as it reflects the ongoing strength we see from the consumer, and it speaks to our product and technology differentiation, customer relationships and value chain participation. This is not a new phenomenon for us as we have been growing in these applications for some time, and we continue to maintain our positive view of the fundamentals in these value chains. I will come back to this point later in the call.  
Second, we continued to drive our cost reduction actions. We delivered more than $125 million of incremental cost synergies in the quarter, taking our cumulative savings, since merger close, to nearly $1 billion. And we also removed the first $40 million of stranded costs in the quarter. We remain on track to deliver the incremental $600 million of savings this year. 
And third, we continued to benefit from our new U.S. Gulf Coast investments, which all ran at high rates in the quarter and contributed approximately 500 million pounds of additional polyethylene volume versus the same quarter last year. 
Finally, during the quarter, we established the initial shareholder return targets for Dow. We confirmed an industry-leading annual dividend payout of $2.1 billion and announced a $3 billion open share repurchase program. Our commitment to shareholder returns was something we first outlined at our Investor Day in November last year, and it is a top priority of the Board and the Dow management team. 
Turning to our segment results. On Slide 4, Performance Materials & Coatings operating EBITDA was $481 million, down 18% from the year ago period, primarily driven by lower prices for siloxanes and shipping restrictions from our Performance Monomers facility in Deer Park, Texas due to a tank farm fire at a nearby third-party facility. Consumer Solutions sales were flat with the year ago period as gains in volume and local price were offset by currency headwinds in EMEA and Asia Pacific. The business achieved broad-based local price and volume gains for silicones products. Those gains were offset by price declines in siloxanes. 
To put things in perspective, siloxanes' prices in China in the first quarter were approximately 30% below the peak pricing of the third quarter of 2018. But as we look ahead, we are encouraged that siloxanes pricing stabilized as we completed the first quarter. 
Coatings & Performance Monomers sales were also down primarily due to the shedding of lower-margin business as well as weather-related events, which shifted seasonal demand in the construction industry in the U.S., Canada and EMEA. 
On Slide 5, Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure operating EBITDA was $448 million, down 31% from the year ago period, primarily due to margin compression in isocyanates and MEG, which impacted both our core business results and equity earnings. 
Polyurethanes & CAV delivered higher volume in all regions, but this was more than offset by lower isocyanates pricing. As I mentioned in my opening, our polyurethane systems growth was the highlight, expanding year-over-year about 2x global GDP. 
Industrial Solutions reported lower sales on reduced local price and currency headwinds. However, the business grew volume in EMEA, U.S. and Canada in industrial, oil and gas applications as well as on strong demand for deicing fluids, lubricants and fuels. 
On Slide 6, operating EBITDA for the Packaging & Specialty Plastics segment was $993 million, down 24% from the year ago period. The key driver here was compression in integrated polyethylene margin. However, we were able to offset more than $100 million of this headwind through cost synergy savings, increased supply from growth projects and lower commissioning and startup costs. The Packaging & Specialty Plastics business grew volume on higher demand in Asia Pacific and EMEA, supported by our new capacity add. From an end market perspective, our growth was led by Industrial & Consumer Packaging and Flexible Food & Specialty Packaging, 2 core sectors for our packaging franchise. 
And finally, the decline in Hydrocarbons & Energy sales was primarily due to 2 factors: the first was our increased ethylene integration from startups of our new derivative asset; and the second was our tilt towards max ethane cracking in the U.S. Gulf Coast, which reduced coproduct sales in the quarter. 
I'll now turn it over to Howard to discuss our 
overall financial performance and our modeling guidance."

Volume grew 1% with demand growth in many of our core businesses, including polyurethanes, Industrial Solutions, Consumer Solutions and Packaging & Specialt",1292,"Thanks, Jim. 
Turning to Slide 7. Sales declined 10% to $10.8 billion, in line with our guidance. Volume grew 1% with demand growth in many of our core businesses, including polyurethanes, Industrial Solutions, Consumer Solutions and Packaging & Specialty Plastics. These gains more than offset a decline in Coatings & Performance Monomers and a double-digit decline in Hydrocarbons & Energy. And as Jim mentioned, the hydrocarbons decline was primarily due to lower sales of coproducts. Excluding the Hydrocarbons & Energy business, the Materials Science Division grew volume year-over-year by approximately 3%. Local price was down 9%, largely driven by lower prices in isocyanates, siloxanes and polyethylene. Currency decreased sales 2% primarily driven by a stronger U.S. dollar against the euro. Operating EBITDA for the quarter was $1.9 billion, down 24% versus the year ago period and also in line with our guidance. The key driver of the decline was margin compression in polyethylene as well as isocyanates and siloxanes. And these factors, along with lower MEG prices, also drove our equity earnings decline. But importantly, we were able to offset a portion of this with cost synergies, contributions from new capacity adds and growth in the more differentiated portions of our portfolio. 
Now while Dow is not a stand-alone company in the first quarter, we were able to estimate our cash flow metrics on a new Dow basis. Free cash flow in the quarter was approximately $600 million or $200 million lower than the prior year period, primarily driven by reduced earnings, partly offset by a capacity reservation payment from MEGlobal related to our Texas-9 cracker expansion, which will support MEGlobal's new facility in Freeport, Texas. 
We also made further progress toward our targeted capital structure just after the quarter ended. We received the $2 billion deleveraging payment from DowDuPont. And as we said we would, we used that cash to pay down a portion of the Dow Corning term loan. That pay down was executed in early April, so you'll see it reflected in our second quarter financial statements. This brings the Dow Corning term loan balance to $2.5 billion. 
And finally, as Jim mentioned, we also put in place our initial shareholder return targets. In early April, Dow's Board of Directors declared a second quarter dividend of $0.70 per share. And we established a $3 billion open share repurchase program, a portion of which was designated under Rule 10b5-1, which involved a prearranged trading plan. 
Given our stock performance and spin, we have not yet repurchased any shares under the program. The the 10b5-1 is expected to expire in June. And from that point, we plan to be opportunistic with our share repurchases and will be disciplined with how we allocate our excess cash, taking into consideration all our priorities, including the dividend and deleveraging, to reach our targeted capital structure. 
As we said before, our target is to return approximately 65% of our operating net income to our owners across the economic cycle. Within that, the dividend is our top priority for returning cash and share repurchases are the flywheel. 
We're currently targeting share repurchases of approximately $500 million for the remainder of the year. This is our base case target and does not take into account any additional nonoperational cash inflows. 
Let's now take a closer look at the contributions from our joint ventures on Slide 8. During our Investor Day last year, we made a commitment to provide more transparency on our JV results. And today, we're providing those details. This slide gives you more granularity on the performance of what we call our principal JVs, our 3 most meaningful joint ventures, which account for the vast majority of Dow's equity earnings. 
Including all JVs, equity losses for the quarter were $10 million compared to equity earnings of $208 million in the year ago period. The reduction was primarily driven by margin compression in MEG at the Kuwait joint ventures and isocyanates at the Sadara joint venture. And as is typical in the first quarter, we also received annual dividends from many of our JVs, which totaled more than $750 million of cash inflow in the quarter. 
Now before I turn to our modeling guidance, I would like to review some of the reporting changes that we're making now that we've completed our spin. This was another commitment we made, and we are moving quickly to the new reporting. 
Slide 9 provides an initial look at the details to help you reconcile these changes and how they'll impact our historical results. There are 3 key changes that will impact our financial reporting and the way we discuss our results. First, as of our next quarterly report, we will switch to EBIT as our primary profit metric to reinforce the message that capital is not free. But we will still provide all the details for EBITDA as well for those of you who want to continue to track it. And as we shift to EBIT as our primary metric, we will also include the impact of foreign exchange in our definition of EBIT, which is how Dow historically defined our profit metric before the DowDuPont merger. 
Second, we will transition to full market-based transfer pricing. This change will have an impact on the profit across our operating segment, but it will be net neutral to total EBIT at the enterprise level. 
And third, we will also incorporate the impact of the new contracts and service agreements we will have with DuPont and Corteva. We plan to file a voluntary 8-K later this quarter by mid-June, which will provide you with quarterly recaps of our operating segment results incorporating these changes. Until then, you see on Slide 9 the estimates of what to expect for a few historical periods so that you can begin to incorporate these impacts into your models. While there are quite a few changes that we're putting in place, the net impact at historical EBITDA and EBIT is relatively modest. 
Moving to modeling guidance on Slide 10. Given the current environment and the fact that we've just spun out as an independent company, we have provided our modeling guidance today on a sequential basis versus the first quarter of 2019. For those of you who prefer to look at the year-over-year comparison, you'll find a similar slide with that view in the appendix of today's deck. 
On a sequential basis, we see overall demand remaining healthy in consumer and packaging end markets, which will continue to benefit businesses like our silicones, polyurethane systems and plastics businesses. 
We're also now seeing margins stabilize. And in a few areas such as polyethylene [ MDI ] and siloxanes, we're seeing the early signs of price increases starting with Asia Pacific. It's too early to tell how much traction we'll see in the second quarter, but these developing trends are a positive indicator for the second half of the year. 
We're also entering the typical seasonal high period for our turnaround activity, which will be a headwind sequentially. We expect our turnaround spending in the second quarter to be approximately $200 million higher than the first quarter or about even with our spending in the second quarter of last year. These are planned turnarounds that are scheduled in advance for crackers who are on a roughly 8-year turnaround cycle and for derivative plants that's approximately every 3 to 5 years. 
We will also be impacted by a fire that occurred at a third-party storage facility near our Deer Park, Texas site, which is limiting our ability to ship material. Our current assessment is that this limitation will continue through the second quarter and will result in approximately a $40 million impact sequentially. 
I'll now turn it back to Jim."
9830660,608199486,1720665,"Dow Inc., Q1 2019 Earnings Call, May 02, 2019",2019-05-02,"Earnings Calls","Dow Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Howard. Let's turn to Slide 11 and the outlook. Global economy is still expanding, albeit at a slower pace than 2018. We're seeing strength in the overall consumer confidence and spending supported by a strong labor market and wage growth. Manuf",1192,"Thanks, Howard. 
Let's turn to Slide 11 and the outlook. Global economy is still expanding, albeit at a slower pace than 2018. We're seeing strength in the overall consumer confidence and spending supported by a strong labor market and wage growth. Manufacturing activity also continues to expand in support of this demand. 
But the trends are not synchronized globally. The U.S. remains a bright spot, while the EU and China are expanding at a more modest rate. And while personal consumption remains healthy, spending on big-ticket items, such as automobiles and home purchases and builds, remains tepid in some geographies. Additionally, ongoing trade negotiations remain front and center around much of the world. We think that a positive trade outcome could be a catalyst for increased economic activity. But that said, our plans as always are focused on what we can control. 
Looking more specifically at our portfolio, we see early signs of stabilization and improvement in our key fundamental indicators. After several months of inventory destocking in many of our value chain, we saw inventory levels settle in the mid-to-late first quarter on normal demand seasonality. While we still see prices down year-over-year in areas like MDI and siloxanes, they have stabilized sequentially, and we see the opportunity to regain margin with price increases underway. We expect MDI fundamentals to be balanced through 2021. And in siloxanes, we expect overall operating rates to remain high in the near term as demand continues to outpace supply. 
The global ethylene market is relatively balanced on a regional basis today with some links in the U.S. Gulf Coast. We expect polyethylene demand to outstrip the recent ethylene supply additions starting in the second half of 2019. Our view of the cycle has been consistent for several years, short and shallow, and we see no reason to change that view. 
In feedstocks, the naphtha-to-ethane spread is widening again after the large contraction in the fourth quarter of 2018. In some areas like Europe, this may be a near term headwind to margins. But over the medium term, it should be constructive to our product spreads. Also, the risk of an ethane price spike in 2019  has vastly reduced due to new NGL infrastructure capacity coming online, coupled with delayed ethylene capacity adds as well as the turnaround season in the second quarter. 
The result is a significant reduction in the market's forward view of ethane prices for the year. We still expect near-term ethane prices to be somewhat volatile as the industry works through the timing of new ethane demand versus supply. But fundamentally, we expect upward pricing pressure to be moderate and spikes, if any, to be short-lived. We saw a realized example of this in the back half of 2018. And I think what surprised many people outside of our industry was how quickly these energy and feedstock markets changed, which is something that is often underestimated. And additionally, people underestimate how quickly Dow's assets can shift. 
We have leading feedstock flexibility and commercial capability to adjust quickly to these markets, and we have full chain integration and a differentiated portfolio to further mitigate the impact of the swings. 
To that point, as I mentioned before, our focus on increasing the consumer-driven bias of our portfolio is paying off, particularly in consumer care, packaging and infrastructure sectors. There are a few examples on Slide 12. 
In our silicones franchise, we have prioritized the growing use of our siloxanes toward our performance silicones business, where we can convert that siloxane into differentiated silicones that provide our customers with tremendous value and use. And our efforts are delivering. Every quarter since we brought this franchise into our portfolio, we have driven silicones growth that has outpaced global GDP. And consequently, our teams are unlocking incremental capacity to continue to meet growing customer demand. So far this year, we have already completed 4 debottleneck projects, and we have more than a dozen still on deck with incremental expansions in every geography. 
Another example is in our polyurethanes business. The business has been able to partly dampen the impact of isocyanates margin compressions with continued above GDP growth in systems applications in furniture, bedding, white goods and other durable goods. As a result, our polyurethanes business has now achieved year-over-year demand growth for 23 consecutive quarters. 
And finally, in Packaging & Specialty Plastics, we've been growing volume for several quarters on our strength in Industrial & Consumer Packaging and Flexible Food & Specialty Packaging. These are parts of the value chain where we are the proven market leader. And for our global asset base, our new capacity and expertise in local markets have enabled us to place new pounds efficiently in the market and deliver them with the highest value application. 
The common thread across these examples is their connection to the consumer and everyday life. And for us, this is another indicator that consumer spending remains healthy. And that benefits the Dow portfolio. 
I'll close with a quick recap on our near-term priorities on Slide 13. These are the same priorities that we've shared with you over the past several months, and I'm proud of the progress that we're making against each. But there is still work to do. While we see the early signs of improvement in our value chain, it is still early days. That's why our focus remains on being very disciplined with where we allocate our capital and our resources. 
Nothing has changed in our mindset of preferentially driving lower risk, faster payback projects while keeping our CapEx well within D&A levels. 
We've made substantial progress against our cost synergy capture and stranded cost removal targets, but we still have work to do. Our focus on a lean cost structure is still very much in place, and we will deliver the $600 million of incremental savings this year. And as you've seen over the past few months and today, we're committed to a best owner mindset and an enhanced level of disclosure. 
To wrap up, first, I could not be prouder of our team for working through all the complexities of our successful separation from DowDupont. Team Dow embraces challenge and took it head on. Second, the resilience of our portfolio showed through in the quarter, notably in our consumer-driven businesses where we can take advantage of our innovation and differentiation. And third, we believe that the fundamentals in our key value chains are beginning to stabilize. And as we look through the second quarter, we see early signs of inflection points that could materialize in the middle of the year. 
Going forward, our capital allocation and disciplined focus on higher return on invested capital, incremental investments, while keeping CapEx at or below D&A levels, is the right approach in this environment. And the Dow team remains focused on the actions within our control, capturing cost synergy savings and removing stranded costs, growing our differentiated positions, running our assets efficiently and continuing to be disciplined resource and capital allocators to drive value growth within each of our businesses and across the company. 
Now I'll turn it to Neal to open the Q&A."

I would say I think what's happening, there've been many reports out there about the value creation in petrochemicals. It's been one of the sectors over the last decade, 14, 15 years that's created some high value. So I think people are interested in that. There are different driving forces for everybody. Our driving force for our strategy is to grow with those consumer-driven differentiated markets. And so we'll be focused on developing products like performance silicones, better packaging products, polyurethane systems. Our Industrial Solutions will go downstream, working on coatings. Both our architectural and industrial coatings portfolios, our adhesives portfolios to continue to grow that business. 
And then, of course, we'll look at the back integration. Is that a better make versus buy decision? Where is the best place for us to be? Is it U.S. Gulf Coast where you've got this tremendous NGL advantage and ethane advantage and where we can tie into the flexibility that we have and benefit from that. And that's a different driving force obviously than someone who's looking at maybe a future market that speak oil and looking at what are they going to do with different barrels of oil. 
There are different chemistries out there. There's a lot of things going on. There's different strategies, partnerships around the world. So you might take the oil and do partnerships. You might make acquisitions. But in most cases today, the industry has shifted to cracking lighter. And so if you're going to make acquisitions to think that you're going to convert oil to petrochemicals, in most cases, you would be making acquisitions that are today probably NGL cracking. 
So I think there are a lot of things that have to play out. I feel good about our investments and our position. We took advantage of the first wave of shale. We were up first. We got our projects done on time. We got them done under budget, and they're going to be the most efficient capital projects in that cycle."

And really, the only thing that we called out is the specific headwinds from the turnaround costs. The core earnings I expect to be up. So Performance Material & Coatings, I think, we're going to see sales moving up. Siloxanes pricings have stabilized and started to move up, so that's going to help. Silicones pricing has held up well, and the issue there is just getting more capacity online to support that. So we had 4 debottlenecks in the quarter that came online, and we've got 12 new incremental projects for downstream silicones coming online through the year. 
In industrial intermediates, the big drag on industrial intermediates was really equity earnings, and it was ethylene glycol from the Kuwait joint ventures. The core business is growing there. Now we've announced some alkoxylates capacity. That won't come on in second quarter. That's a longer-term bet, but they're going to be up 3% to 5% in sales. And Packaging & Specialty Plastics is going to be up 3% to 5% in sales, and it's going to benefit from, obviously, the pricing that we're seeing coming through in April. And good to start the quarter with that and build that momentum. And then also the better cost positions we've seen on ethane. 2 fracs came up in the quarter, and so they'll come up ahead of the ethylene capacity. And that's really what's put that ethane future's curve down. So I believe you're going to see the core earnings move up sequentially, Vincent. And we just called out the turnarounds to make sure everybody understood what the magnitude of that cost would be in the second quarter."

And also, we saw inventory levels through the quarter kind of come back to the normal level, so we're able to get some material moved out. Some things had backed up at the end of fourth quarter '18, as you know, in the U.S. Gulf. And so we saw some of that stabilize through the quarter. I think that's another big factor in why you see the pricing moving up. You've got inventories coming back to kind of the normal level in the Gulf Coast. On the 10b5, Howard can speak to that."

Once we're in the process of doing all the final accounting, we're going to get that done as soon as we practically can. As soon as that 8-K gets published, then we can be in the market because -- with an open program as opposed to the 10b5. 
The 10b5 was set up based on the feedback that Dow's stock could trade with substantial churn in volatility immediately postspin. So we put the algorithm in place to take advantage of the opportunistic intrinsic value, and the Dow stock traded very well. And so as a result so far, that hasn't kicked in. But like I said, the 10b51 is there until we get the 8-K out. Once we get the 8-K out, we'll be in the open market.

I expect MDI is going to continue to tighten through the year. I think you've got 2 things happening. The consumer-driven side of the business, so our systems business, where you had end markets like furniture, bedding, some level of white goods, durable goods, that business, some cold storage, cold chain businesses, has been relatively good. Where we see obviously some things have been a little bit slower are housing starts and housing sales. So that's kind of slowed. And so you've got also automotive, and automotive is a lot of content for polyurethanes. So some of the big-ticket items are also big-demand pull items in that chain. So I'd say the consumer strength is really showing up in the numbers, 2x GDP for the systems growth, and that's without the big-ticket items pulling. So as we get through the year, I think you're going to start to see automotive pick up. 
I would say in Europe right now, automotive is weak, and there's probably the biggest inventory of finished autos out on the lots and at the dealers that has to be worked through. So I'd say Europe sentiment right now is it's going to take a little bit longer to work that through. 
The U.S. is relatively okay. North -- I'd say North America is relatively okay.  And China's relatively okay.  So I think as the year progresses, we're going to see those bigger-ticket items pull through a little bit more. 
On TDI, as we said before, I think TDI is going to be long for most of the year. So we're not putting into our outlook any big increases in TDI prices or margins. Mostly the improvement will be on MDI."

And then obviously, we have been working with Aramco diligently on things that we can do to help that out, including looking at the debt restructuring. So now that we've done the lender's reliability test and we've actually kicked off a team between Sadara and the 2 parents actively looking at how we can restructure that debt.

And so we've been looking at what we can do there to get some better cost position in there. 
But I think relative to where they are today, we're going to start to see things stepwise improve just on the basis of the market demand.

And if you look at the year-over-year pricing, it's quite a bit down. Now what we've seen through the quarter is obviously the inventory levels have started to improve in China. The demand pull, as you mentioned, hasn't yet kicked in. This is one of the areas in the China trade agreement. If you know, textiles had some tariffs coming back into the United States. That really put the brakes on some of the exports out of China, and that kind of backed up some of that capacity. So as we get this trade agreement through and we see what happens, if that gives a little bit more confidence to the textiles industry in China to be able to move some material in here, then that would be immediately visible in the marketplace. So that might give us some momentum on ethylene glycol pricing. The PET side of the equation has continued to be strong. So we really need the polyester side to pick up to see that pricing move. 
And I would also say that typically, when we pull out of one of these compression periods, PE and ethylene glycol is what you start to see turn. We've seen PE turn here in the month of April. So I think we could probably see also some cost push on the ethylene side in China that may start to move things up a little bit."

So MEGlobal is continuing to grow in that format and that structure, and that's been positive for us. And they've been also able to participate and continue that growth down in the U.S. Gulf Coast. So I think that's good. They clearly were already marketing ethylene glycol and carbide set that JV up obviously on its own to market the polyethylene so we don't do anything together there other than be an equity investor in polyethylene. 
Thailand was always an Asia growth play and continues to be that. And where we have strategic interests together, we'll look at that. And where we've got lines of business there that may be strategic to one of us and not the other, we'll look at options there. But both of those JVs are sustainable. They generate really positive cash flow and dividends. They've got good balance sheets. They're healthy.

In total, our sales volumes were up double digits year-over-year, so we continue to grow there, and it's across the board. It's in all the businesses: polyurethanes, packaging, Consumer Solutions, obviously. 
We don't have as much coatings exposure in China. We don't have too many facilities for coatings over there, and we don't have as much Industrial Solutions exposure. Most of that is exports out of Gulf Coast and out of Sadara. But I still feel good about the demand growth, and it continues to look good. 
I think the operating rates are probably been held down because of the cost curve and because of where some things are on the cost curves. There's just a big advantage in the U.S. Gulf Coast on the NGLs, and that's probably what's held them down. 
I think most of the environmental things are related to the incidents that have happened. And so you've had a couple of explosions and fires that typically always cause another relook at the industry and who's a credible operator and can operate safely and also who can operate at scale and return. 
I think the biggest challenge has been the pricing compression that we saw in the fourth quarter. And so as we see those margins recover, you may start to see people take a look in China again at whether they can have a good investment there and, long term, make some money there. But it's the feedstock challenge. That's the toughest part of that. It's hard to find a good competitive feedstock there, and I think that's why you see most of the oil majors looking. And it's mostly refinery integration discussion that you see happening. You see some ethane discussion, but that requires a lot of CapEx to build ships to take ethane out of the U.S. Gulf Coast. There's really not anywhere else in the world that you can get ethane export. And if you start to drive that price up too high, then you're going to be looking back at naphtha as an alternative."

And you know the priorities for us are to continue to work on returns out of those so that people can see the value out of those JVs. 
On the ethylene side, you're right. Because there hasn't been as much derivative capacity, that ethylene's been backed up. And what you see in the first quarter is people adjusting ethylene plant operating rates really to the derivative downstream operating rates. And derivatives are continuing to run hard in the U.S. Gulf Coast. So that's why we announced things like alkoxylates yield capacity expansions down in the Gulf Coast to convert more of that material. That's a high return to ethylene. I think by 2020, you're going to see that derivative demand's going to start to pull that excess ethylene that's out there. You also got a little bit of restrictions right now. There are not too many places that you can ship ethylene out, and one of them just had a large fire. And so that's caused us a little bit of more constraints. And so you've seen a lot of that margin in the short term disappear out of the ethylene part of the chain. But PE is holding up good, so I think if you think where we are in the cycle here and why we still say short and shallow is because PE margins are relatively strong. And we're seeing pricing coming back in April in polyethylene, so I think that's a good trend."

Please read the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the earnings news release and slides. During our call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding our expectations or predictions about the future. Because these statements are based on current assumptions and factors that involve risks and uncertainties, our actual performance and results may differ materially from our forward-looking statements. 
Dow's Form 10 as well as our Form 10-K include detailed discussions of the principal risks and uncertainties, which may cause such differences. Unless otherwise specified, all historical financial measures presented today and all financials, where applicable, exclude significant items. 
We'll also refer to non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and other associated disclosures are contained in the DowDuPont earnings release and on the DowDuPont and Dow websites. 
And as a reminder, because Dow operated as the Materials Science Division of DowDuPont through the end of the first quarter of 2019, the financial results shared during this call are based on the Materials Science Division's financial performance as disclosed earlier today in DowDuPont's earnings release. 
On Slide 2, you'll see our agenda for the call. We will start with an overview of the first quarter performance of the Materials Science Division of DowDuPont. We will also discuss the results for each of our operating segments. Then we'll move into a financial overview of the quarter, which will also include some comments on modeling guidance. And finally, we will close with a discussion on our go-forward views. There will be plenty of time for your questions.

I want to start by acknowledging the incredible accomplishments achieved by the Dow team to get us through our successful separation from DowDuPont on April 1.

I want to start by acknowledging the incredible accomplishments achieved by the Dow team to get us through our successful separation from DowDuPont on April 1. I want to thank every member of team Dow for all they did over the past 3.5 years to execute one of the largest and most complex spins in the history of corporate America. We are now fully operating as a stand-alone independent Dow with a streamlined and focused business portfolio that is well positioned to operate more productively, invest more prudently, grow more profitably and deliver higher returns to shareholders. 
With that, let's turn to our performance in the quarter on Slide 3. The Materials Science Division of DowDuPont reported top and bottom line results in line with the updated guidance we provided a few weeks ago. During the quarter, the resilience of the Dow portfolio was on display as we were able to moderate the impact of year-over-year margin compression in siloxanes, isocyanates and polyethylene products, which impacted our core business results and our equity earnings. 
We mitigated the headwinds in 3 ways: first, our continued demand growth in our differentiated applications was noteworthy, including silicones, polyurethane systems and packaging. This end market growth is an important highlight of the quarter as it reflects the ongoing strength we see from the consumer, and it speaks to our product and technology differentiation, customer relationships and value chain participation. This is not a new phenomenon for us as we have been growing in these applications for some time, and we continue to maintain our positive view of the fundamentals in these value chains. I will come back to this point later in the call.  
Second, we continued to drive our cost reduction actions. We delivered more than $125 million of incremental cost synergies in the quarter, taking our cumulative savings, since merger close, to nearly $1 billion. And we also removed the first $40 million of stranded costs in the quarter. We remain on track to deliver the incremental $600 million of savings this year. 
And third, we continued to benefit from our new U.S. Gulf Coast investments, which all ran at high rates in the quarter and contributed approximately 500 million pounds of additional polyethylene volume versus the same quarter last year. 
Finally, during the quarter, we established the initial shareholder return targets for Dow. We confirmed an industry-leading annual dividend payout of $2.1 billion and announced a $3 billion open share repurchase program. Our commitment to shareholder returns was something we first outlined at our Investor Day in November last year, and it is a top priority of the Board and the Dow management team. 
Turning to our segment results. On Slide 4, Performance Materials & Coatings operating EBITDA was $481 million, down 18% from the year ago period, primarily driven by lower prices for siloxanes and shipping restrictions from our Performance Monomers facility in Deer Park, Texas due to a tank farm fire at a nearby third-party facility. Consumer Solutions sales were flat with the year ago period as gains in volume and local price were offset by currency headwinds in EMEA and Asia Pacific. The business achieved broad-based local price and volume gains for silicones products. Those gains were offset by price declines in siloxanes. 
To put things in perspective, siloxanes' prices in China in the first quarter were approximately 30% below the peak pricing of the third quarter of 2018. But as we look ahead, we are encouraged that siloxanes pricing stabilized as we completed the first quarter. 
Coatings & Performance Monomers sales were also down primarily due to the shedding of lower-margin business as well as weather-related events, which shifted seasonal demand in the construction industry in the U.S., Canada and EMEA. 
On Slide 5, Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure operating EBITDA was $448 million, down 31% from the year ago period, primarily due to margin compression in isocyanates and MEG, which impacted both our core business results and equity earnings. 
Polyurethanes & CAV delivered higher volume in all regions, but this was more than offset by lower isocyanates pricing. As I mentioned in my opening, our polyurethane systems growth was the highlight, expanding year-over-year about 2x global GDP. 
Industrial Solutions reported lower sales on reduced local price and currency headwinds. However, the business grew volume in EMEA, U.S. and Canada in industrial, oil and gas applications as well as on strong demand for deicing fluids, lubricants and fuels. 
On Slide 6, operating EBITDA for the Packaging & Specialty Plastics segment was $993 million, down 24% from the year ago period. The key driver here was compression in integrated polyethylene margin. However, we were able to offset more than $100 million of this headwind through cost synergy savings, increased supply from growth projects and lower commissioning and startup costs. The Packaging & Specialty Plastics business grew volume on higher demand in Asia Pacific and EMEA, supported by our new capacity add. From an end market perspective, our growth was led by Industrial & Consumer Packaging and Flexible Food & Specialty Packaging, 2 core sectors for our packaging franchise. 
And finally, the decline in Hydrocarbons & Energy sales was primarily due to 2 factors: the first was our increased ethylene integration from startups of our new derivative asset; and the second was our tilt towards max ethane cracking in the U.S. Gulf Coast, which reduced coproduct sales in the quarter. 
I'll now turn it over to Howard to discuss our 
overall financial performance and our modeling guidance."

Sales declined 10% to $10.8 billion, in line with our guidance. Volume grew 1% with demand growth in many of our core businesses, including polyurethanes, Industrial Solutions, Consumer Solutions and Packaging & Specialt",1292,"Thanks, Jim. 
Turning to Slide 7. Sales declined 10% to $10.8 billion, in line with our guidance. Volume grew 1% with demand growth in many of our core businesses, including polyurethanes, Industrial Solutions, Consumer Solutions and Packaging & Specialty Plastics. These gains more than offset a decline in Coatings & Performance Monomers and a double-digit decline in Hydrocarbons & Energy. And as Jim mentioned, the hydrocarbons decline was primarily due to lower sales of coproducts. Excluding the Hydrocarbons & Energy business, the Materials Science Division grew volume year-over-year by approximately 3%. Local price was down 9%, largely driven by lower prices in isocyanates, siloxanes and polyethylene. Currency decreased sales 2% primarily driven by a stronger U.S. dollar against the euro. Operating EBITDA for the quarter was $1.9 billion, down 24% versus the year ago period and also in line with our guidance. The key driver of the decline was margin compression in polyethylene as well as isocyanates and siloxanes. And these factors, along with lower MEG prices, also drove our equity earnings decline. But importantly, we were able to offset a portion of this with cost synergies, contributions from new capacity adds and growth in the more differentiated portions of our portfolio. 
Now while Dow is not a stand-alone company in the first quarter, we were able to estimate our cash flow metrics on a new Dow basis. Free cash flow in the quarter was approximately $600 million or $200 million lower than the prior year period, primarily driven by reduced earnings, partly offset by a capacity reservation payment from MEGlobal related to our Texas-9 cracker expansion, which will support MEGlobal's new facility in Freeport, Texas. 
We also made further progress toward our targeted capital structure just after the quarter ended. We received the $2 billion deleveraging payment from DowDuPont. And as we said we would, we used that cash to pay down a portion of the Dow Corning term loan. That pay down was executed in early April, so you'll see it reflected in our second quarter financial statements. This brings the Dow Corning term loan balance to $2.5 billion. 
And finally, as Jim mentioned, we also put in place our initial shareholder return targets. In early April, Dow's Board of Directors declared a second quarter dividend of $0.70 per share. And we established a $3 billion open share repurchase program, a portion of which was designated under Rule 10b5-1, which involved a prearranged trading plan. 
Given our stock performance and spin, we have not yet repurchased any shares under the program. The the 10b5-1 is expected to expire in June. And from that point, we plan to be opportunistic with our share repurchases and will be disciplined with how we allocate our excess cash, taking into consideration all our priorities, including the dividend and deleveraging, to reach our targeted capital structure. 
As we said before, our target is to return approximately 65% of our operating net income to our owners across the economic cycle. Within that, the dividend is our top priority for returning cash and share repurchases are the flywheel. 
We're currently targeting share repurchases of approximately $500 million for the remainder of the year. This is our base case target and does not take into account any additional nonoperational cash inflows. 
Let's now take a closer look at the contributions from our joint ventures on Slide 8. During our Investor Day last year, we made a commitment to provide more transparency on our JV results. And today, we're providing those details. This slide gives you more granularity on the performance of what we call our principal JVs, our 3 most meaningful joint ventures, which account for the vast majority of Dow's equity earnings. 
Including all JVs, equity losses for the quarter were $10 million compared to equity earnings of $208 million in the year ago period. The reduction was primarily driven by margin compression in MEG at the Kuwait joint ventures and isocyanates at the Sadara joint venture. And as is typical in the first quarter, we also received annual dividends from many of our JVs, which totaled more than $750 million of cash inflow in the quarter. 
Now before I turn to our modeling guidance, I would like to review some of the reporting changes that we're making now that we've completed our spin. This was another commitment we made, and we are moving quickly to the new reporting. 
Slide 9 provides an initial look at the details to help you reconcile these changes and how they'll impact our historical results. There are 3 key changes that will impact our financial reporting and the way we discuss our results. First, as of our next quarterly report, we will switch to EBIT as our primary profit metric to reinforce the message that capital is not free. But we will still provide all the details for EBITDA as well for those of you who want to continue to track it. And as we shift to EBIT as our primary metric, we will also include the impact of foreign exchange in our definition of EBIT, which is how Dow historically defined our profit metric before the DowDuPont merger. 
Second, we will transition to full market-based transfer pricing. This change will have an impact on the profit across our operating segment, but it will be net neutral to total EBIT at the enterprise level. 
And third, we will also incorporate the impact of the new contracts and service agreements we will have with DuPont and Corteva. We plan to file a voluntary 8-K later this quarter by mid-June, which will provide you with quarterly recaps of our operating segment results incorporating these changes. Until then, you see on Slide 9 the estimates of what to expect for a few historical periods so that you can begin to incorporate these impacts into your models. While there are quite a few changes that we're putting in place, the net impact at historical EBITDA and EBIT is relatively modest. 
Moving to modeling guidance on Slide 10. Given the current environment and the fact that we've just spun out as an independent company, we have provided our modeling guidance today on a sequential basis versus the first quarter of 2019. For those of you who prefer to look at the year-over-year comparison, you'll find a similar slide with that view in the appendix of today's deck. 
On a sequential basis, we see overall demand remaining healthy in consumer and packaging end markets, which will continue to benefit businesses like our silicones, polyurethane systems and plastics businesses. 
We're also now seeing margins stabilize. And in a few areas such as polyethylene [ MDI ] and siloxanes, we're seeing the early signs of price increases starting with Asia Pacific. It's too early to tell how much traction we'll see in the second quarter, but these developing trends are a positive indicator for the second half of the year. 
We're also entering the typical seasonal high period for our turnaround activity, which will be a headwind sequentially. We expect our turnaround spending in the second quarter to be approximately $200 million higher than the first quarter or about even with our spending in the second quarter of last year. These are planned turnarounds that are scheduled in advance for crackers who are on a roughly 8-year turnaround cycle and for derivative plants that's approximately every 3 to 5 years. 
We will also be impacted by a fire that occurred at a third-party storage facility near our Deer Park, Texas site, which is limiting our ability to ship material. Our current assessment is that this limitation will continue through the second quarter and will result in approximately a $40 million impact sequentially. 
I'll now turn it back to Jim."

Global economy is still expanding, albeit at a slower pace than 2018. We're seeing strength in the overall consumer confidence and spending supported by a strong labor market and wage growth. Manuf",1193,"Thanks, Howard. 
Let's turn to Slide 11 and the outlook. Global economy is still expanding, albeit at a slower pace than 2018. We're seeing strength in the overall consumer confidence and spending supported by a strong labor market and wage growth. Manufacturing activity also continues to expand in support of this demand. 
But the trends are not synchronized globally. The U.S. remains a bright spot, while the EU and China are expanding at a more modest rate. And while personal consumption remains healthy, spending on big-ticket items, such as automobiles and home purchases and builds, remains tepid in some geographies. Additionally, ongoing trade negotiations remain front and center around much of the world. We think that a positive trade outcome could be a catalyst for increased economic activity. But that said, our plans as always are focused on what we can control. 
Looking more specifically at our portfolio, we see early signs of stabilization and improvement in our key fundamental indicators. After several months of inventory destocking in many of our value chain, we saw inventory levels settle in the mid-to-late first quarter on normal demand seasonality. While we still see prices down year-over-year in areas like MDI and siloxanes, they have stabilized sequentially, and we see the opportunity to regain margin with price increases under way. We expect MDI fundamentals to be balanced through 2021. And in siloxanes, we expect overall operating rates to remain high in the near term as demand continues to outpace supply. 
The global ethylene market is relatively balanced on a regional basis today with some links in the U.S. Gulf Coast. We expect polyethylene demand to outstrip the recent ethylene supply additions starting in the second half of 2019. Our view of the cycle has been consistent for several years, short and shallow, and we see no reason to change that view. 
In feedstocks, the naphtha-to-ethane spread is widening again after the large contraction in the fourth quarter of 2018. In some areas like Europe, this may be a near term headwind to margins. But over the medium term, it should be constructive to our product spreads. Also, the risk of an ethane price spike in 2019  has vastly reduced due to new NGL infrastructure capacity coming online, coupled with delayed ethylene capacity adds as well as the turnaround season in the second quarter. 
The result is a significant reduction in the market's forward view of ethane prices for the year. We still expect near-term ethane prices to be somewhat volatile as the industry works through the timing of new ethane demand versus supply. But fundamentally, we expect upward pricing pressure to be moderate and spikes, if any, to be short-lived. We saw a realized example of this in the back half of 2018. And I think what surprised many people outside of our industry was how quickly these energy and feedstock markets changed, which is something that is often underestimated. And additionally, people underestimate how quickly Dow's assets can shift. 
We have leading feedstock flexibility and commercial capability to adjust quickly to these markets, and we have full chain integration and a differentiated portfolio to further mitigate the impact of the swings. 
To that point, as I mentioned before, our focus on increasing the consumer-driven bias of our portfolio is paying off, particularly in consumer care, packaging and infrastructure sectors. There are a few examples on Slide 12. 
In our silicones franchise, we have prioritized the growing use of our siloxanes toward our performance silicones business, where we can convert that siloxane into differentiated silicones that provide our customers with tremendous value and use. And our efforts are delivering. Every quarter since we brought this franchise into our portfolio, we have driven silicones growth that has outpaced global GDP. And consequently, our teams are unlocking incremental capacity to continue to meet growing customer demand. So far this year, we have already completed 4 debottleneck projects, and we have more than a dozen still on deck with incremental expansions in every geography. 
Another example is in our polyurethanes business. The business has been able to partly dampen the impact of isocyanates margin compressions with continued above GDP growth in systems applications in furniture, bedding, white goods and other durable goods. As a result, our polyurethanes business has now achieved year-over-year demand growth for 23 consecutive quarters. 
And finally, in Packaging & Specialty Plastics, we've been growing volume for several quarters on our strength in Industrial & Consumer Packaging and Flexible Food & Specialty Packaging. These are parts of the value chain where we are the proven market leader. And for our global asset base, our new capacity and expertise in local markets have enabled us to place new pounds efficiently in the market and deliver them with the highest value application. 
The common thread across these examples is their connection to the consumer and everyday life. And for us, this is another indicator that consumer spending remains healthy. And that benefits the Dow portfolio. 
I'll close with a quick recap on our near-term priorities on Slide 13. These are the same priorities that we've shared with you over the past several months, and I'm proud of the progress that we're making against each. But there is still work to do. While we see the early signs of improvement in our value chain, it is still early days. That's why our focus remains on being very disciplined with where we allocate our capital and our resources. 
Nothing has changed in our mindset of preferentially driving lower risk, faster payback projects while keeping our CapEx well within D&A levels. 
We've made substantial progress against our cost synergy capture and stranded cost removal targets, but we still have work to do. Our focus on a lean cost structure is still very much in place, and we will deliver the $600 million of incremental savings this year. And as you've seen over the past few months and today, we're committed to a best owner mindset and an enhanced level of disclosure. 
To wrap up, first, I could not be prouder of our team for working through all the complexities of our successful separation from DowDupont. Team Dow embraces challenge and took it head on. Second, the resilience of our portfolio showed through in the quarter, notably in our consumer-driven businesses where we can take advantage of our innovation and differentiation. And third, we believe that the fundamentals in our key value chains are beginning to stabilize. And as we look through the second quarter, we see early signs of inflection points that could materialize in the middle of the year. 
Going forward, our capital allocation and disciplined focus on higher return on invested capital, incremental investments, while keeping CapEx at or below D&A levels, is the right approach in this environment. And the Dow team remains focused on the actions within our control, capturing cost synergy savings and removing stranded costs, growing our differentiated positions, running our assets efficiently and continuing to be disciplined resource and capital allocators to drive value growth within each of our businesses and across the company.

Our turnaround expenses are about the same as they were second quarter last year, but they are higher than first quarter, and that's just because of timing.

I would say I think what's happening, there've been many reports out there about the value creation in petrochemicals. It's been one of the sectors over the last decade, 14, 15 years that's created some high value. So I think people are interested in that. There are different driving forces for everybody. Our driving force for our strategy is to grow with those consumer-driven differentiated markets. And so we'll be focused on developing products like performance silicones, better packaging products, polyurethane systems. Our Industrial Solutions will go downstream, working on coatings. Both our architectural and industrial coatings portfolios, our adhesives portfolios to continue to grow that business. 
And then, of course, we'll look at the back integration. Is that a better make versus buy decision? Where is the best place for us to be? Is it U.S. Gulf Coast where you've got this tremendous NGL advantage and ethane advantage and where we can tie into the flexibility that we have and benefit from that. And that's a different driving force obviously than someone who's looking at maybe a future market that speak oil and looking at what are they going to do with different barrels of oil. 
There are different chemistries out there. There's a lot of things going on. There's different strategies, partnerships around the world. So you might take the oil and do partnerships. You might make acquisitions. But in most cases today, the industry has shifted to cracking lighter. And so if you're going to make acquisitions to think that you're going to convert oil to petrochemicals, in most cases, you would be making acquisitions that are today probably NGL cracking. 
So I think there are a lot of things that have to play out. I feel good about our investments and our position. We took advantage of the first wave of shale. We were up first. We got our projects done on time. We got them done under budget, and they're going to be the most efficient capital projects in that cycle."

And really, the only thing that we called out is the specific headwinds from the turnaround costs. The core earnings I expect to be up. So Performance Material & Coatings, I think, we're going to see sales moving up. Siloxanes pricings have stabilized and started to move up, so that's going to help. Silicones pricing has held up well, and the issue there is just getting more capacity online to support that. So we had 4 debottlenecks in the quarter that came online, and we've got 12 new incremental projects for downstream silicones coming online through the year. 
In industrial intermediates, the big drag on industrial intermediates was really equity earnings, and it was ethylene glycol from the Kuwait joint ventures. The core business is growing there. Now we've announced some alkoxylates capacity. That won't come on in second quarter. That's a longer-term bet, but they're going to be up 3% to 5% in sales. And Packaging & Specialty Plastics is going to be up 3% to 5% in sales, and it's going to benefit from, obviously, the pricing that we're seeing coming through in April. And good to start the quarter with that and build that momentum. And then also the better cost positions we've seen on ethane. Two fracs came up in the quarter, and so they'll come up ahead of the ethylene capacity. And that's really what's put that ethane future's curve down. So I believe you're going to see the core earnings move up sequentially, Vincent. And we just called out the turnarounds to make sure everybody understood what the magnitude of that cost would be in the second quarter."

The 10b5 was set up based on the feedback that Dow's stock could trade with substantial churn in volatility immediately postspin.

The consumer-driven side of the business, so our systems business, where you had end markets like furniture, bedding, some level of white goods, durable goods, that business, some cold storage, cold chain businesses, has been relatively good. Where we see obviously some things have been a little bit slower are housing starts and housing sales. So that's kind of slowed. And so you've got also automotive, and automotive is a lot of content for polyurethanes. So some of the big-ticket items are also big-demand pull items in that chain. So I'd say the consumer strength is really showing up in the numbers, 2x GDP for the systems growth, and that's without the big-ticket items pulling. So as we get through the year, I think you're going to start to see automotive pick up. 
I would say in Europe right now, automotive is weak, and there's probably the biggest inventory of finished autos out on the lots and at the dealers that has to be worked through. So I'd say Europe sentiment right now is it's going to take a little bit longer to work that through. 
The U.S. is relatively okay. North -- I'd say North America is relatively okay.  And China's relatively okay.  So I think as the year progresses, we're going to see those bigger-ticket items pull through a little bit more. 
On TDI, as we said before, I think TDI is going to be long for most of the year. So we're not putting into our outlook any big increases in TDI prices or margins. Mostly the improvement will be on MDI."

We've got supply chain costs that we're working on, so we're optimizing around the supply chain to make things a little bit more efficient. The plant has been running well, so the asset has been good. We don't have any issues there. 
We've looked at obviously all the things we can do on the feedstock side to improve it, as you know. Sadara's feedstock position, that's really the naphtha crack is what goes downstream for all that integration into isocyanates. And so we've been looking at what we can do there to get some better cost position in there. 
But I think relative to where they are today, we're going to start to see things stepwise improve just on the basis of the market demand. And if we got a trade agreement through with China, I think that would be helpful. At least, it would be helpful in the near term on the market psyche, but it would be helpful into the second half of the year."

And if you look at the year-over-year pricing, it's quite a bit down. Now what we've seen through the quarter is obviously the inventory levels have started to improve in China. The demand pull, as you mentioned, hasn't yet kicked in. This is one of the areas in the China trade agreement. If you know, textiles had some tariffs coming back into the United States. That really put the brakes on some of the exports out of China, and that kind of backed up some of that capacity. So as we get this trade agreement through and we see what happens, if that gives a little bit more confidence to the textiles industry in China to be able to move some material in here, then that would be immediately visible in the marketplace. So that might give us some momentum on ethylene glycol pricing. The PET side of the equation has continued to be strong. So we really need the polyester side to pick up to see that pricing move. 
And I would also say that typically, when we pull out of one of these compression periods, PE and ethylene glycol is what you start to see turn. We've seen PE turn here in the month of April. So I think we could probably see also some cost push on the ethylene side in China that may start to move things up a little bit."

So MEGlobal is continuing to grow in that format and that structure, and that's been positive for us. And they've been also able to participate and continue that growth down in the U.S. Gulf Coast. So I think that's good. They clearly were already marketing ethylene glycol and carbide set that JV up obviously on its own to market the polyethylene so we don't do anything together there other than be an equity investor in polyethylene. 
Thailand was always an Asia growth play and continues to be that. And where we have strategic interests together, we'll look at that. And where we've got lines of business there that may be strategic to one of us and not the other, we'll look at options there. But both of those JVs are sustainable.

In total, our sales volumes were up double digits year-over-year, so we continue to grow there, and it's across the board. It's in all the businesses: polyurethanes, packaging, Consumer Solutions, obviously. 
We don't have as much coatings exposure in China. We don't have too many facilities for coatings over there, and we don't have as much Industrial Solutions exposure. Most of that is exports out of Gulf Coast and out of Sadara. But I still feel good about the demand growth, and it continues to look good. 
I think the operating rates are probably been held down because of the cost curve and because of where some things are on the cost curves. There's just a big advantage in the U.S. Gulf Coast on the NGLs, and that's probably what's held them down. 
I think most of the environmental things are related to the incidents that have happened. And so you've had a couple of explosions and fires that typically always cause another relook at the industry and who's a credible operator and can operate safely and also who can operate at scale and return. 
I think the biggest challenge has been the pricing compression that we saw in the fourth quarter. And so as we see those margins recover, you may start to see people take a look in China again at whether they can have a good investment there and, long term, make some money there. But it's the feedstock challenge. That's the toughest part of that. It's hard to find a good competitive feedstock there, and I think that's why you see most of the oil majors looking. And it's mostly refinery integration discussion that you see happening. You see some ethane discussion, but that requires a lot of CapEx to build ships to take ethane out of the U.S. Gulf Coast. There's really not anywhere else in the world that you can get ethane export. And if you start to drive that price up too high, then you're going to be looking back at naphtha as an alternative."

On the ethylene side, you're right. Because there hasn't been as much derivative capacity, that ethylene's been backed up. And what you see in the first quarter is people adjusting ethylene plant operating rates really to the derivative downstream operating rates. And derivatives are continuing to run hard in the U.S. Gulf Coast. So that's why we announced things like alkoxylates yield capacity expansions down in the Gulf Coast to convert more of that material. That's a high return to ethylene. I think by 2020, you're going to see that derivative demand's going to start to pull that excess ethylene that's out there. You also got a little bit of restrictions right now. There are not too many places that you can ship ethylene out, and one of them just had a large fire. And so that's caused us a little bit of more constraints. And so you've seen a lot of that margin in the short term disappear out of the ethylene part of the chain. But PE is holding up good, so I think if you think where we are in the cycle here and why we still say short and shallow is because PE margins are relatively strong.

Starting on Slide 3. Our performance in the second quarter reflected the benefits of Dow's streamlined and more focused portfolio and our disciplined operational and financial management.",505,"Thanks, Neal, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. 
Starting on Slide 3. Our performance in the second quarter reflected the benefits of Dow's streamlined and more focused portfolio and our disciplined operational and financial management. It was a quarter that proved to be more challenging than many of us in the industry expected, and you've heard this from many of our peers in the past few weeks. In spite of this, the Dow team was able to deliver top and bottom line results that were in line with our guidance and consensus estimates. And despite the macro and end market volatility, we achieved core earnings growth sequentially when adjusting for our previously communicated higher planned turnaround spending in the quarter.
Our second quarter results were enabled by proactive and deliberate action. First, we captured demand growth in select consumer markets where the conditions have remained strong. For example, we grew volume in plastic packaging applications both sequentially and year-over-year, supported by our new capacity on the U.S. Gulf Coast. And in our Polyurethane Systems business, we grew our volume year-over-year for the 24th consecutive quarter.
Second, we made full use of our industry-leading feedstock flexibility. Favorable NGL feedstock trends helped us expand operating EBITDA margin in the P&SP segment as we utilized our ethane flexibility in the U.S. and our LPG capabilities in Europe. 
Third, we continued to drive expense management. In addition to reduced discretionary spending, we delivered more than $175 million savings from cost synergies and stranded cost removal. You can see this traction in our numbers. In the second quarter alone, we drove $75 million of year-over-year savings in our combined SG&A and R&D. We now delivered more than $1.1 billion of cumulative cost synergy savings since merger closed and remained well on track to deliver the $600 million of synergy and stranded cost savings that we targeted this year.
Fourth, we quickly put in place actions to further tighten our capital spending in the quarter. Not only was the second quarter CapEx spending below last year, but our first half spending was below trend relative to our full year target. We are taking additional actions to reduce Capex, which I'll cover later in the call.
And fifth, we continued our focus on cash as we generated higher cash flow from operating activities and improved our cash conversion in the quarter. Part of our improvement was driven by a decrease in integration and separation cost outlays, which will continue to be a tailwind going forward. We remain on track to reduce this cash spending by $200 million to $400 million versus 2018.
Taken together, this is a solid result by the Dow team, and it underscores our ability to adapt as market conditions evolve. Going forward, we will continue to take prudent actions to manage near-term macroeconomic challenges while preserving our long-term competitive advantages. I'll share more about our plans in my closing remarks. 
I'll now turn it over to Howard to discuss our overall financial performance and modeling guidance."

Turning to Slide 4. Net sales were $11 billion, in line with our guidance. The decline was driven primarily by lower local pricing in polyethylene, siloxanes and isocyanates as well as lower sales of hydrocarbon co-products due to lighter feedslates in both the U.S. and Europe. Volume declined 3% year-over-year driven primarily by lower hydrocarbon co-product sales due to higher internal ethylene consumption from the start of new downstream assets and our cracker feedstock selection. A notable volume highlight is our growth in the Packaging & Specialty Plastics business, which was up 3% year-over-year.
Local price was down 9%, and currency decreased sales 2% primarily driven by a stronger U.S. dollar against the euro. Equity losses were $15 million primarily driven by margin compression in MEG and polyethylene at the Kuwait joint ventures as well as margin compression in isocyanates at Sadara. 
Operating EBIT for the quarter was $1.1 billion, and EPS was $0.86, in line with consensus estimates. The key earnings tailwinds in the quarter were volume gains in packaging applications, PU systems and isocyanates, contributions from new capacity in the U.S. Gulf Coast and savings from cost synergies and stranded cost removal. These gains were more than offset by margin compression in our key value chain which impacted both our core business results and our JV equity earnings.
Turning to our cash metrics. We generated nearly $1 billion of cash flow from operating activities in the quarter, an increase of $200 million year-over-year. And we also continued to improve our EBITDA to cash flow from operations conversion, which rose to more than 50%. 
And finally, we returned $800 million to our owners in the quarter including $500 million of paid dividends and $300 million of share repurchases. As you may recall, we set a target of $500 million of share repurchases for the year, and we remain on pace to achieve that.
Now let's look at our principal joint ventures on Slide 5. Equity losses for the quarter were $15 million primarily driven by margin compression in MEG and polyethylene at the Kuwait joint ventures, reduced cracker and polyethylene margins at our Thai JVs and margin compression in isocyanates at the Sadara joint venture. 
With regard to Sadara, as we discussed before, one of the key items we are working on is receiving certification for passing the lender reliability test, the key milestone required for the JV parent to be released from the guarantees of Sadara's debt financing. The process to receive the certification typically takes 6 to 9 months, and we're progressing on that timeline. We have made good progress thus far and have essentially isolated the last gating items to a logistics services agreement. We are in active discussions with our partner, the JV and the lending syndicate to resolve this issue. Based on the progress to date, we are on track to formally receive certification in the second half of this year.
Moving to Slide 6 and our modeling guidance for the third quarter. As usual, we are providing specific guidance for our top line revenue expectation as well as several items below the EBIT line. With regard to segment expectations, we are providing our guidance on a sequential basis in response to investor feedback and to reflect the most relevant comparison in today's environment.
At the total Dow level, we expect EBIT tailwinds sequentially including more than $40 million from cost synergy savings and stranded cost removal as well as more than $50 million of lower planned maintenance spending as these costs peaked in the second quarter. However, these gains are temporarily offset by a couple of third-party outages that are impacting our operations in the third quarter.
In Performance Materials & Coatings, we see siloxanes pricing in the third quarter remaining about at the same level as we exited the second quarter, which means that third quarter average pricing will be down sequentially. On the positive side, our formulated silicones demand and margins continue to hold up very well, showcasing the resiliency in our differentiated businesses that are closer to the consumer.
Moving to the Industrial Intermediates and Infrastructure segment. From a pricing perspective, current forecasts estimate MDI prices to trend relatively flat with the second quarter levels. And MEG prices, on average, are projected to soften on a sequential basis. As such, we expect equity earnings results to be lower than the second quarter due to these factors. Additionally, Sadara's operations are being negatively impacted by the reliability of a third-party industrial gas supplier which is limiting production in JV's pool polyurethane chain. The supplier is actively addressing the issues, and the JV currently expects to ramp the normal operations by the middle of the quarter. Sadara currently estimates this limitation to have a $20 million impact to Dow's equity earnings in the quarter.
And finally, in the Packaging & Specialty Plastics segment, we expect robust packaging demand to continue. We see feedstock price trends continuing to drive lighter cracker feedslates in the U.S. and Europe which will further reduce our top line sales of co-products. From an industry supply-demand perspective, new ethylene capacity that is expected to come online in the U.S. will likely put some upward pressure on the ethane prices. The segment will be impacted by a planned cracker maintenance turnaround in the Netherlands as well as an issue that we're dealing with in Argentina.
Late in the second quarter, there was a significant countrywide power outage in Argentina which also spread to neighboring countries. The power outage abruptly shut down our ethylene operations. We have teams on the ground assessing the damage and beginning repairs. And our best estimate today is that the facility will be offline for at least the entire third quarter and is expected to have approximately $100 million impact on our results. 
I'll now turn it back to Jim to cover the performance in our segments as well as our near-term outlook."

On Slide 7, Performance Materials & Coatings operating EBIT was $214 million, down 27% from the year ago period primarily driven by siloxanes margin compression, higher planned turnaround spending and Performance Monomers shipping restrictions from our Deer Park, Texas location due to a tank farm fire at a third-party facility, which we highlighted in our modeling guidance on the last earnings call.
Consumer Solutions sales declined as price and volume gains in the U.S. and Canada were more than offset by price declines in Asia Pacific and EMEAI and volume declines in EMEAI and Latin America. The decline year-over-year primarily reflects lower demand in automotive and consumer electronics end markets. 
Coatings & Performance Monomers sales decline primarily due to lower volumes and local price. In addition to the Performance Monomers' shipping restrictions in Deer Park, the business was also impacted by wet weather that drove a delay in seasonal demand for coatings application in the United States and Europe.
On Slide 8, Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure operating EBIT was $154 million, down from the year ago period due to local price and volume declines and margin compressions in isocyanates and MEG that impacted both our core business and joint venture results. Polyurethanes & Construction Chemicals sales declined on lower isocyanates pricing and currency headwinds in Europe. Volume gains in isocyanates and systems applications were offset by declines in polyols, propylene oxide and propylene glycol. 
Industrial Solutions reported lower sales due to declines in local volume and price. Demand growth in Asia Pacific and Latin America was more than offset by volume declines in the U.S. and Canada and EMEAI driven by softer demand in agriculture, automotive and electronics end markets as well as reduced supply due to planned maintenance turnaround. Equity losses for the segment were $78 million driven by margin compression at the Kuwait and Sadara joint ventures.
On Slide 9. Operating EBITDA for the Packaging & Specialty Plastics segment was $768 million, down 17% from the year ago period. Margin compression in polyethylene products and reduced equity earnings more than offset demand growth for packaging applications, benefits from new capacity on the U.S. Gulf Coast and cost synergy savings. Equity earnings for the segment were $74 million, down from the year-ago period based on lower earnings from the Kuwait joint ventures. 
The Packaging & Specialty Plastics business reported lower net sales due to reduced polyethylene product prices and currency headwinds. However, the business achieved 3% volume growth led by a double-digit gain in Asia Pacific and increases in EMEAI. From an end market perspective, growth was led by industrial and consumer packaging and health and hygiene applications. 
And in Hydrocarbons & Energy, sales declined on both lower volume and local price. The volume decline was primarily driven by increased internal ethylene consumption and our feedstock selection as well as a planned turnaround in Germany which led to a further reduction in hydrocarbons co-products sales.
Let's now turn to Slide 10, where I'll close with our near-term outlook. In light of the current market dynamics, we're taking several actions to continue to manage the operational levers within our control. First, the macro environment is cautious largely driven by geopolitical volatility and prolonged trade negotiations which continue today. The net result is the continuation of a short-term buying pattern and decreased visibility along value chain. Bottom line, today, we still see the global economy expanding, but the pace of growth is slower particularly in Europe and in China. The U.S. remains fairly robust in consumer nondurable sectors. However, spending on big-ticket items like home builds, autos, durable goods and consumer electronics remains tepid globally. And we're closely watching consumer confidence measures which showed some softness during the second quarter.
Second, pricing in our intermediates are expected to continue to move sideways in the near term as a result of the business environment. You will recall that prices dropped in the fourth quarter of 2018 on a rapid destocking across our product chain plus a sharp decline in oil. Prices settled in the first quarter of 2019, and we saw a positive sign going into the second quarter, but those trends reversed as macro uncertainties escalated. So we're not counting on any immediate trade resolutions. We are still of the view that a path forward on that front can be a catalyst for improved market sentiment and a return to more normalized supply chains and buying patterns. 
Third, feedstock trends have improved. Since our last earnings call, ethane prices in the U.S. continued to decline, and today, the forward curve has moved lower. We believe that ethane prices could rise modestly going forward as frac spreads are near 0 today. And we expect new ethylene demand coming online. But we continue to see a much more subdued price trajectory and a much lower probability of any ethane spike.
In Europe, LPG continues to be favored versus naphtha. This is important for Dow as we have industry-leading LPG flexibility in Europe with the capability to produce up to 60% of our ethylene from LPG. And as you would expect, throughout the second quarter and today, we have been utilizing these flexibility. In short, these feedstock trends related to Dow's flexibility strength, and they represent another operational lever that we continue to manage closely as we see opportunities.
Turning to Slide 11. Against this backdrop of macro and market trends, we have a clear execution plan moving forward. First, we will continue to leverage the strengths of our business model, and that includes benefiting from our feedstock flexibility, continuing to manage our margins and pushing for pricing recovery. 
Second, we will keep prioritizing cost control. We have more cost synergy savings and stranded cost removal to accomplish, and we have a clear line of sight to get to it. We will also keep a tight lid on discretionary spending.
Third, with the softness we see in our intermediates pricing, we need to continue selling up and optimizing our product wheel. That means staying focused on driving more captive use of our intermediates into higher value add products such as coatings and silicones formulations and PU systems. 
And finally, on our investments, we are reducing our 2019 CapEx target from $2.5 billion to $2 billion. This is the prudent action to take as it gives us time to slow down some investments that require more market visibility while maintaining our asset base, improving reliability and preserving our ability to invest in quick win, incremental expansions to deliver value growth even in the current business environment.
In our view, this is not the time to invest in a major greenfield project. Here are a few examples of the actions that we are taking. We have decided to postpone the advancement of our feasibility study for a new world-scale siloxanes plant as we have more near-term value creating, de-bottleneck opportunities to pursue. Building on that point, we continue to greenlight incremental de-bottlenecks in our silicones franchise. Year-to-date, we have completed 5 of the 18 downstream silicones capacity expansions that we have on deck for 2019. We recently agreed to acquire our partner's stake in our Thai HPPO joint venture for a net cash outlay of approximately $150 million. This transaction is expected to close later this year and will be immediately accretive to our ROIC. After a detailed analysis of project returns and future demand growth, we have decided to postpone our planned 450,000-ton polyolefins expansion in Europe. And we will continue to push forward select process innovation especially those that move us down the cost curve, reduced capital intensity and lower greenhouse gas emissions. This is something in Dow's wheelhouse. Catalyst and process technology developments have historically represented hallmark investments for Dow and the industry. These near-term actions reflect our financial discipline and returns-oriented mindset. And they preserve the advantages that serve as well over the longer term. Our purpose-built portfolio and leading business positions, our leaner cost structure and our suite of incremental high return growth investments, these factors will continue to differentiate Dow and drive our earnings growth trajectory.
In closing, we delivered a solid second quarter results in a tough environment. Going forward, you can continue to count on the Dow team to remain focused on driving a leaner cost structure, running our assets efficiently, optimizing the value of our integration, growing our differentiated positions and continuing to be disciplined capital and resource allocators.

And I think we're going to continue to see that extend out over the next couple of years. Mainly, we went back and took a look at what happened with projections on capacity adds since back to 2007. And when you look at that whole track record of what's reported versus what actually happened, there were 64 projects that were supposed to start up in 2019 or beyond. Only 18 of those could be tied back to that original forecast. And 13 of the 18 were supposed to come online already, and every single 1 of them has been pushed back from its original start date. So I think some of these projections, whether it's about ethane prices spiking at the back half of the year or whether it's about plummeting operating rates, are a little bit tough to understand. The market's growth is there. We had good growth in the quarter. We had double-digit growth in China both in polyethylene and in downstream silicones. So the market demand growth is there. And I think that the biggest issue really in the integrated chain has to do more with the ethylene supply-demand balances, and that's because everybody in the U.S. has been integrating and so that merge in ethylene has driven some of the margin out of the U.S. ethylene integrated margins."

It's a little bit worse than we had forecasted at the time, and it's lasted a little bit longer than we had expected. But otherwise, everything else is on track. And the growth on the downstream silicones is on track. We had double-digit growth in China in the quarter. We had good growth around the world. So you see consumer markets like health and beauty care, you see large commercial, residential or large commercial buildings like skyscrapers and things, those continue to move forward. Some softness obviously in the applications that go into electronics and auto. But all else remains on track."

It's a function of both how much butane can you get at a location and then how much can you vaporize to move into the crackers. So we'll continue to do that. The other big move, obviously, recently, has been propane. So propane naphtha spreads have widened. And we've been cracking some propane in the fleet as well, propane, ethane. Ethane have been favored most the second quarter, but just here recently, propane actually moved into the money, so we moved in a little bit there. Look, all the investments we've made over the last 5 years were not just growth oriented, they were also to expand our NGL capability and expand our flexibility, and that's paying off. And the propane trends that I mentioned really had the big impact on Europe. So we've been back to maxing LPG cracking in Europe for most of the year. I would say I think the rest of the balances on destocking, inventories are coming down, working capital is coming down. I think people are being a little bit more hand to mouth in their purchases. People are not being very speculative. And so we see that. I don't think that there's been any dramatic increase in any inventories at any part of the world."

Let me just talk about the market macros first, and then I'll have Howard then make a few comments on stress testing because it will tie back to what we talked about on last call about the work that we did on setting up the new Dow. I think the market is really kind of 2 different markets right now. So if you look at it geographically, China and Europe are having some big pressure right now more so than the U.S. So the U.S. economy is holding up relatively better. However, if you look at it from a market standpoint, automotive is down from last year. Last year was obviously a peak year for global light vehicle production, and we are down in those forecasts have continued to be revised down for the year. That has a lot of direct impact, but it has an awful lot of indirect impact on content that hits our industry. Electronics are down, so it's the seventh consecutive month we've seen a contraction in new orders for electronics. That hasn't been that way since 2012. Home builds, the sentiment around Architectural Billing Index is down about 400 basis points year-over-year. And durable goods have been down 3 of the last 4 months. And to me, this is the confidence factor in the market. And we typically see when people are concerned about the outlook, individual consumers, they tighten up on big-ticket purchases, and so that's reflected. The consumer nondurable side, health and beauty care, packaging purchases, things people do everyday, go out to eat, these kind of things, those number -- retail numbers are pretty good. And packaging silicone formulations, coatings formulations, PU systems, that's holding up pretty well. So I don't think we're in a recession. It doesn't feel like we're in a recession. I do think a trade resolution will bring some confidence back into people and brightening the outlook, and confidence is huge in these markets.

I would say on cash flow, our cash from operating activities was up $200 million even though earnings were down versus a year ago. On an apples-to-apples basis, you have to adjust for the AR securitization, and on apples-to-apples basis, it was flat. So we generated flat cash from operations. Even though earnings were down, we generated almost $1 billion of cash flow from operating activities. 
To your stress test point, if you just -- look, if you take the first half based on your moderating point, John, you take the first half EBITDA and then annualize it, you're looking at about a $7.5 billion annual run rate. You subtract out interest and tax of about $1.5 billion, you're at $6 billion. You heard the guidance that Jim gave on the call of lowering CapEx from $2.5 billion to $2 billion, so now you're at $4 billion. We guided to $1 billion of integration and separation costs this year because of the separation and the spinout from Dow Dupont. Most of that spending now in the first half is behind us. So that will sequentially be a tailwind. That's $1 billion $1 billion for the year. So subtract that from the $4 billion, you're talking about $3 billion of discretionary cash or dividends, share buyback, other things. That doesn't include any benefit from nonoperating cash. That doesn't include any benefit from working capital improvements. Pretty proud of the Dow team with the focus on cash inside the company is very, very high and continuing to drive that cash flow conversion number up. So we feel really good about that going forward."

And then some on-time and early startups of new fractionators. And what that did is obviously drove a change in what the forward outlook would be on that ethane curve. There is excess U.S. ethane supply throughout the full period from now until 2023. So the balance is going to be long, and I think that hasn't changed. New cracker delays have taken that ethane down -- ethane demand down by about 275,000 barrels per day. So that means the inventories got bloated, and you saw frac spreads go -- we actually went negative at the end of the quarter. They are back to breakeven or maybe slightly positive. And honestly, I think they could stay here to maybe $1 frac spread in this near-term period. And a little bit will depend on the timing and success of some of these cracker startups. You've got good oil production out of the Permian, the Eagle Ford, the scoop, the stack. Those are really close to Mount Bellevue. You've got 1.2 million barrels a day of new wide grade pipelines. They're going to feed Mount Bellevue by first quarter of '20. And then 6 new Gulf Coast fractionators have been announced for start up in early 2020, and those have a combined capacity of 800,000 barrels per day. 450,000 of that is purity ethane. So that's what's led to the situation that you've got here. Gas demand is going to be at -- gas inventories are going to be at a 5-year high or 5-year average at the end of this year. We haven't been there for the last couple of years. I think our view is we are going to see these kind of prices for ethane for the near term here."

And as we b",363,"Sure. Thanks, Kevin. Let me just touch the last one first. I think the biggest impact on internal consumption of our intermediates is really ethylene to polyethylene, ethylene to EO derivatives. We had historically been that short biomaterial. And as we back integrated and take advantage of shale gas, we use more of that for our own downstream consumption. So the reason we highlighted that on the release and in the speaking comments that Howard made is because that typically would have been trade sales of ethylene or some other product to the market, so with the revenue line can look lighter even though our downstream sales are good. And it's just an adjustment in those numbers. 
On polyurethane, I think the biggest impact right now has been on automotive. So in automotive, seating and different parts to go into the auto industry, as those light vehicle builds have slowed down, that's going to back up some of that change. 
Now systems going into things like spray foams, systems going into gold chain or refrigerated containers going into insulation production for panels or especially commercial and big residential and commercial projects, that continues to look pretty good. And anything we can do into the adhesive space with the exception of obviously adhesives in automotive, which gets a little bit slowed down, has been pretty good. There are PU sales into appliances, so as those durable goods have slowed down, for example, in the refrigerators and maybe in some panels for dishwashers and things, you will see a little bit of an impact there. I think that's the biggest impact on polyurethane. We'll continue to move more of those intermediates, the downstream systems because we can work with the end-use customers to make finished products that really give them an advantage in their products and ability to capture higher value. And that's what we want to do long term, whether that's coatings, taking monomers into coatings or taking polyurethane intermediates into systems or taking more of our plastics into higher grade materials for packaging, health and hygiene, siloxanes into silicones, that's a consistent strategy. We're going to continue to do that across the board."

So our target headcount for the new Dow, once we completed all of our streamlining and really to do this, we had done external benchmarking with the best of the best.

So our target headcount for the new Dow, once we completed all of our streamlining and really to do this, we had done external benchmarking with the best of the best. Our idea was to be best in class competitive, was to get the headcount of 37,000 globally. And we will be there at the end of this year. In fact, we've accelerated some of those moves that we've planned through the year. We've accelerated some of those. And so that's why you see cost synergy savings coming out in advance of what we've said. We always continue to take a look at that. Headcount is part of our fixed cost, but it is only a fraction of it. So when you get to the number of sites that we have around the world, you also have to look at contractual relationships, services and other things that we do. So there's a heavy emphasis right now in manufacturing, engineering and all of that. [indiscernible] and his team are obviously looking at what is the future Dow need to look like in terms of footprint and where we have opportunities to consolidate. We are doing that. And then the rest of this $600 million of savings to come out through this year is really getting after a footprint consolidation, I would say, outside of manufacturing into things like getting lab consolidations done, which we've done a lot of this year, for example, in Europe and here in North America office buildings and other things. So we are making good progress on that, and we keep doing that. We were fortunate that we were already in this mode coming out of the spin so that we have the machine moving. And we could go in at the beginning of the second quarter and say this is going to be a tough quarter. We got to keep the pressure on. So we did put some incremental targets in front of them. And then on top of that, we're going to put the CapEx numbers down there. And we'll get them down to $2 billion this year. And if it gets worse, I don't expect it's going to get recessionary, but if it gets into that kind of frame, we still have room to move."

Starting on Slide 3. Our performance in the second quarter reflected the benefits of Dow's streamlined and more focused portfolio and our disciplined operational and financial management.",505,"Thanks, Neal, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. 
Starting on Slide 3. Our performance in the second quarter reflected the benefits of Dow's streamlined and more focused portfolio and our disciplined operational and financial management. It was a quarter that proved to be more challenging than many of us in the industry expected, and you've heard this from many of our peers in the past few weeks. In spite of this, the Dow team was able to deliver top and bottom line results that were in line with our guidance and consensus estimates. And despite the macro and end market volatility, we achieved core earnings growth sequentially when adjusting for our previously communicated higher planned turnaround spending in the quarter.
Our second quarter results were enabled by proactive and deliberate action. First, we captured demand growth in select consumer markets where the conditions have remained strong. For example, we grew volume in plastic packaging applications both sequentially and year-over-year, supported by our new capacity on the U.S. Gulf Coast. And in our polyurethane systems business, we grew our volume year-over-year for the 24th consecutive quarter.
Second, we made full use of our industry-leading feedstock flexibility. Favorable NGL feedstock trends helped us expand operating EBITDA margin in the P&SP segment as we utilized our ethane flexibility in the U.S. and our LPG capabilities in Europe. 
Third, we continued to drive expense management. In addition to reduced discretionary spending, we delivered more than $175 million savings from cost synergies and stranded cost removal. You can see this traction in our numbers. In the second quarter alone, we drove $75 million of year-over-year savings in our combined SG&A and R&D. We've now delivered more than $1.1 billion of cumulative cost synergy savings since merger close and remain well on track to deliver the $600 million of synergy and stranded cost savings that we targeted this year.
Fourth, we quickly put in place actions to further tighten our capital spending in the quarter. Not only was the second quarter CapEx spending below last year, but our first half spending was below trend relative to our full year target. We are taking additional actions to reduce Capex, which I'll cover later in the call.
And fifth, we continued our focus on cash as we generated higher cash flow from operating activities and improved our cash conversion in the quarter. Part of our improvement was driven by a decrease in integration and separation cost outlays, which will continue to be a tailwind going forward. We remain on track to reduce this cash spending by $200 million to $400 million versus 2018.
Taken together, this is a solid result by the Dow team, and it underscores our ability to adapt as market conditions evolve. Going forward, we will continue to take prudent actions to manage near-term macroeconomic challenges while preserving our long-term competitive advantages. I'll share more about our plans in my closing remarks. 
I'll now turn it over to Howard to discuss our overall financial performance and modeling guidance."

Turning to Slide 4. Net sales were $11 billion, in line with our guidance. The decline was driven primarily by lower local pricing in polyethylene, siloxanes and isocyanates as well as lower sales of hydrocarbon co-products due to lighter feedslates in both the U.S. and Europe. Volume declined 3% year-over-year driven primarily by lower hydrocarbon co-product sales due to higher internal ethylene consumption from the startup of new downstream assets and our cracker feedstock selection. A notable volume highlight is our growth in the Packaging & Specialty Plastics business, which was up 3% year-over-year.
Local price was down 9%, and currency decreased sales 2% primarily driven by a stronger U.S. dollar against the euro. Equity losses were $15 million primarily driven by margin compression in MEG and polyethylene at the Kuwait joint ventures as well as margin compression in isocyanates at Sadara. 
Operating EBIT for the quarter was $1.1 billion, and EPS was $0.86, in line with consensus estimates. The key earnings tailwinds in the quarter were volume gains in packaging applications, PU systems and isocyanates, contributions from new capacity in the U.S. Gulf Coast and savings from cost synergies and stranded cost removal. These gains were more than offset by margin compression in our key value chains which impacted both our core business results and our JV equity earnings.
Turning to our cash metrics. We generated nearly $1 billion of cash flow from operating activities in the quarter, an increase of $200 million year-over-year. And we also continued to improve our EBITDA to cash flow from operations conversion, which rose to more than 50%. 
And finally, we returned $800 million to our owners in the quarter including $500 million of paid dividends and $300 million of share repurchases. As you may recall, we set a target of $500 million of share repurchases for the year, and we remain on pace to achieve that.
Now let's look at our principal joint ventures on Slide 5. Equity losses for the quarter were $15 million primarily driven by margin compression in MEG and polyethylene at the Kuwait joint ventures, reduced cracker and polyethylene margins at our Thai JVs and margin compression in isocyanates at the Sadara joint venture. 
With regard to Sadara, as we have discussed before, one of the key items we are working on is receiving certification for passing the lender reliability test, the key milestone required for the JV parent to be released from the guarantees of Sadara's debt financing. The process to receive the certification typically takes 6 to 9 months, and we're progressing on that timeline. We have made good progress thus far and have essentially isolated the last gating item to a logistics services agreement. We are in active discussions with our partner, the JV and the lending syndicate to resolve this issue. Based on the progress to date, we are on track to formally receive certification in the second half of this year.
Moving to Slide 6 and our modeling guidance for the third quarter. As usual, we are providing specific guidance for our top line revenue expectations as well as several items below the EBIT line. With regard to segment expectations, we are providing our guidance on a sequential basis in response to investor feedback and to reflect the most relevant comparison in today's environment.
At the total Dow level, we expect EBIT tailwinds sequentially including more than $40 million from cost synergy savings and stranded cost removal as well as more than $50 million of lower planned maintenance spending as these costs peaked in the second quarter. However, these gains are temporarily offset by a couple of third-party outages that are impacting our operations in the third quarter.
In Performance Materials & Coatings, we see siloxanes pricing in the third quarter remaining about at the same level as we exited the second quarter, which means that third quarter average pricing will be down sequentially. On the positive side, our formulated silicones demand and margins continue to hold up very well, showcasing the resiliency in our differentiated businesses that are closer to the consumer.
Moving to the Industrial Intermediates and Infrastructure segment. From a pricing perspective, current forecasts estimate MDI prices to trend relatively flat with the second quarter levels. And MEG prices, on average, are projected to soften on a sequential basis. As such, we expect equity earnings results to be lower than the second quarter due to these factors. Additionally, Sadara's operations are being negatively impacted by the reliability of a third-party industrial gas supplier which is limiting production in JV's polyurethane chain. The supplier is actively addressing the issues, and the JV currently expects to ramp to normal operations by the middle of the quarter. Sadara currently estimates this limitation to have a $20 million impact to Dow's equity earnings in the quarter.
And finally, in the Packaging & Specialty Plastics segment, we expect robust packaging demand to continue. We see feedstock price trends continuing to drive lighter cracker feedslates in the U.S. and Europe which will further reduce our top line sales of co-products. From an industry supply-demand perspective, new ethylene capacity that is expected to come online in the U.S. will likely put some upward pressure on the ethane prices. The segment will be impacted by a planned cracker maintenance turnaround in the Netherlands as well as an issue that we're dealing with in Argentina.
Late in the second quarter, there was a significant countrywide power outage in Argentina which also spread to neighboring countries. The power outage abruptly shut down our ethylene operations. We have teams on the ground assessing the damage and beginning repairs. And our best estimate today is that the facility will be offline for at least the entire third quarter and is expected to have approximately $100 million impact on our results. 
I'll now turn it back to Jim to cover the performance in our segments as well as our near-term outlook."

On Slide 7, Performance Materials & Coatings operating EBIT was $214 million, down 27% from the year ago period primarily driven by siloxane's margin compression, higher planned turnaround spending and Performance Monomers shipping restrictions from our Deer Park, Texas location due to a tank farm fire at a third-party facility, which we highlighted in our modeling guidance on the last earnings call.
Consumer Solutions sales declined as price and volume gains in the U.S. and Canada were more than offset by price declines in Asia Pacific and EMEAI and volume declines in EMEAI and Latin America. The decline year-over-year primarily reflects lower demand in automotive and consumer electronics end markets. 
Coatings & Performance Monomers sales declined primarily due to lower volumes and local price. In addition to the Performance Monomers' shipping restrictions in Deer Park, the business was also impacted by wet weather that drove a delay in seasonal demand for coatings application in the United States and Europe.
On Slide 8, Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure operating EBIT was $154 million, down from the year ago period due to local price and volume declines and margin compressions in isocyanates and MEG that impacted both our core business and joint venture results. Polyurethanes & Construction Chemicals sales declined on lower isocyanates pricing and currency headwinds in Europe. Volume gains in isocyanates and systems applications were offset by declines in polyols, propylene oxide and propylene glycol. 
Industrial Solutions reported lower sales due to declines in local volume and price. Demand and growth in Asia Pacific and Latin America was more than offset by volume declines in the U.S. and Canada and EMEAI driven by softer demand in agriculture, automotive and electronics end markets as well as reduced supply due to planned maintenance turnaround. Equity losses for the segment were $78 million driven by margin compression at the Kuwait and Sadara joint ventures.
On Slide 9. Operating EBITDA for the Packaging & Specialty Plastics segment was $768 million, down 17% from the year ago period. Margin compression in polyethylene products and reduced equity earnings more than offset demand growth for packaging applications, benefits from new capacity on the U.S. Gulf Coast and cost synergy savings. Equity earnings for the segment were $74 million, down from the year-ago period based on lower earnings from the Kuwait joint ventures. 
The Packaging & Specialty Plastics business reported lower net sales due to reduced polyethylene product prices and currency headwinds. However, the business achieved 3% volume growth led by a double-digit gain in Asia Pacific and increases in EMEAI. From an end market perspective, growth was led by industrial and consumer packaging and health and hygiene applications. 
And in Hydrocarbons & Energy, sales declined on both lower volume and local price. The volume decline was primarily driven by increased internal ethylene consumption and our feedstock selection as well as a planned turnaround in Germany which led to a further reduction in hydrocarbon co-product sales.
Let's now turn to Slide 10, where I'll close with our near-term outlook. In light of the current market dynamics, we're taking several actions to continue to manage the operational levers within our control. First, the macro environment is cautious largely driven by geopolitical volatility and prolonged trade negotiations which continue today. The net result is the continuation of a short-term buying pattern and decreased visibility along value chain. Bottom line, today, we still see the global economy expanding, but the pace of growth is slower particularly in Europe and in China. The U.S. remains fairly robust in consumer nondurable sectors. However, spending on big-ticket items like home builds, autos, durable goods and consumer electronics remains tepid globally. And we're closely watching consumer confidence measures which showed some softness during the second quarter.
Second, pricing in our intermediates are expected to continue to move sideways in the near term as a result of the business environment. You will recall that prices dropped in the fourth quarter of 2018 on a rapid destocking across our product chain plus a sharp decline in oil. Prices settled in the first quarter of 2019, and we saw a positive signs going into the second quarter, but those trends reversed as macro uncertainties escalated. While we're not counting on any immediate trade resolutions, we are still of the view that a path forward on that front can be a catalyst for improved market sentiment and a return to more normalized supply chains and buying patterns. 
Third, feedstock trends have improved. Since our last earnings call, ethane prices in the U.S. continued to decline, and today, the forward curve has moved lower. We believe that ethane prices could rise modestly going forward as frac spreads are near 0 today. And we expect new ethylene demand coming online. But we continue to see a much more subdued price trajectory and a much lower probability of any ethane spike.
In Europe, LPG continues to be favored versus naphtha. This is important for Dow as we have industry-leading LPG flexibility in Europe with the capability to produce up to 60% of our ethylene from LPG. And as you would expect, throughout the second quarter and today, we have been utilizing this flexibility. In short, these feedstock trends play to Dow's flexibility strength, and they represent another operational lever that we continue to manage closely as we see opportunities.
Turning to Slide 11. Against this backdrop of macro and market trends, we have a clear execution plan moving forward. First, we will continue to leverage the strengths of our business model, and that includes benefiting from our feedstock flexibility, continuing to manage our margins and pushing for pricing recovery. 
Second, we will keep prioritizing cost control. We have more cost synergy savings and stranded cost removal to accomplish, and we have a clear line of sight to get to it. We will also keep a tight lid on discretionary spending.
Third, with the softness we see in our intermediates pricing, we need to continue selling up and optimizing our product wheel. That means staying focused on driving more captive use of our intermediates into higher value add products such as coatings and silicones formulations and PU systems. 
And finally, on our investments, we are reducing our 2019 CapEx target from $2.5 billion to $2 billion. This is the prudent action to take as it gives us time to slow down some investments that require more market visibility while maintaining our asset base, improving reliability and preserving our ability to invest in quick win, incremental expansions to deliver value growth even in the current business environment.
In our view, this is not the time to invest in a major greenfield project. Here are a few examples of the actions that we are taking. We have decided to postpone the advancement of our feasibility study for a new world-scale siloxanes plant as we have more near-term value creating, de-bottleneck opportunities to pursue. Building on that point, we continue to greenlight incremental de-bottlenecks in our silicones franchise. Year-to-date, we have completed 5 of the 18 downstream silicones capacity expansions that we have on deck for 2019. We recently agreed to acquire our partner's stake in our Thai HPPO joint venture for a net cash outlay of approximately $150 million. This transaction is expected to close later this year and will be immediately accretive to our ROIC. 
After a detailed analysis of project returns and future demand growth, we have decided to postpone our planned 450,000-ton polyolefins expansion in Europe. 
And we will continue to push forward select process innovation especially those that move us down the cost curve, reduced capital intensity and lower greenhouse gas emissions. This is something in Dow's wheelhouse. Catalyst and process technology developments have historically represented hallmark investments for Dow and the industry. These near-term actions reflect our financial discipline and returns-oriented mindset. And they preserve the advantages that serve us well over the longer term. Our purpose-built portfolio and leading business positions, our leaner cost structure and our suite of incremental high return growth investments, these factors will continue to differentiate Dow and drive our earnings growth trajectory.
In closing, we delivered a solid second quarter results in a tough environment. Going forward, you can continue to count on the Dow team to remain focused on driving a leaner cost structure, running our assets efficiently, optimizing the value of our integration, growing our differentiated positions and continuing to be disciplined capital and resource allocators.

And when you look at that whole track record of what's reported versus what actually happened, there were 64 projects that were supposed to start up in 2019 or beyond. Only 18 of those could be tied back to that original forecast. And 13 of the 18 were supposed to come online already, and every single 1 of them has been pushed back from its original start date. So I think some of these projections, whether it's about ethane prices spiking at the back half of the year or whether it's about plummeting operating rates, are a little bit tough to understand. The market's growth is there. We had good growth in the quarter. We had double-digit growth in China both in polyethylene and in downstream silicones. So the market demand growth is there. And I think that the biggest issue really in the integrated chain has to do more with the ethylene supply-demand balances, and that's because everybody in the U.S. has been integrating and so that merge in ethylene has driven some of the margin out of the U.S. ethylene integrated margins."

It's a function of both how much butane can you get at a location and then how much can you vaporize to move into the cracker. So we'll continue to do that. 
The other big move, obviously, recently, has been propane. So propane-naphtha spreads have widened. And we've been cracking some propane in the fleet as well, propane, ethane. Ethane had been favored most the second quarter, but just here recently, propane actually moved into the money, so we moved in a little bit there. Look, all the investments we've made over the last 5 years were not just growth oriented, they were also to expand our NGL capability and expand our flexibility, and that's paying off. And the propane trend that I mentioned really has a big impact on Europe. So we've been back to maxing LPG cracking in Europe for most of the year. 
I would say I think the rest of the balance is on destocking, inventories are coming down, working capital is coming down. I think people are being a little bit more hand to mouth in their purchases. People are not being very speculative. And so we see that. I don't think that there's been any dramatic increase in any inventories in any part of the world."

Let me just talk about the market macros first, and then I'll have Howard then make a few comments on stress testing because it will tie back to what we talked about on last call about the work that we did on setting up the new Dow. I think the market is really kind of 2 different markets right now. So if you look at it geographically, China and Europe are having some big pressure right now more so than the U.S. So the U.S. economy is holding up relatively better. However, if you look at it from a market standpoint, automotive is down from last year. Last year was obviously a peak year for global light vehicle production, and we are down in those forecasts have continued to be revised down for the year. That has a lot of direct impact, but then it has an awful lot of indirect impact on content that hits our industry. Electronics are down, so it's the seventh consecutive month we've seen a contraction in new orders for electronics. That hasn't been that way since 2012. Home builds, the sentiment around Architectural Billing Index (sic) [ Architecture Billings Index ] is down about 400 basis points year-over-year. And durable goods have been down 3 of the last 4 months. And to me, this is the confidence factor in the market. And we typically see when people are concerned about the outlook, individual consumers, they tighten up on big-ticket purchases, and so that's reflected. The consumer nondurable side, health and beauty care, packaging purchases, things that people do every day, go out to eat, these kind of things, those number -- retail numbers are looking pretty good. And packaging silicone formulations, coatings formulations, PU systems, that's holding up pretty well. So I don't think we're in a recession. It doesn't feel like we're in a recession. I do think a trade resolution would bring some confidence back into people and brighten the outlook. And confidence is huge in these markets.

On an apples-to-apples basis, you have to adjust for the AR securitization, and on apples-to-apples basis, it was flat. So we generated flat cash from ops. Even though earnings were down, we generated almost $1 billion of cash flow from operating activities. 
To your stress test point, if you just -- look, if you take the first half based on your moderating point, John, you take the first half EBITDA and then annualize it, you're looking at about a $7.5 billion annual run rate. You subtract out interest and taxes of about $1.5 billion, you're at $6 billion. You heard the guidance that Jim gave on the call of lowering CapEx from $2.5 billion to $2 billion, so now you're at $4 billion. We guided to $1 billion of integration and separation costs this year because of the separation and the spinout from DowDuPont. Most of that spending now in the first half is behind us. So that will sequentially be a tailwind. That's $1 billion for the year, so subtract that from the $4 billion, you're talking about $3 billion of discretionary cash for dividends, share buyback, other things. That doesn't include any benefit from nonoperating cash. That doesn't include any benefit from working capital improvements. I'm pretty proud of the Dow team, the focus on cash inside the company is very, very high and we'll be continuing to drive that cash flow conversion number up.

I think at a high level, Dylan, it delays in new cracker startups. And then some on-time and early startups of new fractionators. And what that did is obviously drove a change in what the forward outlook would be on that ethane curve. There is excess U.S. ethane supply throughout the period from now until 2023. So the balance is going to be long, and I think that hasn't changed. New cracker delays have taken that ethane down -- ethane demand down by about 275,000 barrels per day. So that means the inventories got bloated, and you saw frac spreads go -- they actually went negative at the end of the quarter. They are back to breakeven or maybe slightly positive. And honestly, I think they could stay here to maybe $1 frac spread in this near-term period. And a little bit will depend on the timing and success of some of these cracker startups. You've got good oil production out of the Permian, the Eagle Ford, the SCOOP, the STACK. Those are really close to Mont Belvieu. You've got 1.2 million barrels a day of new wide grade pipelines. They're going to feed Mont Belvieu by first quarter of '20. And then 6 new Gulf Coast fractionators have been announced for startup in early 2020, and those have a combined capacity of 800,000 barrels per day. 450,000 of that is purity ethane. So that's what's led to the situation that you've got here. Gas demand is going to be at -- gas inventories are going to be at a 5-year high -- or 5-year average at the end of this year. We haven't been there for the last couple of years. I think our view is we are going to see these kind of prices for ethane for the near term here."

Siloxanes, I would expect maybe somewhere that they might tick up a little bit, but they've been pretty stable as well. I would think for MDI to move up, you're either going to have to have some turnaround outages or you are going to have to see a real pull on the demand side of the equation to make that happen. Our outlook for them is flat. And I would just also say the forecast that we had on these ethane prices that they were going to go up dramatically at the end of the year, and we were not -- at that time, we were saying we don't see that happening. And as we sit here today, it didn't happen. So I just think in this macro environment, it feels like third quarter's going to be kind of a sideways quarter like second quarter."

I think the biggest impact on internal consumption of our intermediates is really ethylene to polyethylene, ethylene to EO derivatives. We had historically been that short, buying material. And as",362,"Sure. Thanks, Kevin. Let me just touch the last one first. I think the biggest impact on internal consumption of our intermediates is really ethylene to polyethylene, ethylene to EO derivatives. We had historically been that short, buying material. And as we've back integrated and take advantage of shale gas, we're using more of that for our own downstream consumption. So the reason we highlighted that on the release and in the speaking comments that Howard made is because that typically would have been trade sales of ethylene or some other product to the market, so with the revenue line can look lighter even though our downstream sales are good. And it's just an adjustment in those numbers. 
On polyurethane, I think the biggest impact right now has been on automotive. So in automotive, seating and different parts that go into the auto industry, as those light vehicle builds have slowed down, that's kind of backed up some of that change. 
Now systems going into things like spray foams, systems going into cold chain, refrigerated containers, going into insulation production for panels for especially commercial and big residential and commercial projects, that continues to look pretty good. And anything we can do into the adhesive space with the exception of obviously adhesives into automotive, which gets a little bit slowed down, has been pretty good. There are PU sales into appliances, so as those durable goods have slowed down, for example, in refrigerators and maybe in some panels for dishwashers and things, you will see a little bit of an impact there. I think that's the biggest impact on polyurethane. We'll continue to move more of those intermediates to downstream systems because we can work with the end-use customers to make finished products that really give them an advantage in their products and ability to capture higher value. And that's what we want to do long term, whether that's coatings, taking monomers into coatings or taking polyurethane intermediates into systems or taking more of our plastics into higher grade materials for packaging, health and hygiene, siloxanes into silicones, that's a consistent strategy. We're going to continue to do that across the board."

So our target headcount for the new Dow, once we completed all of our streamlining -- and really to do this, we had done external benchmarking with the best of the best. Our idea was to be best in class competitive, was to get to a headcount of 37,000 globally. And we will be there at the end of this year. In fact, we've accelerated some of those moves that we've planned through the year. We've accelerated some of those. And so that's why you see cost synergy savings coming out in advance of what we've said. We always continue to take a look at that. Headcount is part of our fixed cost, but it is only a fraction of it. So when you get to the number of sites that we have around the world, you also have to look at contractual relationships, services and other things that we do. So there's a heavy emphasis right now in manufacturing, engineering and all of that. Peter Holicki and his team are obviously looking at what does the future Dow need to look like in terms of footprint. And where we have opportunities to consolidate we are doing that. 
And then the rest of this $600 million of savings we got to come out through this year is really getting after footprint consolidation, I would say, outside of manufacturing into things like getting lab consolidations done, which we've done a lot of this year, for example, in Europe and here in North America, office buildings and other things. So we are making good progress on that, and we keep doing that. We were fortunate that we were already in this mode coming out of the spin so that we have the machine moving. And we could go in at the beginning of the second quarter and say this is going to be a tough quarter. We got to keep the pressure on. So we did put some incremental targets in front of them. And then on top of that, we're going to put the CapEx numbers down there. And we'll get them down to $2 billion this year. And if it gets worse, I don't expect it's going to get recessionary, but if it gets into that kind of frame, we still have room to move."

Starting on Slide 3.

Starting on Slide 3. Our performance in the second quarter reflected the benefits of Dow's streamlined and more focused portfolio and our disciplined operational and financial management. It was a quarter that proved to be more challenging than many of us in the industry expected, and you've heard this from many of our peers in the past few weeks. In spite of this, the Dow team was able to deliver top and bottom line results that were in line with our guidance and consensus estimates. And despite the macro and end market volatility, we achieved core earnings growth sequentially when adjusting for our previously communicated higher planned turnaround spending in the quarter.
Our second quarter results were enabled by proactive and deliberate action. First, we captured demand growth in select consumer markets where the conditions have remained strong. For example, we grew volume in plastic packaging applications both sequentially and year-over-year, supported by our new capacity on the U.S. Gulf Coast. And in our polyurethane systems business, we grew our volume year-over-year for the 24th consecutive quarter.
Second, we made full use of our industry-leading feedstock flexibility. Favorable NGL feedstock trends helped us expand operating EBITDA margin in the P&SP segment as we utilized our ethane flexibility in the U.S. and our LPG capabilities in Europe. 
Third, we continued to drive expense management. In addition to reduced discretionary spending, we delivered more than $175 million savings from cost synergies and stranded cost removal. You can see this traction in our numbers. In the second quarter alone, we drove $75 million of year-over-year savings in our combined SG&A and R&D. We've now delivered more than $1.1 billion of cumulative cost synergy savings since merger close and remain well on track to deliver the $600 million of synergy and stranded cost savings that we targeted this year.
Fourth, we quickly put in place actions to further tighten our capital spending in the quarter. Not only was the second quarter CapEx spending below last year, but our first half spending was below trend relative to our full year target. We are taking additional actions to reduce Capex, which I'll cover later in the call.
And fifth, we continued our focus on cash as we generated higher cash flow from operating activities and improved our cash conversion in the quarter. Part of our improvement was driven by a decrease in integration and separation cost outlays, which will continue to be a tailwind going forward. We remain on track to reduce this cash spending by $200 million to $400 million versus 2018.
Taken together, this is a solid result by the Dow team, and it underscores our ability to adapt as market conditions evolve. Going forward, we will continue to take prudent actions to manage near-term macroeconomic challenges while preserving our long-term competitive advantages. I'll share more about our plans in my closing remarks. 
I'll now turn it over to Howard to discuss our overall financial performance and modeling guidance."

Turning to Slide 4. Net sales were $11 billion, in line with our guidance. The decline was driven primarily by lower local pricing in polyethylene, siloxanes and isocyanates as well as lower sales of hydrocarbon co-products due to lighter feedslates in both the U.S. and Europe. Volume declined 3% year-over-year driven primarily by lower hydrocarbon co-product sales due to higher internal ethylene consumption from the startup of new downstream assets and our cracker feedstock selection. A notable volume highlight is our growth in the Packaging & Specialty Plastics business, which was up 3% year-over-year.
Local price was down 9%, and currency decreased sales 2% primarily driven by a stronger U.S. dollar against the euro. Equity losses were $15 million primarily driven by margin compression in MEG and polyethylene at the Kuwait joint ventures as well as margin compression in isocyanates at Sadara. 
Operating EBIT for the quarter was $1.1 billion, and EPS was $0.86, in line with consensus estimates. The key earnings tailwinds in the quarter were volume gains in packaging applications, PU systems and isocyanates, contributions from new capacity in the U.S. Gulf Coast and savings from cost synergies and stranded cost removal. These gains were more than offset by margin compression in our key value chains which impacted both our core business results and our JV equity earnings.
Turning to our cash metrics. We generated nearly $1 billion of cash flow from operating activities in the quarter, an increase of $200 million year-over-year. And we also continued to improve our EBITDA to cash flow from operations conversion, which rose to more than 50%. 
And finally, we returned $800 million to our owners in the quarter including $500 million of paid dividends and $300 million of share repurchases. As you may recall, we set a target of $500 million of share repurchases for the year, and we remain on pace to achieve that.
Now let's look at our principal joint ventures on Slide 5. Equity losses for the quarter were $15 million primarily driven by margin compression in MEG and polyethylene at the Kuwait joint ventures, reduced cracker and polyethylene margins at our Thai JVs and margin compression in isocyanates at the Sadara joint venture. 
With regard to Sadara, as we have discussed before, one of the key items we are working on is receiving certification for passing the lender reliability test, the key milestone required for the JV parent to be released from the guarantees of Sadara's debt financing. The process to receive the certification typically takes 6 to 9 months, and we're progressing on that timeline. We have made good progress thus far and have essentially isolated the last gating item to a logistics services agreement. We are in active discussions with our partner, the JV and the lending syndicate to resolve this issue. Based on the progress to date, we are on track to formally receive certification in the second half of this year.
Moving to Slide 6 and our modeling guidance for the third quarter. As usual, we are providing specific guidance for our top line revenue expectations as well as several items below the EBIT line. With regard to our segment expectations, we are providing our guidance on a sequential basis in response to investor feedback and to reflect the most relevant comparison in today's environment.
At the total Dow level, we expect EBIT tailwinds sequentially including more than $40 million from cost synergy savings and stranded cost removal as well as more than $50 million of lower planned maintenance spending as these costs peaked in the second quarter. However, these gains are temporarily offset by a couple of third-party outages that are impacting our operations in the third quarter.
In Performance Materials & Coatings, we see siloxanes pricing in the third quarter remaining about at the same level as we exited the second quarter, which means that third quarter average pricing will be down sequentially. On the positive side, our formulated silicones demand and margins continue to hold up very well, showcasing the resiliency in our differentiated businesses that are closer to the consumer.
Moving to the Industrial Intermediates and Infrastructure segment. From a pricing perspective, current forecasts estimate MDI prices to trend relatively flat with the second quarter levels. And MEG prices, on average, are projected to soften on a sequential basis. As such, we expect equity earnings results to be lower than the second quarter due to these factors. Additionally, Sadara's operations are being negatively impacted by the reliability of a third-party industrial gas supplier which is limiting production in JV's polyurethane chain. The supplier is actively addressing the issues, and the JV currently expects to ramp to normal operations by the middle of the quarter. Sadara currently estimates this limitation to have a $20 million impact to Dow's equity earnings in the quarter.
And finally, in the Packaging & Specialty Plastics segment, we expect robust packaging demand to continue. We see feedstock price trends continuing to drive lighter cracker feedslates in the U.S. and Europe which will further reduce our top line sales of co-products. From an industry supply-demand perspective, new ethylene capacity that is expected to come online in the U.S. will likely put some upward pressure on the ethane prices. The segment will be impacted by a planned cracker maintenance turnaround in the Netherlands as well as an issue that we're dealing with in Argentina.
Late in the second quarter, there was a significant countrywide power outage in Argentina which also spread to neighboring countries. The power outage abruptly shut down our ethylene operations. We have teams on the ground assessing the damage and beginning repairs. And our best estimate today is that the facility will be offline for at least the entire third quarter and is expected to have approximately $100 million impact on our results. 
I'll now turn it back to Jim to cover the performance in our segments as well as our near-term outlook."

On Slide 7, Performance Materials & Coatings operating EBIT was $214 million, down 27% from the year ago period primarily driven by siloxane's margin compression, higher planned turnaround spending and Performance Monomers shipping restrictions from our Deer Park, Texas location due to a tank farm fire at a third-party facility, which we highlighted in our modeling guidance on the last earnings call.
Consumer Solutions sales declined as price and volume gains in the U.S. and Canada were more than offset by price declines in Asia Pacific and EMEAI and volume declines in EMEAI and Latin America. The decline year-over-year primarily reflects lower demand in automotive and consumer electronics end markets. 
Coatings & Performance Monomers sales declined primarily due to lower volumes and local price. In addition to the Performance Monomers' shipping restrictions in Deer Park, the business was also impacted by wet weather that drove a delay in seasonal demand for coatings application in the United States and Europe.
On Slide 8, Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure operating EBIT was $154 million, down from the year ago period due to local price and volume declines and margin compressions in isocyanates and MEG that impacted both our core business and joint venture results. Polyurethanes & Construction Chemicals sales declined on lower isocyanates pricing and currency headwinds in Europe. Volume gains in isocyanates and systems applications were offset by declines in polyols, propylene oxide and propylene glycol. 
Industrial Solutions reported lower sales due to declines in local volume and price. Demand and growth in Asia Pacific and Latin America was more than offset by volume declines in the U.S. and Canada and EMEAI driven by softer demand in agriculture, automotive and electronics end markets as well as reduced supply due to planned maintenance turnaround. Equity losses for the segment were $78 million driven by margin compression at the Kuwait and Sadara joint ventures.
On Slide 9. Operating EBITDA for the Packaging & Specialty Plastics segment was $768 million, down 17% from the year ago period. Margin compression in polyethylene products and reduced equity earnings more than offset demand growth for packaging applications, benefits from new capacity on the U.S. Gulf Coast and cost synergy savings. Equity earnings for the segment were $74 million, down from the year-ago period based on lower earnings from the Kuwait joint ventures. 
The Packaging & Specialty Plastics business reported lower net sales due to reduced polyethylene product prices and currency headwinds. However, the business achieved 3% volume growth led by a double-digit gain in Asia Pacific and increases in EMEAI. From an end market perspective, growth was led by industrial and consumer packaging and health and hygiene applications. 
And in Hydrocarbons & Energy, sales declined on both lower volume and local price. The volume decline was primarily driven by increased internal ethylene consumption and our feedstock selection as well as a planned turnaround in Germany which led to a further reduction in hydrocarbon co-product sales.
Let's now turn to Slide 10, where I'll close with our near-term outlook. In light of the current market dynamics, we're taking several actions to continue to manage the operational levers within our control. First, the macro environment is cautious largely driven by geopolitical volatility and prolonged trade negotiations which continue today. The net result is the continuation of a short-term buying pattern and decreased visibility along value chain. Bottom line, today, we still see the global economy expanding, but the pace of growth is slower particularly in Europe and in China. The U.S. remains fairly robust in consumer nondurable sectors. However, spending on big-ticket items like home builds, autos, durable goods and consumer electronics remains tepid globally. And we're closely watching consumer confidence measures which showed some softness during the second quarter.
Second, pricing in our intermediates are expected to continue to move sideways in the near term as a result of the business environment. You will recall that prices dropped in the fourth quarter of 2018 on a rapid destocking across our product chain plus a sharp decline in oil. Prices settled in the first quarter of 2019, and we saw a positive signs going into the second quarter, but those trends reversed as macro uncertainties escalated. While we're not counting on any immediate trade resolutions, we are still of the view that a path forward on that front can be a catalyst for improved market sentiment and a return to more normalized supply chains and buying patterns. 
Third, feedstock trends have improved. Since our last earnings call, ethane prices in the U.S. continued to decline, and today, the forward curve has moved lower. We believe that ethane prices could rise modestly going forward as frac spreads are near 0 today. And we expect new ethylene demand coming online. But we continue to see a much more subdued price trajectory and a much lower probability of any ethane spike.
In Europe, LPG continues to be favored versus naphtha. This is important for Dow as we have industry-leading LPG flexibility in Europe with the capability to produce up to 60% of our ethylene from LPG. And as you would expect, throughout the second quarter and today, we have been utilizing this flexibility. In short, these feedstock trends play to Dow's flexibility strength, and they represent another operational lever that we continue to manage closely as we see opportunities.
Turning to Slide 11. Against this backdrop of macro and market trends, we have a clear execution plan moving forward. First, we will continue to leverage the strengths of our business model, and that includes benefiting from our feedstock flexibility, continuing to manage our margins and pushing for pricing recovery. 
Second, we will keep prioritizing cost control. We have more cost synergy savings and stranded cost removal to accomplish, and we have a clear line of sight to get to it. We will also keep a tight lid on discretionary spending.
Third, with the softness we see in our intermediates pricing, we need to continue selling up and optimizing our product wheel. That means staying focused on driving more captive use of our intermediates into higher value add products such as coatings and silicones formulations and PU systems. 
And finally, on our investments, we are reducing our 2019 CapEx target from $2.5 billion to $2 billion. This is the prudent action to take as it gives us time to slow down some investments that require more market visibility while maintaining our asset base, improving reliability and preserving our ability to invest in quick win, incremental expansions to deliver value growth even in the current business environment.
In our view, this is not the time to invest in a major greenfield project. Here are a few examples of the actions that we are taking. We have decided to postpone the advancement of our feasibility study for a new world-scale siloxanes plant as we have more near-term value creating, de-bottleneck opportunities to pursue. Building on that point, we continue to greenlight incremental de-bottlenecks in our silicones franchise. Year-to-date, we have completed 5 of the 18 downstream silicones capacity expansions that we have on deck for 2019. We recently agreed to acquire our partner's stake in our Thai HPPO joint venture for a net cash outlay of approximately $150 million. This transaction is expected to close later this year and will be immediately accretive to our ROIC. 
After a detailed analysis of project returns and future demand growth, we have decided to postpone our planned 450,000-ton polyolefins expansion in Europe. 
And we will continue to push forward select process innovations, especially those that move us down the cost curve, reduce capital intensity and lower greenhouse gas emissions. This is something in Dow's wheelhouse. Catalyst and process technology developments have historically represented hallmark investments for Dow and the industry. These near-term actions reflect our financial discipline and returns-oriented mindset. And they preserve the advantages that serve us well over the longer term. Our purpose-built portfolio and leading business positions, our leaner cost structure and our suite of incremental high return growth investments, these factors will continue to differentiate Dow and drive our earnings growth trajectory.
In closing, we delivered a solid second quarter results in a tough environment. Going forward, you can continue to count on the Dow team to remain focused on driving a leaner cost structure, running our assets efficiently, optimizing the value of our integration, growing our differentiated positions and continuing to be disciplined capital and resource allocators.

And I think we're going to continue to see that extend out over the next couple of years. Mainly, we went back and took a look at what's happened with projections on capacity adds since back to 2007. And when you look at that whole track record of what's reported versus what actually happened, there were 64 projects that were supposed to start up in 2019 or beyond. Only 18 of those could be tied back to that original forecast. And 13 of the 18 were supposed to come online already, and every single 1 of them has been pushed back from its original start date. So I think some of these projections, whether it's about ethane prices spiking at the back half of the year or whether it's about plummeting operating rates, are a little bit tough to understand. The market's growth is there. We had good growth in the quarter. We had double-digit growth in China both in polyethylene and in downstream silicones. So the market demand growth is there. And I think that the biggest issue really in the integrated chain has to do more with the ethylene supply-demand balances, and that's because everybody in the U.S. has been integrating and so that merge in ethylene has driven some of the margin out of the U.S. ethylene integrated margins."

It's a function of both how much butane can you get at a location and then how much can you vaporize to move into the cracker. So we'll continue to do that. 
The other big move, obviously, recently, has been propane. So propane-naphtha spreads have widened. And we've been cracking some propane in the fleet as well, propane, ethane. Ethane had been favored most the second quarter, but just here recently, propane actually moved into the money, so we moved in a little bit there. Look, all the investments we've made over the last 5 years were not just growth oriented, they were also to expand our NGL capability and expand our flexibility, and that's paying off. And the propane trend that I mentioned really has a big impact on Europe. So we've been back to maxing LPG cracking in Europe for most of the year. 
I would say I think the rest of the balance is on destocking, inventories are coming down, working capital is coming down. I think people are being a little bit more hand to mouth in their purchases. People are not being very speculative. And so we see that. I don't think that there's been any dramatic increase in any inventories in any part of the world."

Let me just talk about the market macros first, and then I'll have Howard then make a few comments on stress testing because it will tie back to what we talked about on last call about the work that we did on setting up the new Dow. I think the market is really kind of 2 different markets right now. So if you look at it geographically, China and Europe are having some big pressure right now more so than the U.S. So the U.S. economy is holding up relatively better. However, if you look at it from a market standpoint, automotive is down from last year. Last year was obviously a peak year for global light vehicle production, and we are down and those forecasts have continued to be revised down for the year. That has a lot of direct impact, but then it has an awful lot of indirect impact on content that hits our industry. Electronics are down, so it's the seventh consecutive month we've seen a contraction in new orders for electronics. That hasn't been that way since 2012. Home builds, the sentiment around Architectural Billing Index (sic) [ Architecture Billings Index ] is down about 400 basis points year-over-year. And durable goods have been down 3 of the last 4 months. And to me, this is the confidence factor in the market. And we typically see when people are concerned about the outlook, individual consumers, they tighten up on big-ticket purchases, and so that's reflected. The consumer nondurable side, health and beauty care, packaging purchases, things that people do every day, go out to eat, these kind of things, those number -- retail numbers are looking pretty good. And packaging silicone formulations, coatings formulations, PU systems, that's holding up pretty well. So I don't think we're in a recession. It doesn't feel like we're in a recession. I do think a trade resolution would bring some confidence back into people and brighten the outlook. And confidence is huge in these markets.

To your stress test point, if you just -- look, if you take the first half based on your moderating point, John, you take the first half EBITDA and then annualize it, you're looking at about a $7.5 billion annual run rate. You subtract out interest and taxes of about $1.5 billion, you're at $6 billion. You heard the guidance that Jim gave on the call of lowering CapEx from $2.5 billion to $2 billion, so now you're at $4 billion. We guided to $1 billion of integration and separation costs this year because of the separation and the spinout from DowDuPont. Most of that spending now in the first half is behind us. So that will sequentially be a tailwind. That's $1 billion for the year, so subtract that from the $4 billion, you're talking about $3 billion of discretionary cash for dividends, share buyback, other things.

I think at a high level, Dylan, it delays in new cracker startups. And then some on-time and early startups of new fractionators. And what that did is obviously drove a change in what the forward outlook would be on that ethane curve. There is excess U.S. ethane supply throughout the period from now until 2023. So the balance is going to be long, and I think that hasn't changed. New cracker delays have taken that ethane down -- ethane demand down by about 275,000 barrels per day. So that means the inventories got bloated, and you saw frac spreads go -- they actually went negative at the end of the quarter. They are back to breakeven or maybe slightly positive. And honestly, I think they could stay here to maybe $1 frac spread in this near-term period. And a little bit will depend on the timing and success of some of these cracker startups. You've got good oil production out of the Permian, the Eagle Ford, the SCOOP, the STACK. Those are really close to Mont Belvieu. You've got 1.2 million barrels a day of new wide grade pipelines. They're going to feed Mont Belvieu by first quarter of '20. And then 6 new Gulf Coast fractionators have been announced for startup in early 2020, and those have a combined capacity of 800,000 barrels per day. 450,000 of that is purity ethane. So that's what's led to the situation that you've got here. Gas demand is going to be at -- gas inventories are going to be at a 5-year high -- or 5-year average at the end of this year. We haven't been there for the last couple of years. I think our view is we are going to see these kind of prices for ethane for the near term here."

So Southeast Asia, obviously coming. There's Africa. So I think there's enough market demand around the world that it hasn't forced that to happen. There are also some just built-in logistics hurdles here in the U.S. It's very much a railcar market, and so there's a delta that has to be maintained there and is protected there. But overall, I haven't seen that pressure on that. I think we've seen more pressure really on the ethylene market price on the integrated margins. And I think that's where we are going to continue to see that pressure until we see that derivative capacity and the links in the ethylene market really get back in line."

And as w",362,"Sure. Thanks, Kevin. Let me just touch the last one first. I think the biggest impact on internal consumption of our intermediates is really ethylene to polyethylene, ethylene to EO derivatives. We had historically been net short buying material. And as we've back integrated and take advantage of shale gas, we're using more of that for our own downstream consumption. So the reason we highlighted that on the release and in the speaking comments that Howard made is because that typically would have been trade sales of ethylene or some other product to the market, so with the revenue line can look lighter even though our downstream sales are good. And it's just an adjustment in those numbers. 
On polyurethane, I think the biggest impact right now has been on automotive. So in automotive, seating and different parts that go into the auto industry, as those light vehicle builds have slowed down, that's kind of backed up some of that change. 
Now systems going into things like spray foams, systems going into cold chain, refrigerated containers, going into insulation production for panels for especially commercial and big residential and commercial projects, that continues to look pretty good. And anything we can do into the adhesive space with the exception of obviously adhesives into automotive, which gets a little bit slowed down, has been pretty good. There are PU sales into appliances, so as those durable goods have slowed down, for example, in refrigerators and maybe in some panels for dishwashers and things, you will see a little bit of an impact there. I think that's the biggest impact on polyurethane. We'll continue to move more of those intermediates to downstream systems because we can work with the end-use customers to make finished products that really give them an advantage in their products and ability to capture higher value. And that's what we want to do long term, whether that's coatings, taking monomers into coatings or taking polyurethane intermediates into systems or taking more of our plastics into higher grade materials for packaging, health and hygiene, siloxanes into silicones, that's a consistent strategy. We're going to continue to do that across the board."

So our target headcount for the new Dow, once we completed all of our streamlining -- and really to do this, we had done external benchmarking with the best of the best. Our idea was to be best in class competitive, was to get to a headcount of 37,000 globally. And we will be there at the end of this year. In fact, we've accelerated some of those moves that we've planned through the year. We've accelerated some of those. And so that's why you see cost synergy savings coming out in advance of what we've said. We always continue to take a look at that. Headcount is part of our fixed cost, but it is only a fraction of it. So when you get to the number of sites that we have around the world, you also have to look at contractual relationships, services and other things that we do. So there's a heavy emphasis right now in manufacturing, engineering and all of that. Peter Holicki and his team are obviously looking at what does the future Dow need to look like in terms of footprint. And where we have opportunities to consolidate we are doing that. 
And then the rest of this $600 million of savings we got to come out through this year is really getting after footprint consolidation, I would say, outside of manufacturing into things like getting lab consolidations done, which we've done a lot of this year, for example, in Europe and here in North America, office buildings and other things. So we are making good progress on that, and we keep doing that. We were fortunate that we were already in this mode coming out of the spin so that we have the machine moving. And we could go in at the beginning of the second quarter and say this is going to be a tough quarter. We got to keep the pressure on. So we did put some incremental targets in front of them. And then on top of that, we're going to put the CapEx numbers down there. And we'll get them down to $2 billion this year. And if it gets worse, I don't expect it's going to get recessionary, but if it gets into that kind of frame, we still have room to move."

Starting on Slide 3. Our performance in the second quarter reflected the benefits of Dow's streamlined and more focused portfolio and our disciplined operational and financial management. It was a quarter that proved to be more challenging than many of us in the industry expected, and you've heard this from many of our peers in the past few weeks. In spite of this, the Dow team was able to deliver top and bottom line results that were in line with our guidance and consensus estimates. And despite the macro and end market volatility, we achieved core earnings growth sequentially when adjusting for our previously communicated higher planned turnaround spending in the quarter.
Our second quarter results were enabled by proactive and deliberate action. First, we captured demand growth in select consumer markets where the conditions have remained strong. For example, we grew volume in plastic packaging applications both sequentially and year-over-year, supported by our new capacity on the U.S. Gulf Coast. And in our polyurethane systems business, we grew our volume year-over-year for the 24th consecutive quarter.
Second, we made full use of our industry-leading feedstock flexibility. Favorable NGL feedstock trends helped us expand operating EBITDA margin in the P&SP segment as we utilized our ethane flexibility in the U.S. and our LPG capabilities in Europe. 
Third, we continued to drive expense management. In addition to reduced discretionary spending, we delivered more than $175 million savings from cost synergies and stranded cost removal. You can see this traction in our numbers. In the second quarter alone, we drove $75 million of year-over-year savings in our combined SG&A and R&D. We've now delivered more than $1.1 billion of cumulative cost synergy savings since merger close and remain well on track to deliver the $600 million of synergy and stranded cost savings that we targeted this year.
Fourth, we quickly put in place actions to further tighten our capital spending in the quarter. Not only was the second quarter CapEx spending below last year, but our first half spending was below trend relative to our full year target. We are taking additional actions to reduce Capex, which I'll cover later in the call.
And fifth, we continued our focus on cash as we generated higher cash flow from operating activities and improved our cash conversion in the quarter. Part of our improvement was driven by a decrease in integration and separation cost outlays, which will continue to be a tailwind going forward. We remain on track to reduce this cash spending by $200 million to $400 million versus 2018.
Taken together, this is a solid result by the Dow team, and it underscores our ability to adapt as market conditions evolve. Going forward, we will continue to take prudent actions to manage near-term macroeconomic challenges while preserving our long-term competitive advantages. I'll share more about our plans in my closing remarks. 
I'll now turn it over to Howard to discuss our overall financial performance and modeling guidance."

Turning to Slide 4. Net sales were $11 billion, in line with our guidance. The decline was driven primarily by lower local pricing in polyethylene, siloxanes and isocyanates as well as lower sales of hydrocarbon co-products due to lighter feedslates in both the U.S. and Europe. Volume declined 3% year-over-year driven primarily by lower hydrocarbon co-product sales due to higher internal ethylene consumption from the startup of new downstream assets and our cracker feedstock selection. A notable volume highlight is our growth in the Packaging & Specialty Plastics business, which was up 3% year-over-year.
Local price was down 9%, and currency decreased sales 2% primarily driven by a stronger U.S. dollar against the euro. Equity losses were $15 million primarily driven by margin compression in MEG and polyethylene at the Kuwait joint ventures as well as margin compression in isocyanates at Sadara. 
Operating EBIT for the quarter was $1.1 billion, and EPS was $0.86, in line with consensus estimates. The key earnings tailwinds in the quarter were volume gains in packaging applications, PU systems and isocyanates, contributions from new capacity in the U.S. Gulf Coast and savings from cost synergies and stranded cost removal. These gains were more than offset by margin compression in our key value chains which impacted both our core business results and our JV equity earnings.
Turning to our cash metrics. We generated nearly $1 billion of cash flow from operating activities in the quarter, an increase of $200 million year-over-year. And we also continued to improve our EBITDA to cash flow from operations conversion, which rose to more than 50%. 
And finally, we returned $800 million to our owners in the quarter including $500 million of paid dividends and $300 million of share repurchases. As you may recall, we set a target of $500 million of share repurchases for the year, and we remain on pace to achieve that.
Now let's look at our principal joint ventures on Slide 5. Equity losses for the quarter were $15 million primarily driven by margin compression in MEG and polyethylene at the Kuwait joint ventures, reduced cracker and polyethylene margins at our Thai JVs and margin compression in isocyanates at the Sadara joint venture. 
With regard to Sadara, as we have discussed before, one of the key items we are working on is receiving certification for passing the lender reliability test, the key milestone required for the JV parent to be released from the guarantees of Sadara's debt financing. The process to receive the certification typically takes 6 to 9 months, and we're progressing on that timeline. We have made good progress thus far and have essentially isolated the last gating item to a logistics services agreement. We are in active discussions with our partner, the JV and the lending syndicate to resolve this issue. Based on the progress to date, we are on track to formally receive certification in the second half of this year.
Moving to Slide 6 and our modeling guidance for the third quarter. As usual, we are providing specific guidance for our top line revenue expectations as well as several items below the EBIT line. With regard to our segment expectations, we are providing our guidance on a sequential basis in response to investor feedback and to reflect the most relevant comparison in today's environment.
At the total Dow level, we expect EBIT tailwinds sequentially including more than $40 million from cost synergy savings and stranded cost removal as well as more than $50 million of lower planned maintenance spending as these costs peaked in the second quarter. However, these gains are temporarily offset by a couple of third-party outages that are impacting our operations in the third quarter.
In Performance Materials & Coatings, we see siloxanes pricing in the third quarter remaining about at the same level as we exited the second quarter, which means that third quarter average pricing will be down sequentially. On the positive side, our formulated silicones demand and margins continue to hold up very well, showcasing the resiliency in our differentiated businesses that are closer to the consumer.
Moving to the Industrial Intermediates and Infrastructure segment. From a pricing perspective, current forecasts estimate MDI prices to trend relatively flat with the second quarter levels. And MEG prices, on average, are projected to soften on a sequential basis. As such, we expect equity earnings results to be lower than the second quarter due to these factors. Additionally, Sadara's operations are being negatively impacted by the reliability of a third-party industrial gas supplier which is limiting production in JV's polyurethane chain. The supplier is actively addressing the issues, and the JV currently expects to ramp to normal operations by the middle of the quarter. Sadara currently estimates this limitation to have a $20 million impact to Dow's equity earnings in the quarter.
And finally, in the Packaging & Specialty Plastics segment, we expect robust packaging demand to continue. We see feedstock price trends continuing to drive lighter cracker feedslates in the U.S. and Europe which will further reduce our top line sales of co-products. From an industry supply-demand perspective, new ethylene capacity that is expected to come online in the U.S. will likely put some upward pressure on the ethane prices. The segment will be impacted by a planned cracker maintenance turnaround in the Netherlands as well as an issue that we're dealing with in Argentina.
Late in the second quarter, there was a significant countrywide power outage in Argentina which also spread to neighboring countries. The power outage abruptly shut down our ethylene operations. We have teams on the ground assessing the damage and beginning repairs. And our best estimate today is that the facility will be offline for at least the entire third quarter and is expected to have approximately $100 million impact on our results. 
I'll now turn it back to Jim to cover the performance in our segments as well as our near-term outlook."

On Slide 7, Performance Materials & Coatings operating EBIT was $214 million, down 27% from the year ago period primarily driven by siloxane's margin compression, higher planned turnaround spending and Performance Monomers shipping restr",1416,"Thanks, Howard. 
On Slide 7, Performance Materials & Coatings operating EBIT was $214 million, down 27% from the year ago period primarily driven by siloxane's margin compression, higher planned turnaround spending and Performance Monomers shipping restrictions from our Deer Park, Texas location due to a tank farm fire at a third-party facility, which we highlighted in our modeling guidance on the last earnings call.
Consumer Solutions sales declined as price and volume gains in the U.S. and Canada were more than offset by price declines in Asia Pacific and EMEAI and volume declines in EMEAI and Latin America. The decline year-over-year primarily reflects lower demand in automotive and consumer electronics end markets. 
Coatings & Performance Monomers sales declined primarily due to lower volumes and local price. In addition to the Performance Monomers' shipping restrictions in Deer Park, the business was also impacted by wet weather that drove a delay in seasonal demand for coatings application in the United States and Europe.
On Slide 8, Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure operating EBIT was $154 million, down from the year ago period due to local price and volume declines and margin compressions in isocyanates and MEG that impacted both our core business and joint venture results. Polyurethanes & Construction Chemicals sales declined on lower isocyanates pricing and currency headwinds in Europe. Volume gains in isocyanates and systems applications were offset by declines in polyols, propylene oxide and propylene glycol. 
Industrial Solutions reported lower sales due to declines in local volume and price. Demand and growth in Asia Pacific and Latin America was more than offset by volume declines in the U.S. and Canada and EMEAI driven by softer demand in agriculture, automotive and electronics end markets as well as reduced supply due to planned maintenance turnaround. Equity losses for the segment were $78 million driven by margin compression at the Kuwait and Sadara joint ventures.
On Slide 9. Operating EBITDA for the Packaging & Specialty Plastics segment was $768 million, down 17% from the year ago period. Margin compression in polyethylene products and reduced equity earnings more than offset demand growth for packaging applications, benefits from new capacity on the U.S. Gulf Coast and cost synergy savings. Equity earnings for the segment were $74 million, down from the year-ago period based on lower earnings from the Kuwait joint ventures. 
The Packaging & Specialty Plastics business reported lower net sales due to reduced polyethylene product prices and currency headwinds. However, the business achieved 3% volume growth led by a double-digit gain in Asia Pacific and increases in EMEAI. From an end market perspective, growth was led by industrial and consumer packaging and health and hygiene applications. 
And in Hydrocarbons & Energy, sales declined on both lower volume and local price. The volume decline was primarily driven by increased internal ethylene consumption and our feedstock selection as well as a planned turnaround in Germany which led to a further reduction in hydrocarbon co-product sales.
Let's now turn to Slide 10, where I'll close with our near-term outlook. In light of the current market dynamics, we're taking several actions to continue to manage the operational levers within our control. First, the macro environment is cautious largely driven by geopolitical volatility and prolonged trade negotiations which continue today. The net result is the continuation of a short-term buying pattern and decreased visibility along value chain. Bottom line, today, we still see the global economy expanding, but the pace of growth is slower particularly in Europe and in China. The U.S. remains fairly robust in consumer nondurable sectors. However, spending on big-ticket items like home builds, autos, durable goods and consumer electronics remains tepid globally. And we're closely watching consumer confidence measures which showed some softness during the second quarter.
Second, pricing in our intermediates are expected to continue to move sideways in the near term as a result of the business environment. You will recall that prices dropped in the fourth quarter of 2018 on a rapid destocking across our product chain plus a sharp decline in oil. Prices settled in the first quarter of 2019, and we saw a positive signs going into the second quarter, but those trends reversed as macro uncertainties escalated. While we're not counting on any immediate trade resolutions, we are still of the view that a path forward on that front can be a catalyst for improved market sentiment and a return to more normalized supply chains and buying patterns. 
Third, feedstock trends have improved. Since our last earnings call, ethane prices in the U.S. continued to decline, and today, the forward curve has moved lower. We believe that ethane prices could rise modestly going forward as frac spreads are near 0 today. And we expect new ethylene demand coming online. But we continue to see a much more subdued price trajectory and a much lower probability of any ethane spike.
In Europe, LPG continues to be favored versus naphtha. This is important for Dow as we have industry-leading LPG flexibility in Europe with the capability to produce up to 60% of our ethylene from LPG. And as you would expect, throughout the second quarter and today, we have been utilizing this flexibility. In short, these feedstock trends play to Dow's flexibility strength, and they represent another operational lever that we continue to manage closely as we see opportunities.
Turning to Slide 11. Against this backdrop of macro and market trends, we have a clear execution plan moving forward. First, we will continue to leverage the strengths of our business model, and that includes benefiting from our feedstock flexibility, continuing to manage our margins and pushing for pricing recovery. 
Second, we will keep prioritizing cost control. We have more cost synergy savings and stranded cost removal to accomplish, and we have a clear line of sight to get to it. We will also keep a tight lid on discretionary spending.
Third, with the softness we see in our intermediates pricing, we need to continue selling up and optimizing our product wheel. That means staying focused on driving more captive use of our intermediates into higher value add products such as coatings and silicones formulations and PU systems. 
And finally, on our investments, we are reducing our 2019 CapEx target from $2.5 billion to $2 billion. This is the prudent action to take as it gives us time to slow down some investments that require more market visibility while maintaining our asset base, improving reliability and preserving our ability to invest in quick win, incremental expansions to deliver value growth even in the current business environment.
In our view, this is not the time to invest in a major greenfield project. Here are a few examples of the actions that we are taking. We have decided to postpone the advancement of our feasibility study for a new world-scale siloxanes plant as we have more near-term value creating, de-bottleneck opportunities to pursue. Building on that point, we continue to greenlight incremental de-bottlenecks in our silicones franchise. Year-to-date, we have completed 5 of the 18 downstream silicones capacity expansions that we have on deck for 2019. We recently agreed to acquire our partner's stake in our Thai HPPO joint venture for a net cash outlay of approximately $150 million. This transaction is expected to close later this year and will be immediately accretive to our ROIC. 
After a detailed analysis of project returns and future demand growth, we have decided to postpone our planned 450,000-ton polyolefins expansion in Europe. 
And we will continue to push forward select process innovations, especially those that move us down the cost curve, reduce capital intensity and lower greenhouse gas emissions. This is something in Dow's wheelhouse. Catalyst and process technology developments have historically represented hallmark investments for Dow and the industry. These near-term actions reflect our financial discipline and returns-oriented mindset. And they preserve the advantages that serve us well over the longer term. Our purpose-built portfolio and leading business positions, our leaner cost structure and our suite of incremental high return growth investments, these factors will continue to differentiate Dow and drive our earnings growth trajectory.
In closing, we delivered a solid second quarter results in a tough environment. Going forward, you can continue to count on the Dow team to remain focused on driving a leaner cost structure, running our assets efficiently, optimizing the value of our integration, growing our differentiated positions and continuing to be disciplined capital and resource allocators.

And I think we're going to continue to see that extend out over the next couple of years. Mainly, we went back and took a look at what's happened with projections on capacity adds since back to 2007. And when you look at that whole track record of what's reported versus what actually happened, there were 64 projects that were supposed to start up in 2019 or beyond. Only 18 of those could be tied back to that original forecast. And 13 of the 18 were supposed to come online already, and every single 1 of them has been pushed back from its original start date. So I think some of these projections, whether it's about ethane prices spiking at the back half of the year or whether it's about plummeting operating rates, are a little bit tough to understand. The market's growth is there. We had good growth in the quarter. We had double-digit growth in China both in polyethylene and in downstream silicones. So the market demand growth is there. And I think that the biggest issue really in the integrated chain has to do more with the ethylene supply-demand balances, and that's because everybody in the U.S. has been integrating and so that merge in ethylene has driven some of the margin out of the U.S. ethylene integrated margins."

It's a function of both how much butane can you get at a location and then how much can you vaporize to move into the cracker. So we'll continue to do that. 
The other big move, obviously, recently, has been propane. So propane-naphtha spreads have widened. And we've been cracking some propane in the fleet as well, propane, ethane. Ethane had been favored most the second quarter, but just here recently, propane actually moved into the money, so we moved in a little bit there. Look, all the investments we've made over the last 5 years were not just growth oriented, they were also to expand our NGL capability and expand our flexibility, and that's paying off. And the propane trend that I mentioned really has a big impact on Europe. So we've been back to maxing LPG cracking in Europe for most of the year. 
I would say I think the rest of the balance is on destocking, inventories are coming down, working capital is coming down. I think people are being a little bit more hand to mouth in their purchases. People are not being very speculative. And so we see that. I don't think that there's been any dramatic increase in any inventories in any part of the world."

Let me just talk about the market macros first, and then I'll have Howard then make a few comments on stress testing because it will tie back to what we talked about on last call about the work that we did on setting up the new Dow. I think the market is really kind of 2 different markets right now. So if you look at it geographically, China and Europe are having some big pressure right now more so than the U.S. So the U.S. economy is holding up relatively better. However, if you look at it from a market standpoint, automotive is down from last year. Last year was obviously a peak year for global light vehicle production, and we are down and those forecasts have continued to be revised down for the year. That has a lot of direct impact, but then it has an awful lot of indirect impact on content that hits our industry. Electronics are down, so it's the seventh consecutive month we've seen a contraction in new orders for electronics. That hasn't been that way since 2012. Home builds, the sentiment around Architectural Billing Index (sic) [ Architecture Billings Index ] is down about 400 basis points year-over-year. And durable goods have been down 3 of the last 4 months. And to me, this is the confidence factor in the market. And we typically see when people are concerned about the outlook, individual consumers, they tighten up on big-ticket purchases, and so that's reflected. The consumer nondurable side, health and beauty care, packaging purchases, things that people do every day, go out to eat, these kind of things, those number -- retail numbers are looking pretty good. And packaging silicone formulations, coatings formulations, PU systems, that's holding up pretty well. So I don't think we're in a recession. It doesn't feel like we're in a recession. I do think a trade resolution would bring some confidence back into people and brighten the outlook. And confidence is huge in these markets.

I would say on cash flow, our cash from operating activities was up $200 million even though earnings were down versus a year ago. On an apples-to-apples basis, you have to adjust for the AR securitization, and on apples-to-apples basis, it was flat. So we generated flat cash from ops. Even though earnings were down, we generated almost $1 billion of cash flow from operating activities. 
To your stress test point, if you just -- look, if you take the first half based on your moderating point, John, you take the first half EBITDA and then annualize it, you're looking at about a $7.5 billion annual run rate. You subtract out interest and taxes of about $1.5 billion, you're at $6 billion. You heard the guidance that Jim gave on the call of lowering CapEx from $2.5 billion to $2 billion, so now you're at $4 billion. We guided to $1 billion of integration and separation costs this year because of the separation and the spinout from DowDuPont. Most of that spending now in the first half is behind us. So that will sequentially be a tailwind. That's $1 billion for the year, so subtract that from the $4 billion, you're talking about $3 billion of discretionary cash for dividends, share buyback, other things. That doesn't include any benefit from nonoperating cash. That doesn't include any benefit from working capital improvements. I'm pretty proud of the Dow team, the focus on cash inside the company is very, very high and we'll be continuing to drive that cash flow conversion number up. So we feel really good about that going forward."

I think at a high level, Dylan, it delays in new cracker startups. And then some on-time and early startups of new fractionators. And what that did is obviously drove a change in what the forward outlook would be on that ethane curve. There is excess U.S. ethane supply throughout the period from now until 2023. So the balance is going to be long, and I think that hasn't changed. New cracker delays have taken that ethane down -- ethane demand down by about 275,000 barrels per day. So that means the inventories got bloated, and you saw frac spreads go -- they actually went negative at the end of the quarter. They are back to breakeven or maybe slightly positive. And honestly, I think they could stay here to maybe $1 frac spread in this near-term period. And a little bit will depend on the timing and success of some of these cracker startups. You've got good oil production out of the Permian, the Eagle Ford, the SCOOP, the STACK. Those are really close to Mont Belvieu. You've got 1.2 million barrels a day of new wide grade pipelines. They're going to feed Mont Belvieu by first quarter of '20. And then 6 new Gulf Coast fractionators have been announced for startup in early 2020, and those have a combined capacity of 800,000 barrels per day. 450,000 of that is purity ethane. So that's what's led to the situation that you've got here. Gas demand is going to be at -- gas inventories are going to be at a 5-year high -- or 5-year average at the end of this year. We haven't been there for the last couple of years. I think our view is we are going to see these kind of prices for ethane for the near term here."

And as w",362,"Sure. Thanks, Kevin. Let me just touch the last one first. I think the biggest impact on internal consumption of our intermediates is really ethylene to polyethylene, ethylene to EO derivatives. We had historically been net short buying material. And as we've back integrated and take advantage of shale gas, we're using more of that for our own downstream consumption. So the reason we highlighted that on the release and in the speaking comments that Howard made is because that typically would have been trade sales of ethylene or some other product to the market, so with the revenue line can look lighter even though our downstream sales are good. And it's just an adjustment in those numbers. 
On polyurethane, I think the biggest impact right now has been on automotive. So in automotive, seating and different parts that go into the auto industry, as those light vehicle builds have slowed down, that's kind of backed up some of that change. 
Now systems going into things like spray foams, systems going into cold chain, refrigerated containers, going into insulation production for panels for especially commercial and big residential and commercial projects, that continues to look pretty good. And anything we can do into the adhesive space with the exception of obviously adhesives into automotive, which gets a little bit slowed down, has been pretty good. There are PU sales into appliances, so as those durable goods have slowed down, for example, in refrigerators and maybe in some panels for dishwashers and things, you will see a little bit of an impact there. I think that's the biggest impact on polyurethane. We'll continue to move more of those intermediates to downstream systems because we can work with the end-use customers to make finished products that really give them an advantage in their products and ability to capture higher value. And that's what we want to do long term, whether that's coatings, taking monomers into coatings or taking polyurethane intermediates into systems or taking more of our plastics into higher grade materials for packaging, health and hygiene, siloxanes into silicones, that's a consistent strategy. We're going to continue to do that across the board."

So our target headcount for the new Dow, once we completed all of our streamlining -- and really to do this, we had done external benchmarking with the best of the best. Our idea was to be best in class competitive, was to get to a headcount of 37,000 globally. And we will be there at the end of this year. In fact, we've accelerated some of those moves that we've planned through the year. We've accelerated some of those. And so that's why you see cost synergy savings coming out in advance of what we've said. We always continue to take a look at that. Headcount is part of our fixed cost, but it is only a fraction of it. So when you get to the number of sites that we have around the world, you also have to look at contractual relationships, services and other things that we do. So there's a heavy emphasis right now in manufacturing, engineering and all of that. Peter Holicki and his team are obviously looking at what does the future Dow need to look like in terms of footprint. And where we have opportunities to consolidate we are doing that. 
And then the rest of this $600 million of savings we got to come out through this year is really getting after footprint consolidation, I would say, outside of manufacturing into things like getting lab consolidations done, which we've done a lot of this year, for example, in Europe and here in North America, office buildings and other things. So we are making good progress on that, and we keep doing that. We were fortunate that we were already in this mode coming out of the spin so that we have the machine moving. And we could go in at the beginning of the second quarter and say this is going to be a tough quarter. We got to keep the pressure on. So we did put some incremental targets in front of them. And then on top of that, we're going to put the CapEx numbers down there. And we'll get them down to $2 billion this year. And if it gets worse, I don't expect it's going to get recessionary, but if it gets into that kind of frame, we still have room to move."

And finally, Jim will provide a progress update on Dow's cost and growth targets and then close with a discussion on our forward-looking views. Following that, there will be plenty of time for your questions. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim."

Starting on Slide 3, our results in the third quarter demonstrate the Dow team's focus on managing the levers within our control while also making progress against our operational, financial and strategic priorities that we laid out for the new Dow at our Investor Day last year. 
At that time, we presented a clear set of priorities and targets along with a playbook to drive our execution. Since then, we have been diligently delivering on that plan. 
In the third quarter, we achieved top line performance that was in line with our guidance and bottom line results that exceeded expectation. In doing so, we delivered strong improvements from Q2 to Q3 across the board, EBIT margin, earnings and free cash flow. Here are some other notable highlights from our results. 
First, we continue to capture demand growth, particularly in sectors closer to the consumer where conditions remain favorable. Excluding hydrocarbons and energy, Dow's volume rose by 1% in the quarter led by consumer growth at packaging, polyurethanes and silicones application. 
Second, we grew earnings and margins sequentially, led by our plastics franchise. We leveraged our industry-leading feedstock flexibility in the United States and Europe. 
In Europe, we capitalized on the OPG advantage versus Napa. And on the U.S. Gulf Coast, we paid full use of new butane capabilities that we put in place earlier this year. And we successfully achieved 0 Naphtha cracking this quarter, expanding our flexibility and avoiding an otherwise costly feedstock penalty. 
Additionally, we focused on recapturing price, a key improvement toward the end of the quarter in polyethylene. Third, we continue to drive down our cost structure. We reached a significant milestone in the quarter, successfully completing our $1.365 billion cost synergy program. Furthermore, we removed another $40 million of stranded cost in the quarter. And fourth, our results this quarter showed the ability of Dow's portfolio to generate strong cash flow. We generated $1.8 billion in cash flow from continuing operation and $1.3 billion in free cash flow. 
We improved our earnings to cash flow conversion as well as working capital improvements provided to source of cash. The cash flow story this quarter is a noteworthy highlight, and Howard will unpack this later in the call. We accomplished all of this while navigating a business environment with limited visibility and while overcoming operational limitations in Argentina, where both of our crackers were down through the third quarter following a countrywide power outage in late June. 
And finally, we made important progress in our litigation with Nova Chemical and in our deleveraging priorities. In September, a judgment was entered in Alberta, Canada ordering Nova Chemicals to pay Dow approximately $1.1 billion. On October 10, Dow received the related cash payment of approximately $800 million. Subsequently, we issued him a may call for the full redemption of $1.25 billion of notes due in 2021, further reducing debt. This was another important step forward in strengthening our financial profile. 
Altogether, our results demonstrate the strengths of the Dow portfolio and our continued focus on executing the operational, financial and strategic playbook that we laid out 1 year ago. Now moving on to our segment results and the business performance in the quarter. 
On Slide 4, Packaging & Specialty Plastics expanded operating EBIT margin nearly 200 basis points year-over-year. Our results reflect the demand growth in packaging application, margin expansion, cost synergies and contributions from new capacity on the U.S. Gulf Coast, which more than offset lower equity earnings. And notably, on a sequential basis, EBIT grew 4% and operating EBIT margin expanded 100 basis point. 
Further, the results are particularly notable considering that the segment overcame a $100 million headwind from a combination of lost ethylene production and repair costs in Argentina. Our 2 crackers there are now back up and running. 
In the third quarter, we saw a continuation of solid demand in packaging application. The Packaging & Specialty Plastics business grew volume by 4% year-over-year. We again saw growth in Industrial & Consumer Packaging, Flexible Food & Specialty Packaging and Health and Hygiene application. 
Regionally, volume growth this quarter was led by Asia-Pacific and EMEA. And Hydrocarbons & Energy, the business reported both lower volume and local price. The volume declines are an outcome of our drive for lighter fleet slates in Europe, which led to lower coal product production volume. In addition, we had slightly lower merchant ethylene sales in the United States as a result of enhanced ethylene integration enabled by our new derivative capacity. 
On Slide 5, Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure operating EBIT decline versus the year ago period primarily due to margin compression in the polyurethanes component and MEG as well as lower demand in industrial end market. 
In Industrial Solutions, volume declined modestly as a result of lower demand in energy, agriculture and automotive end market. This was partly offset by growth in catalyst application and demand in Parma in end market. The business reported a significant drop in its equity earnings driven by margin compression for MEG at our Kuwait joint ventures. 
Polyurethanes and construction chemical sales declined on lower local pricing in all region led by lower components prices. However, the business achieved volume growth driven by gains in the United States and Canada on improved MDI supply year-over-year as well as continued demand growth in polyurethanes systems. 
Our growth in systems reflects the business' focus on driving its downstream agenda and moving the portfolio from margin component sales to higher value formulated system. It has been a multiyear journey and the progress we've made so far has been impressive. This quarter marked the 25th consecutive quarter of year-over-year volume growth for the systems business. 
And finally, on Slide 6. Performance Materials & Coatings operating EBIT fell from the year ago period primarily due to siloxanes' margin compression and lower demand in coatings and monomers. Consumer solutions sales decline as volume gains in Asia-Pacific and the U.S. and Canada were more than offset by local price declines in all region mainly driven by lower siloxanes prices. The business reported volume growth in infrastructure end markets and improved demand for siloxanes in Asia-Pacific. This was offset partly offset by soft demand in the automotive and consumer electronics end market. 
Coatings & Performance Monomers reported on volume decline. On the coatings side, the business lower demand in the U.S. and Canada and architectural coding and supplement in Asia-Pacific in industrial coatings end market. 
I'll now turn it over to Howard to discuss our financial performance in the quarter, modeling guidance and the progress that we made against some of our key financial targets."

The decline was primarily driven by lower local pricing. Volume declined 2% year-over-year. This was largely driven by changes in Hydrocarbons & Energy related to our cracker feedslates combined with lower ethylene trade sales volume. 
Excluding Hydrocarbons & Energy, volume was up 1% versus a year ago period driven by growth in packaging, polyurethanes and silicones applications. Sequentially, demand was higher in Packaging & Specialty Plastics and in Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure. 
Local price declined 12%, primarily due to decreases and lower global energy prices year-over-year. Currency decreased sales by 1% as a result of strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro. The earnings impact of currency was offset by year-over-year tailwinds from the lower tax rate and reduced interest expense. 
Equity losses were $44 million, a year-over-year headwind of nearly $180 million. The decrease was primarily due to lower results at the Kuwait joint ventures driven by margin compression in MEG and polyethylene. Equity losses at Sadara also increased primarily due to the impact of a third-party industrial gas supplier issue, which has since been resolved. 
In the appendix of our earnings deck, we have included our additional disclosure for our 3 principal joint ventures, which provides further details on their results. 
Overall, operating EBIT was $1.1 billion. Tailwinds in the quarter included savings from cost synergies and stranded cost removal as well as contributions from new capacity in U.S. Gulf Coast. These gains, more than offset by a year-over-year margin compression in siloxanes and isocyanates, lower equity earnings and the impact from the Argentina outage. 
On a sequential basis, operating EBIT rose 5% or nearly $60 million, representing our first sequential EBIT increase in more than a year. Our operating EBIT margin also expanded 80 basis points led by margin expansion in Packaging & Specialty Plastics. 
We generated $1.8 billion of cash from continuing operations, which reflected a reduced headwind from integration and separation spending and the $700 million release of cash from working capital. Relative to the year ago period, our cash from continuing operations was up $1.6 billion. Let's recall that we made a voluntary pension contribution last year of $1.1 billion. After adjusting for this, the underlying operation delivered a $500 million increase in cash flow versus the same quarter last year. 
And finally, we returned $600 million to our owners in the quarter, including $500 million of paid dividends and $100 million of share repurchases. Since then, we have completed $400 million of share repurchases and we remain on track to achieve our target of $500 million for the year. 
Moving to Slide 8 in our modeling guidance for the fourth quarter. As we have for the past couple of quarters, we're again providing our segment guidance on a sequential basis to reflect the most relevant comparison in today's environment. At the total Dow level, we see 4 EBIT tailwinds sequentially as headwinds from normal fourth quarter seasonality in coatings and infrastructure markets and modest impacts from turnarounds are offset by nearly $150 million of add-backs from onetime events in the third quarter, including the impact of our outage in Argentina. 
In Performance Materials & Coatings, we expect siloxanes pricing to remain at/or above the same level as we exited the third quarter. In coatings and monomers, we expect to see the normal seasonal reduction in profitability and the business will also absorb 1/3 of the impact from our planned ADH turnaround that is currently underway. 
Moving to Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure. This segment will absorb the remainder of the ADH turnaround impact and energy prices on average are projected be similar to the third quarter. 
And finally, in the Packaging & Specialty Plastics segment, we see feedstock price trends continuing to drive a lighter cracker feedslates in the U.S. and Europe, which will continue to reduce our top line sales of core products. We expect the modest sequential headwind as we complete a large turnaround in the Netherlands, and we anticipate reduced catalase and licensing earnings in the quarter, which by their nature are lumpy. On the positive side, our Argentina assets are now back online so they will once again be positively contributing to our results. 
Turning to Slide 9. There are 2 areas where I'd like to highlight the progress we've made against our financial targets. The first is our capital structure, specifically the deleveraging and liability management we've done this year. As you'll recall from our Investor Day last year, we outlined our capital structure priorities and are deleveraging targets. And as you see on this slide, we have been delivering on our plan, making significant progress in improving and smoothing our debt maturity profile and maintaining our liquidity position. 
We have opportunistically refinanced upcoming maturities and we secured the option to extend the outstanding $2 billion in our term loan by an additional 2 years to the second half of 2023. So far this year, we have completed $2 billion of gross deleveraging. And with our recent $1.25 billion debt redemption announcement, which was supported by the cash proceeds we received from Nova, we will complete more than $3 billion of gross deleveraging by the end of this year. 
The result of these actions is that we do not have a significant debt maturity due until 2022 and we have maintained our strong liquidity position, which is more than $10 billion. These accomplishments align to the financial priorities we outlined a year ago, maintaining a strong capital structure, reducing risk, lowering interest expense and preserving our financial strength and flexibility. 
Moving to Slide 10. The second financial highlight is the progress we have made in our cash flow generation and the potential we see to improve further from here. Looking at the trailing 12 months, we have delivered $3.2 billion of free cash flow. While our results do not yet fully reflect our underlying potential, the recent for is, as we highlighted at the start of the year, is that we had short term cash headwinds from 2 discrete factors: Post-spin integration separation activities and interest expense. 
On both front, peak spending is behind us. Through the third quarter, we have spent more than $1 billion on integration and separation spending in 2019 and we expect a full year spend to be in the range of $1.2 billion, in line with our target for the year. This spending is beginning to recede. And looking ahead, we expect the 2020 cash spend to be in the range of $200 million to $300 million or a year-over-year release of cash of about $1 billion. 
And on interest expense, as I highlighted, we have accomplished a substantial amount of deleveraging and liability management. This has put us in a position today where we see our 2020 run rate interest expense being $100 million lower than where we started in 2019. These 2 factors alone represent more than $1 billion of cash flow uplift in 2020 that are completely within our control and independent of market conditions. 
We also continue to pursue nonoperational cash inflows. Notably, the additional litigation we have pending with Nova and our teams continue to also focus on operational improvements such as greater working capital efficiency. These improvements will not only boost gross cash flow, which it also leaves our earnings to cash conversion. 
Our focus on cash is paying off. And all other things equal, our free cash flow was poised to expand. This additional flexing ability preserve our ability to deliver against our financial priorities, including our strong shareholder returns and further deleveraging. 
Now I'd like to hand it back to Jim to discuss our progress in our cost and growth priorities as well as our near-term outlook."
9830660,640465857,1837972,"Dow Inc., Q3 2019 Earnings Call, Oct 24, 2019",2019-10-24,"Earnings Calls","Dow Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Howard. Turning to Slide 11. I'll start with our cost out priorities. The progress we've made on our cost reductions has been proceeding faster than we planned.

The progress we've made on our cost reductions has been proceeding faster than we planned. 
In the third quarter, we successfully completed our $1.365 billion cost synergy program, which we finished about 1 to 2 quarters ahead of schedule. On the stranded cost removal side, we eliminated an additional $40 million and have already exceeded $125 million in cumulative saving. 
Just before our spin, we laid out a target to deliver $600 million of our remaining $800 million of cost synergy savings and stranded cost removal in 2019. Based on the progress we've made during the third quarter, we now expect to deliver approximately $700 million of savings this year with the remaining $100 million to be realized in the first half of 2020. 
The Dow team has done excellent job in putting together a robust cost out plan that identifies, delivers and tracks these savings, and they have kept at that focus for more than 2 years to ensure our steady delivery against our target. 
Turning to Slide 12 and perhaps what I'm most proud of is that the Dow story has not only been about cost, but we've also continued to drive several high return growth projects. 
A year ago, we told you that the new Dow has a well-defined growth road map that includes a robust pipeline of attractive investment, projects that are lower risk, faster payback, lower capital intensity and higher return on invested capital. As the macro environment change, we quickly adjusted our capital spending target for the year to $2 billion and we intensified our criteria for approving and advancing projects. 
In the third quarter alone, we advanced several projects. We announced the retrofit of one of our crackers in Louisiana with our proprietary fluidized catalytic dehydrogenation technology to produce on purpose propylene. We see the SCDH technology as a game-changer for the industry. It promises reduced capital intensity, lower energy usage and lower greenhouse gas emission. SCDH not only drives returns on invested capital benefit, but it also advances our sustainability agenda when compared to all conventional PDH technology. 
We launched Agility CE, a new resin made with 70% postconsumer recycled plastics, which incorporates recycled plastics shrink found into low density polyethylene. We also announced 2 partnerships to showcase circular economy solutions for plastics. 
The Phoenix agreement allows Dow to incorporate recycled plastic waste back into our feedstock supply. And second, the UPM biofuels technology enables plastic solutions made from bio-based renewable feedstock. Both solutions reduce carbon emission without impacting the performance of our final products. 
In our silicones franchise, we continued to greenlight incremental debottlenecks. Through the third quarter, we have completed 14 of the 18 downstream capacity expansions that we plan for this year. We reached the final investment decision for our previously announced flexible [indiscernible] capacity to support our customers' growth in infrastructure and home and personal care end market. This U.S. Gulf Coast unit is expected to start up by the end of 2021. And furthermore, we recently signed a 10-year supply agreement with a key customer securing the baseload volume for this facility, representing $900 million of new revenue over the life of the contract. 
And on the digital front, we launched the new dow.com, featuring expanded e-commerce platform. Year-to-date, we have already achieved nearly $3 billion of sales through this channel and we're just getting started. These are just a few of the investments that we believe will fuel our growth, deliver productivity improvements, enhance customer experience and further drive it toward our sustainability goals. 
Turning to our market outlook on Slide 13. As we look around the globe key commodity products, our view is that in many cases, the margins for high cost producers has substantially been bouncing around the breakeven point for at least the past 2 quarters. 
On this side, we showcase a few prime examples. In MEG, Asian spot spreads have been at/or slightly below the breakeven point for most of the year and there have been reports over the past 2 quarters of high cost producers dialing back production. In MDI, we see spreads in Asia bouncing around the historic low point. And in ethylene, the high cost producer margins has been and projected to go to 0 while the ethylene margin for producers in the Americas remains healthy. 
Our base case remains that the global economy will continue growing albeit at a slower pace. In that scenario, based on historical spreads in our products change, we see a floor to further margin deterioration and a good upside to normalized levels when fundamentals tighten. 
In this environment, Dow remains well positioned, thanks to our competitive positions on the cost curve driven by our feedstock flexibility, our scale and significant presence in lower cost region such as Canada, Argentina and the U.S. Gulf Coast. 
To sum it up on Slide 14, 2019 has been our year to successfully reintroduce more focused, more streamlined Dow, execute our playbook and showcase our financial and capital discipline. We believe the results of our actions will continue to show in our earnings, deliver enhanced cash flows and preserve our financial strength. 
As you've seen from us all year and especially in the third quarter, we are delivering as we promised. And as we look to the near-term future, our mindset does not change. The current business environment demands discipline, and that is why we'll continue to leverage our feedstock flexibility, advance our low-risk, high-return growth investments while staying in line with our $2 billion capital expenditure target this year and continue driving on best-in-class, reduced cost structure by delivering the remaining branded cost removal. 
In sum, the steps that we're taking today position us well to leverage increased value when the industrial economy rebound. Now I'll turn it back to Neal to open the Q&A."

So that wasn't the real drag on Sadara in the third quarter. The bigger drag was we had industrial gas supplier that supplies into the complex that really had an outage that really cost us on the range of $25 million, $30 million on Sadara EBITDA, and I think that's the bigger impact. Sadara's running well right now. I don't see any long-term issue from that and really good cooperation and response from Aramco, really solid response."

I think what we've tried to do in 2019 is to prepare ourselves and get ourselves on solid financial footing as a new company, and I believe we've done that. We had to get the cost out. We had to get our balance sheet in the right space. We had to make sure that, that industry-leading that we put out there was protected, and I believe that we've done that. 
I think we position ourselves well for an upturn of an industrial economy. The consumer side of the business is doing great and high-return projects that we've got for growth are really playing into that. So we don't have a demand problem right now. There's a little bit of supply/demand imbalance that we're working through on those commodities, and that's driven primarily by a slower industrial economy. 
We see strong growth in Asia. So we're up double digits out there. We see good growth around the world. And with a little rebound in the industrial economy, you're going to see a demand pull on the chain that we haven't seen for 4 consecutive quarters. When that happens, I think you're going to see margin expansion and things are going to start to move up. Oil goes up a little bit. And you see the industrial economy come back, that typically pulls oil price up. That would help, too."

As it gives us another range of flexibility that we didn't have. And that was important this quarter because ethane was really low and also propane was low in the quarter. 
Propane being low meant we crack pretty aggressively LPGs in Europe, and we think we will continue to do that through fourth quarter and first quarter into next year and sometimes in the wintertime if gas prices tick up, you would see that might be limited a little bit. But the outlook for gas as we go into this winter and the inventories and the current prices mean that we're going to be cracking LPGs. 
I don't know if the changes that we have on cracking 0 Naphtha in the Gulf Coast is going to have a big impact on Naphtha cost to everyone else. I would say that in Asia, the Naphtha crackers today are at above breakeven margins. And they've been there for -- especially the fourth quartile producers have been there for the last couple of quarters. So I think that pressure is going to continue even if naphtha goes down.

The consumer side has been continuing to perform well. And so I think with some of the pressures that are on in that industrial side, that's really been the thing that slowed the overall growth. And you're coming off a very, very strong 2018. And so I think you're going to continue to see that there's good balance in the supply/demand going forward. I don't think there's any reason to think there's been a fundamental change in the 1.4x GDP. Our outlook for GDP next year is still around 3% globally. And so I believe that you're going to continue to see about 4%, 4.5% type of growth rates out of polyethylene."

But on the upstream side, when you get into areas of big volume use like, for example, large commercial buildings, big industrial build, some of that has slowed down and taken a little bit of pressure off of siloxanes. There's no new capacity coming on in siloxanes. We're working off a lot of capacity that got added in China over the last couple of years. And I think there's nothing on the horizon for the next 2 or 3 years in the siloxanes space. So it should continue to tighten from here if the industrial economy picks up a bit and the building construction picks up a bit, I think you'll see that full tighten things up."

I think the real thing that's changed here is your starting to get a sense that the pressure on the consumer goods companies from the consumer's would indicate there's probably a change in people's willingness to pay for a more recyclable or sustainable product. And so I think that is probably the more important question than the cost of this versus Virgin plastics from virgin natural gas liquids are another feedstock. 
If it was more competitive, that would have already been done. But the reality is there are pressures out there and their arguments to go to a circular economy and there seems to be a growing consumer base that's willing to pay for that. Now we just have to work out what the value chain looks like. 
The second thing on the consumer side is we have a waste problem, which none of us have our heads in the sand about. We have a plastic waste issue that needs to be resolved. And in order to drive that circular economy, we got to come up with a way to value the plastic waste so that it can come back into the feedstock supply. And that's probably the bigger challenge. I think we will come up with a way to do it. I think everybody in the value chain that's part of the alliance that we put together is trying to figure that out. But that's going to require some time and some things for us to work through. 
Meanwhile, the size of these projects that I'm talking about are going to help us learn more about what the cost positions are, are going to help us learn more about what the customer acceptance is going to be for these products and what the price point for that will be. And I think in another year or so, I have a better answer for you on what the relative values are."

Starting on Slide 3, our results in the third quarter demonstrate the Dow team's focus on managing the levers within our control while also making progress against our operational, financial",1106,"Thanks, Neal, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. Starting on Slide 3, our results in the third quarter demonstrate the Dow team's focus on managing the levers within our control while also making progress against our operational, financial and strategic priorities that we laid out for the new Dow at our Investor Day last year. At that time, we presented a clear set of priorities and targets along with a playbook to drive our execution. Since then, we have been diligently delivering on that plan. 
In the third quarter, we achieved top line performance that was in line with our guidance and bottom line results that exceeded expectations. In doing so, we delivered strong improvements from Q2 to Q3 across the board, EBIT margin, earnings and free cash flow. Here are some other notable highlights from our results. 
First, we continue to capture demand growth, particularly in sectors closer to the consumer where conditions remain favorable. Excluding Hydrocarbons & Energy, Dow's volume rose by 1% in the quarter led by consumer growth in packaging, polyurethanes and silicones application. 
Second, we grew earnings and margins sequentially, led by our plastics franchise. We leveraged our industry-leading feedstock flexibility in the United States and Europe. In Europe, we capitalized on the LPG advantage versus naphtha. And on the U.S. Gulf Coast, we made full use of new butane capabilities that we put in place earlier this year. And we successfully achieved 0 naphtha cracking this quarter, expanding our flexibility and avoiding an otherwise costly feedstock penalty. Additionally, we focused on recapturing price, a key improvement toward the end of the quarter in polyethylene. 
Third, we continued to drive down our cost structure. We reached a significant milestone in the quarter, successfully completing our $1.365 billion cost synergy program. Furthermore, we removed another $40 million of stranded cost in the quarter. 
And fourth, our results this quarter showed the ability of Dow's portfolio to generate strong cash flow. We generated $1.8 billion in cash flow from continuing operations and $1.3 billion in free cash flow. We improved our earnings to cash flow conversion as well as working capital improvements provided a source of cash. The cash flow story this quarter is a noteworthy highlight and Howard will unpack this later in the call. We accomplished all of this while navigating a business environment with limited visibility and while overcoming operational limitations in Argentina, where both of our crackers were down through the third quarter following a countrywide power outage in late June. 
And finally, we made important progress in our litigation with Nova Chemicals and in our deleveraging priorities. In September, a judgment was entered in Alberta, Canada ordering Nova Chemicals to pay Dow approximately $1.1 billion. On October 10, Dow received the related cash payment of approximately $800 million. Subsequently, we issued a make whole call for the full redemption of $1.25 billion of notes due in 2021, further reducing debt. This was another important step forward in strengthening our financial profile. 
Altogether, our results demonstrate the strengths of the Dow portfolio and our continued focus on executing the operational, financial and strategic playbook that we laid out a year ago. Now moving on to our segment results and the business performance in the quarter. 
On Slide 4, Packaging & Specialty Plastics expanded operating EBIT margin nearly 200 basis points year-over-year. Our results reflected demand growth in packaging applications, margin expansion, cost synergies and contributions from new capacity on the U.S. Gulf Coast which more than offset lower equity earnings. And notably on a sequential basis, EBIT grew 4% and operating EBIT margin expanded 100 basis points. Further, the results are particularly notable considering that the segment overcame a $100 million headwind from a combination of lost ethylene production and repair costs in Argentina. Our 2 crackers there are now back up and running. 
In the third quarter, we saw a continuation of solid demand in packaging application. The Packaging & Specialty Plastics business grew volume by 4% year-over-year. We again saw growth in Industrial & Consumer Packaging, Flexible Food & Specialty Packaging and health and hygiene application. Regionally, volume growth this quarter was led by Asia-Pacific and EMEAI. In Hydrocarbons & Energy, the business reported both lower volume and local price. The volume declines were an outcome of our drive for lighter feedslates in Europe which led to lower coproduct production volume. In addition, we had slightly lower merchant ethylene sales in the United States as a result of enhanced ethylene integration enabled by our new derivative capacity. 
On Slide 5, Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure operating EBIT decline versus the year-ago period primarily due to margin compression in the polyurethanes component and MEG as well as lower demand in industrial end markets. 
In Industrial Solutions, volume declined modestly as a result of lower demand in energy, agriculture and automotive end markets. This was partly offset by growth in catalyst application and demand in pharma end market. The business reported a significant drop in its equity earnings driven by margin compression for MEG at our Kuwait joint ventures. 
Polyurethanes & Construction Chemicals sales declined on lower local pricing in all regions led by lower components prices. However, the business achieved volume growth driven by gains in the United States and Canada on improved MDI supply year-over-year as well as continued demand growth in polyurethane systems. 
Our growth in Systems reflects the business' focus on driving its downstream agenda and moving the portfolio from merchant component sales to higher-value formulated systems. It has been a multiyear journey and the progress we've made so far has been impressive. This quarter marked the 25th consecutive quarter of year-over-year volume growth for the Systems business. 
And finally on Slide 6. Performance Materials & Coatings operating EBIT fell from the year-ago period primarily due to siloxanes margin compression and lower demand in coatings and monomers. 
Consumer Solutions sales declined as volume gains in Asia-Pacific and the U.S. and Canada were more than offset by local price declines in all regions mainly driven by lower siloxanes prices. The business reported volume growth in infrastructure end markets and improved demand for siloxanes in Asia-Pacific. This was partly offset by soft demand in the automotive and consumer electronics end markets. 
Coatings & Performance Monomers reported a volume decline. On the coatings side, the business saw lower demand in the U.S. and Canada in architectural coating and soft demand in Asia-Pacific in industrial coatings end markets. 
I'll now turn it over to Howard to discuss our financial performance in the quarter, modeling guidance and the progress that we made against some of our key financial targets."

The decline was primarily driven by lower local pricing. Volume declined 2% year-over-year. This was largely driven by changes in Hydrocarbons & Energy related to our cracker feedslates combined with lower ethylene trade sales volume. Excluding Hydrocarbons & Energy, volume was up 1% versus the year-ago period driven by growth in packaging, polyurethanes and silicones applications. 
Sequentially, demand was higher in Packaging & Specialty Plastics and in Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure. Local price declined 12% primarily due to decreases in lower global energy prices year-over-year. Currency decreased sales by 1% as a result of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro. The earnings impact of currency was offset by year-over-year tailwinds from a lower tax rate and reduced interest expense. 
Equity losses were $44 million, a year-over-year headwind of nearly $180 million. The decrease was primarily due to lower results at the Kuwait joint ventures driven by margin compression in MEG and polyethylene. Equity losses at Sadara also increased primarily due to the impact of a third-party industrial gas supplier issue which has since been resolved. In the appendix of our earnings deck, we have included our additional disclosure for our 3 principal joint ventures which provides further details on their results. 
Overall, operating EBIT was $1.1 billion. Tailwinds in the quarter included savings from cost synergies and stranded cost removal as well as contributions from new capacity on the U.S. Gulf Coast. These gains were more than offset by a year-over-year margin compression in siloxanes and isocyanates, lower equity earnings and the impact from the Argentina outage. On a sequential basis, operating EBIT rose 5% or nearly $60 million, representing our first sequential EBIT increase in more than a year. Our operating EBIT margin also expanded 80 basis points led by margin expansion in Packaging & Specialty Plastics. 
We generated $1.8 billion of cash from continuing operations which reflected a reduced headwind from integration and separation spending and a $700 million release of cash from working capital. Relative to the year-ago period, our cash from continuing operations was up $1.6 billion. But recall that we made a voluntary pension contribution last year of $1.1 billion. After adjusting for this, the underlying operation delivered a $500 million increase in cash flow versus the same quarter last year. 
And finally, we returned $600 million to our owners in the quarter, including $500 million of paid dividends and $100 million of share repurchases. Since spin, we have completed $400 million of share repurchases and we remain on track to achieve our target of $500 million for the year. 
Moving to Slide 8 and our modeling guidance for the fourth quarter. As we have for the past couple of quarters, we're again providing our segment guidance on a sequential basis to reflect the most relevant comparison in today's environment. At the total Dow level, we see core EBIT tailwinds sequentially as headwinds from normal fourth quarter seasonality in coatings and infrastructure markets and modest impacts from turnarounds are offset by nearly $150 million of add-backs from onetime events in the third quarter, including the impact of our outage in Argentina. 
In Performance Materials & Coatings, we expect siloxanes pricing to remain at about the same level as we exited the third quarter. In coatings and monomers, we expect to see the normal seasonal reduction in profitability and the business will also absorb 1/3 of the impact from our planned PDH turnaround that is currently underway. 
Moving to Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure. This segment will absorb the remainder of the PDH turnaround impact, and MEG prices on average are projected to be similar to the third quarter. 
And finally, in the Packaging & Specialty Plastics segment, we see feedstock price trends continuing to drive lighter cracker feedslates in the U.S. and Europe which will continue to reduce our top line sales of coproducts. We expect a modest sequential headwind as we complete a large turnaround in The Netherlands, and we anticipate reduced catalyst and licensing earnings in the quarter, which by their nature are lumpy. On the positive side, our Argentina assets are now back online so they will once again be positively contributing to our results. 
Turning to Slide 9. There are 2 areas where I'd like to highlight the progress we've made against our financial targets. The first is our capital structure, specifically the deleveraging and liability management we've done this year. As you'll recall from our Investor Day last year, we outlined our capital structure priorities and our deleveraging targets. 
And as you see on this slide, we have been delivering on our plan, making significant progress in improving and smoothing our debt maturity profile and maintaining our liquidity position. We have opportunistically refinanced upcoming maturities and we secured the option to extend the outstanding $2 billion on our term loan by an additional 2 years to the second half of 2023. So far this year, we have completed $2 billion of gross deleveraging. And with our recent $1.25 billion debt redemption announcement which was supported by the cash proceeds we received from Nova, we will complete more than $3 billion of gross deleveraging by the end of this year. 
The result of these actions is that we do not have a significant debt maturity due until 2022 and we have maintained our strong liquidity position, which is more than $10 billion. These accomplishments align to the financial priorities we outlined a year ago: Maintaining a strong capital structure, reducing risk, lowering interest expense and preserving our financial strength and flexibility. 
Moving to Slide 10. The second financial highlight is the progress we have made in our cash flow generation and the potential we see to improve further from here. Looking at the trailing 12 months, we have delivered $3.2 billion of free cash flow, but our results do not yet fully reflect our underlying potential. The reason for this, as we highlighted at the start of the year, is that we have had short-term cash headwinds from 2 discrete factors: Post-spin integration and separation activities and interest expense. On both fronts, peak spending is behind us. 
Through the third quarter, we have spent more than $1 billion on integration and separation spending in 2019 and we expect the full year spend to be in the range of $1.2 billion, in line with our target for the year. This spending is beginning to recede. And looking ahead, we expect the 2020 cash spend to be in the range of $200 million to $300 million or a year-over-year release of cash of about $1 billion. 
And on interest expense, as I highlighted, we have accomplished a substantial amount of deleveraging and liability management. This has put us in a position today where we see our 2020 run rate interest expense being $100 million lower than where we started in 2019. These 2 factors alone represent more than $1 billion of cash flow uplift in 2020 that are completely within our control and independent of market conditions. 
We also continue to pursue nonoperational cash inflows, notably the additional litigation we have pending with Nova, and our teams continue to also focus on operational improvements such as greater working capital efficiency. These improvements will not only boost gross cash flow but should also lift our earnings to cash conversion. 
Our focus on cash is paying off, and all other things equal, our free cash flow is poised to expand. This additional flexibility preserves our ability to deliver against our financial priorities, including our strong shareholder returns and further deleveraging. 
Now I'd like to hand it back to Jim to discuss our progress on our cost and growth priorities as well as our near-term outlook."
9830660,640465857,1838203,"Dow Inc., Q3 2019 Earnings Call, Oct 24, 2019",2019-10-24,"Earnings Calls","Dow Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Howard. Turning to Slide 11. I'll start with our cost-out priorities. The progress we've made on our cost reductions has been proceeding faster than we planned. In the third quarter, we successfully completed our $1.365 billion cost synergy prog",975,"Thanks, Howard. Turning to Slide 11. I'll start with our cost-out priorities. 
The progress we've made on our cost reductions has been proceeding faster than we planned. In the third quarter, we successfully completed our $1.365 billion cost synergy program which we finished about 1 to 2 quarters ahead of schedule. On the stranded cost removal side, we eliminated an additional $40 million and have already exceeded $125 million in cumulative savings. 
Just before our spin, we laid out a target to deliver $600 million of our remaining $800 million of cost synergy savings and stranded cost removal in 2019. Based on the progress we've made through the third quarter, we now expect to deliver approximately $700 million of savings this year with the remaining $100 million to be realized in the first half of 2020. The Dow team has done an excellent job in putting together a robust cost-out plan that identifies, delivers and tracks these savings, and they have kept up that focus for more than 2 years to ensure our steady delivery against our target. 
Turning to Slide 12 and perhaps what I'm most proud of is that the Dow story has not only been about cost, but we've also continued to drive several high-return growth projects. A year ago, we told you that the new Dow has a well-defined growth roadmap that includes a robust pipeline of attractive investment -- projects that are lower-risk, faster-payback, lower capital intensity and higher return on invested capital. As the macro environment changed, we quickly adjusted our capital spending target for the year to $2 billion and we intensified our criteria for approving and advancing projects. 
In the third quarter alone, we advanced several projects. We announced the retrofit of one of our crackers in Louisiana with our proprietary fluidized catalytic dehydrogenation technology to produce on-purpose propylene. We see the FCDh technology as a game-changer for the industry. It promises reduced capital intensity, lower energy usage and lower greenhouse gas emission. FCDh not only drives return on invested capital benefits but it also advances our sustainability agenda when compared to all conventional PDH technologies. 
We launched AGILITY CE, a new resin made with 70% post-consumer recycled plastics, which incorporates recycled plastic shrink found into low-density polyethylene. 
We also announced 2 partnerships that showcase circular economy solutions for plastics: The Fuenix agreement allows Dow to incorporate recycled plastic waste back into our feedstock supply; and second, the UPM Biofuels technology enables plastic solutions made from bio-based renewable feedstock. Both solutions reduce carbon emission without impacting the performance of our final products. 
In our silicones franchise, we continued to greenlight incremental debottlenecks. Through the third quarter, we have completed 14 of the 18 downstream capacity expansions that we planned for this year. We reached the final investment decision for our previously announced flexible alkoxylation capacity to support our customers' growth in infrastructure and home and personal care end markets. This U.S. Gulf Coast unit is expected to start up by the end of 2021. And furthermore, we recently signed a 10-year supply agreement with a key customer, securing the baseload volume for this facility, representing $900 million of new revenue over the life of the contract. 
And on the digital front, we launched a new Dow.com, featuring an expanded e-commerce platform. Year-to-date, we have already achieved nearly $3 billion of sales through this channel and we're just getting started. These are just a few of the investments that we believe will fuel our growth, deliver productivity improvements, enhance customer experience and further drive us toward our sustainability goals. 
Turning to our market outlook on Slide 13. As we look around the globe at key commodity products, our view is that in many cases, the margins for high-cost producers has essentially been bouncing around the breakeven point for at least the past 2 quarters. On this slide, we showcase a few prime examples. In MEG, Asian spot spreads have been at or slightly below the breakeven point for most of the year. And there have been reports over the past 2 quarters of high-cost producers dialing back production. In MDI, we see spreads in Asia bouncing around the historic low point. And in ethylene, the high-cost producer margins are thin and projected to go to 0 while the ethylene margin for producers in the Americas remains healthy. 
Our base case remains that the global economy will continue growing albeit at a slower pace. In that scenario, based on historical spreads in our products' chains, we see a floor to further margin deterioration and a good upside to normalized levels when fundamentals tighten. In this environment, Dow remains well positioned thanks to our competitive positions on the cost curve driven by our feedstock flexibility, our scale and significant presence in lower-cost regions such as Canada, Argentina and the U.S. Gulf Coast. 
To sum it up on Slide 14, 2019 has been our year to successfully reintroduce a more focused, more streamlined Dow, execute our playbook and showcase our financial and capital discipline. We believe the results of our actions will continue to show in our earnings, deliver enhanced cash flows and preserve our financial strength. 
As you've seen from us all year and especially in the third quarter, we are delivering as we promised. And as we look to the near-term future, our mindset does not change. The current business environment demands discipline, and that is why we'll continue to leverage our feedstock flexibility, advance our lower-risk, higher-return growth investments while staying in line with our $2 billion capital expenditure target this year and continue driving a best-in-class reduced cost structure by delivering the remaining stranded cost removal. 
In sum, the steps that we're taking today position us well to leverage increased value when the industrial economy rebounds. 
Now I'll turn it back to Neal to open the Q&A."

I would say on PE, I think the thing to take away for fourth quarter is that we ended $0.03 higher than the IHS integrated margin spreads in the third quarter. And you've got ethane prices at $0.18 roughly a gallon versus what everybody had expected to be greater than $0.40 a gallon.

With PMI really declining for the last 4 consecutive quarters, the big delta here is consumer's been really pulling all the volume growth and industrial hasn't yet. But I do think with inventories being low, I don't see any speculative activity out there. And with downstream investments like in our Systems business downstream and our silicones business, which are both continuing to hold up well, that's going to create a pull on that supply/demand balance.

We had to get our balance sheet in the right space. We had to make sure that, that industry-leading dividend that we put out there was protected. And I believe that we've done that. 
I think we've positioned ourselves well for an upturn in the industrial economy. The consumer side of the business is doing great and the high-return projects that we've got for growth are really playing into that. So we don't have a demand problem right now. There's a little bit of supply/demand imbalance that we're working through on those commodities, and that's driven primarily by a slower industrial economy. 
We see strong growth in Asia. So we're up double digits out there. We see good growth around the world. And with a little rebound in the industrial economy, you're going to see a demand pull on the chain that we haven't seen for 4 consecutive quarters. When that happens, I think you're going to see margin expansion and things are going to start to move up. Oil goes up a little bit -- and you see the industrial economy come back, that typically pulls oil price up. That would help, too."

And what that does is really it widens our feedstock flexibility, so it gives us another range of flexibility that we didn't have. And that was important this quarter because ethane was really low and also propane was low in the quarter. Propane being low meant we cracked pretty aggressively LPGs in Europe. And we think that we will continue to do that through fourth quarter and first quarter into next year. And sometimes in the wintertime, if gas prices tick up, you would see that might be limited a little bit. But the outlook for gas as we go into this winter and the inventories and the current prices mean that we're going to be cracking LPGs. 
I don't know if the change that we have on cracking 0 naphtha in the Gulf Coast is going to have a big impact on naphtha cost to everyone else. I would say that in Asia, the naphtha crackers today are at about breakeven margins. And they've been there for -- especially the fourth-quartile producers have been there for the last couple of quarters. So I think that pressure is going to continue even if naphtha goes down. Naphtha probably would move more based on what happens with oil price."

The other thing is that industrial coatings demand has been down, and we had a fair amount of industrial coatings business in China and that China industrial demand has been down. But that's I think in line with the rest of the market. 
We're continuing to work on the coatings business in terms of the business model. So you'll see that I talked about on the call, we've got a new Dow.com portal out there. One of the things we're going to be doing in coatings is taking advantage of that e-commerce capability to try to broaden out our reach into that market segment. And that's going to help us fill up some assets and get more of that coatings volume."

And so I think you're going to continue to see that there's good balance in the supply/demand going forward.

But on the upstream side, when you get into areas of big volume use, like for example large commercial buildings, big industrial builds, some of that has slowed down and taken a little bit of pressure off of siloxanes. 
There's no new capacity coming on in siloxanes. We're working off a lot of capacity that got added in China over the last couple of years. And I think there's nothing on the horizon for the next 2 or 3 years in the siloxanes space. So it should continue to tighten from here.

I think the real thing that's changed here is you're starting to get a sense that the pressure on the consumer goods companies from the consumers would indicate there's probably a change in people's willingness to pay for a more recyclable or sustainable product. And so I think that is probably the more important question than the cost of this versus virgin plastics from virgin natural gas liquids or another feedstock. If it was more competitive, it would have already been done. But the reality is there are pressures out there and there are demands to go to a circular economy and there seems to be a growing consumer base that's willing to pay for that. Now we just have to work out what the value chain looks like. 
The second thing on the consumer side is we have a waste problem which none of us have our heads in the sand about. We have a plastic waste issue that needs to be resolved. And in order to drive that circular economy, we got to come up with a way to value the plastic waste so that it can come back into that feedstock supply. And that's probably the bigger challenge. I think we will come up with a way to do it. I think everybody in the value chain that's part of the alliance that we've put together is trying to figure that out. But that's going to require some time and some things for us to work through. 
Meanwhile, the size of these projects that I'm talking about are going to help us learn more about what the cost positions are, are going to help us learn more about what the customer acceptance is going to be for these products and what the price point for that will be. And I think in another year or so, I'd have a better answer for you on what the relative values are."

Starting on Slide 3, our results in the third quarter demonstrate the Dow team's focus on managing the levers within our control while also making progress against our operational, financial",1106,"Thanks, Neal, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. Starting on Slide 3, our results in the third quarter demonstrate the Dow team's focus on managing the levers within our control while also making progress against our operational, financial and strategic priorities that we laid out for the new Dow at our Investor Day last year. At that time, we presented a clear set of priorities and targets along with a playbook to drive our execution. Since then, we have been diligently delivering on that plan. 
In the third quarter, we achieved top line performance that was in line with our guidance and bottom line results that exceeded expectations. In doing so, we delivered strong improvements from Q2 to Q3 across the board, EBIT margin, earnings and free cash flow. Here are some other notable highlights from our results. 
First, we continued to capture demand growth, particularly in sectors closer to the consumer where conditions remain favorable. Excluding Hydrocarbons & Energy, Dow's volume rose by 1% in the quarter led by consumer growth in packaging, polyurethanes and silicones application. 
Second, we grew earnings and margins sequentially, led by our plastics franchise. We leveraged our industry-leading feedstock flexibility in the United States and Europe. In Europe, we capitalized on the LPG advantage versus naphtha. And on the U.S. Gulf Coast, we made full use of new butane capabilities that we put in place earlier this year. And we successfully achieved 0 naphtha cracking this quarter, expanding our flexibility and avoiding an otherwise costly feedstock penalty. Additionally, we focused on recapturing price, a key improvement toward the end of the quarter in polyethylene. 
Third, we continued to drive down our cost structure. We reached a significant milestone in the quarter, successfully completing our $1.365 billion cost synergy program. Furthermore, we removed another $40 million of stranded costs in the quarter. 
And fourth, our results this quarter showed the ability of Dow's portfolio to generate strong cash flow. We generated $1.8 billion in cash flow from continuing operations and $1.3 billion in free cash flow. We improved our earnings to cash flow conversion as well as working capital improvements provided a source of cash. The cash flow story this quarter is a noteworthy highlight and Howard will unpack this later in the call. We accomplished all of this while navigating a business environment with limited visibility and while overcoming operational limitations in Argentina, where both of our crackers were down through the third quarter following a countrywide power outage in late June. 
And finally, we made important progress in our litigation with Nova Chemicals and in our deleveraging priorities. In September, a judgment was entered in Alberta, Canada ordering Nova Chemicals to pay Dow approximately $1.1 billion. On October 10, Dow received the related cash payment of approximately $800 million. Subsequently, we issued a make whole call for the full redemption of $1.25 billion of notes due in 2021, further reducing debt. This was another important step forward in strengthening our financial profile. 
Altogether, our results demonstrate the strengths of the Dow portfolio and our continued focus on executing the operational, financial and strategic playbook that we laid out a year ago. Now moving on to our segment results and the business performance in the quarter. 
On Slide 4, Packaging & Specialty Plastics expanded operating EBIT margin nearly 200 basis points year-over-year. Our results reflected demand growth in packaging applications, margin expansion, cost synergies and contributions from new capacity on the U.S. Gulf Coast which more than offset lower equity earnings. And notably on a sequential basis, EBIT grew 4% and operating EBIT margin expanded 100 basis points. Further, the results are particularly notable considering that the segment overcame a $100 million headwind from a combination of lost ethylene production and repair costs in Argentina. Our 2 crackers there are now back up and running. 
In the third quarter, we saw a continuation of solid demand in packaging application. The Packaging & Specialty Plastics business grew volume by 4% year-over-year. We again saw growth in Industrial & Consumer Packaging, Flexible Food & Specialty Packaging and health and hygiene application. Regionally, volume growth this quarter was led by Asia-Pacific and EMEAI. In Hydrocarbons & Energy, the business reported both lower volume and local price. The volume declines were an outcome of our drive for lighter feedslates in Europe which led to lower coproduct production volume. In addition, we had slightly lower merchant ethylene sales in the United States as a result of enhanced ethylene integration enabled by our new derivative capacity. 
On Slide 5, Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure operating EBIT decline versus the year-ago period primarily due to margin compression in the polyurethanes component and MEG as well as lower demand in industrial end markets. 
In Industrial Solutions, volume declined modestly as a result of lower demand in energy, agriculture and automotive end markets. This was partly offset by growth in catalyst application and demand in pharma end markets. The business reported a significant drop in its equity earnings driven by margin compression for MEG at our Kuwait joint ventures. 
Polyurethanes & Construction Chemicals sales declined on lower local pricing in all regions led by lower components prices. However, the business achieved volume growth driven by gains in the United States and Canada on improved MDI supply year-over-year as well as continued demand growth in polyurethane systems. 
Our growth in Systems reflects the business' focus on driving its downstream agenda and moving the portfolio from merchant component sales to higher-value formulated systems. It has been a multiyear journey and the progress we've made so far has been impressive. This quarter marked the 25th consecutive quarter of year-over-year volume growth for the Systems business. 
And finally on Slide 6. Performance Materials & Coatings operating EBIT fell from the year-ago period primarily due to siloxanes margin compression and lower demand in coatings and monomers. 
Consumer Solutions sales declined as volume gains in Asia-Pacific and the U.S. and Canada were more than offset by local price declines in all regions mainly driven by lower siloxanes prices. The business reported volume growth in infrastructure end markets and improved demand for siloxanes in Asia-Pacific. This was partly offset by soft demand in the automotive and consumer electronics end markets. 
Coatings & Performance Monomers reported a volume decline. On the coatings side, the business saw lower demand in the U.S. and Canada in architectural coating and soft demand in Asia-Pacific in industrial coatings end markets. 
I'll now turn it over to Howard to discuss our financial performance in the quarter, modeling guidance and the progress that we made against some of our key financial targets."

The decline was primarily driven by lower local pricing. Volume declined 2% year-over-year. This was largely driven by changes in Hydrocarbons & Energy related to our cracker feedslates combined with lower ethylene trade sales volume. Excluding Hydrocarbons & Energy, volume was up 1% versus the year-ago period driven by growth in packaging, polyurethanes and silicones applications. 
Sequentially, demand was higher in Packaging & Specialty Plastics and in Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure. Local price declined 12% primarily due to decreases in lower global energy prices year-over-year. Currency decreased sales by 1% as a result of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro. The earnings impact of currency was offset by year-over-year tailwinds from a lower tax rate and reduced interest expense. 
Equity losses were $44 million, a year-over-year headwind of nearly $180 million. The decrease was primarily due to lower results at the Kuwait joint ventures driven by margin compression in MEG and polyethylene. Equity losses at Sadara also increased primarily due to the impact of a third-party industrial gas supplier issue which has since been resolved. In the appendix of our earnings deck, we have included our additional disclosure for our 3 principal joint ventures which provides further details on their results. 
Overall, operating EBIT was $1.1 billion. Tailwinds in the quarter included savings from cost synergies and stranded cost removal as well as contributions from new capacity on the U.S. Gulf Coast. These gains were more than offset by a year-over-year margin compression in siloxanes and isocyanates, lower equity earnings and the impact from the Argentina outage. On a sequential basis, operating EBIT rose 5% or nearly $60 million, representing our first sequential EBIT increase in more than a year. Our operating EBIT margin also expanded 80 basis points led by margin expansion in Packaging & Specialty Plastics. 
We generated $1.8 billion of cash from continuing operations which reflected a reduced headwind from integration and separation spending and a $700 million release of cash from working capital. Relative to the year-ago period, our cash from continuing operations was up $1.6 billion. But recall that we made a voluntary pension contribution last year of $1.1 billion. After adjusting for this, the underlying operation delivered a $500 million increase in cash flow versus the same quarter last year. 
And finally, we returned $600 million to our owners in the quarter, including $500 million of paid dividends and $100 million of share repurchases. Since spin, we have completed $400 million of share repurchases and we remain on track to achieve our target of $500 million for the year. 
Moving to Slide 8 and our modeling guidance for the fourth quarter. As we have for the past couple of quarters, we're again providing our segment guidance on a sequential basis to reflect the most relevant comparison in today's environment. At the total Dow level, we see core EBIT tailwinds sequentially as headwinds from normal fourth quarter seasonality in coatings and infrastructure markets and modest impacts from turnarounds are offset by nearly $150 million of add-backs from onetime events in the third quarter, including the impact of our outage in Argentina. 
In Performance Materials & Coatings, we expect siloxanes pricing to remain at about the same level as we exited the third quarter. In coatings and monomers, we expect to see the normal seasonal reduction in profitability and the business will also absorb 1/3 of the impact from our planned PDH turnaround that is currently underway. 
Moving to Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure. This segment will absorb the remainder of the PDH turnaround impact, and MEG prices on average are projected to be similar to the third quarter. 
And finally, in the Packaging & Specialty Plastics segment, we see feedstock price trends continuing to drive lighter cracker feedslates in the U.S. and Europe which will continue to reduce our top line sales of coproducts. We expect a modest sequential headwind as we complete a large turnaround in The Netherlands, and we anticipate reduced catalyst and licensing earnings in the quarter, which by their nature are lumpy. On the positive side, our Argentina assets are now back online so they will once again be positively contributing to our results. 
Turning to Slide 9. There are 2 areas where I'd like to highlight the progress we've made against our financial targets. The first is our capital structure, specifically the deleveraging and liability management we've done this year. As you'll recall from our Investor Day last year, we outlined our capital structure priorities and our deleveraging targets. 
And as you see on this slide, we have been delivering on our plan, making significant progress in improving and smoothing our debt maturity profile and maintaining our liquidity position. We have opportunistically refinanced upcoming maturities and we secured the option to extend the outstanding $2 billion on our term loan by an additional 2 years to the second half of 2023. So far this year, we have completed $2 billion of gross deleveraging. And with our recent $1.25 billion debt redemption announcement which was supported by the cash proceeds we received from Nova, we will complete more than $3 billion of gross deleveraging by the end of this year. 
The result of these actions is that we do not have a significant debt maturity due until 2022 and we have maintained our strong liquidity position, which is more than $10 billion. These accomplishments align to the financial priorities we outlined a year ago: Maintaining a strong capital structure, reducing risk, lowering interest expense and preserving our financial strength and flexibility. 
Moving to Slide 10. The second financial highlight is the progress we have made in our cash flow generation and the potential we see to improve further from here. Looking at the trailing 12 months, we have delivered $3.2 billion of free cash flow, but our results do not yet fully reflect our underlying potential. The reason for this, as we highlighted at the start of the year, is that we have had short-term cash headwinds from 2 discrete factors: Post-spin integration and separation activities and interest expense. On both fronts, peak spending is behind us. 
Through the third quarter, we have spent more than $1 billion on integration and separation spending in 2019 and we expect the full year spend to be in the range of $1.2 billion, in line with our target for the year. This spending is beginning to recede. And looking ahead, we expect the 2020 cash spend to be in the range of $200 million to $300 million or a year-over-year release of cash of about $1 billion. 
And on interest expense, as I highlighted, we have accomplished a substantial amount of deleveraging and liability management. This has put us in a position today where we see our 2020 run rate interest expense being $100 million lower than where we started in 2019. These 2 factors alone represent more than $1 billion of cash flow uplift in 2020 that are completely within our control and independent of market conditions. 
We also continue to pursue nonoperational cash inflows, notably the additional litigation we have pending with Nova, and our teams continue to also focus on operational improvements such as greater working capital efficiency. These improvements will not only boost gross cash flow but should also lift our earnings to cash conversion. 
Our focus on cash is paying off, and all other things equal, our free cash flow is poised to expand. This additional flexibility preserves our ability to deliver against our financial priorities, including our strong shareholder returns and further deleveraging. 
Now I'd like to hand it back to Jim to discuss our progress on our cost and growth priorities as well as our near-term outlook."

I'll start with our cost-out priorities. The progress we've made on our cost reductions has been proceeding faster than we planned. In the third quarter, we successfully completed our $1.365 billion cost synergy prog",974,"Thanks, Howard. Turning to Slide 11. I'll start with our cost-out priorities. 
The progress we've made on our cost reductions has been proceeding faster than we planned. In the third quarter, we successfully completed our $1.365 billion cost synergy program which we finished about 1 to 2 quarters ahead of schedule. On the stranded cost removal side, we eliminated an additional $40 million and have already exceeded $125 million in cumulative savings. 
Just before our spin, we laid out a target to deliver $600 million of our remaining $800 million of cost synergy savings and stranded cost removal in 2019. Based on the progress we've made through the third quarter, we now expect to deliver approximately $700 million of savings this year with the remaining $100 million to be realized in the first half of 2020. The Dow team has done an excellent job in putting together a robust cost-out plan that identifies, delivers and tracks these savings, and they have kept up that focus for more than 2 years to ensure our steady delivery against our target. 
Turning to Slide 12 and perhaps what I'm most proud of is that the Dow story has not only been about cost, but we've also continued to drive several high-return growth projects. A year ago, we told you that the new Dow has a well-defined growth roadmap that includes a robust pipeline of attractive investment, projects that are lower-risk, faster-payback, lower capital intensity and higher return on invested capital. As the macro environment changed, we quickly adjusted our capital spending target for the year to $2 billion and we intensified our criteria for approving and advancing projects. 
In the third quarter alone, we advanced several projects. We announced the retrofit of one of our crackers in Louisiana with our proprietary fluidized catalytic dehydrogenation technology to produce on-purpose propylene. We see the FCDh technology as a game-changer for the industry. It promises reduced capital intensity, lower energy usage and lower greenhouse gas emission. FCDh not only drives return on invested capital benefits but it also advances our sustainability agenda when compared to all conventional PDH technologies. 
We launched AGILITY CE, a new resin made with 70% post-consumer recycled plastics, which incorporates recycled plastic shrink film into low-density polyethylene. 
We also announced 2 partnerships that showcase circular economy solutions for plastics: The Fuenix agreement allows Dow to incorporate recycled plastic waste back into our feedstock supply; and second, the UPM Biofuels technology enables plastic solutions made from bio-based renewable feedstock. Both solutions reduce carbon emission without impacting the performance of our final products. 
In our silicones franchise, we continued to greenlight incremental debottlenecks. Through the third quarter, we have completed 14 of the 18 downstream capacity expansions that we planned for this year. We reached the final investment decision for our previously announced flexible alkoxylation capacity to support our customers' growth in infrastructure and home and personal care end markets. This U.S. Gulf Coast unit is expected to start up by the end of 2021. And furthermore, we recently signed a 10-year supply agreement with a key customer, securing the baseload volume for this facility, representing $900 million of new revenue over the life of the contract. 
And on the digital front, we launched a new Dow.com, featuring an expanded e-commerce platform. Year-to-date, we have already achieved nearly $3 billion of sales through this channel and we're just getting started. These are just a few of the investments that we believe will fuel our growth, deliver productivity improvements, enhance customer experience and further drive us toward our sustainability goals. 
Turning to our market outlook on Slide 13. As we look around the globe at key commodity products, our view is that in many cases, the margin for high-cost producers has essentially been bouncing around the breakeven point for at least the past 2 quarters. On this slide, we showcase a few prime examples. In MEG, Asian spot spreads have been at or slightly below the breakeven point for most of the year. And there have been reports over the past 2 quarters of high-cost producers dialing back production. In MDI, we see spreads in Asia bouncing around the historic low point. And in ethylene, the high-cost producer margins are thin and projected to go to 0 while the ethylene margin for producers in the Americas remains healthy. 
Our base case remains that the global economy will continue growing albeit at a slower pace. In that scenario, based on historical spreads in our products' chains, we see a floor to further margin deterioration and a good upside to normalized levels when fundamentals tighten. In this environment, Dow remains well positioned thanks to our competitive positions on the cost curve driven by our feedstock flexibility, our scale and significant presence in lower-cost regions such as Canada, Argentina and the U.S. Gulf Coast. 
To sum it up on Slide 14, 2019 has been our year to successfully reintroduce a more focused, more streamlined Dow, execute our playbook and showcase our financial and capital discipline. We believe the results of our actions will continue to show in our earnings, deliver enhanced cash flows and preserve our financial strength. 
As you've seen from us all year and especially in the third quarter, we are delivering as we promised. And as we look to the near-term future, our mindset does not change. The current business environment demands discipline, and that is why we'll continue to leverage our feedstock flexibility, advance our lower-risk, higher-return growth investments while staying in line with our $2 billion capital expenditure target this year and continue driving a best-in-class reduced cost structure by delivering the remaining stranded cost removal. 
In sum, the steps that we're taking today position us well to leverage increased value when the industrial economy rebounds. 
Now I'll turn it back to Neal to open the Q&A."

There's a little bit of supply/demand imbalance that we're working through on those commodities, and that's driven primarily by a slower industrial economy. 
We see strong growth in Asia. So we're up double digits out there. We see good growth around the world.

And what that does is really it widens our feedstock flexibility, so it gives us another range of flexibility that we didn't have. And that was important this quarter because ethane was really low and also propane was low in the quarter. Propane being low meant we cracked pretty aggressively LPGs in Europe. And we think that we will continue to do that through fourth quarter and first quarter into next year. And sometimes in the wintertime, if gas prices tick up, you would see that might be limited a little bit. But the outlook for gas as we go into this winter and the inventories and the current prices mean that we're going to be cracking LPGs. 
I don't know if the change that we have on cracking 0 naphtha in the Gulf Coast is going to have a big impact on naphtha cost to everyone else. I would say that in Asia, the naphtha crackers today are at about breakeven margins. And they've been there for -- especially the fourth-quartile producers have been there for the last couple of quarters. So I think that pressure is going to continue even if naphtha goes down.

We also move obviously some materials into ag films and some other Industrial & Consumer Packaging. The consumer packaging is holding up fine, the industrial's been a little bit slower. But our volumes have been good. 
The consumer side has been a strong pull for us around the world and it was a very strong quarter for us in Asia. And having said that, with -- even with that demand, we saw prices up at the end of third quarter, up $0.03 higher than the IHS integrated margin levels. So I think that's a combination of our own pricing activity as well as our ability to capture the spreads by the feedstock flexibility that we've got. 
We're continuing to add products to the line to expand that consumer side and to address some of the challenges on a circular economy, so you saw AGILITY CE in there. And we've got a host of other recycle-ready products and things for the consumer side of the business that we think are going to continue to drive demand."

The demand obviously, with industrial slowing down on the industrial side, has been a little bit slower than what we'd anticipated. The consumer side has been continuing to perform well.

And so I think you're going to continue to see that there's good balance in the supply/demand going forward. I don't think there's any reason to think there's been a fundamental change in the 1.4x GDP. Our outlook for GDP next year is still around 3% globally.

But on the upstream side, when you get into areas of big volume use, like for example large commercial buildings, big industrial builds, some of that has slowed down and taken a little bit of pressure off of siloxanes. 
There's no new capacity coming on in siloxanes. We're working off a lot of capacity that got added in China over the last couple of years. And I think there's nothing on the horizon for the next 2 or 3 years in the siloxanes space. So it should continue to tighten from here.

I think the real thing that's changed here is you're starting to get a sense that the pressure on the consumer goods companies from the consumers would indicate there's probably a change in people's willingness to pay for a more recyclable or sustainable product. And so I think that is probably the more important question than the cost of this versus virgin plastics from virgin natural gas liquids or another feedstock. If it was more competitive, it would have already been done. But the reality is there are pressures out there and there are demands to go to a circular economy and there seems to be a growing consumer base that's willing to pay for that. Now we just have to work out what the value chain looks like. 
The second thing on the consumer side is we have a waste problem which none of us have our heads in the sand about. We have a plastic waste issue that needs to be resolved. And in order to drive that circular economy, we've got to come up with a way to value the plastic waste so that it can come back into that feedstock supply. And that's probably the bigger challenge. I think we will come up with a way to do it. I think everybody in the value chain that's part of the alliance that we've put together is trying to figure that out. But that's going to require some time and some things for us to work through. 
Meanwhile, the size of these projects that I'm talking about are going to help us learn more about what the cost positions are, are going to help us learn more about what the customer acceptance is going to be for these products and what the price point for that will be. And I think in another year or so, I'd have a better answer for you on what the relative values are."

Starting on Slide 3, our results in the third quarter demonstrate the Dow team's focus on managing the levers within our control while also making progress against our operational, financial and strategic priorities that we laid out for the new Dow at our Investor Day last year. At that time, we presented a clear set of priorities and targets along with a playbook to drive our execution. Since then, we have been diligently delivering on that plan. 
In the third quarter, we achieved top line performance that was in line with our guidance and bottom line results that exceeded expectations. In doing so, we delivered strong improvements from Q2 to Q3 across the board, EBIT margin, earnings and free cash flow. Here are some other notable highlights from our results. 
First, we continued to capture demand growth, particularly in sectors closer to the consumer where conditions remain favorable. Excluding Hydrocarbons & Energy, Dow's volume rose by 1% in the quarter led by consumer growth in packaging, polyurethanes and silicones application. 
Second, we grew earnings and margins sequentially, led by our plastics franchise. We leveraged our industry-leading feedstock flexibility in the United States and Europe. In Europe, we capitalized on the LPG advantage versus naphtha. And on the U.S. Gulf Coast, we made full use of new butane capabilities that we put in place earlier this year. And we successfully achieved 0 naphtha cracking this quarter, expanding our flexibility and avoiding an otherwise costly feedstock penalty. Additionally, we focused on recapturing price, a key improvement toward the end of the quarter in polyethylene. 
Third, we continued to drive down our cost structure. We reached a significant milestone in the quarter, successfully completing our $1.365 billion cost synergy program. Furthermore, we removed another $40 million of stranded costs in the quarter. 
And fourth, our results this quarter showed the ability of Dow's portfolio to generate strong cash flow. We generated $1.8 billion in cash flow from continuing operations and $1.3 billion in free cash flow. We improved our earnings to cash flow conversion as well as working capital improvements provided a source of cash. The cash flow story this quarter is a noteworthy highlight and Howard will unpack this later in the call. We accomplished all of this while navigating a business environment with limited visibility and while overcoming operational limitations in Argentina, where both of our crackers were down through the third quarter following a countrywide power outage in late June. 
And finally, we made important progress in our litigation with Nova Chemicals and in our deleveraging priorities. In September, a judgment was entered in Alberta, Canada ordering Nova Chemicals to pay Dow approximately $1.1 billion. On October 10, Dow received the related cash payment of approximately $800 million. Subsequently, we issued a make whole call for the full redemption of $1.25 billion of notes due in 2021, further reducing debt. This was another important step forward in strengthening our financial profile. 
Altogether, our results demonstrate the strengths of the Dow portfolio and our continued focus on executing the operational, financial and strategic playbook that we laid out a year ago. Now moving on to our segment results and the business performance in the quarter. 
On Slide 4, Packaging & Specialty Plastics expanded operating EBIT margin nearly 200 basis points year-over-year. Our results reflected demand growth in packaging applications, margin expansion, cost synergies and contributions from new capacity on the U.S. Gulf Coast which more than offset lower equity earnings. And notably on a sequential basis, EBIT grew 4% and operating EBIT margin expanded 100 basis points. Further, the results are particularly notable considering that the segment overcame a $100 million headwind from a combination of lost ethylene production and repair costs in Argentina. Our 2 crackers there are now back up and running. 
In the third quarter, we saw a continuation of solid demand in packaging application. The Packaging & Specialty Plastics business grew volume by 4% year-over-year. We again saw growth in Industrial & Consumer Packaging, Flexible Food & Specialty Packaging and health and hygiene application. Regionally, volume growth this quarter was led by Asia-Pacific and EMEAI. In Hydrocarbons & Energy, the business reported both lower volume and local price. The volume declines were an outcome of our drive for lighter feedslates in Europe which led to lower coproduct production volume. In addition, we had slightly lower merchant ethylene sales in the United States as a result of enhanced ethylene integration enabled by our new derivative capacity. 
On Slide 5, Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure operating EBIT decline versus the year-ago period primarily due to margin compression in the polyurethanes component and MEG as well as lower demand in industrial end markets. 
In Industrial Solutions, volume declined modestly as a result of lower demand in energy, agriculture and automotive end markets. This was partly offset by growth in catalyst application and demand in pharma end markets. The business reported a significant drop in its equity earnings driven by margin compression for MEG at our Kuwait joint ventures. 
Polyurethanes & Construction Chemicals sales declined on lower local pricing in all regions led by lower components prices. However, the business achieved volume growth driven by gains in the United States and Canada on improved MDI supply year-over-year as well as continued demand growth in polyurethane systems. 
Our growth in Systems reflects the business' focus on driving its downstream agenda and moving the portfolio from merchant component sales to higher-value formulated systems. It has been a multiyear journey and the progress we've made so far has been impressive. This quarter marked the 25th consecutive quarter of year-over-year volume growth for the Systems business. 
And finally on Slide 6. Performance Materials & Coatings operating EBIT fell from the year-ago period primarily due to siloxanes margin compression and lower demand in coatings and monomers. 
Consumer Solutions sales declined as volume gains in Asia-Pacific and the U.S. and Canada were more than offset by local price declines in all regions mainly driven by lower siloxanes prices. The business reported volume growth in infrastructure end markets and improved demand for siloxanes in Asia-Pacific. This was partly offset by soft demand in the automotive and consumer electronics end markets. 
Coatings & Performance Monomers reported a volume decline. On the coatings side, the business saw lower demand in the U.S. and Canada in architectural coating and soft demand in Asia-Pacific in industrial coatings end markets. 
I'll now turn it over to Howard to discuss our financial performance in the quarter, modeling guidance and the progress that we made against some of our key financial targets."

The decline was primarily driven by lower local pricing. Volume declined 2% year-over-year. This was largely driven by changes in Hydrocarbons & Energy related to our cracker feedslates combined with lower ethylene trade sales volume. Excluding Hydrocarbons & Energy, volume was up 1% versus the year-ago period driven by growth in packaging, polyurethanes and silicones applications. 
Sequentially, demand was higher in Packaging & Specialty Plastics and in Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure. Local price declined 12% primarily due to decreases in lower global energy prices year-over-year. Currency decreased sales by 1% as a result of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro. The earnings impact of currency was offset by year-over-year tailwinds from a lower tax rate and reduced interest expense. 
Equity losses were $44 million, a year-over-year headwind of nearly $180 million. The decrease was primarily due to lower results at the Kuwait joint ventures driven by margin compression in MEG and polyethylene. Equity losses at Sadara also increased primarily due to the impact of a third-party industrial gas supplier issue which has since been resolved. In the appendix of our earnings deck, we have included our additional disclosure for our 3 principal joint ventures which provides further details on their results. 
Overall, operating EBIT was $1.1 billion. Tailwinds in the quarter included savings from cost synergies and stranded cost removal as well as contributions from new capacity on the U.S. Gulf Coast. These gains were more than offset by a year-over-year margin compression in siloxanes and isocyanates, lower equity earnings and the impact from the Argentina outage. On a sequential basis, operating EBIT rose 5% or nearly $60 million, representing our first sequential EBIT increase in more than a year. Our operating EBIT margin also expanded 80 basis points led by margin expansion in Packaging & Specialty Plastics. 
We generated $1.8 billion of cash from continuing operations which reflected a reduced headwind from integration and separation spending and a $700 million release of cash from working capital. Relative to the year-ago period, our cash from continuing operations was up $1.6 billion. But recall that we made a voluntary pension contribution last year of $1.1 billion. After adjusting for this, the underlying operation delivered a $500 million increase in cash flow versus the same quarter last year. 
And finally, we returned $600 million to our owners in the quarter, including $500 million of paid dividends and $100 million of share repurchases. Since spin, we have completed $400 million of share repurchases and we remain on track to achieve our target of $500 million for the year. 
Moving to Slide 8 and our modeling guidance for the fourth quarter. As we have for the past couple of quarters, we're again providing our segment guidance on a sequential basis to reflect the most relevant comparison in today's environment. At the total Dow level, we see core EBIT tailwinds sequentially as headwinds from normal fourth quarter seasonality in coatings and infrastructure markets and modest impacts from turnarounds are offset by nearly $150 million of add-backs from onetime events in the third quarter, including the impact of our outage in Argentina. 
In Performance Materials & Coatings, we expect siloxanes pricing to remain at about the same level as we exited the third quarter. In coatings and monomers, we expect to see the normal seasonal reduction in profitability and the business will also absorb 1/3 of the impact from our planned PDH turnaround that is currently underway. 
Moving to Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure. This segment will absorb the remainder of the PDH turnaround impact, and MEG prices on average are projected to be similar to the third quarter. 
And finally, in the Packaging & Specialty Plastics segment, we see feedstock price trends continuing to drive lighter cracker feedslates in the U.S. and Europe which will continue to reduce our top line sales of coproducts. We expect a modest sequential headwind as we complete a large turnaround in The Netherlands, and we anticipate reduced catalyst and licensing earnings in the quarter, which by their nature are lumpy. On the positive side, our Argentina assets are now back online so they will once again be positively contributing to our results. 
Turning to Slide 9. There are 2 areas where I'd like to highlight the progress we've made against our financial targets. The first is our capital structure, specifically the deleveraging and liability management we've done this year. As you'll recall from our Investor Day last year, we outlined our capital structure priorities and our deleveraging targets. 
And as you see on this slide, we have been delivering on our plan, making significant progress in improving and smoothing our debt maturity profile and maintaining our liquidity position. We have opportunistically refinanced upcoming maturities and we secured the option to extend the outstanding $2 billion on our term loan by an additional 2 years to the second half of 2023. So far this year, we have completed $2 billion of gross deleveraging. And with our recent $1.25 billion debt redemption announcement which was supported by the cash proceeds we received from Nova, we will complete more than $3 billion of gross deleveraging by the end of this year. 
The result of these actions is that we do not have a significant debt maturity due until 2022 and we have maintained our strong liquidity position, which is more than $10 billion. These accomplishments align to the financial priorities we outlined a year ago: Maintaining a strong capital structure, reducing risk, lowering interest expense and preserving our financial strength and flexibility. 
Moving to Slide 10. The second financial highlight is the progress we have made in our cash flow generation and the potential we see to improve further from here. Looking at the trailing 12 months, we have delivered $3.2 billion of free cash flow, but our results do not yet fully reflect our underlying potential. The reason for this, as we highlighted at the start of the year, is that we have had short-term cash headwinds from 2 discrete factors: Post-spin integration and separation activities and interest expense. On both fronts, peak spending is behind us. 
Through the third quarter, we have spent more than $1 billion on integration and separation spending in 2019 and we expect the full year spend to be in the range of $1.2 billion, in line with our target for the year. This spending is beginning to recede. And looking ahead, we expect the 2020 cash spend to be in the range of $200 million to $300 million or a year-over-year release of cash of about $1 billion. 
And on interest expense, as I highlighted, we have accomplished a substantial amount of deleveraging and liability management. This has put us in a position today where we see our 2020 run rate interest expense being $100 million lower than where we started in 2019. These 2 factors alone represent more than $1 billion of cash flow uplift in 2020 that are completely within our control and independent of market conditions. 
We also continue to pursue nonoperational cash inflows, notably the additional litigation we have pending with Nova, and our teams continue to also focus on operational improvements such as greater working capital efficiency. These improvements will not only boost gross cash flow but should also lift our earnings to cash conversion. 
Our focus on cash is paying off, and all other things equal, our free cash flow is poised to expand. This additional flexibility preserves our ability to deliver against our financial priorities, including our strong shareholder returns and further deleveraging. 
Now I'd like to hand it back to Jim to discuss our progress on our cost and growth priorities as well as our near-term outlook."
9830660,640465857,1839996,"Dow Inc., Q3 2019 Earnings Call, Oct 24, 2019",2019-10-24,"Earnings Calls","Dow Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Howard. Turning to Slide 11. I'll start with our cost-out priorities. The progress we've made on our cost reductions has been proceeding faster than we planned. In the third quarter, we successfully completed our $1.365 billion cost synergy prog",974,"Thanks, Howard. Turning to Slide 11. I'll start with our cost-out priorities. 
The progress we've made on our cost reductions has been proceeding faster than we planned. In the third quarter, we successfully completed our $1.365 billion cost synergy program which we finished about 1 to 2 quarters ahead of schedule. On the stranded cost removal side, we eliminated an additional $40 million and have already exceeded $125 million in cumulative savings. 
Just before our spin, we laid out a target to deliver $600 million of our remaining $800 million of cost synergy savings and stranded cost removal in 2019. Based on the progress we've made through the third quarter, we now expect to deliver approximately $700 million of savings this year with the remaining $100 million to be realized in the first half of 2020. The Dow team has done an excellent job in putting together a robust cost-out plan that identifies, delivers and tracks these savings, and they have kept up that focus for more than 2 years to ensure our steady delivery against our target. 
Turning to Slide 12 and perhaps what I'm most proud of is that the Dow story has not only been about cost, but we've also continued to drive several high-return growth projects. A year ago, we told you that the new Dow has a well-defined growth roadmap that includes a robust pipeline of attractive investment, projects that are lower-risk, faster-payback, lower capital intensity and higher return on invested capital. As the macro environment changed, we quickly adjusted our capital spending target for the year to $2 billion and we intensified our criteria for approving and advancing projects. 
In the third quarter alone, we advanced several projects. We announced the retrofit of one of our crackers in Louisiana with our proprietary fluidized catalytic dehydrogenation technology to produce on-purpose propylene. We see the FCDh technology as a game-changer for the industry. It promises reduced capital intensity, lower energy usage and lower greenhouse gas emission. FCDh not only drives return on invested capital benefits but it also advances our sustainability agenda when compared to all conventional PDH technologies. 
We launched AGILITY CE, a new resin made with 70% post-consumer recycled plastics, which incorporates recycled plastic shrink film into low-density polyethylene. 
We also announced 2 partnerships that showcase circular economy solutions for plastics: The Fuenix agreement allows Dow to incorporate recycled plastic waste back into our feedstock supply; and second, the UPM Biofuels technology enables plastic solutions made from bio-based renewable feedstock. Both solutions reduce carbon emission without impacting the performance of our final products. 
In our silicones franchise, we continued to greenlight incremental debottlenecks. Through the third quarter, we have completed 14 of the 18 downstream capacity expansions that we planned for this year. We reached the final investment decision for our previously announced flexible alkoxylation capacity to support our customers' growth in infrastructure and home and personal care end markets. This U.S. Gulf Coast unit is expected to start up by the end of 2021. And furthermore, we recently signed a 10-year supply agreement with a key customer, securing the baseload volume for this facility, representing $900 million of new revenue over the life of the contract. 
And on the digital front, we launched a new Dow.com, featuring an expanded e-commerce platform. Year-to-date, we have already achieved nearly $3 billion of sales through this channel and we're just getting started. These are just a few of the investments that we believe will fuel our growth, deliver productivity improvements, enhance customer experience and further drive us toward our sustainability goals. 
Turning to our market outlook on Slide 13. As we look around the globe at key commodity products, our view is that in many cases, the margin for high-cost producers has essentially been bouncing around the breakeven point for at least the past 2 quarters. On this slide, we showcase a few prime examples. In MEG, Asian spot spreads have been at or slightly below the breakeven point for most of the year. And there have been reports over the past 2 quarters of high-cost producers dialing back production. In MDI, we see spreads in Asia bouncing around the historic low point. And in ethylene, the high-cost producer margins are thin and projected to go to 0 while the ethylene margin for producers in the Americas remains healthy. 
Our base case remains that the global economy will continue growing albeit at a slower pace. In that scenario, based on historical spreads in our products' chains, we see a floor to further margin deterioration and a good upside to normalized levels when fundamentals tighten. In this environment, Dow remains well positioned thanks to our competitive positions on the cost curve driven by our feedstock flexibility, our scale and significant presence in lower-cost regions such as Canada, Argentina and the U.S. Gulf Coast. 
To sum it up on Slide 14, 2019 has been our year to successfully reintroduce a more focused, more streamlined Dow, execute our playbook and showcase our financial and capital discipline. We believe the results of our actions will continue to show in our earnings, deliver enhanced cash flows and preserve our financial strength. 
As you've seen from us all year and especially in the third quarter, we are delivering as we promised. And as we look to the near-term future, our mindset does not change. The current business environment demands discipline, and that is why we'll continue to leverage our feedstock flexibility, advance our lower-risk, higher-return growth investments while staying in line with our $2 billion capital expenditure target this year and continue driving a best-in-class reduced cost structure by delivering the remaining stranded cost removal. 
In sum, the steps that we're taking today position us well to leverage increased value when the industrial economy rebounds. 
Now I'll turn it back to Neal to open the Q&A."

Sadara's running well right now. I don't see any long-term issue from that. And really good cooperation and response from Aramco, really solid response."

I think what we've tried to do in 2019 is to prepare ourselves and get ourselves on solid financial footing as a new company, and I believe we've done that. We had to get the costs out. We had to get our balance sheet in the right space. We had to make sure that, that industry-leading dividend that we put out there was protected. And I believe that we've done that. 
I think we've positioned ourselves well for an upturn in the industrial economy. The consumer side of the business is doing great and the high-return projects that we've got for growth are really playing into that. So we don't have a demand problem right now. There's a little bit of supply/demand imbalance that we're working through on those commodities, and that's driven primarily by a slower industrial economy. 
We see strong growth in Asia. So we're up double digits out there. We see good growth around the world. And with a little rebound in the industrial economy, you're going to see a demand pull on the chain that we haven't seen for 4 consecutive quarters. When that happens, I think you're going to see margin expansion and things are going to start to move up. Oil goes up a little bit -- and you see the industrial economy come back, that typically pulls oil price up. That would help, too."

And what that does is really it widens our feedstock flexibility, so it gives us another range of flexibility that we didn't have. And that was important this quarter because ethane was really low and also propane was low in the quarter. Propane being low meant we cracked pretty aggressively LPGs in Europe. And we think that we will continue to do that through fourth quarter and first quarter into next year. And sometimes in the wintertime, if gas prices tick up, you would see that might be limited a little bit. But the outlook for gas as we go into this winter and the inventories and the current prices mean that we're going to be cracking LPGs. 
I don't know if the change that we have on cracking 0 naphtha in the Gulf Coast is going to have a big impact on naphtha cost to everyone else. I would say that in Asia, the naphtha crackers today are at about breakeven margins. And they've been there for -- especially the fourth-quartile producers have been there for the last couple of quarters. So I think that pressure is going to continue even if naphtha goes down. Naphtha probably would move more based on what happens with oil price."

The consumer side has been a strong pull for us around the world and it was a very strong quarter for us in Asia. And having said that, with -- even with that demand, we saw prices up at the end of third quarter, up $0.03 higher than the IHS integrated margin levels.

The demand obviously, with industrial slowing down on the industrial side, has been a little bit slower than what we'd anticipated. The consumer side has been continuing to perform well. And so I think with some of the pressures that are on in that industrial side, that's really been the thing that slowed the overall growth. And you're coming off of a very, very strong 2018. 
And so I think you're going to continue to see that there's good balance in the supply/demand going forward. I don't think there's any reason to think there's been a fundamental change in the 1.4x GDP. Our outlook for GDP next year is still around 3% globally. And so I believe that you're going to continue to see about 4%, 4.5% type of growth rates out of polyethylene."

But on the upstream side, when you get into areas of big volume use, like for example large commercial buildings, big industrial builds, some of that has slowed down and taken a little bit of pressure off of siloxanes. 
There's no new capacity coming on in siloxanes. We're working off a lot of capacity that got added in China over the last couple of years. And I think there's nothing on the horizon for the next 2 or 3 years in the siloxanes space. So it should continue to tighten from here. If the industrial economy picks up a bit and the building and construction picks up a bit, I think you'll see that will tighten things up."

I think the real thing that's changed here is you're starting to get a sense that the pressure on the consumer goods companies from the consumers would indicate there's probably a change in people's willingness to pay for a more recyclable or sustainable product. And so I think that is probably the more important question than the cost of this versus virgin plastics from virgin natural gas liquids or another feedstock. If it was more competitive, it would have already been done. But the reality is there are pressures out there and there are demands to go to a circular economy and there seems to be a growing consumer base that's willing to pay for that. Now we just have to work out what the value chain looks like. 
The second thing on the consumer side is we have a waste problem which none of us have our heads in the sand about. We have a plastic waste issue that needs to be resolved. And in order to drive that circular economy, we've got to come up with a way to value the plastic waste so that it can come back into that feedstock supply. And that's probably the bigger challenge. I think we will come up with a way to do it. I think everybody in the value chain that's part of the alliance that we've put together is trying to figure that out. But that's going to require some time and some things for us to work through. 
Meanwhile, the size of these projects that I'm talking about are going to help us learn more about what the cost positions are, are going to help us learn more about what the customer acceptance is going to be for these products and what the price point for that will be. And I think in another year or so, I'd have a better answer for you on what the relative values are."

Starting on Slide 3, our results in the third quarter demonstrate the Dow team's focus on managing the levers within our control while also making progress against our operational, financial",1106,"Thanks, Neal, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. Starting on Slide 3, our results in the third quarter demonstrate the Dow team's focus on managing the levers within our control while also making progress against our operational, financial and strategic priorities that we laid out for the new Dow at our Investor Day last year. At that time, we presented a clear set of priorities and targets along with a playbook to drive our execution. Since then, we have been diligently delivering on that plan. 
In the third quarter, we achieved top line performance that was in line with our guidance and bottom line results that exceeded expectations. In doing so, we delivered strong improvements from Q2 to Q3 across the board, EBIT margin, earnings and free cash flow. Here are some other notable highlights from our results. 
First, we continued to capture demand growth, particularly in sectors closer to the consumer where conditions remain favorable. Excluding Hydrocarbons & Energy, Dow's volume rose by 1% in the quarter led by consumer growth in packaging, polyurethanes and silicones application. 
Second, we grew earnings and margins sequentially, led by our plastics franchise. We leveraged our industry-leading feedstock flexibility in the United States and Europe. In Europe, we capitalized on the LPG advantage versus naphtha. And on the U.S. Gulf Coast, we made full use of new butane capabilities that we put in place earlier this year. And we successfully achieved 0 naphtha cracking this quarter, expanding our flexibility and avoiding an otherwise costly feedstock penalty. Additionally, we focused on recapturing price, a key improvement toward the end of the quarter in polyethylene. 
Third, we continued to drive down our cost structure. We reached a significant milestone in the quarter, successfully completing our $1.365 billion cost synergy program. Furthermore, we removed another $40 million of stranded costs in the quarter. 
And fourth, our results this quarter showed the ability of Dow's portfolio to generate strong cash flow. We generated $1.8 billion in cash flow from continuing operations and $1.3 billion in free cash flow. We improved our earnings to cash flow conversion as well as working capital improvements provided a source of cash. The cash flow story this quarter is a noteworthy highlight and Howard will unpack this later in the call. We accomplished all of this while navigating a business environment with limited visibility and while overcoming operational limitations in Argentina, where both of our crackers were down through the third quarter following a countrywide power outage in late June. 
And finally, we made important progress in our litigation with Nova Chemicals and in our deleveraging priorities. In September, a judgment was entered in Alberta, Canada ordering Nova Chemicals to pay Dow approximately $1.1 billion. On October 10, Dow received the related cash payment of approximately $800 million. Subsequently, we issued a make whole call for the full redemption of $1.25 billion of notes due in 2021, further reducing debt. This was another important step forward in strengthening our financial profile. 
Altogether, our results demonstrate the strengths of the Dow portfolio and our continued focus on executing the operational, financial and strategic playbook that we laid out a year ago. Now moving on to our segment results and the business performance in the quarter. 
On Slide 4, Packaging & Specialty Plastics expanded operating EBIT margin nearly 200 basis points year-over-year. Our results reflected demand growth in packaging applications, margin expansion, cost synergies and contributions from new capacity on the U.S. Gulf Coast which more than offset lower equity earnings. And notably on a sequential basis, EBIT grew 4% and operating EBIT margin expanded 100 basis points. Further, the results are particularly notable considering that the segment overcame a $100 million headwind from a combination of lost ethylene production and repair costs in Argentina. Our 2 crackers there are now back up and running. 
In the third quarter, we saw a continuation of solid demand in packaging application. The Packaging & Specialty Plastics business grew volume by 4% year-over-year. We again saw growth in Industrial & Consumer Packaging, Flexible Food & Specialty Packaging and health and hygiene application. Regionally, volume growth this quarter was led by Asia-Pacific and EMEAI. In Hydrocarbons & Energy, the business reported both lower volume and local price. The volume declines were an outcome of our drive for lighter feedslates in Europe which led to lower coproduct production volume. In addition, we had slightly lower merchant ethylene sales in the United States as a result of enhanced ethylene integration enabled by our new derivative capacity. 
On Slide 5, Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure operating EBIT decline versus the year-ago period primarily due to margin compression in the polyurethanes component and MEG as well as lower demand in industrial end markets. 
In Industrial Solutions, volume declined modestly as a result of lower demand in energy, agriculture and automotive end markets. This was partly offset by growth in catalyst application and demand in pharma end markets. The business reported a significant drop in its equity earnings driven by margin compression for MEG at our Kuwait joint ventures. 
Polyurethanes & Construction Chemicals sales declined on lower local pricing in all regions led by lower components prices. However, the business achieved volume growth driven by gains in the United States and Canada on improved MDI supply year-over-year as well as continued demand growth in polyurethane systems. 
Our growth in Systems reflects the business' focus on driving its downstream agenda and moving the portfolio from merchant component sales to higher-value formulated systems. It has been a multiyear journey and the progress we've made so far has been impressive. This quarter marked the 25th consecutive quarter of year-over-year volume growth for the Systems business. 
And finally on Slide 6. Performance Materials & Coatings operating EBIT fell from the year-ago period primarily due to siloxanes margin compression and lower demand in coatings and monomers. 
Consumer Solutions sales declined as volume gains in Asia-Pacific and the U.S. and Canada were more than offset by local price declines in all regions mainly driven by lower siloxanes prices. The business reported volume growth in infrastructure end markets and improved demand for siloxanes in Asia-Pacific. This was partly offset by soft demand in the automotive and consumer electronics end markets. 
Coatings & Performance Monomers reported a volume decline. On the coatings side, the business saw lower demand in the U.S. and Canada in architectural coating and soft demand in Asia-Pacific in industrial coatings end markets. 
I'll now turn it over to Howard to discuss our financial performance in the quarter, modeling guidance and the progress that we made against some of our key financial targets."

The decline was primarily driven by lower local pricing. Volume declined 2% year-over-year. This was largely driven by changes in Hydrocarbons & Energy related to our cracker feedslates combined with lower ethylene trade sales volume. Excluding Hydrocarbons & Energy, volume was up 1% versus the year-ago period driven by growth in packaging, polyurethanes and silicones applications. 
Sequentially, demand was higher in Packaging & Specialty Plastics and in Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure. Local price declined 12% primarily due to decreases in lower global energy prices year-over-year. Currency decreased sales by 1% as a result of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro. The earnings impact of currency was offset by year-over-year tailwinds from a lower tax rate and reduced interest expense. 
Equity losses were $44 million, a year-over-year headwind of nearly $180 million. The decrease was primarily due to lower results at the Kuwait joint ventures driven by margin compression in MEG and polyethylene. Equity losses at Sadara also increased primarily due to the impact of a third-party industrial gas supplier issue which has since been resolved. In the appendix of our earnings deck, we have included our additional disclosure for our 3 principal joint ventures which provides further details on their results. 
Overall, operating EBIT was $1.1 billion. Tailwinds in the quarter included savings from cost synergies and stranded cost removal as well as contributions from new capacity on the U.S. Gulf Coast. These gains were more than offset by a year-over-year margin compression in siloxanes and isocyanates, lower equity earnings and the impact from the Argentina outage. On a sequential basis, operating EBIT rose 5% or nearly $60 million, representing our first sequential EBIT increase in more than a year. Our operating EBIT margin also expanded 80 basis points led by margin expansion in Packaging & Specialty Plastics. 
We generated $1.8 billion of cash from continuing operations which reflected a reduced headwind from integration and separation spending and a $700 million release of cash from working capital. Relative to the year-ago period, our cash from continuing operations was up $1.6 billion. But recall that we made a voluntary pension contribution last year of $1.1 billion. After adjusting for this, the underlying operation delivered a $500 million increase in cash flow versus the same quarter last year. 
And finally, we returned $600 million to our owners in the quarter, including $500 million of paid dividends and $100 million of share repurchases. Since spin, we have completed $400 million of share repurchases and we remain on track to achieve our target of $500 million for the year. 
Moving to Slide 8 and our modeling guidance for the fourth quarter. As we have for the past couple of quarters, we're again providing our segment guidance on a sequential basis to reflect the most relevant comparison in today's environment. At the total Dow level, we see core EBIT tailwinds sequentially as headwinds from normal fourth quarter seasonality in coatings and infrastructure markets and modest impacts from turnarounds are offset by nearly $150 million of add-backs from onetime events in the third quarter, including the impact of our outage in Argentina. 
In Performance Materials & Coatings, we expect siloxanes pricing to remain at about the same level as we exited the third quarter. In coatings and monomers, we expect to see the normal seasonal reduction in profitability and the business will also absorb 1/3 of the impact from our planned PDH turnaround that is currently underway. 
Moving to Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure. This segment will absorb the remainder of the PDH turnaround impact, and MEG prices on average are projected to be similar to the third quarter. 
And finally, in the Packaging & Specialty Plastics segment, we see feedstock price trends continuing to drive lighter cracker feedslates in the U.S. and Europe which will continue to reduce our top line sales of coproducts. We expect a modest sequential headwind as we complete a large turnaround in The Netherlands, and we anticipate reduced catalyst and licensing earnings in the quarter, which by their nature are lumpy. On the positive side, our Argentina assets are now back online so they will once again be positively contributing to our results. 
Turning to Slide 9. There are 2 areas where I'd like to highlight the progress we've made against our financial targets. The first is our capital structure, specifically the deleveraging and liability management we've done this year. As you'll recall from our Investor Day last year, we outlined our capital structure priorities and our deleveraging targets. 
And as you see on this slide, we have been delivering on our plan, making significant progress in improving and smoothing our debt maturity profile and maintaining our liquidity position. We have opportunistically refinanced upcoming maturities and we secured the option to extend the outstanding $2 billion on our term loan by an additional 2 years to the second half of 2023. So far this year, we have completed $2 billion of gross deleveraging. And with our recent $1.25 billion debt redemption announcement which was supported by the cash proceeds we received from Nova, we will complete more than $3 billion of gross deleveraging by the end of this year. 
The result of these actions is that we do not have a significant debt maturity due until 2022 and we have maintained our strong liquidity position, which is more than $10 billion. These accomplishments align to the financial priorities we outlined a year ago: Maintaining a strong capital structure, reducing risk, lowering interest expense and preserving our financial strength and flexibility. 
Moving to Slide 10. The second financial highlight is the progress we have made in our cash flow generation and the potential we see to improve further from here. Looking at the trailing 12 months, we have delivered $3.2 billion of free cash flow, but our results do not yet fully reflect our underlying potential. The reason for this, as we highlighted at the start of the year, is that we have had short-term cash headwinds from 2 discrete factors: Post-spin integration and separation activities and interest expense. On both fronts, peak spending is behind us. 
Through the third quarter, we have spent more than $1 billion on integration and separation spending in 2019 and we expect the full year spend to be in the range of $1.2 billion, in line with our target for the year. This spending is beginning to recede. And looking ahead, we expect the 2020 cash spend to be in the range of $200 million to $300 million or a year-over-year release of cash of about $1 billion. 
And on interest expense, as I highlighted, we have accomplished a substantial amount of deleveraging and liability management. This has put us in a position today where we see our 2020 run rate interest expense being $100 million lower than where we started in 2019. These 2 factors alone represent more than $1 billion of cash flow uplift in 2020 that are completely within our control and independent of market conditions. 
We also continue to pursue nonoperational cash inflows, notably the additional litigation we have pending with Nova, and our teams continue to also focus on operational improvements such as greater working capital efficiency. These improvements will not only boost gross cash flow but should also lift our earnings to cash conversion. 
Our focus on cash is paying off, and all other things equal, our free cash flow is poised to expand. This additional flexibility preserves our ability to deliver against our financial priorities, including our strong shareholder returns and further deleveraging. 
Now I'd like to hand it back to Jim to discuss our progress on our cost and growth priorities as well as our near-term outlook."
9830660,640465857,1844431,"Dow Inc., Q3 2019 Earnings Call, Oct 24, 2019",2019-10-24,"Earnings Calls","Dow Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Howard. Turning to Slide 11. I'll start with our cost-out priorities. The progress we've made on our cost reductions has been proceeding faster than we planned. In the third quarter, we successfully completed our $1.365 billion cost synergy prog",974,"Thanks, Howard. Turning to Slide 11. I'll start with our cost-out priorities. 
The progress we've made on our cost reductions has been proceeding faster than we planned. In the third quarter, we successfully completed our $1.365 billion cost synergy program which we finished about 1 to 2 quarters ahead of schedule. On the stranded cost removal side, we eliminated an additional $40 million and have already exceeded $125 million in cumulative savings. 
Just before our spin, we laid out a target to deliver $600 million of our remaining $800 million of cost synergy savings and stranded cost removal in 2019. Based on the progress we've made through the third quarter, we now expect to deliver approximately $700 million of savings this year with the remaining $100 million to be realized in the first half of 2020. The Dow team has done an excellent job in putting together a robust cost-out plan that identifies, delivers and tracks these savings, and they have kept up that focus for more than 2 years to ensure our steady delivery against our target. 
Turning to Slide 12 and perhaps what I'm most proud of is that the Dow story has not only been about cost, but we've also continued to drive several high-return growth projects. A year ago, we told you that the new Dow has a well-defined growth roadmap that includes a robust pipeline of attractive investment, projects that are lower-risk, faster-payback, lower capital intensity and higher return on invested capital. As the macro environment changed, we quickly adjusted our capital spending target for the year to $2 billion and we intensified our criteria for approving and advancing projects. 
In the third quarter alone, we advanced several projects. We announced the retrofit of one of our crackers in Louisiana with our proprietary fluidized catalytic dehydrogenation technology to produce on-purpose propylene. We see the FCDh technology as a game-changer for the industry. It promises reduced capital intensity, lower energy usage and lower greenhouse gas emission. FCDh not only drives return on invested capital benefits but it also advances our sustainability agenda when compared to all conventional PDH technologies. 
We launched AGILITY CE, a new resin made with 70% post-consumer recycled plastics, which incorporates recycled plastic shrink film into low-density polyethylene. 
We also announced 2 partnerships that showcase circular economy solutions for plastics: The Fuenix agreement allows Dow to incorporate recycled plastic waste back into our feedstock supply; and second, the UPM Biofuels technology enables plastic solutions made from bio-based renewable feedstock. Both solutions reduce carbon emission without impacting the performance of our final products. 
In our silicones franchise, we continued to greenlight incremental debottlenecks. Through the third quarter, we have completed 14 of the 18 downstream capacity expansions that we planned for this year. We reached the final investment decision for our previously announced flexible alkoxylation capacity to support our customers' growth in infrastructure and home and personal care end markets. This U.S. Gulf Coast unit is expected to start up by the end of 2021. And furthermore, we recently signed a 10-year supply agreement with a key customer, securing the baseload volume for this facility, representing $900 million of new revenue over the life of the contract. 
And on the digital front, we launched a new Dow.com, featuring an expanded e-commerce platform. Year-to-date, we have already achieved nearly $3 billion of sales through this channel and we're just getting started. These are just a few of the investments that we believe will fuel our growth, deliver productivity improvements, enhance customer experience and further drive us toward our sustainability goals. 
Turning to our market outlook on Slide 13. As we look around the globe at key commodity products, our view is that in many cases, the margin for high-cost producers has essentially been bouncing around the breakeven point for at least the past 2 quarters. On this slide, we showcase a few prime examples. In MEG, Asian spot spreads have been at or slightly below the breakeven point for most of the year. And there have been reports over the past 2 quarters of high-cost producers dialing back production. In MDI, we see spreads in Asia bouncing around the historic low point. And in ethylene, the high-cost producer margins are thin and projected to go to 0 while the ethylene margin for producers in the Americas remains healthy. 
Our base case remains that the global economy will continue growing albeit at a slower pace. In that scenario, based on historical spreads in our products' chains, we see a floor to further margin deterioration and a good upside to normalized levels when fundamentals tighten. In this environment, Dow remains well positioned thanks to our competitive positions on the cost curve driven by our feedstock flexibility, our scale and significant presence in lower-cost regions such as Canada, Argentina and the U.S. Gulf Coast. 
To sum it up on Slide 14, 2019 has been our year to successfully reintroduce a more focused, more streamlined Dow, execute our playbook and showcase our financial and capital discipline. We believe the results of our actions will continue to show in our earnings, deliver enhanced cash flows and preserve our financial strength. 
As you've seen from us all year and especially in the third quarter, we are delivering as we promised. And as we look to the near-term future, our mindset does not change. The current business environment demands discipline, and that is why we'll continue to leverage our feedstock flexibility, advance our lower-risk, higher-return growth investments while staying in line with our $2 billion capital expenditure target this year and continue driving a best-in-class reduced cost structure by delivering the remaining stranded cost removal. 
In sum, the steps that we're taking today position us well to leverage increased value when the industrial economy rebounds. 
Now I'll turn it back to Neal to open the Q&A."

And you've got ethane prices at $0.18 roughly a gallon versus what everybody had expected to be greater than $0.40 a gallon.

With PMI really declining for the last 4 consecutive quarters, the big delta here is consumers then really pulling all the volume growth and industrial hasn't yet. But I do think with inventories being low, I don't see any speculative activity out there. And with downstream investments like in our Systems business downstream and our silicones business, which are both continuing to hold up well, that's going to create a pull on that supply/demand balance.

We had to get our balance sheet in the right space. We had to make sure that, that industry-leading dividend that we put out there was protected. And I believe that we've done that. 
I think we've positioned ourselves well for an upturn in the industrial economy. The consumer side of the business is doing great and the high-return projects that we've got for growth are really playing into that. So we don't have a demand problem right now. There's a little bit of supply/demand imbalance that we're working through on those commodities, and that's driven primarily by a slower industrial economy. 
We see strong growth in Asia. So we're up double digits out there. We see good growth around the world. And with a little rebound in the industrial economy, you're going to see a demand pull on the chain that we haven't seen for 4 consecutive quarters. When that happens, I think you're going to see margin expansion and things are going to start to move up. Oil goes up a little bit -- and you see the industrial economy come back, that typically pulls oil price up. That would help, too."

And what that does is really it widens our feedstock flexibility, so it gives us another range of flexibility that we didn't have. And that was important this quarter because ethane was really low and also propane was low in the quarter. Propane being low meant we cracked pretty aggressively LPGs in Europe. And we think that we will continue to do that through fourth quarter and first quarter into next year. And sometimes in the wintertime, if gas prices tick up, you would see that might be limited a little bit. But the outlook for gas as we go into this winter and the inventories and the current prices mean that we're going to be cracking LPGs. 
I don't know if the change that we have on cracking 0 naphtha in the Gulf Coast is going to have a big impact on naphtha cost to everyone else. I would say that in Asia, the naphtha crackers today are at about breakeven margins. And they've been there for -- especially the fourth-quartile producers have been there for the last couple of quarters. So I think that pressure is going to continue even if naphtha goes down. Naphtha probably would move more based on what happens with oil price."

And so I think you're going to continue to see that there's good balance in the supply/demand going forward.

But on the upstream side, when you get into areas of big volume use, like for example large commercial buildings, big industrial builds, some of that has slowed down and taken a little bit of pressure off of siloxanes. 
There's no new capacity coming on in siloxanes. We're working off a lot of capacity that got added in China over the last couple of years. And I think there's nothing on the horizon for the next 2 or 3 years in the siloxanes space. So it should continue to tighten from here.

I think the real thing that's changed here is you're starting to get a sense that the pressure on the consumer goods companies from the consumers would indicate there's probably a change in people's willingness to pay for a more recyclable or sustainable product. And so I think that is probably the more important question than the cost of this versus virgin plastics from virgin natural gas liquids or another feedstock. If it was more competitive, it would have already been done. But the reality is there are pressures out there and there are demands to go to a circular economy and there seems to be a growing consumer base that's willing to pay for that. Now we just have to work out what the value chain looks like. 
The second thing on the consumer side is we have a waste problem which none of us have our heads in the sand about. We have a plastic waste issue that needs to be resolved. And in order to drive that circular economy, we've got to come up with a way to value the plastic waste so that it can come back into that feedstock supply. And that's probably the bigger challenge. I think we will come up with a way to do it. I think everybody in the value chain that's part of the alliance that we've put together is trying to figure that out. But that's going to require some time and some things for us to work through. 
Meanwhile, the size of these projects that I'm talking about are going to help us learn more about what the cost positions are, are going to help us learn more about what the customer acceptance is going to be for these products and what the price point for that will be. And I think in another year or so, I'd have a better answer for you on what the relative values are."

Starting on Slide 3, our results in the third quarter demonstrate the Dow team's focus on managing the levers within our control while also making progress against our operational, financial",1106,"Thanks, Neal, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. Starting on Slide 3, our results in the third quarter demonstrate the Dow team's focus on managing the levers within our control while also making progress against our operational, financial and strategic priorities that we laid out for the new Dow at our Investor Day last year. At that time, we presented a clear set of priorities and targets along with a playbook to drive our execution. Since then, we have been diligently delivering on that plan. 
In the third quarter, we achieved top line performance that was in line with our guidance and bottom line results that exceeded expectations. In doing so, we delivered strong improvements from Q2 to Q3 across the board, EBIT margin, earnings and free cash flow. Here are some other notable highlights from our results. 
First, we continued to capture demand growth, particularly in sectors closer to the consumer where conditions remain favorable. Excluding Hydrocarbons & Energy, Dow's volume rose by 1% in the quarter led by consumer growth in packaging, polyurethanes and silicones application. 
Second, we grew earnings and margins sequentially, led by our plastics franchise. We leveraged our industry-leading feedstock flexibility in the United States and Europe. In Europe, we capitalized on the LPG advantage versus naphtha. And on the U.S. Gulf Coast, we made full use of new butane capabilities that we put in place earlier this year. And we successfully achieved 0 naphtha cracking this quarter, expanding our flexibility and avoiding an otherwise costly feedstock penalty. Additionally, we focused on recapturing price, a key improvement toward the end of the quarter in polyethylene. 
Third, we continued to drive down our cost structure. We reached a significant milestone in the quarter, successfully completing our $1.365 billion cost synergy program. Furthermore, we removed another $40 million of stranded costs in the quarter. 
And fourth, our results this quarter showed the ability of Dow's portfolio to generate strong cash flow. We generated $1.8 billion in cash flow from continuing operations and $1.3 billion in free cash flow. We improved our earnings to cash flow conversion as well as working capital improvements provided a source of cash. The cash flow story this quarter is a noteworthy highlight and Howard will unpack this later in the call. We accomplished all of this while navigating a business environment with limited visibility and while overcoming operational limitations in Argentina, where both of our crackers were down through the third quarter following a countrywide power outage in late June. 
And finally, we made important progress in our litigation with Nova Chemicals and in our deleveraging priorities. In September, a judgment was entered in Alberta, Canada ordering Nova Chemicals to pay Dow approximately $1.1 billion. On October 10, Dow received the related cash payment of approximately $800 million. Subsequently, we issued a make whole call for the full redemption of $1.25 billion of notes due in 2021, further reducing debt. This was another important step forward in strengthening our financial profile. 
Altogether, our results demonstrate the strengths of the Dow portfolio and our continued focus on executing the operational, financial and strategic playbook that we laid out a year ago. Now moving on to our segment results and the business performance in the quarter. 
On Slide 4, Packaging & Specialty Plastics expanded operating EBIT margin nearly 200 basis points year-over-year. Our results reflected demand growth in packaging applications, margin expansion, cost synergies and contributions from new capacity on the U.S. Gulf Coast which more than offset lower equity earnings. And notably on a sequential basis, EBIT grew 4% and operating EBIT margin expanded 100 basis points. Further, the results are particularly notable considering that the segment overcame a $100 million headwind from a combination of lost ethylene production and repair costs in Argentina. Our 2 crackers there are now back up and running. 
In the third quarter, we saw a continuation of solid demand in packaging application. The Packaging & Specialty Plastics business grew volume by 4% year-over-year. We again saw growth in Industrial & Consumer Packaging, Flexible Food & Specialty Packaging and health and hygiene application. Regionally, volume growth this quarter was led by Asia-Pacific and EMEAI. In Hydrocarbons & Energy, the business reported both lower volume and local price. The volume declines were an outcome of our drive for lighter feedslates in Europe which led to lower coproduct production volume. In addition, we had slightly lower merchant ethylene sales in the United States as a result of enhanced ethylene integration enabled by our new derivative capacity. 
On Slide 5, Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure operating EBIT decline versus the year-ago period primarily due to margin compression in the polyurethanes component and MEG as well as lower demand in industrial end markets. 
In Industrial Solutions, volume declined modestly as a result of lower demand in energy, agriculture and automotive end markets. This was partly offset by growth in catalyst application and demand in pharma end markets. The business reported a significant drop in its equity earnings driven by margin compression for MEG at our Kuwait joint ventures. 
Polyurethanes & Construction Chemicals sales declined on lower local pricing in all regions led by lower components prices. However, the business achieved volume growth driven by gains in the United States and Canada on improved MDI supply year-over-year as well as continued demand growth in polyurethane systems. 
Our growth in Systems reflects the business' focus on driving its downstream agenda and moving the portfolio from merchant component sales to higher-value formulated systems. It has been a multiyear journey and the progress we've made so far has been impressive. This quarter marked the 25th consecutive quarter of year-over-year volume growth for the Systems business. 
And finally on Slide 6. Performance Materials & Coatings operating EBIT fell from the year-ago period primarily due to siloxanes margin compression and lower demand in coatings and monomers. 
Consumer Solutions sales declined as volume gains in Asia-Pacific and the U.S. and Canada were more than offset by local price declines in all regions mainly driven by lower siloxanes prices. The business reported volume growth in infrastructure end markets and improved demand for siloxanes in Asia-Pacific. This was partly offset by soft demand in the automotive and consumer electronics end markets. 
Coatings & Performance Monomers reported a volume decline. On the coatings side, the business saw lower demand in the U.S. and Canada in architectural coating and soft demand in Asia-Pacific in industrial coatings end markets. 
I'll now turn it over to Howard to discuss our financial performance in the quarter, modeling guidance and the progress that we made against some of our key financial targets."

The decline was primarily driven by lower local pricing. Volume declined 2% year-over-year. This was largely driven by changes in Hydrocarbons & Energy related to our cracker feedslates combined with lower ethylene trade sales volume. Excluding Hydrocarbons & Energy, volume was up 1% versus the year-ago period driven by growth in packaging, polyurethanes and silicones applications. 
Sequentially, demand was higher in Packaging & Specialty Plastics and in Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure. Local price declined 12% primarily due to decreases in lower global energy prices year-over-year. Currency decreased sales by 1% as a result of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro. The earnings impact of currency was offset by year-over-year tailwinds from a lower tax rate and reduced interest expense. 
Equity losses were $44 million, a year-over-year headwind of nearly $180 million. The decrease was primarily due to lower results at the Kuwait joint ventures driven by margin compression in MEG and polyethylene. Equity losses at Sadara also increased primarily due to the impact of a third-party industrial gas supplier issue which has since been resolved. In the appendix of our earnings deck, we have included our additional disclosure for our 3 principal joint ventures which provides further details on their results. 
Overall, operating EBIT was $1.1 billion. Tailwinds in the quarter included savings from cost synergies and stranded cost removal as well as contributions from new capacity on the U.S. Gulf Coast. These gains were more than offset by a year-over-year margin compression in siloxanes and isocyanates, lower equity earnings and the impact from the Argentina outage. On a sequential basis, operating EBIT rose 5% or nearly $60 million, representing our first sequential EBIT increase in more than a year. Our operating EBIT margin also expanded 80 basis points led by margin expansion in Packaging & Specialty Plastics. 
We generated $1.8 billion of cash from continuing operations which reflected a reduced headwind from integration and separation spending and a $700 million release of cash from working capital. Relative to the year-ago period, our cash from continuing operations was up $1.6 billion. But recall that we made a voluntary pension contribution last year of $1.1 billion. After adjusting for this, the underlying operation delivered a $500 million increase in cash flow versus the same quarter last year. 
And finally, we returned $600 million to our owners in the quarter, including $500 million of paid dividends and $100 million of share repurchases. Since spin, we have completed $400 million of share repurchases and we remain on track to achieve our target of $500 million for the year. 
Moving to Slide 8 and our modeling guidance for the fourth quarter. As we have for the past couple of quarters, we're again providing our segment guidance on a sequential basis to reflect the most relevant comparison in today's environment. At the total Dow level, we see core EBIT tailwinds sequentially as headwinds from normal fourth quarter seasonality in coatings and infrastructure markets and modest impacts from turnarounds are offset by nearly $150 million of add-backs from onetime events in the third quarter, including the impact of our outage in Argentina. 
In Performance Materials & Coatings, we expect siloxanes pricing to remain at about the same level as we exited the third quarter. In coatings and monomers, we expect to see the normal seasonal reduction in profitability and the business will also absorb 1/3 of the impact from our planned PDH turnaround that is currently underway. 
Moving to Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure. This segment will absorb the remainder of the PDH turnaround impact, and MEG prices on average are projected to be similar to the third quarter. 
And finally, in the Packaging & Specialty Plastics segment, we see feedstock price trends continuing to drive lighter cracker feedslates in the U.S. and Europe which will continue to reduce our top line sales of coproducts. We expect a modest sequential headwind as we complete a large turnaround in The Netherlands, and we anticipate reduced catalyst and licensing earnings in the quarter, which by their nature are lumpy. On the positive side, our Argentina assets are now back online so they will once again be positively contributing to our results. 
Turning to Slide 9. There are 2 areas where I'd like to highlight the progress we've made against our financial targets. The first is our capital structure, specifically the deleveraging and liability management we've done this year. As you'll recall from our Investor Day last year, we outlined our capital structure priorities and our deleveraging targets. 
And as you see on this slide, we have been delivering on our plan, making significant progress in improving and smoothing our debt maturity profile and maintaining our liquidity position. We have opportunistically refinanced upcoming maturities and we secured the option to extend the outstanding $2 billion on our term loan by an additional 2 years to the second half of 2023. So far this year, we have completed $2 billion of gross deleveraging. And with our recent $1.25 billion debt redemption announcement which was supported by the cash proceeds we received from Nova, we will complete more than $3 billion of gross deleveraging by the end of this year. 
The result of these actions is that we do not have a significant debt maturity due until 2022 and we have maintained our strong liquidity position, which is more than $10 billion. These accomplishments align to the financial priorities we outlined a year ago: Maintaining a strong capital structure, reducing risk, lowering interest expense and preserving our financial strength and flexibility. 
Moving to Slide 10. The second financial highlight is the progress we have made in our cash flow generation and the potential we see to improve further from here. Looking at the trailing 12 months, we have delivered $3.2 billion of free cash flow, but our results do not yet fully reflect our underlying potential. The reason for this, as we highlighted at the start of the year, is that we have had short-term cash headwinds from 2 discrete factors: Post-spin integration and separation activities and interest expense. On both fronts, peak spending is behind us. 
Through the third quarter, we have spent more than $1 billion on integration and separation spending in 2019 and we expect the full year spend to be in the range of $1.2 billion, in line with our target for the year. This spending is beginning to recede. And looking ahead, we expect the 2020 cash spend to be in the range of $200 million to $300 million or a year-over-year release of cash of about $1 billion. 
And on interest expense, as I highlighted, we have accomplished a substantial amount of deleveraging and liability management. This has put us in a position today where we see our 2020 run rate interest expense being $100 million lower than where we started in 2019. These 2 factors alone represent more than $1 billion of cash flow uplift in 2020 that are completely within our control and independent of market conditions. 
We also continue to pursue nonoperational cash inflows, notably the additional litigation we have pending with Nova, and our teams continue to also focus on operational improvements such as greater working capital efficiency. These improvements will not only boost gross cash flow but should also lift our earnings to cash conversion. 
Our focus on cash is paying off, and all other things equal, our free cash flow is poised to expand. This additional flexibility preserves our ability to deliver against our financial priorities, including our strong shareholder returns and further deleveraging. 
Now I'd like to hand it back to Jim to discuss our progress on our cost and growth priorities as well as our near-term outlook."

I'll start with our cost-out priorities. The progress we've made on our cost reductions has been proceeding faster than we planned. In the third quarter, we successfully completed our $1.365 billion cost synergy prog",974,"Thanks, Howard. Turning to Slide 11. I'll start with our cost-out priorities. 
The progress we've made on our cost reductions has been proceeding faster than we planned. In the third quarter, we successfully completed our $1.365 billion cost synergy program which we finished about 1 to 2 quarters ahead of schedule. On the stranded cost removal side, we eliminated an additional $40 million and have already exceeded $125 million in cumulative savings. 
Just before our spin, we laid out a target to deliver $600 million of our remaining $800 million of cost synergy savings and stranded cost removal in 2019. Based on the progress we've made through the third quarter, we now expect to deliver approximately $700 million of savings this year with the remaining $100 million to be realized in the first half of 2020. The Dow team has done an excellent job in putting together a robust cost-out plan that identifies, delivers and tracks these savings, and they have kept up that focus for more than 2 years to ensure our steady delivery against our target. 
Turning to Slide 12 and perhaps what I'm most proud of is that the Dow story has not only been about cost, but we've also continued to drive several high-return growth projects. A year ago, we told you that the new Dow has a well-defined growth roadmap that includes a robust pipeline of attractive investment, projects that are lower-risk, faster-payback, lower capital intensity and higher return on invested capital. As the macro environment changed, we quickly adjusted our capital spending target for the year to $2 billion and we intensified our criteria for approving and advancing projects. 
In the third quarter alone, we advanced several projects. We announced the retrofit of one of our crackers in Louisiana with our proprietary fluidized catalytic dehydrogenation technology to produce on-purpose propylene. We see the FCDh technology as a game-changer for the industry. It promises reduced capital intensity, lower energy usage and lower greenhouse gas emission. FCDh not only drives return on invested capital benefits but it also advances our sustainability agenda when compared to all conventional PDH technologies. 
We launched AGILITY CE, a new resin made with 70% post-consumer recycled plastics, which incorporates recycled plastic shrink film into low-density polyethylene. 
We also announced 2 partnerships that showcase circular economy solutions for plastics: The Fuenix agreement allows Dow to incorporate recycled plastic waste back into our feedstock supply; and second, the UPM Biofuels technology enables plastic solutions made from bio-based renewable feedstock. Both solutions reduce carbon emission without impacting the performance of our final products. 
In our silicones franchise, we continued to greenlight incremental debottlenecks. Through the third quarter, we have completed 14 of the 18 downstream capacity expansions that we planned for this year. We reached the final investment decision for our previously announced flexible alkoxylation capacity to support our customers' growth in infrastructure and home and personal care end markets. This U.S. Gulf Coast unit is expected to start up by the end of 2021. And furthermore, we recently signed a 10-year supply agreement with a key customer, securing the baseload volume for this facility, representing $900 million of new revenue over the life of the contract. 
And on the digital front, we launched a new Dow.com, featuring an expanded e-commerce platform. Year-to-date, we have already achieved nearly $3 billion of sales through this channel and we're just getting started. These are just a few of the investments that we believe will fuel our growth, deliver productivity improvements, enhance customer experience and further drive us toward our sustainability goals. 
Turning to our market outlook on Slide 13. As we look around the globe at key commodity products, our view is that in many cases, the margin for high-cost producers has essentially been bouncing around the breakeven point for at least the past 2 quarters. On this slide, we showcase a few prime examples. In MEG, Asian spot spreads have been at or slightly below the breakeven point for most of the year. And there have been reports over the past 2 quarters of high-cost producers dialing back production. In MDI, we see spreads in Asia bouncing around the historic low point. And in ethylene, the high-cost producer margins are thin and projected to go to 0 while the ethylene margin for producers in the Americas remains healthy. 
Our base case remains that the global economy will continue growing albeit at a slower pace. In that scenario, based on historical spreads in our products' chains, we see a floor to further margin deterioration and a good upside to normalized levels when fundamentals tighten. In this environment, Dow remains well positioned thanks to our competitive positions on the cost curve driven by our feedstock flexibility, our scale and significant presence in lower-cost regions such as Canada, Argentina and the U.S. Gulf Coast. 
To sum it up on Slide 14, 2019 has been our year to successfully reintroduce a more focused, more streamlined Dow, execute our playbook and showcase our financial and capital discipline. We believe the results of our actions will continue to show in our earnings, deliver enhanced cash flows and preserve our financial strength. 
As you've seen from us all year and especially in the third quarter, we are delivering as we promised. And as we look to the near-term future, our mindset does not change. The current business environment demands discipline, and that is why we'll continue to leverage our feedstock flexibility, advance our lower-risk, higher-return growth investments while staying in line with our $2 billion capital expenditure target this year and continue driving a best-in-class reduced cost structure by delivering the remaining stranded cost removal. 
In sum, the steps that we're taking today position us well to leverage increased value when the industrial economy rebounds. 
Now I'll turn it back to Neal to open the Q&A."

We see strong growth in Asia. So we're up double digits out there. We see good growth around the world.

And what that does is really it widens our feedstock flexibility, so it gives us another range of flexibility that we didn't have. And that was important this quarter because ethane was really low and also propane was low in the quarter. Propane being low meant we cracked pretty aggressively LPGs in Europe. And we think that we will continue to do that through fourth quarter and first quarter into next year. And sometimes in the wintertime, if gas prices tick up, you would see that might be limited a little bit. But the outlook for gas as we go into this winter and the inventories and the current prices mean that we're going to be cracking LPGs. 
I don't know if the change that we have on cracking 0 naphtha in the Gulf Coast is going to have a big impact on naphtha cost to everyone else. I would say that in Asia, the naphtha crackers today are at about breakeven margins.

We also move obviously some materials into ag films and some other Industrial & Consumer Packaging. The consumer packaging is holding up fine, the industrial's been a little bit slower. But our volumes have been good. 
The consumer side has been a strong pull for us around the world and it was a very strong quarter for us in Asia. And having said that, with -- even with that demand, we saw prices up at the end of third quarter, up $0.03 higher than the IHS integrated margin levels. So I think that's a combination of our own pricing activity as well as our ability to capture the spreads by the feedstock flexibility that we've got. 
We're continuing to add products to the line to expand that consumer side and to address some of the challenges on a circular economy, so you saw AGILITY CE in there.

But on the upstream side, when you get into areas of big volume use, like for example large commercial buildings, big industrial builds, some of that has slowed down and taken a little bit of pressure off of siloxanes. 
There's no new capacity coming on in siloxanes. We're working off a lot of capacity that got added in China over the last couple of years. And I think there's nothing on the horizon for the next 2 or 3 years in the siloxanes space. So it should continue to tighten from here.

I think the real thing that's changed here is you're starting to get a sense that the pressure on the consumer goods companies from the consumers would indicate there's probably a change in people's willingness to pay for a more recyclable or sustainable product. And so I think that is probably the more important question than the cost of this versus virgin plastics from virgin natural gas liquids or another feedstock. If it was more competitive, it would have already been done. But the reality is there are pressures out there and there are demands to go to a circular economy and there seems to be a growing consumer base that's willing to pay for that. Now we just have to work out what the value chain looks like. 
The second thing on the consumer side is we have a waste problem which none of us have our heads in the sand about. We have a plastic waste issue that needs to be resolved. And in order to drive that circular economy, we've got to come up with a way to value the plastic waste so that it can come back into that feedstock supply. And that's probably the bigger challenge. I think we will come up with a way to do it. I think everybody in the value chain that's part of the alliance that we've put together is trying to figure that out. But that's going to require some time and some things for us to work through. 
Meanwhile, the size of these projects that I'm talking about are going to help us learn more about what the cost positions are, are going to help us learn more about what the customer acceptance is going to be for these products and what the price point for that will be. And I think in another year or so, I'd have a better answer for you on what the relative values are."
