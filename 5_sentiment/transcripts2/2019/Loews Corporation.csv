Loews' had a disappointing fourth quarter with results negatively affected by higher-than-expected catastrophe losses in CNA and severe declines in the stock market at the end of 2018, impacting both Loews' and CNA's investment portfolios.
Specifically, with regards to CNA, let's put these equity-related losses in context. While the stock market declines 14% in the fourth quarter, CNA's limited partnership and common equity portfolios were down 5.7% or about $138 million. Counterbalancing CNA's fourth quarter investment performance, underlying operations for the full year were strong. In 2018, net written premiums grew by 4% and rate increased by 2.6%. CNA's underlying combined ratio improved for the second straight year. And while CNA's loss ratio ticked up slightly in 2018, it's essentially on par with its top quartile peers. Additionally, CNA has reduced its expense ratio by 2 points over the past 2 years, while still making necessary investments in technology, analytics and talent.
Earlier today, in light of the full year 2018 results and its strong balance sheet and the CNA board's positive outlooks, CNA declared a $0.35 quarterly dividend as well as a $2 special dividend. These dividend payments will result in Loews receiving $570 million in dividends from CNA in March of this year. Over the last 5 years, including the upcoming March dividend payment, Loews will have received almost $4 billion in dividends from CNA.
Moving on to Loews Hotels, I'm happy to report that the company had a stellar year. In 2018, Loews Hotels adjusted EBITDA grew by 15%, and has nearly doubled since 2014. This tremendous progress is due to operational improvements and the company's ongoing commitment to grow in 2 focused areas. First, Loews Hotels is concentrating on highly profitable, distinguished hotels that cater to group business. These hotels are better able to withstand disruptors such as the sharing economy. These hotels typically have between 300 and 800 rooms, along with significant meeting space, properties such as our hotels in Chicago in Miami Beach as well as the soon-to-be opened Loews City Hotel.
The other area of focus for Loews Hotels continues to be developing hotel properties that have unique built-in demand generators. More than 20 years ago, Loews Hotels' CEO, John Fish, set the strategy in motion with the company's initial 50-50 partnership with NBC Universal in developing hotels on their Orlando theme park campus, partnership that has resulted in a highly profitable, long-term joint venture for Loews Hotels and Universal. Starting with the Loews Port of Fino Bay Hotel in 1999 with 750 rooms, the partnership now has 6 properties on the Orlando campus with 6,200 rooms. There are another 2,800 rooms under construction, the first 750, of which are set to open in June of this year. These hotels in Orlando dramatically outperform their competitive set in average daily rate, occupancy rate and therefore, RevPAR.
We hope to continue our success in managing themed concepts and one-of-a-kind destinations with our Live by Loews Hotel. The Live by Loews Hotel in Arlington, Texas, being developed in partnership with the companies in the Texas Rangers is set to open the summer at the base of the globe park and next to AT&T Stadium. In early 2020, the Live by Loews in St. Louis will open. We are partnering with the Quarters companies on this hotel as well, along with the St. Louis Cardinals. The property will be located next to Busch Stadium.
Before turning the call over to David, I want to discuss share repurchases, which I believe have been, and will continue to be a significant means of creating value for Loews shareholders. In 2018, we repurchased a little over 20 million shares of Loews common stock for just over $1 billion, which was the equivalent of about 6% of our outstanding shares. We don't have an automatic share repurchase program because we're sensitive to the price at which we buyback our shares. We repurchased Loews stock only one is trading below our view of its true intrinsic value. We believe this capital allocation tool -- tools is one of the best ways to create value for all those shareholders over the intermediate to long-term.
And on that note, David, over to you."
285930,599253573,1652441,"Loews Corporation, Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Feb 11, 2019",2019-02-11,"Earnings Calls","Loews Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and good morning. Today, we reported a fourth quarter net loss of $165 million or $0.53 per share as compared to net income of $481 million or $1.43 per share on last year's fourth quarter.For the full year, we reported net income of $63",1563,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning. Today, we reported a fourth quarter net loss of $165 million or $0.53 per share as compared to net income of $481 million or $1.43 per share on last year's fourth quarter.
For the full year, we reported net income of $636 million or $1.99 per share, down from $1.16 billion or $3.45 per share in 2017. As a reminder, included in last year's fourth quarter and full year net income, was a $200 million net benefit related to the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. We have included a table in our earnings supplement, laying out the impact of this net benefit by reporting segment.
In my ensuing remarks, I will speak to results before the Q4 2017 impact of the tax act. Note that the year-over-year comparisons were also affected by the ongoing impact of the lower U.S. corporate U.S. tax rate.
Let me start by discussing the key drivers of our fourth quarter loss, and then turn my attention to our full year results. As Jim mentioned, the 2 main drags on our earnings in Q4 were: Investments results at both CNA and the parent company caused by a difficult equity market conditions; and catastrophe losses at CNA, caused primarily by hurricane Michael and the California wildfires.
At CNA, the company's limited partnership and common stock investments lost ground in the fourth quarter, yielding a negative return versus positive results in Q4 2017. This swing accounted for $126 million of the decline in CNA's contribution to our net income. As Jim highlighted, negative returns in the quarter when the S&P 500 was down 14% are no surprise. Additionally, at CNA, the company had realized investment losses in the fourth quarter versus realized gains last year. This change accounted for another $73 million of the decline in CNA's net income contribution.
The Loews parent company portfolio of limited partnership and common stock investments also lost ground in Q4, accounting for $82 million of the decline in after-tax investment income. A lower level of invested assets in 2018 also contributed to the year-over-year decline.
As for the catastrophe losses, CNA booked $146 million of pretax losses in the fourth quarter as compared to just $38 million in last year's fourth quarter. CNA is in the business of assuming risk so it fully expects to absorb catastrophe losses in the quarter with such a significant statutory activity. The higher level of catastrophe losses at CNA accounted for $81 million of the year-over-year decline in CNA's contribution to our net income.
To summarize, the factors cited above in total accounted for over 80% of the year-over-year decline in our quarterly net income, excluding the onetime impact of the tax act. A couple more observations on the quarter before turning to the full year. Average shares outstanding of declined 7% from last year's fourth quarter reflecting our share repurchase activity and the reduction in the corporate tax rate actually exaggerated the size of the year-to-year quarterly variance in our after-tax results, given the pretax losses at CNA, Diamond and the parent company.
Now let me review our full year results. As I mentioned earlier, our net income of $636 million in 2018 was lower than the $964 million we earned in 2017, which excludes the $200 million one-time impact of the tax act.
CNA's core underwriting results were strong in 2018 as it posted a consistent underlying combined ratio of 95.4%, a net written premium growth of 4%. Catastrophe losses were actually down on an annual basis but offsetting this, the company posted a lesser amount of favorable prior-year development. All in all, at CNA, pretax underwriting income was up modestly.
The main drivers, therefore, of the year-to-year decline in CNA's contribution to our net income were net realized investment losses, lower P&C net investment income and increased charges related to the loss portfolio transfer.
Let me touch on all
[Audio Gap]
CNA swung from realized gains in 2017 to losses in 2018. This swing reduced our net income by $112 million relative to last year. P&C investment income for 2018 was hurt by a $42 million pretax loss generated by limited partnership and common stock investments as compared to $207 million of pretax gains in the prior year. This change reduced our net income by $150 million versus last year.
Finally, CNA's corporate segment contributed to the year-to-year decline, largely due to prior-year development on the loss portfolio transfer with the national indemnity. As a reminder, in 2010, CNA seeded essentially all of its privacy expresses and environmental liabilities to national indemnity through a loss portfolio transfer. Activity under the loss portfolio transfer is accounted for using retroactive reinsurance accounting, which is described in all its glory in our 10-K.
CNA recorded adverse net prior year reserve development under the loss portfolio of transfer in 2018, which reduced Loews' year-over-year net income by $34 million.
Turning to Diamond. Diamond Offshore reported a pretax loss of $226 million as compared to a loss of $22 million in 2017. Stripping out nonrecurring items such as asset impairments in both years and a loss on the early extinguishment of debt in 2017, the year-to-year pretax comparison is a pretax loss of $176 million in 2018 against pretax income of $118 million in 2017. Diamond continue to experience a fall out in revenues in 2018, given the difficult market conditions and the effects of contract renegotiations. Contract drilling revenues fell 27% at both the revenue earning days and average daily revenue declined.
Operating expenses, excluding the nonrecurring items, declined only 6%, resulting in a swing from pretax operating income in 2017 to an operating loss in 2018. As we've discussed, Diamond is positioning itself for an eventual upturn. In 2019, Diamond will be investing approximately $350 million in its fleet to ensure its race continue to be considered top-tier by customers.
Diamond ended the year with over $450 million in cash and equivalents. The company has over $1.2 billion of a revolver capacity until 2020 and $950 million of capacity into 2023.
Boardwalk experienced a 32% decline in pretax income in 2018, which excludes the loss on the sale of a processing plant in 2017. Net revenues declined to 5% as transportation revenues from growth projects and higher system utilization were more than offset by unfavorable parking loan and storage revenues as well as the net negative impact of transportation contract expirations, renewals and restructurings. Moreover, expenses were up given higher depreciation expense from new growth projects, resulting in pretax margins declining from 27% to 20%.
Despite the decline in pretax income, Boardwalk's contribution to our net income, excluding the loss on sale and one-time tax act impact, rose from $101 million in 2017 to $135 million in 2018. The increased net income contribution relates to our purchase in July of 2018 of the outstanding publicly-held common units of Boardwalk. For the second half of the year, we included 100% of Boardwalk's earnings in our net income versus just 50% -- 51% during all of 2017 and the first half of 2018.
As Jim mentioned, Loews Hotels had a strong year, generating pretax income of $73 million, up from $65 million in 2017. Excluding all nonrecurring items such as impairments, disposition gains and losses and pre-opening expenses, pretax income increased from $54 million in 2017 to $72 million in 2018. The expense of Loews Hotels nonrecurring items, primarily relates to ongoing portfolio management, along with the development of new properties, all consistent with the company's strategic focus on group meetings hotels and immersive destinations.
Loews Hotels adjusted EBITDA, which is defined and disclosed in our quarterly earnings supplement, rose 15% in 2018 totaled $228 million. Numerous properties, including the 6 hotels at the Universal Orlando Resort, the Loews Miami Beach Hotel and the Loews Philadelphia, to name just a few, performed well during the year.
Current Company net investment income was down meaningfully in 2018. The small loss we posted for the year stemmed from disappointing returns on our holdings of equity securities and LPs, again, largely attributable to the equity market drop in Q4. Also, our portfolio of cash and investments averaged $3.9 billion in 2018, down from an average of over $5 billion in 2017. Share repurchase activity and the purchase of the Boardwalk units caused the decrease.
We continue to maintain an extremely strong and liquid balance sheet. At year-end, the parent company portfolio totaled $3.1 billion with 62% in cash equivalence, 33% in LPs and marketable equity securities and the remaining 5% in fixed maturities.
During the fourth quarter, we received $110 million in dividends from our subsidiaries. $85 million from CNA and $25 million from Boardwalk. For the full year, we received a total dividends of $878 million from CNA and Boardwalk with CNA contributing $801 million of that amount.
Today, CNA declared a $2 per share special dividend in addition to its regular $0.35 quarterly dividend. Combining the 2, Loews will receive $570 million in dividends from CNA this quarter. We repurchased [ 2 point million ] shares in the fourth quarter for $135 million and 20.3 million shares during all of 2018 for just over $1 billion. Since year-end, we have repurchased an additional 0.9 million shares at an average price of about $46.50.
I will now hand the call back to Mary."

First of all, earnings were very ugly, but it was driven by 2 main factors: One was catastrophe losses and in that department, our catastrophe losses for the quarter were $146 million versus $38 million in the prior year. I should add that the $146 million of catastrophe losses that we had in the quarter was in no way disproportionate to the size of CNA. On a combined ratio basis, that was 8.6 points versus 2.3 points in the prior year fourth quarter; aside from catastrophe losses, the other thing that hurt CNA's earnings significantly was the investment results. And specifically, the results from our LP portfolio and common stocks, which was $138 million loss in the quarter versus our fourth quarter of the prior year, which was a $50 million gain. And in my opinion,, those 2 temporary factors or overshadowing a lot of the good things that are going on at CNA. Net written premiums for the year last year were up 4%, gross written premiums were up 7% and the difference between the 7% and the 4% is the additional reinsurance that CNA is purchasing. The underlying combined ratio was 95.4%, about the same as last year. CNA paid a dividend, announced the quarterly -- regular quarterly dividend as well as $2 special dividend, in my opinion, reflecting the board's confidence in the results of CNA and the way that the company is operating and proceeding. CNA continues to achieve significant rate increases across a number of lines. So from my perspective, things at CNA, notwithstanding the relatively ugly quarter, are really going pretty well."

What we've seen is that there is a generational shift in spending where the millennial generation is moving more towards experiences rather than things. We see this play out, especially in Orlando, with our joint venture with Universal theme parks. We have 6 hotels there, and we're building a seventh hotel now that has 2,800 rooms. On the Comcast earnings call, Brian Roberts reported something that we already knew that the occupancy ratio of our Orlando hotels is 90 -- over 90%. And, as I mentioned in my remarks as a result of the occupancy ratio and the higher-than-market average daily rate, we are able to achieve extraordinary RevPAR numbers in that market. So what we've done is we've taken the learnings that we have from Orlando, and we've applied it to the rest of our business. First, we are striving to be close to demand generators, whether it's a sports arena, a stadium or a convention center. Secondly, we are working hard to leverage our unique position in the hotel business. We own our own hotels, we're not a manager of hotels. And therefore, we are willing to put up money to develop hotel properties and as a result, we find that partners are very willing to work with us, and those partners are financial partners as well as municipal partners. And as a result, we are able -- we find to procure for ourselves very attractive development opportunities, which we're now moving forward with in St. Louis, in Arlington and Kansas City. When investing holding company cash, we're very, very cognizant of the need to earn good rates of return, and we believe that the hotels that we're investing in are doing just that. We have a team that's continuing to look for additional opportunities and I suspect that in the coming years, we'll see opportunities as attractive to us as what we're doing in these 3 new markets that we're developing right now."

And I like to think that with respect to offshore drilling, I've seen this movie before in the supertanker business. In the supertanker business, there was a group of supertankers in the early '80s through scrapping, deterioration of the rigs and a slight increase in demand we saw whipsaw recovery in the mid- to late '80s. And I see for offshore drilling, a similar thing that's happening now. First of all, all the offshore drilling companies are managing to one thing and one thing only at this point in time, and that is to cash. Cash is the thing that they're not earning, that they desperately need in order to stay in business. So for the rigs that are not operating, it's a big risk for them to spend cash on maintaining those rigs with no business opportunities in sight. And what happens, I've seen very clearly from the tanker industry and also from offshore drilling, is that when ships, rigs, drillships, are left on the water, and they're not operating, then they can deteriorate very rapidly. Combined with that, right now, oil prices are relatively low at about $52 a barrel for WTI, and about $61 a barrel for Brent oil. My belief is that with an increasing oil prices, which I see happening, I think we could see over the coming years, a pretty significant increase in demand and that demand increase will first to go to rigs that are already operating, and then later on to rigs that are stacked. Our estimation is that the cost to recommission a rig that's been stocked for a number of years can easily be in excess of $100 million per rig, and that cash, today, just doesn't exist in the industry to recommission more than a few rigs. So I think that the recommissioning of rigs will be slow, especially in view of the fact that our customers turning to like to use rigs that have already been working rather than rigs that are being recommissioned. So I think it's going to be a long time for rigs to come back to meet the demand that I foresee going forward. In terms of Diamond, diamond has a relatively long runway within the industry. Diamond had at the end of the quarter, about $450 million in cash, and it has an additional borrowing capacity of about $1 billion. So its got close to $1.5 billion of liquidity that really is the runway for Diamond, which is substantially, in excess of a lot of our other competitors. In terms of consolidation, we've worked for opportunities that what I would say is the -- we have not been able to find any transactions that would be accretive to value for all Diamond shareholders. So we continue to look for opportunities. I would say that the spread between digging as for drilling assets is very wide and the only transactions that really seem to get done these days are transactions where somebody gives their shares in return for buying other shares. But we continue to scour the earth to have discussions but to date, there's not much to report."

At Loews, in the first 5 weeks, 5 or 6 weeks of this year, we have earned back all that we lost in the fourth quarter of last year. So we reported a loss of about $70 million in our portfolio in the fourth quarter of last year, and the portfolio, it was up by more than that at Loews. At CNA, they've recovered over 60% of their losses. Let me take a minute and talk about the different types of things that people can be invested in. You can invest in stocks, you can invest in hedge funds, you can invest in private equity, and one of the things that's struck me this past -- in the past few months is that in the fourth quarter, the S&P 500 was down 14%, our hedge funds were down about 6% and generally, across the board, private equity firms have reported no loss at all. And I actually find that quite incredulous, it's what I would call a self-graded exam. So there was a temporary drop in the market and the private equity firms didn't report a loss. It's inconceivable for me that stocks could be down 14% and that there is no loss in private equity. So CNA is, in some ways, bearing the pain of being mark to market, whereas a private equity, there is more of a, what I would call, a mark to moving average, but it's just something that we have to deal with. In terms of the strategy, CNA has had a very good run with hedge funds, as has Loews. We're starting to deemphasize them because we think that, #1, there's an awful lot of capital that's invested in them. We think the returns has been competed down. Additionally, in today's -- over the past 10 years, you were able to earn 0 on your cash balances. Today, you can easily earn 2.5% to 3%. So simply investing in cash is not such a terrible alternative to hedge funds. We're looking at risk assets that go beyond hedge funds and private equity. We're looking at certain debt instruments. We're looking at certain, what I would call, nontraditional private equity investments.

Loews' had a disappointing fourth quarter, with results negatively affected by higher-than-expected catastrophe losses in CNA and severe declines in the stock market at the end of 2018, impacting both Loews' and CNA's in",706,"Thank you, Mary, and good morning. Loews' had a disappointing fourth quarter, with results negatively affected by higher-than-expected catastrophe losses in CNA and severe declines in the stock market at the end of 2018, impacting both Loews' and CNA's investment portfolios.
Specifically, with regard to CNA, let's put these equity-related losses in context. While the stock market declined 14% in the fourth quarter, CNA's limited partnership and common equity portfolios were down 5.7% or about $138 million. Counterbalancing CNA's fourth quarter investment performance, underlying operations for the full year were strong. In 2018, net written premiums grew by 4% and rate increased by 2.6%. CNA's underlying combined ratio improved for the second straight year. And while CNA's loss ratio ticked up slightly in 2018, it's essentially on par with its top quartile peers. Additionally, CNA has reduced its expense ratio by 2 points over the past 2 years while still making necessary investments in technology, analytics and talent.
Earlier today, in light of the full year 2018 results and its strong balance sheet and the CNA board's positive outlook, CNA declared a $0.35 quarterly dividend as well as a $2 special dividend. These dividend payments will result in Loews receiving $570 million in dividends from CNA in March of this year. Over the last 5 years, including the upcoming March dividend payment, Loews will have received almost $4 billion in dividends from CNA.
Moving on to Loews Hotels, I'm happy to report that the company had a stellar year. In 2018, Loews Hotels adjusted EBITDA grew by 15% and has nearly doubled since 2014. This tremendous progress is due to operational improvements and the company's ongoing commitment to grow in 2 focused areas. First, Loews Hotels is concentrating on highly profitable, distinguished hotels that cater to group business. These hotels are better able to withstand disruptors such as the sharing economy. These hotels typically have between 300 and 800 rooms, along with significant meeting space, properties such as our hotels in Chicago in Miami Beach as well as the soon-to-be opened Loews Kansas City Hotel.
The other area of focus for Loews Hotels continues to be developing hotel properties that have unique built-in demand generators. More than 20 years ago, Loews Hotels' CEO, John Fish, set the strategy in motion with the company's initial 50-50 partnership with NBCUniversal in developing hotels on their Orlando theme park campus, a partnership that has resulted in a highly profitable, long-term joint venture for Loews Hotels and Universal. 
Starting with the Loews Portofino Bay Hotel in 1999 with 750 rooms, the partnership now has 6 properties on the Orlando campus with 6,200 rooms. There are another 2,800 rooms under construction, the first 750, of which are set to open in June of this year. These hotels in Orlando dramatically outperform their competitive set in average daily rate, occupancy rate and, therefore, RevPAR.
We hope to continue our success in managing themed concepts and one-of-a-kind destinations with our Live! By Loews hotels. The Live! By Loews hotel in Arlington, Texas, being developed in partnership with The Cordish Companies and the Texas Rangers, is set to open this summer at the base of Globe Life Park and next to AT&T Stadium. In early 2020, the Live! By Loews in St. Louis will open. We are partnering with The Cordish Companies on this hotel as well, along with the St. Louis Cardinals. The property will be located next to Busch Stadium.
Before turning the call over to David, I want to discuss share repurchases, which I believe have been and will continue to be a significant means of creating value for Loews shareholders. In 2018, we repurchased a little over 20 million shares of Loews common stock for just over $1 billion, which was the equivalent of about 6% of our outstanding shares. We don't have an automatic share repurchase program because we're sensitive to the price at which we buy back our shares. We repurchase Loews stock only one is trading below our view of its true intrinsic value. We believe this capital allocation tool is one of the best ways to create value for all our shareholders over the intermediate to long term.
And on that note, David, over to you."

Today we reported a fourth quarter net loss of $165 million or $0.53 per share as compared to net income of $481 million or $1.43 per share on last year's fourth quarter.For the full year, we reported net income of $636",1556,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning. Today we reported a fourth quarter net loss of $165 million or $0.53 per share as compared to net income of $481 million or $1.43 per share on last year's fourth quarter.
For the full year, we reported net income of $636 million or $1.99 per share, down from $1.16 billion or $3.45 per share in 2017. As a reminder, included in last year's fourth quarter and full year net income was a $200 million net benefit related to the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. We have included a table in our earnings supplement, laying out the impact of this net benefit by reporting segment.
In my ensuing remarks, I will speak to results before the Q4 of 2017 impact of the tax act. Note that the year-over-year comparisons were also affected by the ongoing impact of the lower U.S. corporate U.S. tax rate.
Let me start by discussing the key drivers of our fourth quarter loss, and then turn my attention to our full year results. As Jim mentioned, the 2 main drags on our earnings in Q4 were: investments results at both CNA and the parent company caused by a difficult equity market conditions; and catastrophe losses at CNA, caused primarily by Hurricane Michael and the California wildfires.
At CNA, the company's limited partnership and common stock investments lost ground in the fourth quarter, yielding a negative return versus positive results in Q4 of 2017. This swing accounted for $126 million of the decline in CNA's contribution to our net income. As Jim highlighted, negative returns in the quarter when the S&P 500 was down 14% are no surprise. Additionally, at CNA, the company had realized investment losses in the fourth quarter versus realized gains last year. This change accounted for another $73 million of the decline in CNA's net income contribution.
The Loews parent company portfolio of limited partnership and common stock investments also lost ground in Q4, accounting for $82 million of the decline in after-tax investment income. A lower level of invested assets in 2018 also contributed to the year-over-year decline.
As for the catastrophe losses, CNA booked $146 million of pretax losses in the fourth quarter as compared to just $38 million in last year's fourth quarter. CNA is in the business of assuming risk, so it fully expects to absorb catastrophe losses in the quarter with such significant catastrophe activity. The higher level of catastrophe losses at CNA accounted for $81 million of the year-over-year decline in CNA's contribution to our net income.
To summarize, the factors cited above in total accounted for over 80% of the year-over-year decline in our quarterly net income, excluding the onetime impact of the tax act. 
A couple more observations on the quarter before turning to the full year. Average shares outstanding declined 7% from last year's fourth quarter, reflecting our share repurchase activity, and the reduction in the corporate tax rate actually exaggerated the size of the year-to-year quarterly variance in our after-tax results, given the pretax losses at CNA, Diamond and the parent company.
Now let me review our full year results. As I mentioned earlier, our net income of $636 million in 2018 was lower than the $964 million we earned in 2017, which excludes the $200 million onetime impact of the tax act.
CNA's core underwriting results were strong in 2018 as it posted a consistent underlying combined ratio of 95.4% and net written premium growth of 4%. Catastrophe losses were actually down on an annual basis, but offsetting this, the company posted a lesser amount of favorable prior-year development. All in all, at CNA, pretax underwriting income was up modestly.
The main drivers, therefore, of the year-to-year decline in CNA's contribution to our net income were net realized investment losses, lower P&C net investment income and increased charges related to the loss portfolio transfer.
Let me touch on all
[Audio Gap]
CNA swung from realized gains in 2017 to losses in 2018. This swing reduced our net income by $112 million relative to last year. P&C investment income for 2018 was hurt by a $42 million pretax loss generated by limited partnership and common stock investments as compared to $207 million of pretax gains in the prior year. This change reduced our net income by $150 million versus last year.
  
Finally, CNA's corporate segment contributed to the year-to-year decline, largely due to prior-year development on the loss portfolio transfer with National Indemnity. As a reminder, in 2010, CNA ceded substantially all of its legacy asbestos and environmental liabilities to National Indemnity through a loss portfolio transfer. Activity under the loss portfolio transfer is accounted for using retroactive reinsurance accounting, which is described in all its glory in our 10-K.
CNA recorded adverse net prior year reserve development under the loss portfolio transfer in 2018, which reduced Loews' year-over-year net income by $34 million.
Turning to Diamond. Diamond Offshore reported a pretax loss of $226 million as compared to a loss of $22 million in 2017. Stripping out nonrecurring items such as asset impairments in both years and a loss on the early extinguishment of debt in 2017, the year-to-year pretax comparison is a pretax loss of $176 million in 2018 against pretax income of $118 million in 2017. Diamond continued to experience a fall-off in revenues in 2018, given the difficult market conditions and the effects of contract renegotiations. Contract drilling revenues fell 27% and both revenue earning days and average daily revenue declined.
Operating expenses, excluding nonrecurring items, declined only 6%, resulting in a swing from pretax operating income in 2017 to an operating loss in 2018. 
As we've discussed, Diamond is positioning itself for an eventual upturn. In 2019, Diamond will be investing approximately $350 million in its fleet to ensure its [ fleet ] continue to be considered top tier by customers.
Diamond ended the year with over $450 million in cash and equivalents. The company has over $1.2 billion of revolver capacity until 2020 and $950 million of capacity into 2023.
Boardwalk experienced a 32% decline in pretax income in 2018, which excludes the loss on the sale of a processing plant in 2017. Net revenues declined 5% as transportation revenues from growth projects and higher system utilization were more than offset by unfavorable parking lot and storage revenues as well as the net negative impact of transportation contract expirations, renewals and restructurings. Moreover, expenses were up given higher depreciation expense from new growth projects, resulting in pretax margins declining from 27% to 20%.
Despite the decline in pretax income, Boardwalk's contribution to our net income, excluding the loss on sale and onetime tax act impacts, rose from $101 million in 2017 to $135 million in 2018. The increased net income contribution relates to our purchase in July of 2018 of the outstanding publicly-held common units of Boardwalk. For the second half of the year, we included 100% of Boardwalk's earnings in our net income versus just 50% -- 51% during all of 2017 and the first half of 2018.
As Jim mentioned, Loews Hotels had a strong year, generating pretax income of $73 million, up from $65 million in 2017. Excluding all nonrecurring items, such as impairments, disposition gains and losses and pre-opening expenses, pretax income increased from $54 million in 2017 to $72 million in 2018. 
The extent of Loews Hotels nonrecurring items primarily relates to ongoing portfolio management, along with the development of new properties, all consistent with the company's strategic focus on group meetings hotels and immersive destinations.
Loews Hotels adjusted EBITDA, which is defined and disclosed in our quarterly earnings supplement, rose 15% in 2018 to $228 million. Numerous properties, including the 6 hotels at the Universal Orlando Resort, the Loews Miami Beach Hotel and the Loews Philadelphia, to name just a few, performed well during the year.
Current company net investment income was down meaningfully in 2018. The small loss we posted for the year stemmed from disappointing returns on our holdings of equity securities and LPs, again, largely attributable to the equity market drop in Q4. Also, our portfolio of cash and investments averaged $3.9 billion in 2018, down from an average of over $5 billion in 2017. Share repurchase activity and the purchase of the Boardwalk units caused the decrease.
We continue to maintain an extremely strong and liquid balance sheet. At year-end, the parent company portfolio totaled $3.1 billion with 62% in cash and equivalents, 33% in LPs and marketable equity securities and the remaining 5% in fixed maturities.
During the fourth quarter, we received $110 million in dividends from our subsidiaries, $85 million from CNA and $25 million from Boardwalk. For the full year, we received total dividends of $878 million from CNA and Boardwalk, with CNA contributing $801 million of that amount.
Today CNA declared a $2 per share special dividend in addition to its regular $0.35 quarterly dividend. Combining the 2, Loews will receive $570 million in dividends from CNA this quarter. We repurchased 2.9 million shares in the fourth quarter for $135 million and 20.3 million shares during all of 2018 for just over $1 billion. Since year-end, we have repurchased an additional 0.9 million shares at an average price of about $46.50.
I will now hand the call back to Mary."

First of all, our earnings were very ugly, but it was driven by 2 main factors. One was catastrophe losses, and in that department, our catastrophe losses for the quarter were $146 million versus $38 million in the prior year. I should add that the $146 million of catastrophe losses that we had in the quarter was in no way disproportionate to the size of CNA. On a combined ratio basis, that was 8.6 points versus 2.3 points in the prior year fourth quarter. Aside from catastrophe losses, the other thing that hurt CNA's earnings significantly was the investment results. And specifically, the results from our LP portfolio and common stocks, which was $138 million loss in the quarter versus our fourth quarter of the prior year, which was a $50 million gain. And in my opinion, those 2 temporary factors are overshadowing a lot of the good things that are going on at CNA. Net written premiums for the year last year were up 4%, gross written premiums were up 7%, and the difference between the 7% and the 4% is the additional reinsurance that CNA is purchasing. The underlying combined ratio was 95.4%, about the same as last year. CNA paid a dividend -- announced the quarterly -- regular quarterly dividend as well as the $2 special dividend, in my opinion, reflecting the board's confidence in the results of CNA and the way that the company is operating and proceeding. CNA continues to achieve significant rate increases across a number of lines. So from my perspective, things at CNA, notwithstanding the relatively ugly quarter, are really going pretty well."

What we've seen is that there is a generational shift in spending, where the millennial generation is moving more towards experiences rather than things. We see this play out, especially in Orlando, with our joint venture with Universal theme parks. We have 6 hotels there, and we're building a seventh hotel now that has 2,800 rooms. On the Comcast earnings call, Brian Roberts reported something that we already knew, that the occupancy ratio of our Orlando hotels is over 90%. And as I mentioned in my remarks, as a result of the occupancy ratio and the higher-than-market average daily rate, we're able to achieve extraordinary RevPAR numbers in that market. So what we've done is we've taken the learnings that we have from Orlando, and we've applied it to the rest of our business. First, we are striving to be close to demand generators, whether it's a sports arena, a stadium or a convention center. Secondly, we are working hard to leverage our unique position in the hotel business. We own our own hotels. We're not a manager of hotels. And therefore, we are willing to put up money to develop hotel properties, and as a result, we find that partners are very willing to work with us, and those partners are financial partners as well as municipal partners. And as a result, we are able, we find, to procure for ourselves very attractive development opportunities, which we're now moving forward with in St. Louis, in Arlington and Kansas City. When investing holding company cash, we're very, very cognizant of the need to earn good rates of return, and we believe that the hotels that we're investing in are doing just that. We have a team that's continuing to look for additional opportunities, and I suspect that in the coming years, we'll see opportunities as attractive to us as what we're doing in these 3 new markets that we're developing right now."

And I like to think that with respect to offshore drilling, I've seen this movie before in the supertanker business. In the supertanker business, there was a [indiscernible] of supertankers in the early '80s. Through scrapping, deterioration of the rigs and a slight increase in demand, we saw a whipsaw recovery in the mid- to late '80s. And I see for offshore drilling a similar thing that's happening now. First of all, all of the offshore drilling companies are managing to one thing and one thing only at this point in time, and that is to cash. Cash is the thing that they're not earning, that they desperately need in order to stay in business. So for the rigs that are not operating, it's a big risk for them to spend cash on maintaining those rigs with no business opportunities in sight. And what happens, I've seen very clearly from the tanker industry and also from offshore drilling, is that when ships, rigs, drillships, are left on the water, and they're not operating, then they can deteriorate very rapidly. Combined with that, right now, oil prices are relatively low, at about $52 a barrel for WTI and about $61 a barrel for Brent oil. My belief is that with an increase in oil prices, which I see happening, I think we could see over the coming years, a pretty significant increase in demand, and that demand increase will first to go to rigs that are already operating, and then later on to rigs that are stacked. Our estimation is that the cost to recommission a rig that's been stacked for a number of years can easily be in excess of $100 million per rig, and that cash today just doesn't exist in the industry to recommission more than a few rigs. So I think that the recommissioning of rigs will be slow, especially in view of the fact that our customers tend to like to use rigs that have already been working rather than rigs that are being recommissioned. So I think it's going to be a long time for rigs to come back to meet the demand that I foresee going forward. In terms of Diamond, Diamond has a relatively long runway within the industry. Diamond had at the end of the quarter, about $450 million in cash, and it has an additional borrowing capacity of about $1 billion. So it's got close to $1.5 billion of liquidity that really is the runway for Diamond, which is substantially, in excess of a lot of our other competitors. In terms of consolidation, we've worked for opportunities, but what I would say is the -- we have not been able to find any transactions that would be accretive to value for all Diamond shareholders. So we continue to look for opportunities.

At Loews, in the first 5 weeks, 5 or 6 weeks of this year, we have earned back all that we lost in the fourth quarter of last year. So we reported a loss of about $70 million in our portfolio in the fourth quarter of last year, and the portfolio was up by more than that at Loews. At CNA, they've recovered over 60% of their losses. But let me take a minute and talk about the different types of things that people can be invested in. You can invest in stocks, you can invest in hedge funds, you can invest in private equity. And one of the things that's struck me in this past -- in the past few months is that in the fourth quarter, the S&P 500 was down 14%, our hedge funds were down about 6%, and generally, across the board private equity firms have reported no loss at all. And I actually find that quite incredulous. It's what I would call a self-graded exam. There was a temporary drop in the market and the private equity firms didn't report a loss. It's inconceivable for me that stocks could be down 14% and that there is no loss in private equity. So CNA is in some ways bearing the pain of being mark-to-market, whereas in private equity, there is more of what I would call a mark to moving average, but it's just something that we have to deal with. In terms of the strategy, CNA has had a very good run with hedge funds as has Loews. We're starting to deemphasize them because we think that, number one, there's an awful lot of capital that's invested in them. We think the returns have been competed down. Additionally, in today's -- over the past 10 years, you were able to earn 0 on your cash balances. Today you can easily earn 2.5% to 3%. So simply investing in cash is not such a terrible alternative to hedge funds. We're looking at risk assets that go beyond hedge funds and private equity. We're looking at certain debt instruments. We're looking at certain, what I would call, nontraditional private equity investments. We're just trying to figure out over the coming year what will be the best vehicles for risk assets for both CNA and for Loews."

Loews' had a disappointing fourth quarter, with results negatively affected by higher-than-expected catastrophe losses in CNA and severe declines in the stock market at the end of 2018, impacting both Loews' and CNA's in",705,"Thank you, Mary, and good morning. Loews' had a disappointing fourth quarter, with results negatively affected by higher-than-expected catastrophe losses in CNA and severe declines in the stock market at the end of 2018, impacting both Loews' and CNA's investment portfolios.
Specifically with regard to CNA, let's put these equity-related losses in context. While the stock market declined 14% in the fourth quarter, CNA's limited partnership and common equity portfolios were down 5.7% or about $138 million. Counterbalancing CNA's fourth quarter investment performance, underlying operations for the full year were strong. In 2018, net written premiums grew by 4% and rate increased by 2.6%. CNA's underlying combined ratio improved for the second straight year. And while CNA's loss ratio ticked up slightly in 2018, it's essentially on par with its top-quartile peers. Additionally, CNA has reduced its expense ratio by 2 points over the past 2 years while still making necessary investments in technology, analytics and talent.
Earlier today, in light of the full year 2018 results and its strong balance sheet and the CNA board's positive outlook, CNA declared a $0.35 quarterly dividend as well as a $2 special dividend. These dividend payments will result in Loews receiving $570 million in dividends from CNA in March of this year. Over the last 5 years, including the upcoming March dividend payment, Loews will have received almost $4 billion in dividends from CNA.
Moving on to Loews Hotels, I'm happy to report that the company had a stellar year. In 2018, Loews Hotels adjusted EBITDA grew by 15% and has nearly doubled since 2014. This tremendous progress is due to operational improvements and the company's ongoing commitment to grow in 2 focused areas. First, Loews Hotels is concentrating on highly profitable, distinguished hotels that cater to group business. These hotels are better able to withstand disruptors such as the sharing economy. These hotels typically have between 300 and 800 rooms, along with significant meeting space, properties such as our hotels in Chicago and Miami Beach as well as the soon-to-be opened Loews Kansas City Hotel.
The other area of focus for Loews Hotels continues to be developing hotel properties that have unique built-in demand generators. More than 20 years ago, Loews Hotels' CEO, Jon Tisch, set the strategy in motion with the company's initial 50-50 partnership with NBCUniversal in developing hotels on their Orlando theme park campus, a partnership that has resulted in a highly profitable, long-term joint venture for Loews Hotels and Universal. 
Starting with the Loews Portofino Bay Hotel in 1999 with 750 rooms, the partnership now has 6 properties on the Orlando campus with 6,200 rooms. There are another 2,800 rooms under construction, the first 750 of which are set to open in June of this year. These hotels in Orlando dramatically outperform their competitive set in average daily rate, occupancy rate and, therefore, RevPAR.
We hope to continue our success in managing themed concepts and one-of-a-kind destinations with our Live! By Loews hotels. The Live! By Loews hotel in Arlington, Texas, being developed in partnership with The Cordish Companies and the Texas Rangers, is set to open this summer at the base of Globe Life Park and next to AT&T Stadium. In early 2020, the Live! By Loews in St. Louis will open. We are partnering with The Cordish Companies on this hotel as well, along with the St. Louis Cardinals. The property will be located next to Busch Stadium.
Before turning the call over to David, I want to discuss share repurchases, which I believe have been and will continue to be a significant means of creating value for Loews shareholders. In 2018, we repurchased a little over 20 million shares of Loews common stock for just over $1 billion, which was the equivalent of about 6% of our outstanding shares. We don't have an automatic share repurchase program because we're sensitive to the price at which we buy back our shares. We repurchase Loews stock only when it's trading below our view of its true intrinsic value. We believe this capital allocation tool is one of the best ways to create value for all our shareholders over the intermediate to long term.
And on that note, David, over to you."

Today we reported a fourth quarter net loss of $165 million or $0.53 per share as compared to net income of $481 million or $1.43 per share in last year's fourth quarter.For the full year, we reported net income of $636",1556,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning. Today we reported a fourth quarter net loss of $165 million or $0.53 per share as compared to net income of $481 million or $1.43 per share in last year's fourth quarter.
For the full year, we reported net income of $636 million or $1.99 per share, down from $1.16 billion or $3.45 per share in 2017. As a reminder, included in last year's fourth quarter and full year net income was a $200 million net benefit related to the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. We have included a table in our earnings supplement, laying out the impact of this net benefit by reporting segment.
In my ensuing remarks, I will speak to results before the Q4 of 2017 impact of the tax act. Note that the year-over-year comparisons were also affected by the ongoing impact of the lower U.S. corporate tax rate.
Let me start by discussing the key drivers of our fourth quarter loss, and then turn my attention to our full year results. As Jim mentioned, the 2 main drags on our earnings in Q4 were: investment results at both CNA and the parent company caused by a difficult equity market conditions; and catastrophe losses at CNA, caused primarily by Hurricane Michael and the California wildfires.
At CNA, the company's limited partnership and common stock investments lost ground in the fourth quarter, yielding a negative return versus positive results in Q4 of 2017. This swing accounted for $126 million of the decline in CNA's contribution to our net income. As Jim highlighted, negative returns in the quarter, when the S&P 500 was down 14%, are no surprise. Additionally, at CNA, the company had realized investment losses in the fourth quarter versus realized gains last year. This change accounted for another $73 million of the decline in CNA's net income contribution.
The Loews parent company portfolio of limited partnership and common stock investments also lost ground in Q4, accounting for $82 million of the decline in after-tax investment income. A lower level of invested assets in 2018 also contributed to the year-over-year decline.
As for the catastrophe losses, CNA booked $146 million of pretax losses in the fourth quarter as compared to just $38 million in last year's fourth quarter. CNA is in the business of assuming risk, so it fully expects to absorb catastrophe losses in the quarter with such significant catastrophe activity. The higher level of catastrophe losses at CNA accounted for $81 million of the year-over-year decline in CNA's contribution to our net income.
To summarize, the factors cited above in total accounted for over 80% of the year-over-year decline in our quarterly net income, excluding the onetime impact of the tax act. 
A couple more observations on the quarter before turning to the full year. Average shares outstanding declined 7% from last year's fourth quarter, reflecting our share repurchase activity, and the reduction in the corporate tax rate actually exaggerated the size of the year-to-year quarterly variance in our after-tax results, given the pretax losses at CNA, Diamond and the parent company.
Now let me review our full year results. As I mentioned earlier, our net income of $636 million in 2018 was lower than the $964 million we earned in 2017, which excludes the $200 million onetime impact of the tax act.
CNA's core underwriting results were strong in 2018 as it posted a consistent underlying combined ratio of 95.4% and net written premium growth of 4%. Catastrophe losses were actually down on an annual basis, but offsetting this, the company posted a lesser amount of favorable prior year development. All in all, at CNA, pretax underwriting income was up modestly.
The main drivers, therefore, of the year-to-year decline in CNA's contribution to our net income were net realized investment losses, lower P&C net investment income and increased charges related to the loss portfolio transfer.
Let me touch on all
[Audio Gap]
CNA swung from realized gains in 2017 to losses in 2018. This swing reduced our net income by $112 million relative to last year. P&C investment income for 2018 was hurt by a $42 million pretax loss generated by limited partnership and common stock investments as compared to $207 million of pretax gains in the prior year. This change reduced our net income by $150 million versus last year.
  
Finally, CNA's corporate segment contributed to the year-to-year decline, largely due to prior year development on the loss portfolio transfer with National Indemnity. As a reminder, in 2010, CNA ceded substantially all of its legacy asbestos and environmental liabilities to National Indemnity through a loss portfolio transfer. Activity under the loss portfolio transfer is accounted for using retroactive reinsurance accounting, which is described in all its glory in our 10-K.
CNA recorded adverse net prior year reserve development under the loss portfolio transfer in 2018, which reduced Loews' year-over-year net income by $34 million.
Turning to Diamond. Diamond Offshore reported a pretax loss of $226 million as compared to a loss of $22 million in 2017. Stripping out nonrecurring items such as asset impairments in both years and a loss on the early extinguishment of debt in 2017, the year-to-year pretax comparison is a pretax loss of $176 million in 2018 against pretax income of $118 million in 2017. Diamond continued to experience a fall-off in revenues in 2018, given the difficult market conditions and the effects of contract renegotiations. Contract drilling revenues fell 27% as both revenue earning days and average daily revenue declined.
Operating expenses, excluding nonrecurring items, declined only 6%, resulting in a swing from pretax operating income in 2017 to an operating loss in 2018. 
As we've discussed, Diamond is positioning itself for an eventual upturn. In 2019, Diamond will be investing approximately $350 million in its fleet to ensure its rigs continue to be considered top tier by customers.
Diamond ended the year with over $450 million in cash and equivalents. The company has over $1.2 billion of revolver capacity until 2020 and $950 million of capacity into 2023.
Boardwalk experienced a 32% decline in pretax income in 2018, which excludes the loss on the sale of a processing plant in 2017. Net revenues declined 5% as transportation revenues from growth projects and higher system utilization were more than offset by unfavorable parking lot and storage revenues as well as the net negative impact of transportation contract expirations, renewals and restructurings. Moreover, expenses were up given higher depreciation expense from new growth projects, resulting in pretax margins declining from 27% to 20%.
Despite the decline in pretax income, Boardwalk's contribution to our net income, excluding the loss on sale and onetime tax act impacts, rose from $101 million in 2017 to $135 million in 2018. The increased net income contribution relates to our purchase in July of 2018 of the outstanding publicly held common units of Boardwalk. For the second half of the year, we included 100% of Boardwalk's earnings in our net income versus just 50% -- 51% during all of 2017 and the first half of 2018.
As Jim mentioned, Loews Hotels had a strong year, generating pretax income of $73 million, up from $65 million in 2017. Excluding all nonrecurring items, such as impairments, disposition gains and losses and pre-opening expenses, pretax income increased from $54 million in 2017 to $72 million in 2018. 
The extent of Loews Hotels nonrecurring items primarily relates to ongoing portfolio management, along with the development of new properties, all consistent with the company's strategic focus on group meetings hotels and immersive destinations.
Loews Hotels adjusted EBITDA, which is defined and disclosed in our quarterly earnings supplement, rose 15% in 2018 to $228 million. Numerous properties, including the 6 hotels at the Universal Orlando Resort, the Loews Miami Beach Hotel and the Loews Philadelphia, to name just a few, performed well during the year.
Current company net investment income was down meaningfully in 2018. The small loss we posted for the year stemmed from disappointing returns on our holdings of equity securities and LPs, again, largely attributable to the equity market drop in Q4. Also, our portfolio of cash and investments averaged $3.9 billion in 2018, down from an average of over $5 billion in 2017. Share repurchase activity and the purchase of the Boardwalk units caused the decrease.
We continue to maintain an extremely strong and liquid balance sheet. At year-end, the parent company portfolio totaled $3.1 billion with 62% in cash and equivalents, 33% in LPs and marketable equity securities and the remaining 5% in fixed maturities.
During the fourth quarter, we received $110 million in dividends from our subsidiaries: $85 million from CNA and $25 million from Boardwalk. For the full year, we received total dividends of $878 million from CNA and Boardwalk, with CNA contributing $801 million of that amount.
Today CNA declared a $2 per share special dividend in addition to its regular $0.35 quarterly dividend. Combining the 2, Loews will receive $570 million in dividends from CNA this quarter. We repurchased 2.9 million shares in the fourth quarter for $135 million and 20.3 million shares during all of 2018 for just over $1 billion. Since year-end, we have repurchased an additional 0.9 million shares at an average price of about $46.50.
I will now hand the call back to Mary."

First of all, our earnings were very ugly, but it was driven by 2 main factors. One was catastrophe losses, and in that department, our catastrophe losses for the quarter were $146 million versus $38 million in the prior year. I should add that the $146 million of catastrophe losses that we had in the quarter was in no way disproportionate to the size of CNA. On a combined ratio basis, that was 8.6 points versus 2.3 points in the prior year fourth quarter. Aside from catastrophe losses, the other thing that hurt CNA's earnings significantly was the investment results. And specifically, the results from our LP portfolio and common stocks, which was $138 million loss in the quarter versus our fourth quarter of the prior year, which was a $50 million gain. And in my opinion, those 2 temporary factors are overshadowing a lot of the good things that are going on at CNA. Net written premiums for the year last year were up 4%, gross written premiums were up 7%, and the difference between the 7% and the 4% is the additional reinsurance that CNA is purchasing. The underlying combined ratio was 95.4%, about the same as last year. CNA paid a dividend -- announced the quarterly -- regular quarterly dividend as well as the $2 special dividend, in my opinion, reflecting the board's confidence in the results of CNA and the way that the company is operating and proceeding. CNA continues to achieve significant rate increases across a number of lines. So from my perspective, things at CNA, notwithstanding the relatively ugly quarter, are really going pretty well."

On the Comcast earnings call, Brian Roberts reported something that we already knew, that the occupancy ratio of our Orlando hotels is over 90%. And as I mentioned in my remarks, as a result of the occupancy ratio and the higher-than-market average daily rate, we're able to achieve extraordinary RevPAR numbers in that market. So what we've done is we've taken the learnings that we have from Orlando, and we've applied it to the rest of our business. First, we are striving to be close to demand generators, whether it's a sports arena, a stadium or a convention center. Secondly, we are working hard to leverage our unique position in the hotel business. We own our own hotels. We're not a manager of hotels. And therefore, we are willing to put up money to develop hotel properties, and as a result, we find that partners are very willing to work with us, and those partners are financial partners as well as municipal partners. And as a result, we are able, we find, to procure for ourselves very attractive development opportunities, which we're now moving forward with in St. Louis, in Arlington and Kansas City. When investing holding company cash, we're very, very cognizant of the need to earn good rates of return, and we believe that the hotels that we're investing in are doing just that. We have a team that's continuing to look for additional opportunities, and I suspect that in the coming years, we'll see opportunities as attractive to us as what we're doing in these 3 new markets that we're developing right now."

In the supertanker busi",554,"So one of the nice things about having been in the business for over 40 years is that you've seen a lot of things. And I like to think that with respect to offshore drilling, I've seen this movie before in the supertanker business. In the supertanker business, there was a glut of supertankers in the early '80s. Through scrapping, deterioration of the rigs and a slight increase in demand, we saw a whipsaw recovery in the mid- to late '80s. And I see for offshore drilling a similar thing that's happening now. First of all, all of the offshore drilling companies are managing to one thing and one thing only at this point in time, and that is to cash. Cash is the thing that they're not earning, that they desperately need in order to stay in business. So for the rigs that are not operating, it's a big risk for them to spend cash on maintaining those rigs with no business opportunities in sight. And what happens, I've seen very clearly from the tanker industry and also from offshore drilling, is that when ships, rigs, drillships, are left on the water, and they're not operating, then they can deteriorate very rapidly. Combined with that, right now, oil prices are relatively low at about $52 a barrel for WTI and about $61 a barrel for Brent oil. My belief is that with an increase in oil prices, which I see happening, I think we could see over the coming years, a pretty significant increase in demand. And that demand increase will first to go to rigs that are already operating, and then later on to rigs that are stacked. Our estimation is that the cost to recommission a rig that's been stacked for a number of years can easily be in excess of $100 million per rig, and that cash today just doesn't exist in the industry to recommission more than a few rigs. So I think that the recommissioning of rigs will be slow, especially in view of the fact that our customers tend to like to use rigs that have already been working rather than rigs that are being recommissioned. So I think it's going to be a long time for rigs to come back to meet the demand that I foresee going forward. In terms of Diamond, Diamond has a relatively long runway within the industry. Diamond had, at the end of the quarter, about $450 million in cash, and it has an additional borrowing capacity of about $1 billion. So it's got close to $1.5 billion of liquidity that really is the runway for Diamond, which is substantially in excess of a lot of our other competitors. In terms of consolidation, we've looked for opportunities, but what I would say is the -- we have not been able to find any transactions that would be accretive to value for all Diamond shareholders. So we continue to look for opportunities. I would say that the spread between bid and ask for drilling assets is very wide, and the only transactions that really seem to get done these days are transactions where somebody gives their shares in return for buying other shares. But we continue to scour the earth, to have discussions, but to date, there's not much to report."

At Loews, in the first 5 weeks, 5 or 6 weeks of this year, we have earned back all that we lost in the fourth quarter of last year. So we reported a loss of about $70 million in our portfolio in the fourth quarter of last year, and the portfolio was up by more than that at Loews. At CNA, they've recovered over 60% of their losses. But let me take a minute and talk about the different types of things that people can be invested in. You can invest in stocks, you can invest in hedge funds, you can invest in private equity. And one of the things that's struck me in this past -- in the past few months is that in the fourth quarter, the S&P 500 was down 14%, our hedge funds were down about 6%, and generally, across the board, private equity firms have reported no loss at all. And I actually find that quite incredulous. It's what I would call a self-graded exam. There was a temporary drop in the market and the private equity firms didn't report a loss. It's inconceivable for me that stocks could be down 14% and that there is no loss in private equity. So CNA is in some ways bearing the pain of being marked to market, whereas in private equity, there is more of what I would call a mark to moving average, but it's just something that we have to deal with. In terms of the strategy, CNA has had a very good run with hedge funds, as has Loews. We're starting to deemphasize them because we think that, number one, there's an awful lot of capital that's invested in them. We think the returns have been competed down. Additionally, in today's -- over the past 10 years, you were able to earn 0 on your cash balances. Today you can easily earn 2.5% to 3%. So simply investing in cash is not such a terrible alternative to hedge funds. We're looking at risk assets that go beyond hedge funds and private equity. We're looking at certain debt instruments. We're looking at certain, what I would call, nontraditional private equity investments. We're just trying to figure out over the coming year, what will be the best vehicles for risk assets for both CNA and for Loews."

Loews' had a disappointing fourth quarter, with results negatively affected by higher-than-expected catastrophe losses in CNA and severe declines in the stock market at the end of 2018, impacting both Loews' and CNA's in",704,"Thank you, Mary, and good morning. Loews' had a disappointing fourth quarter, with results negatively affected by higher-than-expected catastrophe losses in CNA and severe declines in the stock market at the end of 2018, impacting both Loews' and CNA's investment portfolios.
Specifically with regard to CNA, let's put these equity-related losses in context. While the stock market declined 14% in the fourth quarter, CNA's limited partnership and common equity portfolios were down 5.7% or about $138 million. Counterbalancing CNA's fourth quarter investment performance, underlying operations for the full year were strong. In 2018, net written premiums grew by 4% and rate increased by 2.6%. CNA's underlying combined ratio improved for the second straight year. And while CNA's loss ratio ticked up slightly in 2018, it's essentially on par with its top-quartile peers. Additionally, CNA has reduced its expense ratio by 2 points over the past 2 years while still making necessary investments in technology, analytics and talent.
Earlier today, in light of the full year 2018 results and its strong balance sheet and the CNA board's positive outlook, CNA declared a $0.35 quarterly dividend as well as a $2 special dividend. These dividend payments will result in Loews receiving $570 million in dividends from CNA in March of this year. Over the last 5 years, including the upcoming March dividend payment, Loews will have received almost $4 billion in dividends from CNA.
Moving on to Loews Hotels, I'm happy to report that the company had a stellar year. In 2018, Loews Hotels adjusted EBITDA grew by 15% and has nearly doubled since 2014. This tremendous progress is due to operational improvements and the company's ongoing commitment to grow in 2 focused areas. First, Loews Hotels is concentrating on highly profitable, distinguished hotels that cater to group business. These hotels are better able to withstand disruptors such as the sharing economy. These hotels typically have between 300 and 800 rooms, along with significant meeting space, properties such as our hotels in Chicago and Miami Beach as well as the soon-to-be-opened Loews Kansas City Hotel.
The other area of focus for Loews Hotels continues to be developing hotel properties that have unique built-in demand generators. More than 20 years ago, Loews Hotels' CEO, Jon Tisch, set the strategy in motion with the company's initial 50-50 partnership with NBCUniversal in developing hotels on their Orlando theme park campus, a partnership that has resulted in a highly profitable, long-term joint venture for Loews Hotels and Universal. 
Starting with the Loews Portofino Bay Hotel in 1999 with 750 rooms, the partnership now has 6 properties on the Orlando campus with 6,200 rooms. There are another 2,800 rooms under construction, the first 750 of which are set to open in June of this year. These hotels in Orlando dramatically outperform their competitive set in average daily rate, occupancy rate and, therefore, RevPAR.
We hope to continue our success in managing themed concepts and one-of-a-kind destinations with our Live! By Loews hotels. The Live! By Loews hotel in Arlington, Texas, being developed in partnership with The Cordish Companies and the Texas Rangers, is set to open this summer at the base of Globe Life Park and next to AT&T Stadium. In early 2020, the Live! By Loews in St. Louis will open. We are partnering with The Cordish Companies on this hotel as well, along with the St. Louis Cardinals. The property will be located next to Busch Stadium.
Before turning the call over to David, I want to discuss share repurchases, which I believe have been and will continue to be a significant means of creating value for Loews shareholders. In 2018, we repurchased a little over 20 million shares of Loews common stock for just over $1 billion, which was the equivalent of about 6% of our outstanding shares. We don't have an automatic share repurchase program because we're sensitive to the price at which we buy back our shares. We repurchase Loews stock only when it's trading below our view of its true intrinsic value. We believe this capital allocation tool is one of the best ways to create value for all our shareholders over the intermediate to long term.
And on that note, David, over to you."

Today we reported a fourth quarter net loss of $165 million or $0.53 per share as compared to net income of $481 million or $1.43 per share in last year's fourth quarter.For the full year, we reported net income of $636",1556,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning. Today we reported a fourth quarter net loss of $165 million or $0.53 per share as compared to net income of $481 million or $1.43 per share in last year's fourth quarter.
For the full year, we reported net income of $636 million or $1.99 per share, down from $1.16 billion or $3.45 per share in 2017. As a reminder, included in last year's fourth quarter and full year net income was a $200 million net benefit related to the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. We have included a table in our earnings supplement, laying out the impact of this net benefit by reporting segment.
In my ensuing remarks, I will speak to results before the Q4 of 2017 impact of the tax act. Note that the year-over-year comparisons were also affected by the ongoing impact of the lower U.S. corporate tax rate.
Let me start by discussing the key drivers of our fourth quarter loss, and then turn my attention to our full year results. As Jim mentioned, the 2 main drags on our earnings in Q4 were: investment results at both CNA and the parent company caused by a difficult equity market conditions; and catastrophe losses at CNA, caused primarily by Hurricane Michael and the California wildfires.
At CNA, the company's limited partnership and common stock investments lost ground in the fourth quarter, yielding a negative return versus positive results in Q4 of 2017. This swing accounted for $126 million of the decline in CNA's contribution to our net income. As Jim highlighted, negative returns in the quarter, when the S&P 500 was down 14%, are no surprise. Additionally, at CNA, the company had realized investment losses in the fourth quarter versus realized gains last year. This change accounted for another $73 million of the decline in CNA's net income contribution.
The Loews parent company portfolio of limited partnership and common stock investments also lost ground in Q4, accounting for $82 million of the decline in after-tax investment income. A lower level of invested assets in 2018 also contributed to the year-over-year decline.
As for the catastrophe losses, CNA booked $146 million of pretax losses in the fourth quarter as compared to just $38 million in last year's fourth quarter. CNA is in the business of assuming risk, so it fully expects to absorb catastrophe losses in the quarter with such significant catastrophe activity. The higher level of catastrophe losses at CNA accounted for $81 million of the year-over-year decline in CNA's contribution to our net income.
To summarize, the factors cited above in total accounted for over 80% of the year-over-year decline in our quarterly net income, excluding the onetime impact of the tax act. 
A couple more observations on the quarter before turning to the full year. Average shares outstanding declined 7% from last year's fourth quarter, reflecting our share repurchase activity, and the reduction in the corporate tax rate actually exaggerated the size of the year-to-year quarterly variance in our after-tax results, given the pretax losses at CNA, Diamond and the parent company.
Now let me review our full year results. As I mentioned earlier, our net income of $636 million in 2018 was lower than the $964 million we earned in 2017, which excludes the $200 million onetime impact of the tax act.
CNA's core underwriting results were strong in 2018 as it posted a consistent underlying combined ratio of 95.4% and net written premium growth of 4%. Catastrophe losses were actually down on an annual basis, but offsetting this, the company posted a lesser amount of favorable prior year development. All in all, at CNA, pretax underwriting income was up modestly.
The main drivers, therefore, of the year-to-year decline in CNA's contribution to our net income were net realized investment losses, lower P&C net investment income and increased charges related to the loss portfolio transfer.
Let me touch on all
[Audio Gap]
CNA swung from realized gains in 2017 to losses in 2018. This swing reduced our net income by $112 million relative to last year. P&C investment income for 2018 was hurt by a $42 million pretax loss generated by limited partnership and common stock investments as compared to $207 million of pretax gains in the prior year. This change reduced our net income by $150 million versus last year.
 
Finally, CNA's corporate segment contributed to the year-to-year decline, largely due to prior year development on the loss portfolio transfer with National Indemnity. As a reminder, in 2010, CNA ceded substantially all of its legacy asbestos and environmental liabilities to National Indemnity through a loss portfolio transfer. Activity under the loss portfolio transfer is accounted for using retroactive reinsurance accounting, which is described in all its glory in our 10-K.
CNA recorded adverse net prior year reserve development under the loss portfolio transfer in 2018, which reduced Loews' year-over-year net income by $34 million.
Turning to Diamond. Diamond Offshore reported a pretax loss of $226 million as compared to a loss of $22 million in 2017. Stripping out nonrecurring items such as asset impairments in both years and a loss on the early extinguishment of debt in 2017, the year-to-year pretax comparison is a pretax loss of $176 million in 2018 against pretax income of $118 million in 2017. Diamond continued to experience a fall-off in revenues in 2018, given the difficult market conditions and the effects of contract renegotiations. Contract drilling revenues fell 27% as both revenue earning days and average daily revenue declined.
Operating expenses, excluding nonrecurring items, declined only 6%, resulting in a swing from pretax operating income in 2017 to an operating loss in 2018. 
As we've discussed, Diamond is positioning itself for an eventual upturn. In 2019, Diamond will be investing approximately $350 million in its fleet to ensure its rigs continue to be considered top tier by customers.
Diamond ended the year with over $450 million in cash and equivalents. The company has over $1.2 billion of revolver capacity until 2020 and $950 million of capacity into 2023.
Boardwalk experienced a 32% decline in pretax income in 2018, which excludes the loss on the sale of a processing plant in 2017. Net revenues declined 5% as transportation revenues from growth projects and higher system utilization were more than offset by unfavorable parking lot and storage revenues as well as the net negative impact of transportation contract expirations, renewals and restructurings. Moreover, expenses were up given higher depreciation expense from new growth projects, resulting in pretax margins declining from 27% to 20%.
Despite the decline in pretax income, Boardwalk's contribution to our net income, excluding the loss on sale and onetime tax act impacts, rose from $101 million in 2017 to $135 million in 2018. The increased net income contribution relates to our purchase in July of 2018 of the outstanding publicly held common units of Boardwalk. For the second half of the year, we included 100% of Boardwalk's earnings in our net income versus just 50% -- 51% during all of 2017 and the first half of 2018.
As Jim mentioned, Loews Hotels had a strong year, generating pretax income of $73 million, up from $65 million in 2017. Excluding all nonrecurring items, such as impairments, disposition gains and losses and pre-opening expenses, pretax income increased from $54 million in 2017 to $72 million in 2018. 
The extent of Loews Hotels nonrecurring items primarily relates to ongoing portfolio management, along with the development of new properties, all consistent with the company's strategic focus on group meetings hotels and immersive destinations.
Loews Hotels adjusted EBITDA, which is defined and disclosed in our quarterly earnings supplement, rose 15% in 2018 to $228 million. Numerous properties, including the 6 hotels at the Universal Orlando Resort, the Loews Miami Beach Hotel and the Loews Philadelphia, to name just a few, performed well during the year.
Current company net investment income was down meaningfully in 2018. The small loss we posted for the year stemmed from disappointing returns on our holdings of equity securities and LPs, again, largely attributable to the equity market drop in Q4. Also, our portfolio of cash and investments averaged $3.9 billion in 2018, down from an average of over $5 billion in 2017. Share repurchase activity and the purchase of the Boardwalk units caused the decrease.
We continue to maintain an extremely strong and liquid balance sheet. At year-end, the parent company portfolio totaled $3.1 billion with 62% in cash and equivalents, 33% in LPs and marketable equity securities and the remaining 5% in fixed maturities.
During the fourth quarter, we received $110 million in dividends from our subsidiaries: $85 million from CNA and $25 million from Boardwalk. For the full year, we received total dividends of $878 million from CNA and Boardwalk, with CNA contributing $801 million of that amount.
Today CNA declared a $2 per share special dividend in addition to its regular $0.35 quarterly dividend. Combining the 2, Loews will receive $570 million in dividends from CNA this quarter. We repurchased 2.9 million shares in the fourth quarter for $135 million and 20.3 million shares during all of 2018 for just over $1 billion. Since year-end, we have repurchased an additional 0.9 million shares at an average price of about $46.50.

First of all, our earnings were very ugly, but it was driven by 2 main factors. One was catastrophe losses, and in that department, our catastrophe losses for the quarter were $146 million versus $38 million in the prior year. I should add that the $146 million of catastrophe losses that we had in the quarter was in no way disproportionate to the size of CNA. On a combined ratio basis, that was 8.6 points versus 2.3 points in the prior year fourth quarter. Aside from catastrophe losses, the other thing that hurt CNA's earnings significantly was the investment results. And specifically, the results from our LP portfolio and common stocks, which was $138 million loss in the quarter versus our fourth quarter of the prior year, which was a $50 million gain. And in my opinion, those 2 temporary factors are overshadowing a lot of the good things that are going on at CNA. Net written premiums for the year last year were up 4%, gross written premiums were up 7%, and the difference between the 7% and the 4% is the additional reinsurance that CNA is purchasing. The underlying combined ratio was 95.4%, about the same as last year. CNA paid a dividend -- announced the quarterly -- regular quarterly dividend as well as the $2 special dividend, in my opinion, reflecting the board's confidence in the results of CNA and the way that the company is operating and proceeding. CNA continues to achieve significant rate increases across a number of lines. So from my perspective, things at CNA, notwithstanding the relatively ugly quarter, are really going pretty well."

What we've seen is that there is a generational shift in spending, where the millennial generation is moving more towards experiences rather than things. We see this play out especially in Orlando, with our joint venture with Universal theme parks. We have 6 hotels there, and we're building a seventh hotel now that has 2,800 rooms. On the Comcast earnings call, Brian Roberts reported something that we already knew, that the occupancy ratio of our Orlando hotels is over 90%. And as I mentioned in my remarks, as a result of the occupancy ratio and the higher-than-market average daily rate, we're able to achieve extraordinary RevPAR numbers in that market. So what we've done is we've taken the learnings that we have from Orlando, and we've applied it to the rest of our business. First, we are striving to be close to demand generators, whether it's a sports arena, a stadium or a convention center. Secondly, we are working hard to leverage our unique position in the hotel business. We own our own hotels. We're not a manager of hotels. And therefore, we are willing to put up money to develop hotel properties, and as a result, we find that partners are very willing to work with us, and those partners are financial partners as well as municipal partners. And as a result, we are able, we find, to procure for ourselves very attractive development opportunities, which we're now moving forward with in St. Louis, in Arlington and Kansas City. When investing holding company cash, we're very, very cognizant of the need to earn good rates of return, and we believe that the hotels that we're investing in are doing just that. We have a team that's continuing to look for additional opportunities, and I suspect that in the coming years, we'll see opportunities as attractive to us as what we're doing in these 3 new markets that we're developing right now."

And I like to think that with respect to offshore drilling, I've seen this movie before in the supertanker business. In the supertanker business, there was a glut of supertankers in the early '80s. Through scrapping, deterioration of the rigs and a slight increase in demand, we saw a whipsaw recovery in the mid- to late '80s. And I see for offshore drilling a similar thing that's happening now. First of all, all of the offshore drilling companies are managing to one thing and one thing only at this point in time, and that is to cash. Cash is the thing that they're not earning, that they desperately need in order to stay in business. So for the rigs that are not operating, it's a big risk for them to spend cash on maintaining those rigs with no business opportunities in sight. And what happens, I've seen very clearly from the tanker industry and also from offshore drilling, is that when ships, rigs, drillships, are left on the water, and they're not operating, then they can deteriorate very rapidly. Combined with that, right now, oil prices are relatively low at about $52 a barrel for WTI and about $61 a barrel for Brent oil. My belief is that with an increase in oil prices, which I see happening, I think we could see over the coming years, a pretty significant increase in demand. And that demand increase will first to go to rigs that are already operating, and then later on to rigs that are stacked. Our estimation is that the cost to recommission a rig that's been stacked for a number of years can easily be in excess of $100 million per rig, and that cash today just doesn't exist in the industry to recommission more than a few rigs. So I think that the recommissioning of rigs will be slow, especially in view of the fact that our customers tend to like to use rigs that have already been working rather than rigs that are being recommissioned. So I think it's going to be a long time for rigs to come back to meet the demand that I foresee going forward. In terms of Diamond, Diamond has a relatively long runway within the industry. Diamond had, at the end of the quarter, about $450 million in cash, and it has an additional borrowing capacity of about $1 billion. So it's got close to $1.5 billion of liquidity that really is the runway for Diamond, which is substantially in excess of a lot of our other competitors. In terms of consolidation, we've looked for opportunities, but what I would say is the -- we have not been able to find any transactions that would be accretive to value for all Diamond shareholders. So we continue to look for opportunities. I would say that the spread between bid and ask for drilling assets is very wide, and the only transactions that really seem to get done these days are transactions where somebody gives their shares in return for buying other shares. But we continue to scour the earth, to have discussions, but to date, there's not much to report."

So we reported a loss of about $70 million in our portfolio in the fourth quarter of last year, and the portfolio was up by more than that at Loews. At CNA, they've recovered over 60% of their losses. But let me take a minute and talk about the different types of things that people can be invested in. You can invest in stocks, you can invest in hedge funds, you can invest in private equity. And one of the things that's struck me in this past -- in the past few months is that in the fourth quarter, the S&P 500 was down 14%, our hedge funds were down about 6%, and generally, across the board, private equity firms have reported no loss at all. And I actually find that quite incredulous. It's what I would call a self-graded exam. There was a temporary drop in the market and the private equity firms didn't report a loss. It's inconceivable for me that stocks could be down 14% and that there is no loss in private equity. So CNA is in some ways bearing the pain of being marked to market, whereas in private equity, there is more of what I would call a mark to moving average, but it's just something that we have to deal with. In terms of the strategy, CNA has had a very good run with hedge funds, as has Loews. We're starting to deemphasize them because we think that, number one, there's an awful lot of capital that's invested in them. We think the returns have been competed down. Additionally, in today's -- over the past 10 years, you were able to earn 0 on your cash balances. Today you can easily earn 2.5% to 3%. So simply investing in cash is not such a terrible alternative to hedge funds. We're looking at risk assets that go beyond hedge funds and private equity. We're looking at certain debt instruments. We're looking at certain, what I would call, nontraditional private equity investments. We're just trying to figure out over the coming year, what will be the best vehicles for risk assets for both CNA and for Loews."

Loews' had a disappointing fourth quarter, with results negatively affected by higher-than-expected catastrophe losses in CNA and severe declines in the stock market at the end of 2018, impacting both Loews' and CNA's investment portfolios.
Specifically with regard to CNA, let's put these equity-related losses in context. While the stock market declined 14% in the fourth quarter, CNA's limited partnership and common equity portfolios were down 5.7% or about $138 million. Counterbalancing CNA's fourth quarter investment performance, underlying operations for the full year were strong. In 2018, net written premiums grew by 4% and rate increased by 2.6%. CNA's underlying combined ratio improved for the second straight year. And while CNA's loss ratio ticked up slightly in 2018, it's essentially on par with its top-quartile peers. Additionally, CNA has reduced its expense ratio by 2 points over the past 2 years while still making necessary investments in technology, analytics and talent.
Earlier today, in light of the full year 2018 results and its strong balance sheet and the CNA board's positive outlook, CNA declared a $0.35 quarterly dividend as well as a $2 special dividend. These dividend payments will result in Loews receiving $570 million in dividends from CNA in March of this year. Over the last 5 years, including the upcoming March dividend payment, Loews will have received almost $4 billion in dividends from CNA.
Moving on to Loews Hotels, I'm happy to report that the company had a stellar year. In 2018, Loews Hotels adjusted EBITDA grew by 15% and has nearly doubled since 2014. This tremendous progress is due to operational improvements and the company's ongoing commitment to grow in 2 focused areas. First, Loews Hotels is concentrating on highly profitable, distinguished hotels that cater to group business. These hotels are better able to withstand disruptors such as the sharing economy. These hotels typically have between 300 and 800 rooms, along with significant meeting space, properties such as our hotels in Chicago and Miami Beach as well as the soon-to-be-opened Loews Kansas City Hotel.
The other area of focus for Loews Hotels continues to be developing hotel properties that have unique built-in demand generators. More than 20 years ago, Loews Hotels' CEO, Jon Tisch, set the strategy in motion with the company's initial 50-50 partnership with NBCUniversal in developing hotels on their Orlando theme park campus, a partnership that has resulted in a highly profitable, long-term joint venture for Loews Hotels and Universal. 
Starting with the Loews Portofino Bay Hotel in 1999 with 750 rooms, the partnership now has 6 properties on the Orlando campus with 6,200 rooms. There are another 2,800 rooms under construction, the first 750 of which are set to open in June of this year. These hotels in Orlando dramatically outperform their competitive set in average daily rate, occupancy rate and, therefore, RevPAR.
We hope to continue our success in managing themed concepts and one-of-a-kind destinations with our Live! By Loews hotels. The Live! By Loews hotel in Arlington, Texas, being developed in partnership with The Cordish Companies and the Texas Rangers, is set to open this summer at the base of Globe Life Park and next to AT&T Stadium. In early 2020, the Live! By Loews in St. Louis will open. We are partnering with The Cordish Companies on this hotel as well, along with the St. Louis Cardinals. The property will be located next to Busch Stadium.
Before turning the call over to David, I want to discuss share repurchases, which I believe have been and will continue to be a significant means of creating value for Loews shareholders. In 2018, we repurchased a little over 20 million shares of Loews common stock for just over $1 billion, which was the equivalent of about 6% of our outstanding shares. We don't have an automatic share repurchase program because we're sensitive to the price at which we buy back our shares. We repurchase Loews stock only when it's trading below our view of its true intrinsic value. We believe this capital allocation tool is one of the best ways to create value for all our shareholders over the intermediate to long term.
And on that note, David, over to you."

Today we reported a fourth quarter net loss of $165 million or $0.53 per share as compared to net income of $481 million or $1.43 per share in last year's fourth quarter.
For the full year, we reported net income of $636 million or $1.99 per share, down from $1.16 billion or $3.45 per share in 2017. As a reminder, included in last year's fourth quarter and full year net income was a $200 million net benefit related to the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. We have included a table in our earnings supplement, laying out the impact of this net benefit by reporting segment.
In my ensuing remarks, I will speak to results before the Q4 of 2017 impact of the tax act. Note that the year-over-year comparisons were also affected by the ongoing impact of the lower U.S. corporate tax rate.
Let me start by discussing the key drivers of our fourth quarter loss, and then turn my attention to our full year results. As Jim mentioned, the 2 main drags on our earnings in Q4 were: investment results at both CNA and the parent company caused by a difficult equity market conditions; and catastrophe losses at CNA, caused primarily by Hurricane Michael and the California wildfires.
At CNA, the company's limited partnership and common stock investments lost ground in the fourth quarter, yielding a negative return versus positive results in Q4 of 2017. This swing accounted for $126 million of the decline in CNA's contribution to our net income. As Jim highlighted, negative returns in the quarter, when the S&P 500 was down 14%, are no surprise. Additionally, at CNA, the company had realized investment losses in the fourth quarter versus realized gains last year. This change accounted for another $73 million of the decline in CNA's net income contribution.
The Loews parent company portfolio of limited partnership and common stock investments also lost ground in Q4, accounting for $82 million of the decline in after-tax investment income. A lower level of invested assets in 2018 also contributed to the year-over-year decline.
As for the catastrophe losses, CNA booked $146 million of pretax losses in the fourth quarter as compared to just $38 million in last year's fourth quarter. CNA is in the business of assuming risk, so it fully expects to absorb catastrophe losses in the quarter with such significant catastrophe activity. The higher level of catastrophe losses at CNA accounted for $81 million of the year-over-year decline in CNA's contribution to our net income.
To summarize, the factors cited above in total accounted for over 80% of the year-over-year decline in our quarterly net income, excluding the onetime impact of the tax act. 
A couple more observations on the quarter before turning to the full year. Average shares outstanding declined 7% from last year's fourth quarter, reflecting our share repurchase activity, and the reduction in the corporate tax rate actually exaggerated the size of the year-to-year quarterly variance in our after-tax results, given the pretax losses at CNA, Diamond and the parent company.
Now let me review our full year results. As I mentioned earlier, our net income of $636 million in 2018 was lower than the $964 million we earned in 2017, which excludes the $200 million onetime impact of the tax act.
CNA's core underwriting results were strong in 2018 as it posted a consistent underlying combined ratio of 95.4% and net written premium growth of 4%. Catastrophe losses were actually down on an annual basis, but offsetting this, the company posted a lesser amount of favorable prior year development. All in all, at CNA, pretax underwriting income was up modestly.
The main drivers, therefore, of the year-to-year decline in CNA's contribution to our net income were net realized investment losses, lower P&C net investment income and increased charges related to the loss portfolio transfer.
Let me touch on all

CNA swung from realized gains in 2017 to losses in 2018. This swing reduced our net income by $112 million relative to last year. P&C investment income for 2018 was hurt by a $42 million pretax loss generated by limited partnership and common stock investments as compared to $207 million of pretax gains in the prior year. This change reduced our net income by $150 million versus last year.
 
Finally, CNA's corporate segment contributed to the year-to-year decline, largely due to prior year development on the loss portfolio transfer with National Indemnity. As a reminder, in 2010, CNA ceded substantially all of its legacy asbestos and environmental liabilities to National Indemnity through a loss portfolio transfer. Activity under the loss portfolio transfer is accounted for using retroactive reinsurance accounting, which is described in all its glory in our 10-K.
CNA recorded adverse net prior year reserve development under the loss portfolio transfer in 2018, which reduced Loews' year-over-year net income by $34 million.
Turning to Diamond. Diamond Offshore reported a pretax loss of $226 million as compared to a loss of $22 million in 2017. Stripping out nonrecurring items such as asset impairments in both years and a loss on the early extinguishment of debt in 2017, the year-to-year pretax comparison is a pretax loss of $176 million in 2018 against pretax income of $118 million in 2017. Diamond continued to experience a fall-off in revenues in 2018, given the difficult market conditions and the effects of contract renegotiations. Contract drilling revenues fell 27% as both revenue earning days and average daily revenue declined.
Operating expenses, excluding nonrecurring items, declined only 6%, resulting in a swing from pretax operating income in 2017 to an operating loss in 2018. 
As we've discussed, Diamond is positioning itself for an eventual upturn. In 2019, Diamond will be investing approximately $350 million in its fleet to ensure its rigs continue to be considered top tier by customers.
Diamond ended the year with over $450 million in cash and equivalents. The company has over $1.2 billion of revolver capacity until 2020 and $950 million of capacity into 2023.
Boardwalk experienced a 32% decline in pretax income in 2018, which excludes the loss on the sale of a processing plant in 2017. Net revenues declined 5% as transportation revenues from growth projects and higher system utilization were more than offset by unfavorable parking lot and storage revenues as well as the net negative impact of transportation contract expirations, renewals and restructurings. Moreover, expenses were up given higher depreciation expense from new growth projects, resulting in pretax margins declining from 27% to 20%.
Despite the decline in pretax income, Boardwalk's contribution to our net income, excluding the loss on sale and onetime tax act impacts, rose from $101 million in 2017 to $135 million in 2018. The increased net income contribution relates to our purchase in July of 2018 of the outstanding publicly held common units of Boardwalk. For the second half of the year, we included 100% of Boardwalk's earnings in our net income versus just 50% -- 51% during all of 2017 and the first half of 2018.
As Jim mentioned, Loews Hotels had a strong year, generating pretax income of $73 million, up from $65 million in 2017. Excluding all nonrecurring items, such as impairments, disposition gains and losses and pre-opening expenses, pretax income increased from $54 million in 2017 to $72 million in 2018. 
The extent of Loews Hotels nonrecurring items primarily relates to ongoing portfolio management, along with the development of new properties, all consistent with the company's strategic focus on group meetings hotels and immersive destinations.
Loews Hotels adjusted EBITDA, which is defined and disclosed in our quarterly earnings supplement, rose 15% in 2018 to $228 million. Numerous properties, including the 6 hotels at the Universal Orlando Resort, the Loews Miami Beach Hotel and the Loews Philadelphia, to name just a few, performed well during the year.
Parent company net investment income was down meaningfully in 2018. The small loss we posted for the year stemmed from disappointing returns on our holdings of equity securities and LPs, again, largely attributable to the equity market drop in Q4. Also, our portfolio of cash and investments averaged $3.9 billion in 2018, down from an average of over $5 billion in 2017. Share repurchase activity and the purchase of the Boardwalk units caused the decrease.
We continue to maintain an extremely strong and liquid balance sheet. At year-end, the parent company portfolio totaled $3.1 billion with 62% in cash and equivalents, 33% in LPs and marketable equity securities and the remaining 5% in fixed maturities.
During the fourth quarter, we received $110 million in dividends from our subsidiaries: $85 million from CNA and $25 million from Boardwalk. For the full year, we received total dividends of $878 million from CNA and Boardwalk, with CNA contributing $801 million of that amount.
Today CNA declared a $2 per share special dividend in addition to its regular $0.35 quarterly dividend. Combining the 2, Loews will receive $570 million in dividends from CNA this quarter. We repurchased 2.9 million shares in the fourth quarter for $135 million and 20.3 million shares during all of 2018 for just over $1 billion. Since year-end, we have repurchased an additional 0.9 million shares at an average price of about $46.50.

First of all, our earnings were very ugly, but it was driven by 2 main factors. One was catastrophe losses, and in that department, our catastrophe losses for the quarter were $146 million versus $38 million in the prior year. I should add that the $146 million of catastrophe losses that we had in the quarter was in no way disproportionate to the size of CNA. On a combined ratio basis, that was 8.6 points versus 2.3 points in the prior year fourth quarter. Aside from catastrophe losses, the other thing that hurt CNA's earnings significantly was the investment results. And specifically, the results from our LP portfolio and common stocks, which was $138 million loss in the quarter versus our fourth quarter of the prior year, which was a $50 million gain. And in my opinion, those 2 temporary factors are overshadowing a lot of the good things that are going on at CNA. Net written premiums for the year last year were up 4%, gross written premiums were up 7%, and the difference between the 7% and the 4% is the additional reinsurance that CNA is purchasing. The underlying combined ratio was 95.4%, about the same as last year. CNA paid a dividend -- announced the quarterly -- regular quarterly dividend as well as the $2 special dividend, in my opinion, reflecting the board's confidence in the results of CNA and the way that the company is operating and proceeding. CNA continues to achieve significant rate increases across a number of lines. So from my perspective, things at CNA, notwithstanding the relatively ugly quarter, are really going pretty well."

What we've seen is that there is a generational shift in spending, where the millennial generation is moving more towards experiences rather than things. We see this play out especially in Orlando, with our joint venture with Universal theme parks. We have 6 hotels there, and we're building a seventh hotel now that has 2,800 rooms. On the Comcast earnings call, Brian Roberts reported something that we already knew, that the occupancy ratio of our Orlando hotels is over 90%. And as I mentioned in my remarks, as a result of the occupancy ratio and the higher-than-market average daily rate, we're able to achieve extraordinary RevPAR numbers in that market. So what we've done is we've taken the learnings that we have from Orlando, and we've applied it to the rest of our business. First, we are striving to be close to demand generators, whether it's a sports arena, a stadium or a convention center. Secondly, we are working hard to leverage our unique position in the hotel business. We own our own hotels. We're not a manager of hotels. And therefore, we are willing to put up money to develop hotel properties, and as a result, we find that partners are very willing to work with us, and those partners are financial partners as well as municipal partners. And as a result, we are able, we find, to procure for ourselves very attractive development opportunities, which we're now moving forward with in St. Louis, in Arlington and Kansas City. When investing holding company cash, we're very, very cognizant of the need to earn good rates of return, and we believe that the hotels that we're investing in are doing just that. We have a team that's continuing to look for additional opportunities, and I suspect that in the coming years, we'll see opportunities as attractive to us as what we're doing in these 3 new markets that we're developing right now."

And I like to think that with respect to offshore drilling, I've seen this movie before in the supertanker business. In the supertanker business, there was a glut of supertankers in the early '80s. Through scrapping, deterioration of the rigs and a slight increase in demand, we saw a whipsaw recovery in the mid- to late '80s. And I see for offshore drilling a similar thing that's happening now. First of all, all of the offshore drilling companies are managing to one thing and one thing only at this point in time, and that is to cash. Cash is the thing that they're not earning, that they desperately need in order to stay in business. So for the rigs that are not operating, it's a big risk for them to spend cash on maintaining those rigs with no business opportunities in sight. And what happens, I've seen very clearly from the tanker industry and also from offshore drilling, is that when ships, rigs, drillships, are left on the water, and they're not operating, then they can deteriorate very rapidly. Combined with that, right now, oil prices are relatively low at about $52 a barrel for WTI and about $61 a barrel for Brent oil. My belief is that with an increase in oil prices, which I see happening, I think we could see over the coming years, a pretty significant increase in demand. And that demand increase will first to go to rigs that are already operating, and then later on to rigs that are stacked. Our estimation is that the cost to recommission a rig that's been stacked for a number of years can easily be in excess of $100 million per rig, and that cash today just doesn't exist in the industry to recommission more than a few rigs. So I think that the recommissioning of rigs will be slow, especially in view of the fact that our customers tend to like to use rigs that have already been working rather than rigs that are being recommissioned. So I think it's going to be a long time for rigs to come back to meet the demand that I foresee going forward. In terms of Diamond, Diamond has a relatively long runway within the industry. Diamond had, at the end of the quarter, about $450 million in cash, and it has an additional borrowing capacity of about $1 billion. So it's got close to $1.5 billion of liquidity that really is the runway for Diamond, which is substantially in excess of a lot of our other competitors. In terms of consolidation, we've looked for opportunities, but what I would say is the -- we have not been able to find any transactions that would be accretive to value for all Diamond shareholders. So we continue to look for opportunities. I would say that the spread between bid and ask for drilling assets is very wide, and the only transactions that really seem to get done these days are transactions where somebody gives their shares in return for buying other shares. But we continue to scour the earth, to have discussions, but to date, there's not much to report."

At Loews, in the first 5 weeks, 5 or 6 weeks of this year, we have earned back all that we lost in the fourth quarter of last year. So we reported a loss of about $70 million in our portfolio in the fourth quarter of last year, and the portfolio was up by more than that at Loews. At CNA, they've recovered over 60% of their losses. But let me take a minute and talk about the different types of things that people can be invested in. You can invest in stocks, you can invest in hedge funds, you can invest in private equity. And one of the things that's struck me in this past -- in the past few months is that in the fourth quarter, the S&P 500 was down 14%, our hedge funds were down about 6%, and generally, across the board, private equity firms have reported no loss at all. And I actually find that quite incredulous. It's what I would call a self-graded exam. There was a temporary drop in the market and the private equity firms didn't report a loss. It's inconceivable for me that stocks could be down 14% and that there is no loss in private equity. So CNA is in some ways bearing the pain of being marked to market, whereas in private equity, there is more of what I would call a mark to moving average, but it's just something that we have to deal with. In terms of the strategy, CNA has had a very good run with hedge funds, as has Loews. We're starting to deemphasize them because we think that, number one, there's an awful lot of capital that's invested in them. We think the returns have been competed down. Additionally, in today's -- over the past 10 years, you were able to earn 0 on your cash balances. Today you can easily earn 2.5% to 3%. So simply investing in cash is not such a terrible alternative to hedge funds. We're looking at risk assets that go beyond hedge funds and private equity. We're looking at certain debt instruments. We're looking at certain, what I would call, nontraditional private equity investments. We're just trying to figure out over the coming year, what will be the best vehicles for risk assets for both CNA and for Loews."

Loews was off to a good start in 2019 due primarily to CNA, our largest subsidiary, building on it's momentum of the last several years, CNA had strong quarterly results. Since Dino Robusto became the CEO at the end of 2016, CNA's key financial metrics have been steadily improving. In comparing full year 2016 results with first quarter 2019 results, the progress is clear. The underlying combined ratio improved by 3 points and the loss -- with a loss ratio decreasing by 2 points and the expense ratio decreasing by 1 point. 
Notwithstanding this solid progress, CNA still not satisfied. The company remains committed to further improving it's underwriting performance, continuing to strengthen relationships with distributors to grow it's broker business and managing it's expenses diligently. CNA continues to mitigate risk in it's long-term care book of business by carefully managing claimed and obtaining rate increases from state regulators when justified. 
CNA is also exploring new strategies that would simultaneously lessen the effects of rate increases on policyholders and meaningfully reduce CNA's exposure. 
As CNA moves forward, we are confident that the company will continue to grow it's business profitably and responsibly. And that it can and will deliver even stronger operating results in the future. CNA's financial stability and strength as well as it's continually improving operational performance is a major reason why Loews has recently purchased so many of it's own shares. 
Through last Friday, we've bought 7.8 million shares or about 2.5% of the outstanding shares, spending about $370 million so far in 2019. But this is nothing new for us. In 2018, we repurchase more than 20 million shares of Loews' common stocks, representing about 6.1% of our outstanding shares at a cost of just over $1 billion. 
In our view, these share repurchases benefit from what I call, a triple discount. First, we believe Loews is trading at a discount through it's intrinsic value. Second, CNA is a high yielding stock with great prospects, yet it's trading at a PE discard through its peers. And third, CNA's peer companies, in the P&C insurance industry are trading at a notable discount to the S&P 500. 
In my view, this triple discount makes repurchasing our shares an attractive value creation lever for us. I feel like the stock market is giving us a gift, and to the extend that our shares continue to trade. And while we consider to be an extraordinary discount, we are comfortable buying them in. 
Before I turn the call over to Dave, I want to mention some good news from Diamond Offshore. Earlier this morning, the company announced new contracts for 2 of drill ships with Woodside petroleum, a major Australian E&P company. These contracts would add more than 4 years of backlog at attractive market rates with potential for follow-on work. The first rig is expected to start rolling in May 2020. While the day-rate is not disclosed, the growth in diamond's backlog suggest that this charter with Woodside represent a significant uptake in charter rates. Due in large part, I believe, the diamond stellar operating record. 
David, over to you."

For the first quarter, Loews reported net income of $394 million or $1.27 per share compared to $293 million or $0.89 per share in last year's first quarter. The healthy increase was driven by 2 main factors. Number one, strong investment results at both CNA and the parent company, drove by the first quarter's robust equity market performance. And number two, Broadwalk pipeline, whose contribution to our net income more than doubled year-over-year mainly due to the increase in our ownership from 51% to the current 100%. 
While our net income was up 34% over the prior year, earnings per share increased 43% as average shares outstanding declined 5.6% from last year's first quarter. 
Now let me walk through the ins and outs of the quarter. Starting with CNA, which accounted for over 75% of our net income in Q1 2019. CNA contributed net income of $305 million. This 17% increase was driven by 3 main factors: Number one, higher net investment income; number two, a higher level of investment gains; and number three, improved performance in CNA's corporate segment. 
Before describing these 3 drivers, I'd highlight that CNA continues to successfully execute on it's strategy of profitable, premium growth. 
P&C underwriting income was down, however, year-over-year as CNA posted an all-in combined ratio in the quarter of [ 97.8% ] versus [ 93.1% ] in Q1 2018. The increase in the combined ratio was attributable to higher year-over-year cat losses, a lower level of favorable prior year development and a slightly higher underlying combined ratio. 
Importantly, the underlying combined ratio, which excludes cat losses and prior development came in at [ 94.9% ]. While this is higher than last year's first quarter, it is below CNA's full year 2018 underlying combined ratio of 95.4%. 
CNA's underlying loss ratio in the quarter was extremely strong, coming in below 61%, about 1 point better than the underlying loss ratio for full year 2018. 
On the CNA earnings call earlier today, CFO James Anderson highlighted, why it makes sense to compare this quarter's underlying underwriting results to full year 2018. 
Let me return to the 3 things that drove CNA's year-over-year earnings increase. Number one, CNA reported after-tax net investment income of $465 million, up $60 million over last year's first quarter and $186 million better than fourth quarter results. The fourth quarter was negatively impacted by the selloff in the equity markets. 
The year-over-year improvement in NII was attributable almost entirely to returns on CNA's portfolio of limited partnership and equity investments. This portfolio returned 4.5% in Q1 2019 versus 1.3% last year, and a negative 5.7% last quarter. 
Number two, CNA reported after-tax investment gains of $24 million versus $10 million last year. CNA records the mark-to-market on it's nonredeemable preferred stock holdings in investment gains and losses. 
And number three, the after-tax loss in CNA's corporate segment declined to $6 million in Q1 2019 compared to a $60 million loss last year. As the company recorded a net retroactive reinsurance benefit this year as compared to a net charge in Q1 2018. 
As a reminder, the retroactive reinsurance results relate to the 2010 loss portfolio transfer with National Indemnity, involving CNA's [indiscernible] and environmental pollution reserves. 
CNA conducted an LPT reserve review in last year's first quarter. Subsequently, however, the company decided to conduct these reviews in the fourth quarter going forward. As such, there was no review or charge; chores in Q1 2019. In fact, results benefited from the amortization of the deferred gain associated with the LPT. Taken together, the year-over-year favorable variances in CNA's investment income, investment gains and corporate segment amounted to $114 million after-tax for Loews. 
Turning to Diamond Offshore. Diamond contributed a $37 million net loss in the first quarter compared to $10 million positive contribution in last year's first quarter. As a reminder, Diamond's after-tax contribution last year would have been a $13 million loss, if not for the favorable impact of the reversal of an uncertain tax position in the quarter. The increased year-over-year loss was an outgrowth of the challenging conditions in the global offshore drilling market. 
Diamond experienced a 21% year-over-year decline in contract drilling revenues as revenue earning days were down 9%, and average daily revenue per working rig were down 12%. 
Contract drilling margins declined 10 points from 36% to 26%. Diamond remains focused on maintaining a healthy liquidity position while investing in it's fleet to ensure it's rigs are considered top tiered by customers. 
Broadwalk net income contribution more than doubled to $79 million, predominantly due to the increase in our ownership from 51% to 100% in the third quarter of 2018. Operationally, Broadwalk had a good quarter. Net revenues were up 3.6% and EBITDA margins expanded by about 2 points. 
Pretax income at Boardwalk rose 11% over Q1 2018. The revenue increase was propelled by growth projects and the transportation and storage in natural gas liquids. Revenue offsets included the decline in parking and lending, and natural gas storage, and the net impact of contract restructurings, expirations and renewals. 
Moving on to Loews Hotels, which contributed $13 million to our net income in Q1 2019, the same amount as last year. Loews Hotels underlined year-over-year earnings gains from ongoing operational improvements, work skewered by strategic repositioning activity. As the company both develops new hotels and selectively divests properties that are no longer fit it's strategy. The company booked unusual charges of $3.6 million after-tax in Q1, made largely of an impairment charge on a property held for sale, and preopening expenses on properties under development. Such charges were negligible in last year's first quarter. 
Loews Hotels adjusted EBITDA, which excludes nonrecurring items and is reported and defined in our quarterly earnings summary, was $61 million in the quarter, up from $57 million in last year's first quarter. 
Turning to the parent company. Investment income was up markedly with higher returns on equities driving the year-to-year increase. At March 31, the parent company portfolio of cash and investments totaled $3.4 billion with over 70% in cash and equivalents, and the remainder mainly in marketable equity securities and a portfolio of limited partnership investments. As a reminder, the parent company portfolio totaled close to $4.9 billion on March 31, 2018. The decline over the past 12 months resulted primarily from share repurchase activity together with a purchase last summer of the Boardwalk LP units not previously owned by Loews. 
Importantly, over the past year, we have kept our focus on liquidity by reducing our holdings of noncash assets in favor of maintaining a high level of cash and equivalents. We received $596 million in dividends from our subsidiaries during the first quarter, $26 million from Boardwalk and $570 million from CNA, which includes the $0.35 regular quarterly dividend and the $2 special dividend. 
As Jim mentioned, we repurchased 6.8 million shares of our common stock during the first quarter for a total of $322 million. 
After quarter end, we repurchased an additional 960,000 shares for $47 million. 
Let me now hand the call back to Jim."

They owuold accumulate on the balance sheet as capital and with increasing levels of capital, they would feel they have to write more business. They would write that business, it would compete rates down significantly. And then things would get bad in the industry and they would stop writing so much business because capital has dried up. And then things would move up again. The industry today is no longer cyclical like that. And the reason is, I believe, that Jay Fishman of [indiscernible] memory, who is the CEO of travelers for more than a decade have started to buy -- started to use his earnings to pay dividends and repurchase shares. And if you look at travelers over here, [indiscernible] as CEO, you see that statutory capital, which is an index of how much business you can write never increased. But the stock price went up dramatically. And that was a lesson to a lot of other companies in our sector of the market. So you see today that there is dramatically less price competition due, I believe, to the fact that capital, unnecessary capital, is not accumulating on the balance sheets of insurance companies but rather it's being used to pay dividends and repurchase shares. So I think that going back to the question. The property and cash, our sector of the P&C industry trades, my guess is about a 25% discount to the S&P 500. I think in view of the dynamics today in the market, such an enormous discount is just not warranted anymore."

So just as a reminder, we got into -- when we got into CCC, we've been studying the package industry for a few years. And then when we've had the opportunity to buy CCC, it was just the right company in just the right sector of the market. It's after the market is fragmented, meaning that there are opportunities for roll ups. There are significant economies of scale to be had by buying smaller lump pop businesses in the industry. And the other thing, though, a really good cash on cash returns that we had, especially in an environment where short-term interest rates are 0%, 1%, 2% or 3%. So that was what we got into CCC in the first place. Now let's fast forward, we have approximately the cash on cash returns that we've expected. We have the platform for growth, which has been very compelling for us. We're able to buy businesses to the seller at say, 9x EBITDA multiple. But in our hands because of our economy of scales, we're able to own them at a 6x. We have, what I think is really defensive business that in good times and bad is going to do reasonably well. And I think most important, now that we've lived with them for 2 years, we have a really, really strong managing team who knows how to manage their business, knows how to acquire other businesses, are interested in profitable growth not growth at any cost. So from my perspective, the things that CCC is really playing out. And we see more opportunities for acquisition. We see opportunities for organic growth. And we're very pleased with how this is working out for Loews and the shareholders."

Diamond reported excellent earnings -- excellent prospects today, yet the stock is down significantly. My view is that $10 a share, diamond is trading is more like a stock-option than it is a stock. We've got into diamond now over 30 years ago. And the things that I have seen about offshore drilling, it is highly cyclical. Let me take you a short trip down memory lane. When we bought into diamond, before it went public, we had invested a total of about $300 million. It went public. We got all of our cash back. And then nothing really happens for a while. I forget what price stock it went public at. But come 2007, when the drilling business was really good, the stock got to $140 a share. $140 a share. Diamond used those good times to pay dividends to shareholders. And as I think you all know, paid in excess of $40 per diamond share in dividends. So now let's fast forward from 2007 to today. Today, diamond trades just about $10. And just as I couldn't believe that, that diamond could get to $140, likewise, I can't believe that diamond has gotten to $10. So what's it's worth, I see the seeds of change in the industry. Since 2014, $120 floater rigs have been scrapped. When you also take out as a fleet, the cold stacks -- the cold stacked rigs, most of which will never come back to work. There are about 240 rigs left in the market. And they're operating at about 65% or 70% operating rate. So I saw this in the shipping industry in the early '80s. And I've seen this in the offshore drilling business. As long as the market stays at the level it's at, then will continue to be scraping from the fleet. And additionally what I believe, that with oil prices at these levels, $65 on WTI and $70 on Brent, there's more than enough opportunity for our customers to have a good operating profits on drilling prospects. So I think that there will be increases in demand for rigs. I think the size of the fleet will continue to come down. And then one day, bam, it's going to happen. Supply will have come down. Demand will go up. Demand is highly, highly, highly inelastic. And it would not be surprising at all for me, for all of us to see a day rate increases of $50,000, $100,000, $200,000 a day. There is no doubt in my mind that over the next 4 to 5 years, that can happen. And the thing I like about diamonds positioned in this industry is that it's got a lot of runway for that to happen. So I actually feel pretty good about where diamond is. One additional thing, diamond has, for us, an $800 million market value. Yet as you can see from the earnings, it has an oversized effect on Loews Corp's overall earnings. So it's one of the reasons I look at some of the parts for Loews as they value measure as opposed to earnings per share."

Rather than buying hotels in cities that may or may not fully fit but we're trying to do. We're building our own properties. Often times in partnership with municipalities that refitted to the strategy of having a demand driver nearby where we can do significant amount of group business and earn what we believe are above market returns on our equity investments. And we're building in Texas now. We're building in Kansas City. We're building in St. Louis. We're building more hotels in Orlando. And from my perspective, our plate is pretty full. And we see -- we're generating new opportunities every year. So I feel really good about the strategy. I feel really good about the opportunity set. And now it's going to be up to us and people in our hotel company to execute and generate the returns that we think are entirely within reach."

Loews is off to a good start in 2019 due primarily to CNA, our largest subsidiary. Building on its momentum of the last several years, CNA had strong quarterly results. Since Dino Robusto became the CEO at the end of 201",533,"Thank you, Mary, and good morning. Loews is off to a good start in 2019 due primarily to CNA, our largest subsidiary. Building on its momentum of the last several years, CNA had strong quarterly results. Since Dino Robusto became the CEO at the end of 2016, CNA's key financial metrics have been steadily improving. In comparing full year 2016 results with first quarter 2019 results, the progress is clear. The underlying combined ratio improved by 3 points and the loss -- with a loss ratio decreasing by 2 points and the expense ratio decreasing by 1 point. 
Notwithstanding this solid progress, CNA is still not satisfied. The company remains committed to further improving its underwriting performance, continuing to strengthen relationships with distributors to grow its book of business and managing its expenses diligently. CNA continues to mitigate risk in its long-term care book of business by carefully managing claims and obtaining rate increases from state regulators when justified. 
CNA is also exploring new strategies that would simultaneously lessen the effects of rate increases on policyholders and meaningfully reduce CNA's exposure. 
As CNA moves forward, we are confident that the company will continue to grow its business profitably and responsibly. And that it can and will deliver even stronger operating results in the future. CNA's financial stability and strength as well as its continually improving operational performance is our major -- is a major reason why Loews has recently purchased so many of its own shares. Through last Friday, we've bought 7.8 million shares or about 2.5% of the outstanding shares, spending about $370 million so far in 2019. But this is nothing new for us. In 2018, we repurchased more than 20 million shares of Loews' common stock, representing about 6.1% of our outstanding shares at a cost of just over $1 billion. 
In our view, these share repurchases benefit from, what I call, a triple discount. First, we believe Loews is trading at a discount to its intrinsic value. Second, CNA is a high-yielding stock with great prospects, yet it's trading at a PE discount to its peers. And third, CNA's peer companies, in the P&C insurance industry, are trading at a notable discount to the S&P 500. In my view, this triple discount makes repurchasing our shares an attractive value creation lever for us. I feel like the stock market is giving us a gift. And to the extent that our shares continue to trade, and while we consider to be an extraordinary discount, we are comfortable buying them in. 
Before I turn the call over to Dave, I want to mention some good news from Diamond Offshore. Earlier this morning, the company announced new contracts for 2 of its drill ships with Woodside Petroleum, a major Australian E&P company. These contracts would add more than 4 years of backlog at attractive market rates with potential for follow-on work. The first rig is expected to start drilling in late 2020. While the day rate is not disclosed, the growth in Diamond's backlog suggests that this charter with Woodside represents a significant uptick in charter rates, due in large part, I believe, to diamond's stellar operating record. 
David, over to you."
285930,609742024,1711760,"Loews Corporation, Q1 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2019",2019-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Loews Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and good morning. For the first quarter, Loews reported net income of $394 million or $1.27 per share compared to $293 million or $0.89 per share in last year's first quarter. This healthy increase was driven by 2 main factors. Number one,",1180,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning. For the first quarter, Loews reported net income of $394 million or $1.27 per share compared to $293 million or $0.89 per share in last year's first quarter. This healthy increase was driven by 2 main factors. Number one, strong investment results at both CNA and the parent company, stroked by the first quarter's robust equity market performance. And number two, Boardwalk Pipeline, whose contribution to our net income more than doubled year-over-year mainly due to the increase in our ownership from 51% to the current 100%. 
While our net income was up 34% over the prior year, earnings per share increased 43% as average shares outstanding declined 5.6% from last year's first quarter. 
Now let me walk through the ins and outs of the quarter, starting with CNA, which accounted for over 75% of our net income in Q1 2019. CNA contributed net income of $305 million. This 17% increase was driven by 3 main factors: number one, higher net investment income; number two, a higher level of investment gains; and number three, improved performance in CNA's corporate segment. Before describing these 3 drivers, I'd highlight that CNA continues to successfully execute on its strategy of profitable premium growth.  
P&C underwriting income was down, however, year-over-year as CNA posted an all-in combined ratio in the quarter of 97.8% versus 93.1% in Q1 2018. The increase in the combined ratio was attributable to higher year-over-year cat losses, a lower level of favorable prior year development and a slightly higher underlying combined ratio. 
Importantly, the underlying combined ratio, which excludes cat losses and prior development, came in at 94.9%. While this is higher than last year's first quarter, it is below CNA's full year 2018 underlying combined ratio of 95.4%. 
CNA's underlying loss ratio in the quarter was extremely strong, coming in below 61%, about 1 point better than the underlying loss ratio for full year 2018. 
On the CNA earnings call earlier today, CFO James Anderson highlighted, why it makes sense to compare this quarter's underlying underwriting results to full year 2018. 
Let me return to the 3 things that drove CNA's year-over-year earnings increase. Number one, CNA reported after-tax net investment income of $465 million, up $60 million over last year's first quarter and $186 million better than fourth quarter results. The fourth quarter was negatively impacted by the sell-off in the equity markets. The year-over-year improvement in NII was attributable almost entirely to returns on CNA's portfolio of limited partnership and equity investments. This portfolio returned 4.5% in Q1 2019 versus 1.3% last year and a negative 5.7% last quarter. Number two, CNA reported after-tax investment gains of $24 million versus $10 million last year. CNA records the mark-to-market on its nonredeemable preferred stock holdings in investment gains and losses. And number three, the after-tax loss in CNA's corporate segment declined to $6 million in Q1 2019 compared to a $60 million loss last year. As the company recorded a net retroactive reinsurance benefit this year as compared to a net charge in Q1 2018. As a reminder, the retroactive reinsurance results relate to the 2010 loss portfolio transfer with National Indemnity, involving CNA's asbestos and environmental pollution reserves. 
CNA conducted an LPT reserve review in last year's first quarter. Subsequently, however, the company decided to conduct these reviews in the fourth quarter going forward. As such, there was no review or charge in Q1 2019. In fact, results benefited from the amortization of the deferred gain associated with the LPT. Taken together, the year-over-year favorable variances in CNA's investment income, investment gains and corporate segment amounted to $114 million after-tax for Loews. 
Turning to Diamond Offshore. Diamond contributed a $37 million net loss in the first quarter compared to a $10 million positive contribution in last year's first quarter. As a reminder, Diamond's after-tax contribution last year would have been a $13 million loss, if not for the favorable impact of the reversal of an uncertain tax position in the quarter. The increased year-over-year loss was an outgrowth of the challenging conditions in the global offshore drilling market. 
Diamond experienced a 21% year-over-year decline in contract drilling revenues as revenue earning days were down 9%, and average daily revenue per working rig was down 12%. 
Contract drilling margins declined 10 points from 36% to 26%. Diamond remains focused on maintaining a healthy liquidity position while investing in its fleet to ensure its rigs are considered top tier by customers. 
Boardwalk's net income contribution more than doubled to $79 million, predominantly due to the increase in our ownership from 51% to 100% in the third quarter of 2018. Operationally, Boardwalk had a good quarter. Net revenues were up 3.6% and EBITDA margins expanded by about 2 points. 
Pretax income at Boardwalk rose 11% over Q1 2018. The revenue increase was propelled by growth projects and the transportation and storage of natural gas liquids. Revenue offsets included a decline in parking and lending, and natural gas storage, and the net impact of contract restructurings, expirations and renewals. 
Moving on to Loews Hotels, which contributed $13 million to our net income in Q1 2019, the same amount as last year. Loews Hotels' underlined year-over-year earnings gains from ongoing operational improvements were skewered by strategic repositioning activity, as the company both develops new hotels and selectively divests properties that no longer fit its strategy. The company booked unusual charges of $3.6 million after tax in Q1, made up largely of an impairment charge on a property held for sale and preopening expenses on properties under development. Such charges were negligible in last year's first quarter. 
Loews Hotels' adjusted EBITDA, which excludes nonrecurring items and is reported and defined in our quarterly earnings summary, was $61 million in the quarter, up from $57 million in last year's first quarter. 
Turning to the parent company. Investment income was up markedly with higher returns on equities driving the year-to-year increase. At March 31, the parent company portfolio of cash and investments totaled $3.4 billion with over 70% in cash and equivalents and the remainder mainly in marketable equity securities and a portfolio of limited partnership investments. As a reminder, the parent company portfolio totaled close to $4.9 billion on March 31, 2018. The decline over the past 12 months resulted primarily from share repurchase activity together with a purchase last summer of the Boardwalk LP units not previously owned by Loews. 
Importantly, over the past year, we have kept our focus on liquidity by reducing our holdings of noncash assets in favor of maintaining a high level of cash and equivalents. We received $596 million in dividends from our subsidiaries during the first quarter, $26 million from Boardwalk and $570 million from CNA, which includes the $0.35 regular quarterly dividend and the $2 special dividend. 
As Jim mentioned, we repurchased 6.8 million shares of our common stock during the first quarter for a total of $322 million. After quarter end, we repurchased an additional 960,000 shares for $47 million. 
Let me now hand the call back to Jim."

They would -- it would accumulate on their balance sheet as capital and with the increasing levels of capital, they would feel they had to write more business. They would write that business. It would compete rates down significantly. And then things would get bad in the industry and they would stop writing so much business because capital had dried up. And then things would move up again. The industry today is no longer cyclical like that. And the reason is, I believe, that Jay Fishman of blessed memory, who was the CEO of Travelers for more than a decade started to buy -- started to use his earnings to pay dividends and repurchase shares. And if you look at Travelers over his time as a CEO, you see that statutory capital, which is an index of how much business you can write, never increased. But the stock price went up dramatically. And that was a lesson to a lot of other companies in our sector of the market. So you see today that there is dramatically less price competition due, I believe, to the fact that capital -- unnecessary capital, is not accumulating on the balance sheets of insurance companies but rather it's being used to pay dividends and repurchase shares. So I think that going back to the question, the property and -- our sector of the P&C industry trades, my guess, at about a 25% discount to the S&P 500. I think in view of the dynamics today in the market, such an enormous discount is just not warranted anymore."

So just as a reminder, we got into -- when we got into CCC, we've been studying the packaging industry for a few years. And then when we've had the opportunity to buy CCC, it was just the right company in just the right sector of the market. It's after the market is fragmented, meaning that there are opportunities for roll-ups. There are significant economies of scale to be had by buying smaller mom and pop businesses in this industry. And the other thing, there are really good cash-on-cash returns to be had, especially in an environment where short-term interest rates are 0%, 1%, 2% or 3%. So that was why we got into CCC in the first place. Now let's fast forward. We've had approximately the cash-on-cash returns that we've expected. We have the platform for growth, which has been, I think, very compelling for us. We're able to buy businesses to the seller at, say, 9x EBITDA multiple. But in all hands because of our economies of scale, we're able to own them at a 6x. We have, what I think, is a really defensive business that, in good times and bad, is going to do reasonably well. And I think most important, now that we've lived with them for 2 years, we have a really, really strong management team who knows how to manage their business, knows how to acquire other businesses, are interested in profitable growth, not growth at any cost. So from my perspective, the things at CCC is really playing out. And we see more opportunities for acquisition. We see opportunities for organic growth.

Diamond reported excellent earnings -- excellent prospects today, yet the stock is down significantly. My view is that $10 a share, Diamond is trading more like a stock option than it is a stock. We've got into Diamond now over 30 years ago. And the things that I have seen about offshore drilling, it is highly cyclical. Let me take you to a short trip down memory lane. When we bought into Diamond, before it went public, we had invested a total of about $300 million. It went public. We got all of our cash back. And then nothing really happened for a while. I think -- I forget what price the stock went public at. But come 2007, when the drilling business was really good, the stock got to $140 a share. $140 a share. Diamond used those good times to pay dividends to shareholders. And as I think you all know, paid in excess of $40 per Diamond share in dividends. So now let's fast forward from 2007 to today. Today, Diamond trades just above $10. And just as I couldn't believe, the Diamond could get to $140, likewise, I can't believe that Diamond has gotten to $10. For what it's worth, I see the seeds of change in the industry. Since 2014, $120 floater rigs have been scrapped. When you also take out as a fleet, the cold stacks -- the cold stacked rigs, most of which will never come back to work, there are about 240 rigs left in the market. And they're operating at about 65% or 70% operating rate. So I saw this in the shipping industry in the early '80s, and I've seen this in the offshore drilling business. As long as the market stays at the level that it's at, they will continue to be scraping from the fleet. And additionally, what I believe, that with oil prices at these levels, $65 on WTI and $70 on Brent, there's more than enough opportunities for our customers to have good operating profits on drilling prospects. So I think that there will be increases in demand for rigs. I think the size of the fleet will continue to come down. And then one day, bam, it's going to happen. Supply will have come down. Demand will go up. Demand is highly, highly, highly inelastic. And it would not be surprising at all for me, for all of us to see day rate increases of $50,000, $100,000, $200,000 a day. There's no doubt in my mind that over the next 4 to 5 years, that can happen. And the thing I like about Diamond's position in this industry is that it's got a lot of runway for that to happen. So I actually feel pretty good about where Diamond is. One additional thing, Diamond has, for us, an $800 million market value. Yet as you can see from the earnings, it has an oversized effect on Loews Corp's overall earnings. So it's one of the reasons I look at some of the parts for Loews as they value measure as opposed to earnings per share."

I see it in Boardwalk Pipelines where we've had down EBITDA and chances are -- sorry, flat EBITDA, and the possibility of down EBITDA going forward.

Loews is off to a good start in 2019 due primarily to CNA, our largest subsidiary. Building on its momentum of the last several years, CNA had strong quarterly results. Since Dino Robusto became the CEO at the end of 201",533,"Thank you, Mary, and good morning. Loews is off to a good start in 2019 due primarily to CNA, our largest subsidiary. Building on its momentum of the last several years, CNA had strong quarterly results. Since Dino Robusto became the CEO at the end of 2016, CNA's key financial metrics have been steadily improving. In comparing full year 2016 results with first quarter 2019 results, the progress is clear. The underlying combined ratio improved by 3 points and the loss -- with a loss ratio decreasing by 2 points and the expense ratio decreasing by 1 point. 
Notwithstanding this solid progress, CNA is still not satisfied. The company remains committed to further improving its underwriting performance, continuing to strengthen relationships with distributors to grow its book of business and managing its expenses diligently. CNA continues to mitigate risk in its long-term care book of business by carefully managing claims and obtaining rate increases from state regulators when justified. 
CNA is also exploring new strategies that would simultaneously lessen the effects of rate increases on policyholders and meaningfully reduce CNA's exposure. 
As CNA moves forward, we are confident that the company will continue to grow its business profitably and responsibly, and that it can and will deliver even stronger operating results in the future. CNA's financial stability and strength as well as its continually improving operational performance is our major -- is a major reason why Loews has recently purchased so many of its own shares. Through last Friday, we've bought 7.8 million shares or about 2.5% of the outstanding shares, spending about $370 million so far in 2019. But this is nothing new for us. In 2018, we repurchased more than 20 million shares of Loews' common stock, representing about 6.1% of our outstanding shares at a cost of just over $1 billion. 
In our view, these share repurchases benefit from what I call a triple discount. First, we believe Loews is trading at a discount to its intrinsic value. Second, CNA is a high-yielding stock with great prospects, yet it's trading at a PE discount to its peers. And third, CNA's peer companies, in the P&C insurance industry, are trading at a notable discount to the S&P 500. In my view, this triple discount makes repurchasing our shares an attractive value creation lever for us. I feel like the stock market is giving us a gift. And to the extent that our shares continue to trade, and while we consider to be an extraordinary discount, we are comfortable buying them in. 
Before I turn the call over to Dave, I want to mention some good news from Diamond Offshore. Earlier this morning, the company announced new contracts for 2 of its drill ships with Woodside Petroleum, a major Australian E&P company. These contracts would add more than 4 years of backlog at attractive market rates with potential for follow-on work. The first rig is expected to start drilling in late 2020. While the day rate is not disclosed, the growth in Diamond's backlog suggests that this charter with Woodside represents a significant uptick in charter rates, due in large part, I believe, to Diamond's stellar operating record. 
David, over to you."
285930,609742024,1711846,"Loews Corporation, Q1 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2019",2019-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Loews Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and good morning. For the first quarter, Loews reported net income of $394 million or $1.27 per share compared to $293 million or $0.89 per share in last year's first quarter. This healthy increase was driven by 2 main factors. Number one,",1181,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning. For the first quarter, Loews reported net income of $394 million or $1.27 per share compared to $293 million or $0.89 per share in last year's first quarter. This healthy increase was driven by 2 main factors. Number one, strong investment results at both CNA and the parent company, stroked by the first quarter's robust equity market performance. And number two, Boardwalk Pipeline, whose contribution to our net income more than doubled year-over-year mainly due to the increase in our ownership from 51% to the current 100%. 
While our net income was up 34% over the prior year, earnings per share increased 43% as average shares outstanding declined 5.6% from last year's first quarter. 
Now let me walk through the ins and outs of the quarter, starting with CNA, which accounted for over 75% of our net income in Q1 2019. CNA contributed net income of $305 million. This 17% increase was driven by 3 main factors: number one, higher net investment income; number two, a higher level of investment gains; and number three, improved performance in CNA's corporate segment. Before describing these 3 drivers, I'd highlight that CNA continues to successfully execute on its strategy of profitable premium growth.  
P&C underwriting income was down, however, year-over-year as CNA posted an all-in combined ratio in the quarter of 97.8% versus 93.1% in Q1 2018. The increase in the combined ratio was attributable to higher year-over-year cat losses, a lower level of favorable prior year development and a slightly higher underlying combined ratio. 
Importantly, the underlying combined ratio, which excludes cat losses and prior year development, came in at 94.9%. While this is higher than last year's first quarter, it is below CNA's full year 2018 underlying combined ratio of 95.4%. 
CNA's underlying loss ratio in the quarter was extremely strong, coming in below 61%, about 1 point better than the underlying loss ratio for full year 2018. 
On the CNA earnings call earlier today, CFO James Anderson highlighted, why it makes sense to compare this quarter's underlying underwriting results to full year 2018. 
Let me return to the 3 things that drove CNA's year-over-year earnings increase. Number one, CNA reported after-tax net investment income of $465 million, up $60 million over last year's first quarter and $186 million better than fourth quarter results. The fourth quarter was negatively impacted by the sell-off in the equity markets. The year-over-year improvement in NII was attributable almost entirely to returns on CNA's portfolio of limited partnership and equity investments. This portfolio returned 4.5% in Q1 2019 versus 1.3% last year and a negative 5.7% last quarter. Number two, CNA reported after-tax investment gains of $24 million versus $10 million last year. CNA records the mark-to-market on its nonredeemable preferred stock holdings in investment gains and losses. And number three, the after-tax loss in CNA's corporate segment declined to $6 million in Q1 2019 compared to a $60 million loss last year. As the company recorded a net retroactive reinsurance benefit this year as compared to a net charge in Q1 2018. As a reminder, the retroactive reinsurance results relate to the 2010 loss portfolio transfer with National Indemnity, involving CNA's asbestos and environmental pollution reserves. 
CNA conducted an LPT reserve review in last year's first quarter. Subsequently, however, the company decided to conduct these reviews in the fourth quarter going forward. As such, there was no review or charge in Q1 2019. In fact, results benefited from the amortization of the deferred gain associated with the LPT. Taken together, the year-over-year favorable variances in CNA's investment income, investment gains and corporate segment amounted to $114 million after-tax for Loews. 
Turning to Diamond Offshore. Diamond contributed a $37 million net loss in the first quarter compared to a $10 million positive contribution in last year's first quarter. As a reminder, Diamond's after-tax contribution last year would have been a $13 million loss, if not for the favorable impact of the reversal of an uncertain tax position in the quarter. The increased year-over-year loss was an outgrowth of the challenging conditions in the global offshore drilling market. 
Diamond experienced a 21% year-over-year decline in contract drilling revenues as revenue earning days were down 9%, and average daily revenue per working rig was down 12%. 
Contract drilling margins declined 10 points from 36% to 26%. Diamond remains focused on maintaining a healthy liquidity position while investing in its fleet to ensure its rigs are considered top tier by customers. 
Boardwalk's net income contribution more than doubled to $79 million, predominantly due to the increase in our ownership from 51% to 100% in the third quarter of 2018. Operationally, Boardwalk had a good quarter. Net revenues were up 3.6% and EBITDA margins expanded by about 2 points. 
Pretax income at Boardwalk rose 11% over Q1 2018. The revenue increase was propelled by growth projects and the transportation and storage of natural gas liquids. Revenue offsets included a decline in parking and lending, and natural gas storage, and the net impact of contract restructurings, expirations and renewals. 
Moving on to Loews Hotels, which contributed $13 million to our net income in Q1 2019, the same amount as last year. Loews Hotels' underlined year-over-year earnings gains from ongoing operational improvements were obscured by strategic repositioning activity, as the company both develops new hotels and selectively divests properties that no longer fit its strategy. The company booked unusual charges of $3.6 million after tax in Q1, made up largely of an impairment charge on a property held for sale and preopening expenses on properties under development. Such charges were negligible in last year's first quarter. 
Loews Hotels' adjusted EBITDA, which excludes nonrecurring items and is reported and defined in our quarterly earnings summary, was $61 million in the quarter, up from $57 million in last year's first quarter. 
Turning to the parent company. Investment income was up markedly with higher returns on equities driving the year-to-year increase. At March 31, the parent company portfolio of cash and investments totaled $3.4 billion with over 70% in cash and equivalents and the remainder mainly in marketable equity securities and a portfolio of limited partnership investments. As a reminder, the parent company portfolio totaled close to $4.9 billion on March 31, 2018. The decline over the past 12 months resulted primarily from share repurchase activity together with a purchase last summer of the Boardwalk LP units not previously owned by Loews. 
Importantly, over the past year, we have kept our focus on liquidity by reducing our holdings of noncash assets in favor of maintaining a high level of cash and equivalents. We received $596 million in dividends from our subsidiaries during the first quarter, $26 million from Boardwalk and $570 million from CNA, which includes the $0.35 regular quarterly dividend and the $2 special dividend. 
As Jim mentioned, we repurchased 6.8 million shares of our common stock during the first quarter for a total of $322 million. After quarter end, we repurchased an additional 960,000 shares for $47 million. 
Let me now hand the call back to Jim."

They would -- it would accumulate on their balance sheet as capital and with the increasing levels of capital, they would feel they had to write more business. They would write that business. It would compete rates down significantly. And then things would get bad in the industry and they would stop writing so much business because capital had dried up. And then things would move up again. The industry today is no longer cyclical like that. And the reason is, I believe, that Jay Fishman of blessed memory, who was the CEO of Travelers for more than a decade started to buy -- started to use his earnings to pay dividends and repurchase shares. And if you look at Travelers over his time as a CEO, you see that statutory capital, which is an index of how much business you can write, never increased. But the stock price went up dramatically. And that was a lesson to a lot of other companies in our sector of the market. So you see today that there is dramatically less price competition due, I believe, to the fact that capital -- unnecessary capital is not accumulating on the balance sheets of insurance companies but rather it's being used to pay dividends and repurchase shares. So I think that going back to the question, the property and -- our sector of the P&C industry trades, my guess, at about a 25% discount to the S&P 500. I think in view of the dynamics today in the market, such an enormous discount is just not warranted anymore."

So just as a reminder, we got into -- when we got into CCC, we've been studying the packaging industry for a few years. And then when we've had the opportunity to buy CCC, it was just the right company in just the right sector of the market. Its sector of the market is fragmented, meaning that there are opportunities for roll-ups. There are significant economies of scale to be had by buying smaller mom and pop businesses in this industry. And the other thing, there are really good cash-on-cash returns to be had, especially in an environment where short-term interest rates are 0%, 1%, 2% or 3%. So that was why we got into CCC in the first place. Now let's fast forward. We've had approximately the cash-on-cash returns that we've expected. We have the platform for growth, which has been, I think, very compelling for us. We're able to buy businesses to the seller at, say, a 9x EBITDA multiple. But in all hands because of our economies of scale, we're able to own them at a 6x. We have, what I think, is a really defensive business that, in good times and bad, is going to do reasonably well. And I think most important, now that we've lived with them for 2 years, we have a really, really strong management team who knows how to manage their business, knows how to acquire other businesses, are interested in profitable growth, not growth at any cost. So from my perspective, the things at CCC is really playing out. And we see more opportunities for acquisition. We see opportunities for organic growth.

I think -- I forget what price the stock went public at. But come 2007, when the drilling business was really good, the stock got to $140 a share. $140 a share. Diamond used those good times to pay dividends to shareholders. And as I think you all know, paid in excess of $40 per Diamond share in dividends. So now let's fast forward from 2007 to today. Today, Diamond trades just above $10. And just as I couldn't believe, the Diamond could get to $140, likewise, I can't believe that Diamond has gotten to $10. For what it's worth, I see the seeds of change in the industry. Since 2014, 120 floater rigs have been scrapped. When you also take out as a fleet, the cold stacks -- the cold stacked rigs, most of which will never come back to work, there are about 240 rigs left in the market. And they're operating at about a 65% or 70% operating rate. So I saw this in the shipping industry in the early '80s, and I've seen this in the offshore drilling business. As long as the market stays at the level that it's at, there will continue to be scrapping from the fleet. And additionally with -- I believe that with oil prices at these levels, $65 on WTI and $70 on Brent, there's more than enough opportunity for our customers to have good operating profits on drilling prospects. So I think that there will be increases in demand for rigs. I think the size of the fleet will continue to come down. And then one day, bam, it's going to happen. Supply will have come down. Demand will go up. Demand is highly, highly, highly inelastic. And it would not be surprising at all for me, for all of us to see day rate increases of $50,000, $100,000, $200,000 a day. There's no doubt in my mind that over the next 4 to 5 years, that can happen. And the thing I like about Diamond's position in this industry is that it's got a lot of runway for that to happen. So I actually feel pretty good about where Diamond is. One additional thing, Diamond has, for us, an $800 million market value. Yet as you can see from the earnings, it has an oversized effect on Loews Corp's overall earnings. So it's one of the reasons I look at some of the parts for Loews as a value measure as opposed to earnings per share."

I see it in Boardwalk Pipelines where we've had down EBITDA and chances are -- sorry, flat EBITDA, and the possibility of down EBITDA going forward. But over the past year, I think there are -- we've also seen some opportunities for some upside. Likewise, CCC has opportunities in front of it.

Loews is off to a good start in 2019 due primarily to CNA, our largest subsidiary. Building on its momentum of the last several years, CNA had strong quarterly results. Since Dino Robusto became the CEO at the end of 201",533,"Thank you, Mary, and good morning. Loews is off to a good start in 2019 due primarily to CNA, our largest subsidiary. Building on its momentum of the last several years, CNA had strong quarterly results. Since Dino Robusto became the CEO at the end of 2016, CNA's key financial metrics have been steadily improving. In comparing full year 2016 results with first quarter 2019 results, the progress is clear. The underlying combined ratio improved by 3 points and the loss -- with a loss ratio decreasing by 2 points and the expense ratio decreasing by 1 point. 
Notwithstanding this solid progress, CNA is still not satisfied. The company remains committed to further improving its underwriting performance, continuing to strengthen relationships with distributors to grow its book of business and managing its expenses diligently. CNA continues to mitigate risk in its long-term care book of business by carefully managing claims and obtaining rate increases from state regulators when justified. 
CNA is also exploring new strategies that would simultaneously lessen the effects of rate increases on policyholders and meaningfully reduce CNA's exposure. 
As CNA moves forward, we are confident that the company will continue to grow its business profitably and responsibly, and that it can and will deliver even stronger operating results in the future. CNA's financial stability and strength as well as its continually improving operational performance is our major -- is a major reason why Loews has recently purchased so many of its own shares. Through last Friday, we've bought 7.8 million shares or about 2.5% of the outstanding shares, spending about $370 million so far in 2019. But this is nothing new for us. In 2018, we repurchased more than 20 million shares of Loews' common stock, representing about 6.1% of our outstanding shares at a cost of just over $1 billion. 
In our view, these share repurchases benefit from what I call a triple discount. First, we believe Loews is trading at a discount to its intrinsic value. Second, CNA is a high-yielding stock with great prospects, yet it's trading at a PE discount to its peers. And third, CNA's peer companies, in the P&C insurance industry, are trading at a notable discount to the S&P 500. In my view, this triple discount makes repurchasing our shares an attractive value creation lever for us. I feel like the stock market is giving us a gift. And to the extent that our shares continue to trade, and while we consider to be an extraordinary discount, we are comfortable buying them in. 
Before I turn the call over to Dave, I want to mention some good news from Diamond Offshore. Earlier this morning, the company announced new contracts for 2 of its drill ships with Woodside Petroleum, a major Australian E&P company. These contracts would add more than 4 years of backlog at attractive market rates with potential for follow-on work. The first rig is expected to start drilling in late 2020. While the day rate is not disclosed, the growth in Diamond's backlog suggests that this charter with Woodside represents a significant uptick in charter rates, due in large part, I believe, to Diamond's stellar operating record. 
David, over to you."

For the first quarter, Loews reported net income of $394 million or $1.27 per share compared to $293 million or $0.89 per share in last year's first quarter. This healthy increase was driven by 2 main factors. Number one,",1181,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning. For the first quarter, Loews reported net income of $394 million or $1.27 per share compared to $293 million or $0.89 per share in last year's first quarter. This healthy increase was driven by 2 main factors. Number one, strong investment results at both CNA and the parent company, stroked by the first quarter's robust equity market performance. And number two, Boardwalk Pipeline, whose contribution to our net income more than doubled year-over-year mainly due to the increase in our ownership from 51% to the current 100%. 
While our net income was up 34% over the prior year, earnings per share increased 43% as average shares outstanding declined 5.6% from last year's first quarter. 
Now let me walk through the ins and outs of the quarter, starting with CNA, which accounted for over 75% of our net income in Q1 2019. CNA contributed net income of $305 million. This 17% increase was driven by 3 main factors: number one, higher net investment income; number two, a higher level of investment gains; and number three, improved performance in CNA's corporate segment. Before describing these 3 drivers, I'd highlight that CNA continues to successfully execute on its strategy of profitable premium growth.  
P&C underwriting income was down, however, year-over-year as CNA posted an all-in combined ratio in the quarter of 97.8% versus 93.1% in Q1 2018. The increase in the combined ratio was attributable to higher year-over-year cat losses, a lower level of favorable prior year development and a slightly higher underlying combined ratio. 
Importantly, the underlying combined ratio, which excludes cat losses and prior year development, came in at 94.9%. While this is higher than last year's first quarter, it is below CNA's full year 2018 underlying combined ratio of 95.4%. 
CNA's underlying loss ratio in the quarter was extremely strong, coming in below 61%, about 1 point better than the underlying loss ratio for full year 2018. 
On the CNA earnings call earlier today, CFO James Anderson highlighted, why it makes sense to compare this quarter's underlying underwriting results to full year 2018. 
Let me return to the 3 things that drove CNA's year-over-year earnings increase. Number one, CNA reported after-tax net investment income of $465 million, up $60 million over last year's first quarter and $186 million better than fourth quarter results. The fourth quarter was negatively impacted by the sell-off in the equity markets. The year-over-year improvement in NII was attributable almost entirely to returns on CNA's portfolio of limited partnership and equity investments. This portfolio returned 4.5% in Q1 2019 versus 1.3% last year and a negative 5.7% last quarter. Number two, CNA reported after-tax investment gains of $24 million versus $10 million last year. CNA records the mark-to-market on its nonredeemable preferred stock holdings in investment gains and losses. And number three, the after-tax loss in CNA's corporate segment declined to $6 million in Q1 2019 compared to a $60 million loss last year. As the company recorded a net retroactive reinsurance benefit this year as compared to a net charge in Q1 2018. As a reminder, the retroactive reinsurance results relate to the 2010 loss portfolio transfer with National Indemnity, involving CNA's asbestos and environmental pollution reserves. 
CNA conducted an LPT reserve review in last year's first quarter. Subsequently, however, the company decided to conduct these reviews in the fourth quarter going forward. As such, there was no review or charge in Q1 2019. In fact, results benefited from the amortization of the deferred gain associated with the LPT. Taken together, the year-over-year favorable variances in CNA's investment income, investment gains and corporate segment amounted to $114 million after-tax for Loews. 
Turning to Diamond Offshore. Diamond contributed a $37 million net loss in the first quarter compared to a $10 million positive contribution in last year's first quarter. As a reminder, Diamond's after-tax contribution last year would have been a $13 million loss, if not for the favorable impact of the reversal of an uncertain tax position in the quarter. The increased year-over-year loss was an outgrowth of the challenging conditions in the global offshore drilling market. 
Diamond experienced a 21% year-over-year decline in contract drilling revenues as revenue earning days were down 9%, and average daily revenue per working rig was down 12%. 
Contract drilling margins declined 10 points from 36% to 26%. Diamond remains focused on maintaining a healthy liquidity position while investing in its fleet to ensure its rigs are considered top tier by customers. 
Boardwalk's net income contribution more than doubled to $79 million, predominantly due to the increase in our ownership from 51% to 100% in the third quarter of 2018. Operationally, Boardwalk had a good quarter. Net revenues were up 3.6% and EBITDA margins expanded by about 2 points. 
Pretax income at Boardwalk rose 11% over Q1 2018. The revenue increase was propelled by growth projects and the transportation and storage of natural gas liquids. Revenue offsets included a decline in parking and lending, and natural gas storage, and the net impact of contract restructurings, expirations and renewals. 
Moving on to Loews Hotels, which contributed $13 million to our net income in Q1 2019, the same amount as last year. Loews Hotels' underlined year-over-year earnings gains from ongoing operational improvements were obscured by strategic repositioning activity, as the company both develops new hotels and selectively divests properties that no longer fit its strategy. The company booked unusual charges of $3.6 million after tax in Q1, made up largely of an impairment charge on a property held for sale and preopening expenses on properties under development. Such charges were negligible in last year's first quarter. 
Loews Hotels' adjusted EBITDA, which excludes nonrecurring items and is reported and defined in our quarterly earnings summary, was $61 million in the quarter, up from $57 million in last year's first quarter. 
Turning to the parent company. Investment income was up markedly with higher returns on equities driving the year-to-year increase. At March 31, the parent company portfolio of cash and investments totaled $3.4 billion with over 70% in cash and equivalents and the remainder mainly in marketable equity securities and a portfolio of limited partnership investments. As a reminder, the parent company portfolio totaled close to $4.9 billion on March 31, 2018. The decline over the past 12 months resulted primarily from share repurchase activity together with a purchase last summer of the Boardwalk LP units not previously owned by Loews. 
Importantly, over the past year, we have kept our focus on liquidity by reducing our holdings of noncash assets in favor of maintaining a high level of cash and equivalents. We received $596 million in dividends from our subsidiaries during the first quarter, $26 million from Boardwalk and $570 million from CNA, which includes the $0.35 regular quarterly dividend and the $2 special dividend. 
As Jim mentioned, we repurchased 6.8 million shares of our common stock during the first quarter for a total of $322 million. After quarter end, we repurchased an additional 960,000 shares for $47 million. 
Let me now hand the call back to Jim."

The stock market declined 14% in the fourth quarter and has increased 13% in the first quarter. In other words, the volatility in the stock market over that time period was the driver of the volatility in our portfolio.

We encourage shareholders to send us questions that they would like us to answer. And we hope that they continue to do so. 
Our first question is to Jim. Jim, since the P&C industry has always traded at a discount to the market, why is today's discount significant as you think about share repurchases?"
285930,609742024,1714325,"Loews Corporation, Q1 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2019",2019-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Loews Corporation","Executives","So I believe that the insurance industry, the property & casualty insurance industry, the commercial property & casualty insurance industry, where CNA is dramatically less cyclical today than it was previously. 10, 20 and 30 years ago, in the insurance in",308,"So I believe that the insurance industry, the property & casualty insurance industry, the commercial property & casualty insurance industry, where CNA is dramatically less cyclical today than it was previously. 10, 20 and 30 years ago, in the insurance industry, companies would earn money. They would -- it would accumulate on their balance sheet as capital and with the increasing levels of capital, they would feel they had to write more business. They would write that business. It would compete rates down significantly. And then things would get bad in the industry and they would stop writing so much business because capital had dried up. And then things would move up again. The industry today is no longer cyclical like that. And the reason is, I believe, that Jay Fishman of blessed memory, who was the CEO of Travelers for more than a decade started to buy -- started to use his earnings to pay dividends and repurchase shares. And if you look at Travelers over his time as a CEO, you see that statutory capital, which is an index of how much business you can write, never increased. But the stock price went up dramatically. And that was a lesson to a lot of other companies in our sector of the market. So you see today that there is dramatically less price competition due, I believe, to the fact that capital -- unnecessary capital is not accumulating on the balance sheets of insurance companies but rather it's being used to pay dividends and repurchase shares. So I think that going back to the question, the property and -- our sector of the P&C industry trades, my guess, at about a 25% discount to the S&P 500. I think in view of the dynamics today in the market, such an enormous discount is just not warranted anymore."

So just as a reminder, we got into -- when we got into CCC, we've been studying the packaging industry for a few years. And then when we've had the opportunity to buy CCC, it was just the right company in just the right sector of the market. Its sector of the market is fragmented, meaning that there are opportunities for roll-ups. There are significant economies of scale to be had by buying smaller mom and pop businesses in this industry. And the other thing, there are really good cash-on-cash returns to be had, especially in an environment where short-term interest rates are 0%, 1%, 2% or 3%. So that was why we got into CCC in the first place. Now let's fast forward. We've had approximately the cash-on-cash returns that we've expected. We have the platform for growth, which has been, I think, very compelling for us. We're able to buy businesses to the seller at, say, a 9x EBITDA multiple. But in all hands because of our economies of scale, we're able to own them at a 6x. We have, what I think, is a really defensive business that, in good times and bad, is going to do reasonably well. And I think most important, now that we've lived with them for 2 years, we have a really, really strong management team who knows how to manage their business, knows how to acquire other businesses, are interested in profitable growth, not growth at any cost. So from my perspective, the things at CCC is really playing out. And we see more opportunities for acquisition. We see opportunities for organic growth. And we're very pleased with how this is working out for Loews and its shareholders."

Diamond reported excellent earnings -- excellent prospects today, yet the stock is down significantly. My view is that at $10 a share, Diamond is trading more like a stock option than it is a stock. We've got into Diamond now over 30 years ago. And the thing that I have seen about offshore drilling, it is highly cyclical. Let me take you to a short trip down memory lane. When we bought into Diamond, before it went public, we had invested a total of about $300 million. It went public. We got all of our cash back. And then nothing really happened for a while. I think -- I forget what price the stock went public at. But come 2007, when the drilling business was really good, the stock got to $140 a share. $140 a share. Diamond used those good times to pay dividends to shareholders. And as I think you all know, paid in excess of $40 per Diamond share in dividends. So now let's fast forward from 2007 to today. Today, Diamond trades just above $10. And just as I couldn't believe, the Diamond could get to $140, likewise, I can't believe that Diamond has gotten to $10. For what it's worth, I see the seeds of change in the industry. Since 2014, 120 floater rigs have been scrapped. When you also take out as a fleet, the cold stacks -- the cold stacked rigs, most of which will never come back to work, there are about 240 rigs left in the market. And they're operating at about a 65% or 70% operating rate. So I saw this in the shipping industry in the early '80s, and I've seen this in the offshore drilling business. As long as the market stays at the level that it's at, there will continue to be scrapping from the fleet. And additionally with -- I believe that with oil prices at these levels, $65 on WTI and $70 on Brent, there's more than enough opportunity for our customers to have good operating profits on drilling prospects. So I think that there will be increases in demand for rigs. I think the size of the fleet will continue to come down. And then one day, bam, it's going to happen. Supply will have come down. Demand will go up. Demand is highly, highly, highly inelastic. And it would not be surprising at all for me, for all of us to see day rate increases of $50,000, $100,000, $200,000 a day. There's no doubt in my mind that over the next 4 to 5 years, that can happen. And the thing I like about Diamond's position in this industry is that it's got a lot of runway for that to happen. So I actually feel pretty good about where Diamond is. One additional thing, Diamond has, for us, an $800 million market value. Yet as you can see from the earnings, it has an oversized effect on Loews Corp's overall earnings. So it's one of the reasons I look at some of the parts for Loews as a value measure as opposed to earnings per share."

I see it in Boardwalk Pipelines where we've had down EBITDA and chances are -- sorry, flat EBITDA, and the possibility of down EBITDA going forward.

Loews is off to a good start in 2019 due primarily to CNA, our largest subsidiary. Building on its momentum of the last several years, CNA had strong quarterly results. Since Dino Robusto became the CEO at the end of 201",533,"Thank you, Mary, and good morning. Loews is off to a good start in 2019 due primarily to CNA, our largest subsidiary. Building on its momentum of the last several years, CNA had strong quarterly results. Since Dino Robusto became the CEO at the end of 2016, CNA's key financial metrics have been steadily improving. In comparing full year 2016 results with first quarter 2019 results, the progress is clear. The underlying combined ratio improved by 3 points and the loss -- with a loss ratio decreasing by 2 points and the expense ratio decreasing by 1 point. 
Notwithstanding this solid progress, CNA is still not satisfied. The company remains committed to further improving its underwriting performance, continuing to strengthen relationships with distributors to grow its book of business and managing its expenses diligently. CNA continues to mitigate risk in its long-term care book of business by carefully managing claims and obtaining rate increases from state regulators when justified. 
CNA is also exploring new strategies that would simultaneously lessen the effects of rate increases on policyholders and meaningfully reduce CNA's exposure. 
As CNA moves forward, we are confident that the company will continue to grow its business profitably and responsibly, and that it can and will deliver even stronger operating results in the future. CNA's financial stability and strength as well as its continually improving operational performance is our major -- is a major reason why Loews has recently purchased so many of its own shares. Through last Friday, we've bought 7.8 million shares or about 2.5% of the outstanding shares, spending about $370 million so far in 2019. But this is nothing new for us. In 2018, we repurchased more than 20 million shares of Loews' common stock, representing about 6.1% of our outstanding shares at a cost of just over $1 billion. 
In our view, these share repurchases benefit from what I call a triple discount. First, we believe Loews is trading at a discount to its intrinsic value. Second, CNA is a high-yielding stock with great prospects, yet it's trading at a PE discount to its peers. And third, CNA's peer companies, in the P&C insurance industry, are trading at a notable discount to the S&P 500. In my view, this triple discount makes repurchasing our shares an attractive value creation lever for us. I feel like the stock market is giving us a gift. And to the extent that our shares continue to trade, and while we consider to be an extraordinary discount, we are comfortable buying them in. 
Before I turn the call over to Dave, I want to mention some good news from Diamond Offshore. Earlier this morning, the company announced new contracts for 2 of its drill ships with Woodside Petroleum, a major Australian E&P company. These contracts would add more than 4 years of backlog at attractive market rates with potential for follow-on work. The first rig is expected to start drilling in late 2020. While the day rate is not disclosed, the growth in Diamond's backlog suggests that this charter with Woodside represents a significant uptick in charter rates, due in large part, I believe, to Diamond's stellar operating record. 
David, over to you."

And number two, Boardwalk Pipeline, whose contribution to our net income more than doubled year-over-year mainly due to the increase in our ownership from 51% to the current 100%. 
While our net income was up 34% over the prior year, earnings per share increased 43% as average shares outstanding declined 5.6% from last year's first quarter. 
Now let me walk through the ins and outs of the quarter, starting with CNA, which accounted for over 75% of our net income in Q1 2019. CNA contributed net income of $305 million. This 17% increase was driven by 3 main factors: number one, higher net investment income; number two, a higher level of investment gains; and number three, improved performance in CNA's corporate segment. Before describing these 3 drivers, I'd highlight that CNA continues to successfully execute on its strategy of profitable premium growth.  
P&C underwriting income was down, however, year-over-year as CNA posted an all-in combined ratio in the quarter of 97.8% versus 93.1% in Q1 2018. The increase in the combined ratio was attributable to higher year-over-year cat losses, a lower level of favorable prior year development and a slightly higher underlying combined ratio. 
Importantly, the underlying combined ratio, which excludes cat losses and prior year development, came in at 94.9%. While this is higher than last year's first quarter, it is below CNA's full year 2018 underlying combined ratio of 95.4%. 
CNA's underlying loss ratio in the quarter was extremely strong, coming in below 61%, about 1 point better than the underlying loss ratio for full year 2018. 
On the CNA earnings call earlier today, CFO James Anderson highlighted, why it makes sense to compare this quarter's underlying underwriting results to full year 2018. 
Let me return to the 3 things that drove CNA's year-over-year earnings increase. Number one, CNA reported after-tax net investment income of $465 million, up $60 million over last year's first quarter and $186 million better than fourth quarter results. The fourth quarter was negatively impacted by the sell-off in the equity markets. The year-over-year improvement in NII was attributable almost entirely to returns on CNA's portfolio of limited partnership and equity investments. This portfolio returned 4.5% in Q1 2019 versus 1.3% last year and a negative 5.7% last quarter. Number two, CNA reported after-tax investment gains of $24 million versus $10 million last year. CNA records the mark-to-market on its nonredeemable preferred stock holdings in investment gains and losses. And number three, the after-tax loss in CNA's corporate segment declined to $6 million in Q1 2019 compared to a $60 million loss last year. As the company recorded a net retroactive reinsurance benefit this year as compared to a net charge in Q1 2018. As a reminder, the retroactive reinsurance results relate to the 2010 loss portfolio transfer with National Indemnity, involving CNA's asbestos and environmental pollution reserves. 
CNA conducted an LPT reserve review in last year's first quarter. Subsequently, however, the company decided to conduct these reviews in the fourth quarter going forward. As such, there was no review or charge in Q1 2019. In fact, results benefited from the amortization of the deferred gain associated with the LPT. Taken together, the year-over-year favorable variances in CNA's investment income, investment gains and corporate segment amounted to $114 million after-tax for Loews. 
Turning to Diamond Offshore. Diamond contributed a $37 million net loss in the first quarter compared to a $10 million positive contribution in last year's first quarter. As a reminder, Diamond's after-tax contribution last year would have been a $13 million loss, if not for the favorable impact of the reversal of an uncertain tax position in the quarter. The increased year-over-year loss was an outgrowth of the challenging conditions in the global offshore drilling market. 
Diamond experienced a 21% year-over-year decline in contract drilling revenues as revenue earning days were down 9%, and average daily revenue per working rig was down 12%. 
Contract drilling margins declined 10 points from 36% to 26%. Diamond remains focused on maintaining a healthy liquidity position while investing in its fleet to ensure its rigs are considered top tier by customers. 
Boardwalk's net income contribution more than doubled to $79 million, predominantly due to the increase in our ownership from 51% to 100% in the third quarter of 2018. Operationally, Boardwalk had a good quarter. Net revenues were up 3.6% and EBITDA margins expanded by about 2 points. 
Pretax income at Boardwalk rose 11% over Q1 2018. The revenue increase was propelled by growth projects and the transportation and storage of natural gas liquids. Revenue offsets included a decline in parking and lending, and natural gas storage, and the net impact of contract restructurings, expirations and renewals. 
Moving on to Loews Hotels, which contributed $13 million to our net income in Q1 2019, the same amount as last year. Loews Hotels' underlined year-over-year earnings gains from ongoing operational improvements were obscured by strategic repositioning activity, as the company both develops new hotels and selectively divests properties that no longer fit its strategy. The company booked unusual charges of $3.6 million after tax in Q1, made up largely of an impairment charge on a property held for sale and preopening expenses on properties under development. Such charges were negligible in last year's first quarter. 
Loews Hotels' adjusted EBITDA, which excludes nonrecurring items and is reported and defined in our quarterly earnings summary, was $61 million in the quarter, up from $57 million in last year's first quarter. 
Turning to the parent company. Investment income was up markedly with higher returns on equities driving the year-to-year increase. At March 31, the parent company portfolio of cash and investments totaled $3.4 billion with over 70% in cash and equivalents and the remainder mainly in marketable equity securities and a portfolio of limited partnership investments. As a reminder, the parent company portfolio totaled close to $4.9 billion on March 31, 2018. The decline over the past 12 months resulted primarily from share repurchase activity together with a purchase last summer of the Boardwalk LP units not previously owned by Loews. 
Importantly, over the past year, we have kept our focus on liquidity by reducing our holdings of noncash assets in favor of maintaining a high level of cash and equivalents. We received $596 million in dividends from our subsidiaries during the first quarter, $26 million from Boardwalk and $570 million from CNA, which includes the $0.35 regular quarterly dividend and the $2 special dividend. 
As Jim mentioned, we repurchased 6.8 million shares of our common stock during the first quarter for a total of $322 million. After quarter end, we repurchased an additional 960,000 shares for $47 million. 
Let me now hand the call back to Jim."

Our first question is to Jim. Jim, since the P&C industry has always traded at a discount to the market, why is today's discount significant as you think about share repurchases?"

They would -- it would accumulate on their balance sheet as capital and with the increasing levels of capital, they would feel they had to write more business. They would write that business. It would compete rates down significantly. And then things would get bad in the industry and they would stop writing so much business because capital had dried up. And then things would move up again. The industry today is no longer cyclical like that. And the reason is, I believe, that Jay Fishman of blessed memory, who was the CEO of Travelers for more than a decade started to buy -- started to use his earnings to pay dividends and repurchase shares. And if you look at Travelers over his time as a CEO, you see that statutory capital, which is an index of how much business you can write, never increased. But the stock price went up dramatically. And that was a lesson to a lot of other companies in our sector of the market. So you see today that there is dramatically less price competition due, I believe, to the fact that capital -- unnecessary capital is not accumulating on the balance sheets of insurance companies but rather it's being used to pay dividends and repurchase shares. So I think that going back to the question, the property and -- our sector of the P&C industry trades, my guess, at about a 25% discount to the S&P 500. I think in view of the dynamics today in the market, such an enormous discount is just not warranted anymore."

So just as a reminder, we got into -- when we got into CCC, we've been studying the packaging industry for a few years. And then when we've had the opportunity to buy CCC, it was just the right company in just the right sector of the market. Its sector of the market is fragmented, meaning that there are opportunities for roll-ups. There are significant economies of scale to be had by buying smaller mom and pop businesses in this industry. And the other thing, there are really good cash-on-cash returns to be had, especially in an environment where short-term interest rates are 0%, 1%, 2% or 3%. So that was why we got into CCC in the first place. Now let's fast forward. We've had approximately the cash-on-cash returns that we've expected. We have the platform for growth, which has been, I think, very compelling for us. We're able to buy businesses to the seller at, say, a 9x EBITDA multiple. But in all hands because of our economies of scale, we're able to own them at a 6x. We have, what I think, is a really defensive business that, in good times and bad, is going to do reasonably well. And I think most important, now that we've lived with them for 2 years, we have a really, really strong management team who knows how to manage their business, knows how to acquire other businesses, are interested in profitable growth, not growth at any cost. So from my perspective, the things at CCC is really playing out. And we see more opportunities for acquisition. We see opportunities for organic growth.

Diamond reported excellent earnings -- excellent prospects today, yet the stock is down significantly. My view is that at $10 a share, Diamond is trading more like a stock option than it is a stock. We've got into Diamond now over 30 years ago. And the thing that I have seen about offshore drilling, it is highly cyclical. Let me take you to a short trip down memory lane. When we bought into Diamond, before it went public, we had invested a total of about $300 million. It went public. We got all of our cash back. And then nothing really happened for a while. I think -- I forget what price the stock went public at. But come 2007, when the drilling business was really good, the stock got to $140 a share. $140 a share. Diamond used those good times to pay dividends to shareholders. And as I think you all know, paid in excess of $40 per Diamond share in dividends. So now let's fast forward from 2007 to today. Today, Diamond trades just above $10. And just as I couldn't believe, the Diamond could get to $140, likewise, I can't believe that Diamond has gotten to $10. For what it's worth, I see the seeds of change in the industry. Since 2014, 120 floater rigs have been scrapped. When you also take out as a fleet, the cold stacks -- the cold stacked rigs, most of which will never come back to work, there are about 240 rigs left in the market. And they're operating at about a 65% or 70% operating rate. So I saw this in the shipping industry in the early '80s, and I've seen this in the offshore drilling business. As long as the market stays at the level that it's at, there will continue to be scrapping from the fleet. And additionally with -- I believe that with oil prices at these levels, $65 on WTI and $70 on Brent, there's more than enough opportunity for our customers to have good operating profits on drilling prospects. So I think that there will be increases in demand for rigs. I think the size of the fleet will continue to come down. And then one day, bam, it's going to happen. Supply will have come down. Demand will go up. Demand is highly, highly, highly inelastic. And it would not be surprising at all for me, for all of us to see day rate increases of $50,000, $100,000, $200,000 a day. There's no doubt in my mind that over the next 4 to 5 years, that can happen. And the thing I like about Diamond's position in this industry is that it's got a lot of runway for that to happen. So I actually feel pretty good about where Diamond is. One additional thing, Diamond has, for us, an $800 million market value. Yet as you can see from the earnings, it has an oversized effect on Loews Corp's overall earnings. So it's one of the reasons I look at some of the parts for Loews as a value measure as opposed to earnings per share."

Loews had another good quarter with strong results from our largest subsidiary CNA.In the quarter, CNA's domestic property and casualty, net written premium was up by 8% and rate was up by about 4%. The sizable increas",818,"Thank you, Mary, and good morning. Loews had another good quarter with strong results from our largest subsidiary CNA.
In the quarter, CNA's domestic property and casualty, net written premium was up by 8% and rate was up by about 4%. The sizable increase over last year and last quarter reflects significant new business development as well as sustained improvement in pricing across a number of business lines.
Since our CFO, David Erickson will do a deeper dive in the CNS numbers, I want to focus my remarks today primarily on CNA strategic direction over the mid- to long-term. Our confidence in their strategy and the state of the P&C industry.
Reflecting our confidence in CNA, through last Friday, Loews' spent nearly $0.5 billion on share repurchases, and CNA currently accounts for more than 70% of the value of each low share.
Now that I've told you, how much we believe in their strategy, let me walk you through some of the reasoning for this confidence.
CNA's management team has done their work to enhance profitability by establishing a highly disciplined expert underwriting culture. Additionally, the company has strengthened its talent pool and built mechanisms to share expertise across the organization through a critical investments in technology and analytics.
At the same time, CNA has indented a disciplined awareness of expense management throughout the company.  This CNA team has worked diligently and successfully to deliver improved growth and profitability with the goal of remaining a consistent top quartile underwriter.
CNA's underlying loss ratio continues to be in line with loss ratios of the company's peers. In terms of the expense ratio, there are still a few points of improvements to be have and the CNA team has plans to achieve their improvement.
Adding to my confidence in CNA and without diminishing the company's achievements and what is a still a competitive marketplace, in my 40 years of experience in the insurance industry, I have never known it to be more financially disciplined that it has been for the past 5 years. Since CNA and its peer companies as allocating almost all of their earnings to dividends and share buybacks, there is less appetite to underwrite unprofitable risk, with the continual return of capital to shareholders over that 5-year period, managements are load to disappoint their investors with the strategies to increase volume at the expense of profitability.
Turning to Diamond Offshore, the company continues to be affected by a longer-than-expected downturn in the offshore drilling market. As I mentioned last quarter, while Diamond may add a lot of noise to Loews' quarterly results, our downside is limited to the value of our equity states, which comes to less than $2 per low share.
And although we offshore drilling market continues to be challenging, there is a positive side to the ledger. Since 2015, Diamond has restructured its fleet to focus on its most competitive assets and have selectively invested in several assets that operate in an attractive niche markets. Furthermore, Diamond has differentiated itself from the competition through value-added innovations that enhance drilling efficiency and save customers time and money.
Diamond has -- excuse me, Diamond has accomplished all of this while maintaining its focus on operational excellence and continuous improvements in safety.  We believe that these actions, coupled with prudent financial management, have positioned Diamond to capitalize on an eventual recovery.
We also have some news from our packaging subsidiaries CCC, which made an exciting acquisition of June of this year. It brought trice a straight distribution, which expanded CCC's footprint in the pharmaceutical packaging space, specialty growth segment in the industry. Pharmaceutical packaging now accounts for more than 11% of CCC's total sales. By way of background, Loews acquired CCC a little over 2 years ago. Since then, the company has made 6 tuck-in acquisitions for a total purchase price of $300 million, all of which were funded at the CCC level.
These acquisitions, either added to scale at extremely attractive post-synergy multiples or increase CCC's presence in specialty segment.
The management team continues to reevaluate other possible targets that could add size and scale or diversify CCC in 2 segments with a strong growth potential.
Finally, it wouldn't be a Lowe's Earnings Call without a mention of share repurchases. Funset, 10 years ago, Loews had about 40% more shares outstanding than it does today.  As for this year to date, we've repurchased just over 10 million shares. And in the second quarter of this year, we repurchased a little over 3 million shares.
We have continued to buy Lowe's just talk, because in our view, it's still trading below its intrinsic value.  not mention the fact that share repurchases remains an important way that we create long-term value for our Loews shareholders.
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to David Adelson, Lowe's CFO, who will explain key drivers for the quarter."

For the second quarter, Loews reported net income of $249 million or $0.82 per share compared to [ $230 million ] or $0.72 per share in last year's second quarter.Our net income was up 8% over the prior year, while our",1197,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning. For the second quarter, Loews reported net income of $249 million or $0.82 per share compared to [ $230 million ] or $0.72 per share in last year's second quarter.
Our net income was up 8% over the prior year, while our earnings per share increased 14% as average share outstanding declined almost 5% from Q2 2018, given our share repurchase activity.
CNA continues to be by far the largest contributor to our net income and a posted a slight year-over-year increase. The bulk of the quarterly increase, however, was driven by boardwalk pipelines, as its net income contribution more than tripled, mainly due to 2 factors. Number one, our ownership increase from 51% last year to the current 100%. And two, board workbook and net benefit of $19 million, resulting from a customer bankruptcy and related contract cancellation.
Offsetting the increases from boardwalk and CNA were lower year-over-year contributions by Diamond Offshore and Loews Hotels. Despite the fact that Loews Hotels had an excellent quarter operationally.
Let me now delve into the results in more depth.
CNA contributed net income of $249 million, up from $240 million last year.  This modest increase resulted from several nearly offsetting factors.
Underlying underwriting income, which excludes catastrophe losses in prior year development improved with CNA posting an underlying combined ratio of [ 94 dot 6], which was  [ point 7 ] points better than last year's second quarter.
Despite the increase in underlying underwriting income, however, total underwriting income declined because of a lower level of favorable prior year development and marginally higher cat losses.
CNA's calendar year combined ratio was 95.7, which was 1.9 points above last year's second quarter results, but still highly respectable.
CNA's after-tax investment income and its P&C segment was essentially identical to Q2 2018.
The corporate and lighting group segments both had significant variable variances.  In last year's second quarter, CNA incurred one-time costs from transitioning to a new IT infrastructure service provider. These nonrecurring costs were booked in CNA's corporate segment.
And in life and group, results improved largely from continuing favorable persistency and long-term care, as many policyholders chose to lapse coverage or reduce benefits in lie of premium rate increases.
Finally, an early redemption charge under retirement of debt reduced CNA's contribution to our net income by $15 million.
In summary, CNA posted strong P&C underwriting and investment results and improved results in its non-P&C segments.
Turning to Diamond Offshore. Diamond contributed a $52 million net loss compared to a $37 million net loss in last year's second quarter.
Diamond's results continue to be negatively affected by the challenging conditions in the global offshore drilling market, while numerous factors impacted Diamond's quarterly results in comparison. Let me highlight 3 of them. Number one, contract drilling revenues were down 22% year-over-year as revenue earning days declined 8% and average daily revenue per working rig was down 14%. Downtime, contract timing and lower day rates drove these declines. Number two, contract drilling expenses were up 19% with the increase largely attributable to the adverse impact of the amortization of deferred contract prep and move cost incurred to ready certain rates for their current contracts. And number  3, Diamond booked a break impairment charge last year, which reduced Diamond's contribution to our Q2 2018 net income by $12 million and a gain on sale this year, which increased our net income by $5 million.
As we have highlighted for the past several quarters, Diamond remains focused on maintaining a healthy liquidity position, while investing in its fleet to ensure its rigs are considered top tier by customers.
Boardwalk net income contribution was $53 million, up from $16 million in Q2 2018, mainly due to the increase in our ownership from 51% to a 100% and the contract cancellation payment referenced earlier.
Operationally, boardwalk had a good quarter. Absent the contract cancellation payment, net revenues were up 5.7%, EBITDA margins expanded by about 50 basis points, and EBITDA rose 6.3%.
The underlying revenue increase was propelled by growth projects recently placed in service, revenue offsets included the net impact of contract restructurings, expirations and renewals.
Let's turn to a Loews Hotels, which contributed $12 million to our net income, down from $17 million last year. Loews Hotels underlying year-over-year earnings gains were obscured this quarter by preopening expenses on properties under development and by the write off of capitalized cost related to our terminated development project.
These items totaled $7 million after-tax in Q2 versus almost no such expenses last year.
Revenues declined mainly due to the sale of 2 owned hotel properties during the past 12 months as well as renovations at a few owned hotels. As a reminder, Loews Hotels uses the equity method of accounting for its joint venture properties, meaning the revenues for those properties, which include the hotels at the universal Orlando resort are not shown its revenue in our GAAP financial results.
Loews Hotels adjusted EBITDA, which excludes nonrecurring items and is reported and defined in our quarterly earnings summary, was $68 million in the quarter, up from $67 million in last year's second quarter. Year-to-date, adjusted EBITDA is a $129 million versus a $123 million last year.
I would note that the renovation activity, cited above and the sale of 3 properties of the last 12 months, 2 owned and 1 JV, held back the year we're adjusted year-over-year comparison. The opening among -- of almost 4100 rooms in Kansas City, Orlando, St. Louis and Arlington Texas, from Q2 2019 through Q4 2020, should provide a boost to adjusted EBITDA.
Turning to the parent company. Investment income was down modestly, contributing to the decline was a lower level of invested assets, including a much smaller portfolio of limited partnership investments. At June 30, the parent company portfolio of cash and investments totaled $3.5 billion, with 80% in cash and equivalents and the remainder mainly in marketable equity securities and a portfolio of limited partnership investments. The LP portfolio has declined from about $950 million at June 30, 2018, to [ $250 million ] at quarter end, consistent with our decision to shrink the size of this portfolio.
As a reminder, the parent company portfolio totaled $4.7 billion on June 30, 2018, which was just prior to the July 2018 purchase for $1.5 billion of the Boardwalk LP units not previously owned by Loews.
Consolidated container, which is reported as part of other corporate results completed the acquisition of tri-state distribution late in the second quarter. Nonrecurring expenses connected to the acquisition, negatively affected other corporate results in Q2.
We received $110 million in dividends from our subsidiaries during the past quarter, $25 million from boardwalk and $85 million from CNA. Dividends received year-to-date total just over $700 million.
We repurchased 3 million shares of our common stock during the second quarter for a total of $151 million. After quarter end, we repurchased an additional 421,000 shares for just under $23 million.
Year-to-date, we have repurchased 10.25 million quarter million shares or 3.3% of our shares outstanding at the beginning of the year.
I will now hand the call back to Mary"

So as David said, a year ago, we had about $4.7 billion in cash and liquid investments and today, that number is about $3.5 billion. The reason, the cash and liquidity investment has declined because, offsetting the close to [ $1 billion ] of cash in flows that we had from dividends over the past year from our subsidiaries, we spent $1.5 billion acquiring of the minority interest in boardwalk, we've also spent approximately $1 billion on share repurchases.
So with $3.5 billion rather than close to $5 billion, we decided that we needed to make some adjustments in our investment portfolio. And one of the areas where we especially wanted to make an adjustment was in our hedge funds. We decided that the returns that we received on the hedge funds have not been sufficient for the risk. My guess for why that's been the case is that the hedge fund space, as I think everybody knows, is very, very crowded and returns have been completed away. So we have still retained about [ $215 million ] in hedge funds, and we also have approximately $600 million in equities -- and other than that our investments are primarily in treasury bills, treasury notes and other short-term money market instruments."

So in my mind, this is created a massive supply/demand and balance between assets that are for sale and buyers that are equal -- that are eager to buy them.
So what's happened is that multiples have moved up rather significantly, and they have moved up in just about every subsector of the market. Making that is worst, investment bankers and sellers have found adjustments to earnings with which to market their assets. There is now a term called adjusted EBITDA, and as you might imagine, when someone is selling a business, adjusted EBITDA is higher often times, significantly higher than that stated EBITDA. Those adjustments reflect what sellers consider to be one-time cost that should be excluded and future benefits that should be included. So as a result, while the Samson charge may show prior to asset multiples approaching their [ 0 7 ] peaks, it's my estimation that, in fact, they force to pass it.
And as I like to say, welcome to the world of low interest rates. My guess is that what we've seen going on we persist for some kind, and while we remain dutifully on watch for any potential opportunities, I'm basically pretty skeptical that we'll be adding a new leg in this environment. What I'm seeing today is that you really need synergies in order to make the math on any corporate acquisition work.
So for all of these reasons, we continue to acquire assets where we currently have strong businesses that can make use of these synergies. But it seems to me highly unlikely that we'll get into any new industry or business at this point in time."

We were attracted to CCC because it was a good-sized player in a highly highly fragmented market that we felt could serve as a platform for growth for Loews in the packaging industry.  As I mentioned on the call, in the past several years, Loews Hotels acquired CCC. We have made 6 tuck-in acquisitions. These acquisitions have helped us to diversify CCC away from the dairy and water packaging business, which has been declining, and it's also -- these acquisitions have also added very significant post-acquisitions synergies. These tuck-ins were all financed, self-funded by CCC, but all is not entirely sunshine in roses. These are the headwinds in the industry, including increased labor costs and also steeper decline in the dairy and water volumes than we had previously expected. But overall, the investment thesis still holds. Now in terms of adding value to their customers, CCC's first step with any customer is to try to understand what their priorities are to develop a customized packaging solution for them. So one example of the providing value-added is a CCC innovation that adds value, not only by helping customers meet their needs, but also by reducing the impact of plastic packaging on the environment. And specifically, what I'm talking about is a product from CCC, called, Dura-Lite, it's a -- in the packaging world it really is a majorly poured. Dura-Lite was introduced in 2016, and it's a technology that creates plastic container that is as strong or stronger than the original, but using 10% to 20% less rows and. So Dura-Lite bottles now make up more than 50% of all the dairy and water gallon bottles that CCC ships and our side of that, it's that the Dura-Lite product has translated into $9 million fewer pounds of resin being used by CCC, which gets us to the environmental part of the question. CCC has also, I'm proud to say, the second largest producer and United States of recycle, high density power you are feeling, which is the major represented CCC users. In the past, manufacturers have been reticent to use recycled resin in packaging because it was more expensive per unit than words of resin. But more recently, to I believe that the focus on sustainability, that pictures are starting to see any dimension. And we're seeing that more companies are taking an interest in using this greener somewhat more expensive packaging material.
I'd like to add that CCC takes very seriously the impact that plastic packaging has on the earth and it continues to develop solutions that are better for the world and better for CCC's customers."

What I'm pleased about with respect to Diamond, is that it has a fleet that is very strong and capable and when recovery comes, which it eventually will, I believe that Diamond will be able to do well in that environment. I think that a big problem for offshore drilling has been the price of oil, which has been not only volatile, but relatively low. It's competing with shale production, which -- offshore drilling has been competing with shale production, and right now that is -- the flavor do your the oil market. But now all this time has passed and while the offshore drilling market has been weak, what we have seen as a large amount of scrapping in the offshore drilling space. I've been through this movie once before in the supertanker business, in the early to mid-80s, and there are 2 things that are going on simultaneously. Number 1, we're seeing that demand is going down, and we're also seeing that rigs are being laid up. And as they get laid up and as companies don't have the funds to -- as the companies don't have the funds to maintain and invest in those rags, they deteriorate sitting on the water as they do in a highly corrosive environment. And after a few years of that, our rigs become more and more expensive to reactivate. So my guess is that all over the next several years, we're going to -- if oil prices don't improve and if activity does increase -- does not increase significantly, we will see more rigs scrapped no longer in the market. And at some point in time, the supply and -- the demand curve will change, there will be more demand for rigs, and bingo, there won't be enough supply. And before you know it, rates will go up again. So my view is that there will be, at some point in time, a change in the marketplace.
Going back to my $2 comment, I mentioned that because Diamond Offshore is consolidated with Loews and so it's a earnings show up and our net income numbers. And the mention of $2 was simply a reflection of the fact that even though, those profit and loss numbers may be significant within Loews that the total value of our investment, according this -- to Mr. Market is less than $2 per Loews share."

Loews had another good quarter with strong results from our largest subsidiary CNA.In the quarter, CNA's domestic property and casualty net written premium was up by 8% and rate was up by about 4%. The sizable increase",805,"Thank you, Mary, and good morning. Loews had another good quarter with strong results from our largest subsidiary CNA.
In the quarter, CNA's domestic property and casualty net written premium was up by 8% and rate was up by about 4%. The sizable increase over last year and last quarter reflect significant new business development as well as sustained improvement in pricing across a number of business lines.
Since our CFO, David Edelson, will do a deeper dive into CNA's numbers, I want to focus my remarks today primarily on CNA's strategic direction over the mid to long term, our confidence in their strategy and the state of the P&C industry.
Reflecting our confidence in CNA, through last Friday, Loews spent nearly $0.5 billion on share repurchases, and CNA currently accounts for more than 70% of the value of each Loews share.
Now that I've told you how much we believe in their strategy, let me walk you through some of the reasoning for this confidence.
CNA's management team has done their work to enhance profitability by establishing a highly disciplined expert underwriting culture. Additionally, the company has strengthened its talent pool and built mechanisms to share expertise across the organization through critical investments in technology and analytics.
At the same time, CNA has indented a disciplined awareness of expense management throughout the company. The CNA team has worked diligently and successfully to deliver improved growth and profitability, with the goal of remaining a consistent top quartile underwriter.
CNA's underlying loss ratio continues to be in line with loss ratios of the company's peers. In terms of the expense ratio, there are still a few points of improvements to be had and the CNA team has plans to achieve their improvement.
Adding to my confidence in CNA and without diminishing the company's achievements and what is still a competitive marketplace, in my 40 years of experience in the insurance industry, I have never known it to be more financially disciplined that it has been for the past 5 years. Since CNA and its peer companies are allocating almost all of their earnings to dividends and share buybacks, there is less appetite to underwrite unprofitable risk. With a continual return of capital to shareholders over that 5-year period, managements are loathed to disappoint their investors with strategies to increase volume at the expense of profitability.
Turning to Diamond Offshore, the company continues to be affected by a longer-than-expected downturn in the offshore drilling market. As I mentioned last quarter, while Diamond may add a lot of noise to Loews' quarterly results, our downside is limited to the value of our equity stake, which comes to less than $2 per Loews share.
And although the offshore drilling market continues to be challenging, there is a positive side to the ledger. Since 2015, Diamond has restructured its fleet to focus on its most competitive assets and has selectively invested in several assets that operate in attractive niche markets. Furthermore, Diamond has differentiated itself from the competition through value-added innovations that enhance drilling efficiency and save customers time and money.
Diamond has accomplished all of this while maintaining its focus on operational excellence and continuous improvements in safety.  We believe that these actions, coupled with prudent financial management, have positioned Diamond to capitalize on an eventual recovery.
We also have some news from our packaging subsidiary, CCC, which made an exciting acquisition at June of this year. It bought Tri State Distribution, which expanded CCC's footprint in the pharmaceutical packaging space, a specialty growth segment in the industry. Pharmaceutical packaging now accounts for more than 11% of CCC's total sales. By way of background, Loews acquired CCC a little over 2 years ago. Since then, the company has made 6 tuck-in acquisitions for a total purchase price of $300 million, all of which were funded at the CCC level.
These acquisitions either added scale at extremely attractive post-synergy multiples or increased CCC's presence in specialty segment.
The management team continues to evaluate other possible targets that could add size and scale or diversify CCC into segments with strong growth potential.
Finally, it wouldn't be a Loews' earnings call without a mention of share repurchases. Fun fact, 10 years ago, Loews had about 40% more shares outstanding than it does today. As for this year, to date, we've repurchased just over 10 million shares. And in the second quarter of this year, we repurchased a little over 3 million shares.
We've continued to buy Loews stock, because in our view, it's still trading below its intrinsic value. Not mention the fact that share repurchases remain an important way that we create long-term value for all Loews' shareholders.
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to David Edelson, Loews' CFO, who will explain key drivers for the quarter."

For the second quarter, Loews reported net income of $249 million or $0.82 per share compared to $230 million or $0.72 per share in last year's second quarter.
Our net income was up 8% over the prior year, while our earnings per share increased 14% as average shares outstanding declined almost 5% from Q2 2018, given our share repurchase activity.
CNA continued to be by far the largest contributor to our net income and it posted a slight year-over-year increase. The bulk of the quarterly increase, however, was driven by Boardwalk Pipelines, as its net income contribution more than tripled, mainly due to 2 factors. Number one, our ownership increased from 51% last year to the current 100%. And two, Boardwalk booked a net benefit of $19 million resulting from a customer bankruptcy and related contract cancellation.
Offsetting the increases from Boardwalk and CNA were lower year-over-year contributions by Diamond Offshore and Loews Hotels, despite the fact that Loews Hotels had an excellent quarter operationally.
Let me now delve into the results in more depth.
CNA contributed net income of $249 million, up from $240 million last year. This modest increase resulted from several nearly offsetting factors.
Underlying underwriting income, which excludes catastrophe losses in prior year development, improved with CNA posting an underlying combined ratio of 94.6%, which was 0.7 points better than last year's second quarter.
Despite the increase in underlying underwriting income, however, total underwriting income declined because of a lower level of favorable prior year development and marginally higher cat losses.
CNA's calendar year combined ratio was 95.7%, which was 1.9 points above last year's second quarter result but still highly respectable.
CNA's after-tax investment income in its P&C segment was essentially identical to Q2 2018.
The Corporate and Life & Group segments both had significant favorable variances. In last year's second quarter, CNA incurred onetime costs from transitioning to a new IT infrastructure service provider. These nonrecurring costs were booked in CNA's corporate segment.
And in Life & Group, results improved largely from continuing favorable persistency and long-term care, as many policyholders chose to lapse coverage or reduce benefits in lieu of premium rate increases.
Finally, an early redemption charge on the retirement of debt reduced CNA's contribution to our net income by $15 million.
In summary, CNA posted strong P&C underwriting and investment results and improved results in its non-P&C segments.
Turning to Diamond Offshore. Diamond contributed a $52 million net loss compared to a $37 million net loss in last year's second quarter.
Diamond's results continue to be negatively affected by the challenging conditions in the global offshore drilling market, while numerous factors impacted Diamond's quarterly results in comparison. Let me highlight 3 of them. Number one, contract drilling revenues were down 22% year-over-year as revenue earning days declined 8% and average daily revenue per working rig was down 14%. Downtime, contract timing and lower day rates drove these declines. 
Number two, contract drilling expenses were up 19% with the increase largely attributable to the adverse impact of the amortization of deferred contract prep and mob cost incurred to ready certain rigs for their current contracts.
And number three, Diamond booked a rig impairment charge last year, which reduced Diamond's contribution to our Q2 2018 net income by $12 million and a gain on sale this year, which increased our net income by $5 million.
As we have highlighted for the past several quarters, Diamond remains focused on maintaining a healthy liquidity position, while investing in its fleet to ensure its rigs are considered top tier by customers.
Boardwalk net income contribution was $53 million, up from $16 million in Q2 2018, mainly due to the increase in our ownership from 51% to a 100% and the contract cancellation payment referenced earlier.
Operationally, Boardwalk had a good quarter. Absent the contract cancellation payment, net revenues were up 5.7%, EBITDA margins expanded by about 50 basis points and EBITDA rose 6.3%.
The underlying revenue increase was propelled by growth projects recently placed in service, revenue offsets included the net impact of contract restructurings, expirations and renewals.
Let's turn to Loews Hotels, which contributed $12 million to our net income, down from $17 million last year. Loews Hotels underlying year-over-year earnings gains were obscured this quarter by preopening expenses on properties under development and by the write-off of capitalized costs related to a terminated development project.
These items totaled $7 million after-tax in Q2 versus almost no such expenses last year.
Revenues declined mainly due to the sale of 2 owned hotel properties during the past 12 months as well as renovations at a few owned hotels. As a reminder, Loews Hotels uses the equity method of accounting for its joint venture properties, meaning the revenues for those properties, which include the hotels at the Universal Orlando Resort are not shown as revenue in our GAAP financial results.
Loews Hotels adjusted EBITDA, which excludes nonrecurring items and is reported and defined in our quarterly earnings summary, was $68 million in the quarter, up from $67 million in last year's second quarter. Year-to-date, adjusted EBITDA is a $129 million versus a $123 million last year.
I would note that the renovation activity cited above and the sale of 3 properties of the last 12 months, 2 owned and 1 JV, held back the year-over-year adjusted EBITDA comparison. The opening of almost 4,100 rooms in Kansas City, Orlando, St. Louis and Arlington, Texas, from Q2 2019 through Q4 2020, should provide a boost to adjusted EBITDA.
Turning to the parent company. Investment income was down modestly, contributing to the decline was a lower level of invested assets, including a much smaller portfolio of limited partnership investments. At June 30, the parent company portfolio of cash and investments totaled $3.5 billion, with 80% in cash and equivalents and the remainder mainly in marketable equity securities and a portfolio of limited partnership investments. The LP portfolio has declined from about $950 million at June 30, 2018, to $250 million at quarter end, consistent with our decision to shrink the size of this portfolio.
As a reminder, the parent company portfolio totaled $4.7 billion on June 30, 2018, which was just prior to the July 2018 purchase for $1.5 billion of the Boardwalk LP units not previously owned by Loews.
Consolidated container, which is reported as part of other corporate results, completed the acquisition of Tri State Distribution late in the second quarter. Nonrecurring expenses connected to the acquisition negatively affected other corporate results in Q2.
We received $110 million in dividends from our subsidiaries during the past quarter, $25 million from Boardwalk and $85 million from CNA. Dividends received year-to-date total just over $700 million.
We repurchased 3 million shares of our common stock during the second quarter for a total of $151 million. After quarter end, we repurchased an additional 421,000 shares for just under $23 million.
Year-to-date, we have repurchased 10.25 million quarter million shares or 3.3% of our shares outstanding at the beginning of the year.
I will now hand the call back to Mary."

So as David said, a year ago, we had about $4.7 billion in cash and liquid investments and today, that number is about $3.5 billion. The reason, the cash and liquidity investments has declined is because, offsetting the close to $1 billion of cash inflow that we had from dividends over the past year from our subsidiaries, we spent $1.5 billion acquiring the minority interest in Boardwalk and we also spent approximately $1 billion on share repurchases.
So with $3.5 billion rather than close to $5 billion, we decided that we needed to make some adjustments in our investment portfolio. And one of the areas where we especially wanted to make an adjustment was in our hedge funds. We decided that the returns that we've received on the hedge funds haven't been sufficient for the risk. My guess for why that's been the case is that the hedge fund space, as I think everybody knows, is very, very crowded and returns have been competed away. So we still retain about $215 million in hedge funds, and we also have approximately $600 million in equities. And other than that, our investments are primarily in treasury bills, treasury notes and other short-term money market instruments."

So in my mind, this has created a massive supply/demand imbalance between assets that are for sale and buyers that are equal -- that are eager to buy them.
So what's happened is that multiples have moved up rather significantly, and they've moved up in just about every subsector of the market. Making that is worst, investment bankers and sellers have found adjustments to earnings with which to market their assets. There is now a term called adjusted EBITDA, and as you might imagine, when someone is selling a business, adjusted EBITDA is higher oftentimes, significantly higher than the stated EBITDA. Those adjustments reflect what sellers consider to be onetime cost that should be excluded and future benefits that should be included. So as a result, while the fancy charts may show private asset multiples approaching their '07 peaks, it's my estimation that, in fact, they far surpass it.
And as I like to say, welcome to the world of low interest rates. My guess is that what we've seen going on will persist for some kind. And while we remain dutifully on watch for any potential opportunities, I'm basically pretty skeptical that we'll be adding a new leg in this environment. What I'm seeing today is that you really need synergies in order to make the math on any corporate acquisition work.
So for all of these reasons, we continue to acquire assets where we currently have strong businesses that can make use of the synergies. But it seems to me highly unlikely that we'll get into any new industry or business at this point in time."

We were attracted to CCC because it was a good-sized player in a highly, highly fragmented market that we felt could serve as a platform for growth for Loews in the packaging industry. As I mentioned on the call, in the past several years, Loews -- since Loews acquired CCC, we've made 6 tuck-in acquisitions. These acquisitions have helped us to diversify CCC away from the dairy and water packaging business, which has been declining, and it's also -- these acquisitions have also added very significant post-acquisition synergies. These tuck-ins were all financed, self-funded by CCC. But all is not entirely sunshine and roses. There are the headwinds in the industry, including increased labor costs and also a steeper decline in the dairy and water volumes than we had previously expected. But overall, the original investment thesis still holds.
Now in terms of adding value to their customers, CCC's first step with any customer is to try to understand what their priorities are and to develop a customized packaging solution for them. So one example of providing value-added is a recent CCC innovation that adds value, not only by helping customers meet their needs, but also by reducing the impact of plastic packaging on the environment. And specifically, what I'm talking about is a product from CCC, called Dura-Lite, it's a -- in the packaging world, it really is a major leap forward. Dura-Lite was introduced in 2016, and it's a technology that creates a plastic container that is as strong or stronger than the original, but using 10% to 20% less resin.
So Dura-Lite bottles now make up more than 50% of all the dairy and water gallon bottles that CCC ships. And a side effect of that is that the Dura-Lite product has translated into $9 million fewer pounds of resin being used by CCC, which gets us to the environmental part of the question. CCC is also, I'm proud to say, the second largest producer in the United States of recycled, high-density polyethylene, which is the major resin that CCC uses.
In the past, manufacturers have been reticent to use recycled resin in packaging because it was more expensive per unit than virgin resin. But more recently, do I believe to the focus on sustainability, that picture has started to change. And we're seeing that more companies are taking an interest in using this greener somewhat more expensive packaging material.
I'd like to add that CCC takes very seriously the impact that plastic packaging has on the earth and it continues to develop solutions that are better for the world and better for CCC's customers."

What I'm pleased about with respect to Diamond is that it has a fleet that is very strong and capable, and when the recovery comes, which it eventually will,",406,"So my outlook is that the offshore drilling business is going to come back at some point in time. What I'm pleased about with respect to Diamond is that it has a fleet that is very strong and capable, and when the recovery comes, which it eventually will, I believe that Diamond will be able to do well in that environment. I think that a big problem for offshore drilling has been the price of oil, which has been not only volatile, but relatively low. It's competing with shale production, which -- offshore drilling has been competing with shale production, and right now, that is the flavor du jour for the oil markets.
But now all this time has passed and while the offshore drilling market has been weak, what we've seen is a large amount of scrapping in the offshore drilling space. I've been through this movie once before in the supertanker business, in the early to mid-80s, and there are 2 things that are going on simultaneously.
Number one, we're seeing that demand is going down, and we're also seeing that rigs are being laid up. And as they get laid up and as companies don't have the funds to maintain and invest in those rigs, they deteriorate sitting on the water, as they do, a highly corrosive environment. And after a few years of that, our rigs become more and more expensive to reactivate. So my guess is that over the next several years, we're going to -- if oil prices don't improve and if activity does increase -- does not increase significantly, we will see more rigs scrapped no longer in the market. And then at some point in time, the supply and the demand curve will change, there will be more demand for rigs, and bingo, there won't be enough supply. And before you know it, rates will go up again. So my view is that there will be, at some point in time, a change in the marketplace.
Going back to my $2 comment, I mentioned that because Diamond Offshore is consolidated with Loews and so its earnings show up in our net income numbers. And the mention of $2 was simply a reflection of the fact that even though those profit and loss numbers may be significant within Loews that the total value of our investment, according this -- to Mr. Market is less than $2 per Loews share."

Loews had another good quarter with strong results from our largest subsidiary CNA.In the quarter, CNA's domestic property and casualty net written premium was up by 8% and rate was up by about 4%. The sizable increase",806,"Thank you, Mary, and good morning. Loews had another good quarter with strong results from our largest subsidiary CNA.
In the quarter, CNA's domestic property and casualty net written premium was up by 8% and rate was up by about 4%. The sizable increase over last year and last quarter reflect significant new business development as well as sustained improvement in pricing across a number of business lines.
Since our CFO, David Edelson, will do a deeper dive into CNA's numbers, I want to focus my remarks today primarily on CNA's strategic direction over the mid to long term, our confidence in their strategy and the state of the P&C industry.
Reflecting our confidence in CNA, through last Friday, Loews spent nearly $0.5 billion on share repurchases, and CNA currently accounts for more than 70% of the value of each Loews share.
Now that I've told you how much we believe in their strategy, let me walk you through some of the reasoning for this confidence.
CNA's management team has done the work to enhance profitability by establishing a highly disciplined expert underwriting culture. Additionally, the company has strengthened its talent pool and built mechanisms to share expertise across the organization through critical investments in technology and analytics.
At the same time, CNA has embedded a disciplined awareness of expense management throughout the company. The CNA team has worked diligently and successfully to deliver improved growth and profitability, with the goal of remaining a consistent top quartile underwriter.
CNA's underlying loss ratio continues to be in line with the loss ratios of the company's peers. In terms of the expense ratio, there are still a few points of improvements to be had and the CNA team has plans to achieve that improvement.
Adding to my confidence in CNA and without diminishing the company's achievements in what is still a competitive marketplace, in my 40 years of experience in the insurance industry, I have never known it to be more financially disciplined than it has been for the past 5 years. Since CNA and its peer companies are allocating almost all of their earnings to dividends and share buybacks, there is less appetite to underwrite unprofitable risk. With a continual return of capital to shareholders over that 5-year period, managements are loathed to disappoint their investors with strategies to increase volume at the expense of profitability.
Turning to Diamond Offshore, the company continues to be affected by a longer-than-expected downturn in the offshore drilling market. As I mentioned last quarter, while Diamond may add a lot of noise to Loews' quarterly results, our downside is limited to the value of our equity stake, which comes to less than $2 per Loews share.
And although the offshore drilling market continues to be challenging, there is a positive side to the ledger. Since 2015, Diamond has restructured its fleet to focus on its most competitive assets and has selectively invested in several assets that operate in attractive niche markets. Furthermore, Diamond has differentiated itself from the competition through value-added innovations that enhance drilling efficiency and save customers time and money.
Diamond has accomplished all of this while maintaining its focus on operational excellence and continuous improvements in safety. We believe that these actions, coupled with prudent financial management, have positioned Diamond to capitalize on an eventual recovery.
We also have some news from our packaging subsidiary, CCC, which made an exciting acquisition in June of this year. It bought Tri State Distribution, which expanded CCC's footprint in the pharmaceutical packaging space, a specialty growth segment in the industry. Pharmaceutical packaging now accounts for more than 11% of CCC's total sales. By way of background, Loews acquired CCC a little over 2 years ago. Since then, the company has made 6 tuck-in acquisitions for a total purchase price of $300 million, all of which were funded at the CCC level.
These acquisitions either added scale at extremely attractive post-synergy multiples or increased CCC's presence in specialty segments.
The management team continues to evaluate other possible targets that could add size and scale or diversify CCC into segments with strong growth potential.
Finally, it wouldn't be a Loews earnings call without a mention of share repurchases. Fun fact: 10 years ago, Loews had about 40% more shares outstanding than it does today. As for this year, to date, we've repurchased just over 10 million shares. And in the second quarter of this year, we repurchased a little over 3 million shares.
We've continued to buy Loews stock, because, in our view, it's still trading below its intrinsic value. Not mention the fact that share repurchases remain an important way that we create long-term value for all Loews shareholders.
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to David Edelson, Loews' CFO, who will explain key drivers for the quarter."

For the second quarter, Loews reported net income of $249 million or $0.82 per share compared to $230 million or $0.72 per share in last year's second quarter.
Our net income was up 8% over the prior year, while our earnings per share increased 14% as average shares outstanding declined almost 5% from Q2 2018, given our share repurchase activity.
CNA continued to be by far the largest contributor to our net income and it posted a slight year-over-year increase. The bulk of the quarterly increase, however, was driven by Boardwalk Pipelines, as its net income contribution more than tripled, mainly due to 2 factors. Number one, our ownership increased from 51% last year to the current 100%. And two, Boardwalk booked a net benefit of $19 million resulting from a customer bankruptcy and related contract cancellation.
Offsetting the increases from Boardwalk and CNA were lower year-over-year contributions by Diamond Offshore and Loews Hotels, despite the fact that Loews Hotels had an excellent quarter operationally.
Let me now delve into the results in more depth.
CNA contributed net income of $249 million, up from $240 million last year. This modest increase resulted from several nearly offsetting factors.
Underlying underwriting income, which excludes catastrophe losses in prior year development, improved, with CNA posting an underlying combined ratio of 94.6%, which was 0.7 points better than last year's second quarter.
Despite the increase in underlying underwriting income, however, total underwriting income declined because of a lower level of favorable prior year development and marginally higher cat losses.
CNA's calendar year combined ratio was 95.7%, which was 1.9 points above last year's second quarter result but still highly respectable.
CNA's after-tax investment income in its P&C segment was essentially identical to Q2 2018.
The Corporate and Life & Group segments both had significant favorable variances. In last year's second quarter, CNA incurred onetime costs from transitioning to a new IT infrastructure service provider. These nonrecurring costs were booked in CNA's corporate segment.
And in Life & Group, results improved largely from continuing favorable persistency and long-term care, as many policyholders chose to lapse coverage or reduce benefits in lieu of premium rate increases.
Finally, an early redemption charge on the retirement of debt reduced CNA's contribution to our net income by $15 million.
In summary, CNA posted strong P&C underwriting and investment results and improved results in its non-P&C segments.
Turning to Diamond Offshore. Diamond contributed a $52 million net loss compared to a $37 million net loss in last year's second quarter.
Diamond's results continue to be negatively affected by the challenging conditions in the global offshore drilling market. While numerous factors impacted Diamond's quarterly results in comparison, let me highlight 3 of them. Number one, contract drilling revenues were down 22% year-over-year as revenue earning days declined 8% and average daily revenue per working rig was down 14%. Downtime, contract timing and lower day rates drove these declines. 
Number two, contract drilling expenses were up 19%, with the increase largely attributable to the adverse impact of the amortization of deferred contract prep and mob costs incurred to ready certain rigs for their current contracts.
And number three, Diamond booked a rig impairment charge last year, which reduced Diamond's contribution to our Q2 2018 net income by $12 million and a gain on sale this year, which increased our net income by $5 million.
As we have highlighted for the past several quarters, Diamond remains focused on maintaining a healthy liquidity position, while investing in its fleet to ensure its rigs are considered top tier by customers.
Boardwalk's net income contribution was $53 million, up from $16 million in Q2 2018, mainly due to the increase in our ownership from 51% to 100% and the contract cancellation payment referenced earlier.
Operationally, Boardwalk had a good quarter. Absent the contract cancellation payment, net revenues were up 5.7%, EBITDA margins expanded by about 50 basis points and EBITDA rose 6.3%.
The underlying revenue increase was propelled by growth projects recently placed in service. Revenue offsets included the net impact of contract restructurings, expirations and renewals.
Let's turn to Loews Hotels, which contributed $12 million to our net income, down from $17 million last year. Loews Hotels' underlying year-over-year earnings gains were obscured this quarter by preopening expenses on properties under development and by the write-off of capitalized costs related to a terminated development project.
These items totaled $7 million after-tax in Q2 versus almost no such expenses last year.
Revenues declined mainly due to the sale of 2 owned hotel properties during the past 12 months as well as renovations at a few owned hotels. As a reminder, Loews Hotels uses the equity method of accounting for its joint venture properties, meaning the revenues for those properties, which include the hotels at the Universal Orlando Resort, are not shown as revenue in our GAAP financial results.
Loews Hotels' adjusted EBITDA, which excludes nonrecurring items and is reported and defined in our quarterly earnings summary, was $68 million in the quarter, up from $67 million in last year's second quarter. Year-to-date, adjusted EBITDA is a $129 million versus $123 million last year.
I would note that the renovation activity cited above and the sale of 3 properties over the last 12 months, 2 owned and 1 JV, held back the year-over-year adjusted EBITDA comparison. The opening of almost 4,100 rooms in Kansas City, Orlando, St. Louis and Arlington, Texas, from Q2 2019 through Q4 2020, should provide a boost to adjusted EBITDA.
Turning to the parent company. Investment income was down modestly. Contributing to the decline was a lower level of invested assets, including a much smaller portfolio of limited partnership investments. At June 30, the parent company portfolio of cash and investments totaled $3.5 billion, with 80% in cash and equivalents and the remainder mainly in marketable equity securities and a portfolio of limited partnership investments. The LP portfolio has declined from about $950 million at June 30, 2018, to $250 million at quarter end, consistent with our decision to shrink the size of this portfolio.
As a reminder, the parent company portfolio totaled $4.7 billion on June 30, 2018, which was just prior to the July 2018 purchase for $1.5 billion of the Boardwalk LP units not previously owned by Loews.
Consolidated container, which is reported as part of other corporate results, completed the acquisition of Tri State Distribution late in the second quarter. Nonrecurring expenses connected to the acquisition negatively affected other corporate results in Q2.
We received $110 million in dividends from our subsidiaries during the past quarter, $25 million from Boardwalk and $85 million from CNA. Dividends received year-to-date total just over $700 million.
We repurchased 3 million shares of our common stock during the second quarter for a total of $151 million. After quarter end, we repurchased an additional 421,000 shares for just under $23 million.
Year-to-date, we have repurchased 10.25 million shares or 3.3% of our shares outstanding at the beginning of the year.
I will now hand the call back to Mary."

So as David said, a year ago, we had about $4.7 billion in cash and liquid investments and today, that number is about $3.5 billion. The reason the cash and liquid investments has declined is because, offsetting the close to $1 billion of cash inflow that we had from dividends over the past year from our subsidiaries, we spent $1.5 billion acquiring the minority interest in Boardwalk and we also spent approximately $1 billion on share repurchases.
So with $3.5 billion rather than close to $5 billion, we decided that we needed to make some adjustments in our investment portfolio. And one of the areas where we especially wanted to make an adjustment was in our hedge funds. We decided that the returns that we've received on the hedge funds haven't been sufficient for the risk. My guess for why that's been the case is that the hedge fund space, as I think everybody knows, is very, very crowded and returns have been competed away. So we still retain about $215 million in hedge funds, and we also have approximately $600 million in equities. And other than that, our investments are primarily in treasury bills, treasury notes and other short-term money market instruments."

So in my mind, this has created a massive supply/demand imbalance between assets that are for sale and buyers that are equal -- that are eager to buy them.
So what's happened is that multiples have moved up rather significantly, and they've moved up in just about every subsector of the market. Making matters worse, investment bankers and sellers have found adjustments to earnings with which to market their assets. There is now a term called adjusted EBITDA, and as you might imagine, when someone is selling a business, adjusted EBITDA is higher, oftentimes significantly higher than the stated EBITDA. Those adjustments reflect what sellers consider to be onetime costs that should be excluded and future benefits that should be included. So as a result, while the fancy charts may show private asset multiples approaching their '07 peaks, it's my estimation that, in fact, they far surpass it.
And as I like to say, welcome to the world of low interest rates. My guess is that what we've seen going on will persist for some kind. And while we remain dutifully on watch for any potential opportunities, I'm basically pretty skeptical that we'll be adding a new leg in this environment. What I'm seeing today is that you really need synergies in order to make the math on any corporate acquisition work.
So for all of these reasons, we continue to acquire assets where we currently have strong businesses that can make use of the synergies. But it seems to me highly unlikely that we'll get into any new industry or business at this point in time."

We were attracted to CCC because it was a good-sized player in a highly, highly fragmented market that we felt could serve as a platform for growth for Loews in the packaging industry. As I mentioned on the call, in the past several years, Loews -- since Loews acquired CCC, we've made 6 tuck-in acquisitions. These acquisitions have helped us to diversify CCC away from the dairy and water-packaging business, which has been declining, and it's also -- these acquisitions have also added very significant post-acquisition synergies. These tuck-ins were all financed, self-funded by CCC. But all is not entirely sunshine and roses. There are headwinds in the industry, including increased labor costs and also a steeper decline in the dairy and water volumes than we had previously expected. But overall, the original investment thesis still holds.
Now in terms of adding value to their customers, CCC's first step with any customer is to try to understand what their priorities are and to develop a customized packaging solution for them. So one example of providing value-added is a recent CCC innovation that adds value, not only by helping customers meet their needs, but also by reducing the impact of plastic packaging on the environment. And specifically what I'm talking about is a product from CCC called Dura-Lite. It's a -- in the packaging world, it really is a major leap forward. Dura-Lite was introduced in 2016, and it's a technology that creates a plastic container that is as strong or stronger than the original, but using 10% to 20% less resin.
So Dura-Lite bottles now make up more than 50% of all the dairy and water gallon bottles that CCC ships. And a side effect of that is that the Dura-Lite product has translated into $9 million fewer pounds of resin being used by CCC, which gets us to the environmental part of the question. CCC is also, I'm proud to say, the second-largest producer in the United States of recycled, high-density polyethylene, which is the major resin that CCC uses.
In the past, manufacturers have been reticent to use recycled resin in packaging because it was more expensive per unit than virgin resin. But more recently, due, I believe, to the focus on sustainability, that picture has started to change. And we're seeing that more companies are taking an interest in using this greener, somewhat more expensive packaging material.
I'd like to add that CCC takes very seriously the impact that plastic packaging has on the earth and it continues to develop solutions that are better for the world and better for CCC's customers."

But now, while all this time has passed and while the offshore drilling market has been weak, what we've seen is a large amount of scrapping in the offshore-drilling space. I've been through this movie once before in the supertanker business in the early to mid-80s, and there are 2 things that are going on simultaneously.
Number one, we're seeing that demand is going down, and we're also seeing that rigs are being laid up. And as they get laid up and as companies don't have the funds to maintain and invest in those rigs, they deteriorate sitting on the water, as they do, a highly corrosive environment. And after a few years of that, our rigs become more and more expensive to reactivate. So my guess is that over the next several years, we're going to -- if oil prices don't improve and if activity does increase -- does not increase significantly, we will see more rigs scrapped, no longer in the market. And then at some point in time, the supply -- the demand curve will change, there will be more demand for rigs and, bingo, there won't be enough supply. And before you know it, rates will go up again. So my view is that there will be, at some point in time, a change in the marketplace.
Going back to my $2 comment, I mentioned that because Diamond Offshore is consolidated with Loews and so its earnings show up in our net income numbers. And the mention of $2 was simply a reflection of the fact that even though those profit and loss numbers may be significant within Loews that the total value of our investment, according this -- to Mr. Market, is less than $2 per Loews share."

Loews had another good quarter with strong results from our largest subsidiary CNA.In the quarter, CNA's domestic property and casualty net written premium was up by 8% and rate was up by about 4%. The sizable increase",806,"Thank you, Mary, and good morning. Loews had another good quarter with strong results from our largest subsidiary CNA.
In the quarter, CNA's domestic property and casualty net written premium was up by 8% and rate was up by about 4%. The sizable increase over last year and last quarter reflect significant new business development as well as sustained improvement in pricing across a number of business lines.
Since our CFO, David Edelson, will do a deeper dive into CNA's numbers, I want to focus my remarks today primarily on CNA's strategic direction over the mid to long term, our confidence in their strategy and the state of the P&C industry.
Reflecting our confidence in CNA, through last Friday, Loews spent nearly $0.5 billion on share repurchases, and CNA currently accounts for more than 70% of the value of each Loews share.
Now that I've told you how much we believe in their strategy, let me walk you through some of the reasoning for this confidence.
CNA's management team has done the work to enhance profitability by establishing a highly disciplined expert underwriting culture. Additionally, the company has strengthened its talent pool and built mechanisms to share expertise across the organization through critical investments in technology and analytics.
At the same time, CNA has embedded a disciplined awareness of expense management throughout the company. The CNA team has worked diligently and successfully to deliver improved growth and profitability, with the goal of remaining a consistent top quartile underwriter.
CNA's underlying loss ratio continues to be in line with the loss ratios of the company's peers. In terms of the expense ratio, there are still a few points of improvements to be had and the CNA team has plans to achieve that improvement.
Adding to my confidence in CNA and without diminishing the company's achievements in what is still a competitive marketplace, in my 40 years of experience in the insurance industry, I have never known it to be more financially disciplined than it has been for the past 5 years. Since CNA and its peer companies are allocating almost all of their earnings to dividends and share buybacks, there is less appetite to underwrite unprofitable risk. With a continual return of capital to shareholders over that 5-year period, managements are loathed to disappoint their investors with strategies to increase volume at the expense of profitability.
Turning to Diamond Offshore, the company continues to be affected by a longer-than-expected downturn in the offshore drilling market. As I mentioned last quarter, while Diamond may add a lot of noise to Loews' quarterly results, our downside is limited to the value of our equity stake, which comes to less than $2 per Loews share.
And although the offshore drilling market continues to be challenging, there is a positive side to the ledger. Since 2015, Diamond has restructured its fleet to focus on its most competitive assets and has selectively invested in several assets that operate in attractive niche markets. Furthermore, Diamond has differentiated itself from the competition through value-added innovations that enhance drilling efficiency and save customers time and money.
Diamond has accomplished all of this while maintaining its focus on operational excellence and continuous improvements in safety. We believe that these actions, coupled with prudent financial management, have positioned Diamond to capitalize on an eventual recovery.
We also have some news from our packaging subsidiary, CCC, which made an exciting acquisition in June of this year. It bought Tri State Distribution, which expanded CCC's footprint in the pharmaceutical packaging space, a specialty growth segment in the industry. Pharmaceutical packaging now accounts for more than 11% of CCC's total sales. By way of background, Loews acquired CCC a little over 2 years ago. Since then, the company has made 6 tuck-in acquisitions for a total purchase price of $300 million, all of which were funded at the CCC level.
These acquisitions either added scale at extremely attractive post-synergy multiples or increased CCC's presence in specialty segments.
The management team continues to evaluate other possible targets that could add size and scale or diversify CCC into segments with strong growth potential.
Finally, it wouldn't be a Loews earnings call without a mention of share repurchases. Fun fact: 10 years ago, Loews had about 40% more shares outstanding than it does today. As for this year, to date, we've repurchased just over 10 million shares. And in the second quarter of this year, we repurchased a little over 3 million shares.
We've continued to buy Loews stock because, in our view, it's still trading below its intrinsic value. Not mention the fact that share repurchases remain an important way that we create long-term value for all Loews shareholders.
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to David Edelson, Loews' CFO, who will explain key drivers for the quarter."

For the second quarter, Loews reported net income of $249 million or $0.82 per share compared to $230 million or $0.72 per share in last year's second quarter.
Our net income was up 8% over the prior year, while our earnings per share increased 14% as average shares outstanding declined almost 5% from Q2 2018, given our share repurchase activity.
CNA continued to be by far the largest contributor to our net income and it posted a slight year-over-year increase. The bulk of the quarterly increase, however, was driven by Boardwalk Pipelines as its net income contribution more than tripled mainly due to 2 factors. Number one, our ownership increased from 51% last year to the current 100%. And two, Boardwalk booked a net benefit of $19 million resulting from a customer bankruptcy and related contract cancellation.
Offsetting the increases from Boardwalk and CNA were lower year-over-year contributions by Diamond Offshore and Loews Hotels, despite the fact that Loews Hotels had an excellent quarter operationally.
Let me now delve into the results in more depth.
CNA contributed net income of $249 million, up from $240 million last year. This modest increase resulted from several nearly offsetting factors.
Underlying underwriting income, which excludes catastrophe losses in prior year development, improved, with CNA posting an underlying combined ratio of 94.6%, which was 0.7 points better than last year's second quarter.
Despite the increase in underlying underwriting income, however, total underwriting income declined because of a lower level of favorable prior year development and marginally higher cat losses.
CNA's calendar year combined ratio was 95.7%, which was 1.9 points above last year's second quarter result but still highly respectable.
CNA's after-tax investment income in its P&C segment was essentially identical to Q2 2018.
The Corporate and Life & Group segments both had significant favorable variances. In last year's second quarter, CNA incurred onetime costs from transitioning to a new IT infrastructure service provider. These nonrecurring costs were booked in CNA's corporate segment.
And in Life & Group, results improved largely from continuing favorable persistency and long-term care as many policyholders chose to lapse coverage or reduce benefits in lieu of premium rate increases.
Finally, an early redemption charge on the retirement of debt reduced CNA's contribution to our net income by $15 million.
In summary, CNA posted strong P&C underwriting and investment results and improved results in its non-P&C segments.
Turning to Diamond Offshore. Diamond contributed a $52 million net loss compared to a $37 million net loss in last year's second quarter.
Diamond's results continue to be negatively affected by the challenging conditions in the global offshore drilling market. While numerous factors impacted Diamond's quarterly results in comparison, let me highlight 3 of them. Number one, contract drilling revenues were down 22% year-over-year as revenue earning days declined 8% and average daily revenue per working rig was down 14%. Downtime, contract timing and lower day rates drove these declines. 
Number two, contract drilling expenses were up 19%, with the increase largely attributable to the adverse impact of the amortization of deferred contract prep and mob costs incurred to ready certain rigs for their current contracts.
And number three, Diamond booked a rig impairment charge last year, which reduced Diamond's contribution to our Q2 2018 net income by $12 million and a gain on sale this year, which increased our net income by $5 million.
As we have highlighted for the past several quarters, Diamond remains focused on maintaining a healthy liquidity position, while investing in its fleet to ensure its rigs are considered top tier by customers.
Boardwalk's net income contribution was $53 million, up from $16 million in Q2 2018, mainly due to the increase in our ownership from 51% to 100% and the contract cancellation payment referenced earlier.
Operationally, Boardwalk had a good quarter. Absent the contract cancellation payment, net revenues were up 5.7%, EBITDA margins expanded by about 50 basis points and EBITDA rose 6.3%.
The underlying revenue increase was propelled by growth projects recently placed in service. Revenue offsets included the net impact of contract restructurings, expirations and renewals.
Let's turn to Loews Hotels, which contributed $12 million to our net income, down from $17 million last year. Loews Hotels' underlying year-over-year earnings gains were obscured this quarter by preopening expenses on properties under development and by the write-off of capitalized costs related to a terminated development project.
These items totaled $7 million after-tax in Q2 versus almost no such expenses last year.
Revenues declined mainly due to the sale of 2 owned hotel properties during the past 12 months as well as renovations at a few owned hotels. As a reminder, Loews Hotels uses the equity method of accounting for its joint venture properties, meaning the revenues for those properties, which include the hotels at the Universal Orlando Resort, are not shown as revenue in our GAAP financial results.
Loews Hotels' adjusted EBITDA, which excludes nonrecurring items and is reported and defined in our quarterly earnings summary, was $68 million in the quarter, up from $67 million in last year's second quarter. Year-to-date, adjusted EBITDA is a $129 million versus $123 million last year.
I would note that the renovation activity cited above and the sale of 3 properties over the last 12 months, 2 owned and 1 JV, held back the year-over-year adjusted EBITDA comparison. The opening of almost 4,100 rooms in Kansas City, Orlando, St. Louis and Arlington, Texas, from Q2 2019 through Q4 2020, should provide a boost to adjusted EBITDA.
Turning to the parent company. Investment income was down modestly. Contributing to the decline was a lower level of invested assets, including a much smaller portfolio of limited partnership investments. At June 30, the parent company portfolio of cash and investments totaled $3.5 billion, with 80% in cash and equivalents and the remainder mainly in marketable equity securities and a portfolio of limited partnership investments. The LP portfolio has declined from about $950 million at June 30, 2018, to $250 million at quarter end, consistent with our decision to shrink the size of this portfolio.
As a reminder, the parent company portfolio totaled $4.7 billion on June 30, 2018, which was just prior to the July 2018 purchase for $1.5 billion of the Boardwalk LP units not previously owned by Loews.
Consolidated container, which is reported as part of other corporate results, completed the acquisition of Tri State Distribution late in the second quarter. Nonrecurring expenses connected to the acquisition negatively affected other corporate results in Q2.
We received $110 million in dividends from our subsidiaries during the past quarter, $25 million from Boardwalk and $85 million from CNA. Dividends received year-to-date total just over $700 million.
We repurchased 3 million shares of our common stock during the second quarter for a total of $151 million. After quarter end, we repurchased an additional 421,000 shares for just under $23 million.
Year-to-date, we have repurchased 10.25 million shares or 3.3% of our shares outstanding at the beginning of the year.
I will now hand the call back to Mary."

So as David said, a year ago, we had about $4.7 billion in cash and liquid investments and today, that number is about $3.5 billion. The reason the cash and liquid investments has declined is because, offsetting the close to $1 billion of cash inflow that we had from dividends over the past year from our subsidiaries, we spent $1.5 billion acquiring the minority interest in Boardwalk and we also spent approximately $1 billion on share repurchases.
So with $3.5 billion rather than close to $5 billion, we decided that we needed to make some adjustments in our investment portfolio. And one of the areas where we especially wanted to make an adjustment was in our hedge funds. We decided that the returns that we've received on the hedge funds haven't been sufficient for the risk. My guess for why that's been the case is that the hedge fund space, as I think everybody knows, is very, very crowded and returns have been competed away. So we still retain about $215 million in hedge funds, and we also have approximately $600 million in equities. And other than that, our investments are primarily in treasury bills, treasury notes and other short-term money market instruments."

So in my mind, this has created a massive supply/demand imbalance between assets that are for sale and buyers that are equal -- that are eager to buy them.
So what's happened is that multiples have moved up rather significantly, and they've moved up in just about every subsector of the market. Making matters worse, investment bankers and sellers have found adjustments to earnings with which to market their assets. There is now a term called adjusted EBITDA, and as you might imagine, when someone is selling a business, adjusted EBITDA is higher, oftentimes significantly higher than the stated EBITDA. Those adjustments reflect what sellers consider to be onetime costs that should be excluded and future benefits that should be included. So as a result, while the fancy charts may show private asset multiples approaching their '07 peaks, it's my estimation that, in fact, they far surpass it.
And as I like to say, welcome to the world of low interest rates. My guess is that what we've seen going on will persist for some kind. And while we remain dutifully on watch for any potential opportunities, I'm basically pretty skeptical that we'll be adding a new leg in this environment. What I'm seeing today is that you really need synergies in order to make the math on any corporate acquisition work.
So for all of these reasons, we continue to acquire assets where we currently have strong businesses that can make use of the synergies. But it seems to me highly unlikely that we'll get into any new industry or business at this point in time."

We were attracted to CCC because it was a good-sized player in a highly, highly fragmented market that we felt could serve as a platform for growth for Loews in the packaging industry. As I mentioned on the call, in the past several years, Loews -- since Loews acquired CCC, we've made 6 tuck-in acquisitions. These acquisitions have helped us to diversify CCC away from the dairy and water-packaging business, which has been declining, and it's also -- these acquisitions have also added very significant post-acquisition synergies. These tuck-ins were all financed, self-funded by CCC. But all is not entirely sunshine and roses. There are headwinds in the industry, including increased labor costs and also a steeper decline in the dairy and water volumes than we had previously expected. But overall, the original investment thesis still holds.
Now in terms of adding value to their customers, CCC's first step with any customer is to try to understand what their priorities are and to develop a customized packaging solution for them. So one example of providing value-added is a recent CCC innovation that adds value, not only by helping customers meet their needs but also by reducing the impact of plastic packaging on the environment. And specifically what I'm talking about is a product from CCC called Dura-Lite. It's a -- in the packaging world, it really is a major leap forward. Dura-Lite was introduced in 2016, and it's a technology that creates a plastic container that is as strong or stronger than the original, but using 10% to 20% less resin.
So Dura-Lite bottles now make up more than 50% of all the dairy and water gallon bottles that CCC ships. And a side effect of that is that the Dura-Lite product has translated into $9 million fewer pounds of resin being used by CCC, which gets us to the environmental part of the question. CCC is also, I'm proud to say, the second-largest producer in the United States of recycled, high-density polyethylene, which is the major resin that CCC uses.
In the past, manufacturers have been reticent to use recycled resin in packaging because it was more expensive per unit than virgin resin. But more recently, due, I believe, to the focus on sustainability, that picture has started to change. And we're seeing that more companies are taking an interest in using this greener, somewhat more expensive packaging material.

What I'm pleased about with respect to Diamond is that it has a fleet that is very strong and capable, and when the recovery comes, which it eventually will,",406,"So my outlook is that the offshore drilling business is going to come back at some point in time. What I'm pleased about with respect to Diamond is that it has a fleet that is very strong and capable, and when the recovery comes, which it eventually will, I believe that Diamond will be able to do well in that environment. I think that a big problem for offshore drilling has been the price of oil, which has been not only volatile but relatively low. It's competing with shale production, which -- offshore drilling has been competing with shale production, and right now, that is the flavor du jour for the oil markets.
But now, while all this time has passed and while the offshore drilling market has been weak, what we've seen is a large amount of scrapping in the offshore-drilling space. I've been through this movie once before in the supertanker business in the early to mid-80s, and there are 2 things that are going on simultaneously.
Number one, we're seeing that demand is going down, and we're also seeing that rigs are being laid up. And as they get laid up and as companies don't have the funds to maintain and invest in those rigs, they deteriorate sitting on the water, as they do, a highly corrosive environment. And after a few years of that, our rigs become more and more expensive to reactivate. So my guess is that over the next several years, we're going to -- if oil prices don't improve and if activity does increase -- does not increase significantly, we will see more rigs scrapped, no longer in the market. And then at some point in time, the supply -- the demand curve will change, there will be more demand for rigs and, bingo, there won't be enough supply. And before you know it, rates will go up again. So my view is that there will be, at some point in time, a change in the marketplace.
Going back to my $2 comment, I mentioned that because Diamond Offshore is consolidated with Loews and so its earnings show up in our net income numbers. And the mention of $2 was simply a reflection of the fact that even though those profit and loss numbers may be significant within Loews that the total value of our investment, according this -- to Mr. Market, is less than $2 per Loews share."

Loews had another good quarter with strong results from our largest subsidiary CNA.In the quarter, CNA's domestic property and casualty net written premium was up by 8% and rate was up by about 4%. The sizable increase",807,"Thank you, Mary, and good morning. Loews had another good quarter with strong results from our largest subsidiary CNA.
In the quarter, CNA's domestic property and casualty net written premium was up by 8% and rate was up by about 4%. The sizable increase over last year and last quarter reflect significant new business development as well as sustained improvement in pricing across a number of business lines.
Since our CFO, David Edelson, will do a deeper dive into CNA's numbers, I want to focus my remarks today primarily on CNA's strategic direction over the mid to long term, our confidence in their strategy and the state of the P&C industry.
Reflecting our confidence in CNA, through last Friday, Loews spent nearly $0.5 billion on share repurchases, and CNA currently accounts for more than 70% of the value of each Loews share.
Now that I've told you how much we believe in their strategy, let me walk you through some of the reasoning for this confidence.
CNA's management team has done the work to enhance profitability by establishing a highly disciplined expert underwriting culture. Additionally, the company has strengthened its talent pool and built mechanisms to share expertise across the organization through critical investments in technology and analytics.
At the same time, CNA has embedded a disciplined awareness of expense management throughout the company. The CNA team has worked diligently and successfully to deliver improved growth and profitability, with the goal of remaining a consistent top quartile underwriter.
CNA's underlying loss ratio continues to be in line with the loss ratios of the company's peers. In terms of the expense ratio, there are still a few points of improvements to be had and the CNA team has plans to achieve that improvement.
Adding to my confidence in CNA and without diminishing the company's achievements in what is still a competitive marketplace, in my 40 years of experience in the insurance industry, I have never known it to be more financially disciplined than it has been for the past 5 years. Since CNA and its peer companies are allocating almost all of their earnings to dividends and share buybacks, there is less appetite to underwrite unprofitable risk. With a continual return of capital to shareholders over that 5-year period, managements are loathed to disappoint their investors with strategies to increase volume at the expense of profitability.
Turning to Diamond Offshore, the company continues to be affected by a longer-than-expected downturn in the offshore drilling market. As I mentioned last quarter, while Diamond may add a lot of noise to Loews' quarterly results, our downside is limited to the value of our equity stake, which comes to less than $2 per Loews share.
And although the offshore drilling market continues to be challenging, there is a positive side to the ledger. Since 2015, Diamond has restructured its fleet to focus on its most competitive assets and has selectively invested in several assets that operate in attractive niche markets. Furthermore, Diamond has differentiated itself from the competition through value-added innovations that enhance drilling efficiency and save customers time and money.
Diamond has accomplished all of this while maintaining its focus on operational excellence and continuous improvements in safety. We believe that these actions, coupled with prudent financial management, have positioned Diamond to capitalize on an eventual recovery.
We also have some news from our packaging subsidiary, CCC, which made an exciting acquisition in June of this year. It bought Tri State Distribution, which expanded CCC's footprint in the pharmaceutical packaging space, a specialty growth segment in the industry. Pharmaceutical packaging now accounts for more than 11% of CCC's total sales. By way of background, Loews acquired CCC a little over 2 years ago. Since then, the company has made 6 tuck-in acquisitions for a total purchase price of $300 million, all of which were funded at the CCC level.
These acquisitions either added scale at extremely attractive post-synergy multiples or increased CCC's presence in specialty segments.
The management team continues to evaluate other possible targets that could add size and scale or diversify CCC into segments with strong growth potential.
Finally, it wouldn't be a Loews earnings call without a mention of share repurchases. Fun fact: 10 years ago, Loews had about 40% more shares outstanding than it does today. As for this year, to date, we've repurchased just over 10 million shares. And in the second quarter of this year, we repurchased a little over 3 million shares.
We've continued to buy Loews stock because, in our view, it's still trading below its intrinsic value. Not to mention the fact that share repurchases remain an important way that we create long-term value for all Loews shareholders.
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to David Edelson, Loews' CFO, who will explain key drivers for the quarter."

For the second quarter, Loews reported net income of $249 million or $0.82 per share compared to $230 million or $0.72 per share in last year's second quarter.
Our net income was up 8% over the prior year, while our earnings per share increased 14% as average shares outstanding declined almost 5% from Q2 2018, given our share repurchase activity.
CNA continued to be by far the largest contributor to our net income and it posted a slight year-over-year increase. The bulk of the quarterly increase, however, was driven by Boardwalk Pipelines as its net income contribution more than tripled mainly due to 2 factors. Number one, our ownership increased from 51% last year to the current 100%. And two, Boardwalk booked a net benefit of $19 million resulting from a customer bankruptcy and related contract cancellation.
Offsetting the increases from Boardwalk and CNA were lower year-over-year contributions by Diamond Offshore and Loews Hotels, despite the fact that Loews Hotels had an excellent quarter operationally.
Let me now delve into the results in more depth.
CNA contributed net income of $249 million, up from $240 million last year. This modest increase resulted from several nearly offsetting factors.
Underlying underwriting income, which excludes catastrophe losses in prior year development, improved, with CNA posting an underlying combined ratio of 94.6%, which was 0.7 points better than last year's second quarter.
Despite the increase in underlying underwriting income, however, total underwriting income declined because of a lower level of favorable prior year development and marginally higher cat losses.
CNA's calendar year combined ratio was 95.7%, which was 1.9 points above last year's second quarter result but still highly respectable.
CNA's after-tax investment income in its P&C segment was essentially identical to Q2 2018.
The Corporate and Life & Group segments both had significant favorable variances. In last year's second quarter, CNA incurred onetime costs from transitioning to a new IT infrastructure service provider. These nonrecurring costs were booked in CNA's corporate segment.
And in Life & Group, results improved largely from continuing favorable persistency and long-term care as many policyholders chose to lapse coverage or reduce benefits in lieu of premium rate increases.
Finally, an early redemption charge on the retirement of debt reduced CNA's contribution to our net income by $15 million.
In summary, CNA posted strong P&C underwriting and investment results and improved results in its non-P&C segments.
Turning to Diamond Offshore. Diamond contributed a $52 million net loss compared to a $37 million net loss in last year's second quarter.
Diamond's results continue to be negatively affected by the challenging conditions in the global offshore drilling market. While numerous factors impacted Diamond's quarterly results in comparison, let me highlight 3 of them. Number one, contract drilling revenues were down 22% year-over-year as revenue earning days declined 8% and average daily revenue per working rig was down 14%. Downtime, contract timing and lower day rates drove these declines. 
Number two, contract drilling expenses were up 19%, with the increase largely attributable to the adverse impact of the amortization of deferred contract prep and mob costs incurred to ready certain rigs for their current contracts.
And number three, Diamond booked a rig impairment charge last year, which reduced Diamond's contribution to our Q2 2018 net income by $12 million and a gain on sale this year, which increased our net income by $5 million.
As we have highlighted for the past several quarters, Diamond remains focused on maintaining a healthy liquidity position, while investing in its fleet to ensure its rigs are considered top tier by customers.
Boardwalk's net income contribution was $53 million, up from $16 million in Q2 2018, mainly due to the increase in our ownership from 51% to 100% and the contract cancellation payment referenced earlier.
Operationally, Boardwalk had a good quarter. Absent the contract cancellation payment, net revenues were up 5.7%, EBITDA margins expanded by about 50 basis points and EBITDA rose 6.3%.
The underlying revenue increase was propelled by growth projects recently placed in service. Revenue offsets included the net impact of contract restructurings, expirations and renewals.
Let's turn to Loews Hotels, which contributed $12 million to our net income, down from $17 million last year. Loews Hotels' underlying year-over-year earnings gains were obscured this quarter by preopening expenses on properties under development and by the write-off of capitalized costs related to a terminated development project.
These items totaled $7 million after-tax in Q2 versus almost no such expenses last year.
Revenues declined mainly due to the sale of 2 owned hotel properties during the past 12 months as well as renovations at a few owned hotels. As a reminder, Loews Hotels uses the equity method of accounting for its joint venture properties, meaning the revenues for those properties, which include the hotels at the Universal Orlando Resort, are not shown as revenue in our GAAP financial results.
Loews Hotels' adjusted EBITDA, which excludes nonrecurring items and is reported and defined in our quarterly earnings summary, was $68 million in the quarter, up from $67 million in last year's second quarter. Year-to-date, adjusted EBITDA is a $129 million versus $123 million last year.
I would note that the renovation activity cited above and the sale of 3 properties over the last 12 months, 2 owned and 1 JV, held back the year-over-year adjusted EBITDA comparison. The opening of almost 4,100 rooms in Kansas City, Orlando, St. Louis and Arlington, Texas, from Q2 2019 through Q4 2020, should provide a boost to adjusted EBITDA.
Turning to the parent company. Investment income was down modestly. Contributing to the decline was a lower level of invested assets, including a much smaller portfolio of limited partnership investments. At June 30, the parent company portfolio of cash and investments totaled $3.5 billion, with 80% in cash and equivalents and the remainder mainly in marketable equity securities and a portfolio of limited partnership investments. The LP portfolio has declined from about $950 million at June 30, 2018, to $250 million at quarter end, consistent with our decision to shrink the size of this portfolio.
As a reminder, the parent company portfolio totaled $4.7 billion on June 30, 2018, which was just prior to the July 2018 purchase for $1.5 billion of the Boardwalk LP units not previously owned by Loews.
Consolidated container, which is reported as part of other corporate results, completed the acquisition of Tri State Distribution late in the second quarter. Nonrecurring expenses connected to the acquisition negatively affected other corporate results in Q2.
We received $110 million in dividends from our subsidiaries during the past quarter, $25 million from Boardwalk and $85 million from CNA. Dividends received year-to-date total just over $700 million.
We repurchased 3 million shares of our common stock during the second quarter for a total of $151 million. After quarter end, we repurchased an additional 421,000 shares for just under $23 million.
Year-to-date, we have repurchased 10.25 million shares or 3.3% of our shares outstanding at the beginning of the year.
I will now hand the call back to Mary."

So as David said, a year ago, we had about $4.7 billion in cash and liquid investments and today, that number is about $3.5 billion. The reason the cash and liquid investments has declined is because, offsetting the close to $1 billion of cash inflow that we had from dividends over the past year from our subsidiaries, we spent $1.5 billion acquiring the minority interest in Boardwalk and we also spent approximately $1 billion on share repurchases.
So with $3.5 billion rather than close to $5 billion, we decided that we needed to make some adjustments in our investment portfolio. And one of the areas where we especially wanted to make an adjustment was in our hedge funds. We decided that the returns that we've received on the hedge funds haven't been sufficient for the risk. My guess for why that's been the case is that the hedge fund space, as I think everybody knows, is very, very crowded and returns have been competed away. So we still retain about $215 million in hedge funds, and we also have approximately $600 million in equities. And other than that, our investments are primarily in treasury bills, treasury notes and other short-term money market instruments."

So in my mind, this has created a massive supply/demand imbalance between assets that are for sale and buyers that are equal -- that are eager to buy them.
So what's happened is that multiples have moved up rather significantly, and they've moved up in just about every subsector of the market. Making matters worse, investment bankers and sellers have found adjustments to earnings with which to market their assets. There is now a term called adjusted EBITDA, and as you might imagine, when someone is selling a business, adjusted EBITDA is higher, oftentimes significantly higher than the stated EBITDA. Those adjustments reflect what sellers consider to be onetime costs that should be excluded and future benefits that should be included. So as a result, while the fancy charts may show private asset multiples approaching their '07 peaks, it's my estimation that, in fact, they far surpass it.
And as I like to say, welcome to the world of low interest rates. My guess is that what we've seen going on will persist for some kind. And while we remain dutifully on watch for any potential opportunities, I'm basically pretty skeptical that we'll be adding a new leg in this environment. What I'm seeing today is that you really need synergies in order to make the math on any corporate acquisition work.
So for all of these reasons, we continue to acquire assets where we currently have strong businesses that can make use of the synergies. But it seems to me highly unlikely that we'll get into any new industry or business at this point in time."

As I mentioned on the call, in the past several years, Loews -- since Loews acquired CCC, we've made 6 tuck-in acquisitions. These acquisitions have helped us to diversify CCC away from the dairy and water-packaging business, which has been declining, and it's also -- these acquisitions have also added very significant post-acquisition synergies. These tuck-ins were all financed, self-funded by CCC. But all is not entirely sunshine and roses. There are headwinds in the industry, including increased labor costs and also a steeper decline in the dairy and water volumes than we had previously expected. But overall, the original investment thesis still holds.
Now in terms of adding value to their customers, CCC's first step with any customer is to try to understand what their priorities are and to develop a customized packaging solution for them. So one example of providing value-added is a recent CCC innovation that adds value, not only by helping customers meet their needs but also by reducing the impact of plastic packaging on the environment. And specifically what I'm talking about is a product from CCC called Dura-Lite. It's a -- in the packaging world, it really is a major leap forward. Dura-Lite was introduced in 2016, and it's a technology that creates a plastic container that is as strong or stronger than the original, but using 10% to 20% less resin.
So Dura-Lite bottles now make up more than 50% of all the dairy and water gallon bottles that CCC ships. And a side effect of that is that the Dura-Lite product has translated into 9 million fewer pounds of resin being used by CCC, which gets us to the environmental part of the question. CCC is also, I'm proud to say, the second-largest producer in the United States of recycled, high-density polyethylene, which is the major resin that CCC uses.
In the past, manufacturers have been reticent to use recycled resin in packaging because it was more expensive per unit than virgin resin. But more recently, due, I believe, to the focus on sustainability, that picture has started to change. And we're seeing that more companies are taking an interest in using this greener, somewhat more expensive packaging material.
I'd like to add that CCC takes very seriously the impact that plastic packaging has on the earth and it continues to develop solutions that are better for the world and better for CCC's customers."

What I'm pleased about with respect to Diamond is that it has a fleet that is very strong and capable, and when the recovery comes, which it eventually will, I believe that Diamond will be able to do well in that environment. I think that a big problem for offshore drilling has been the price of oil, which has been not only volatile but relatively low. It's competing with shale production, which -- offshore drilling has been competing with shale production, and right now, that is the flavor du jour for the oil markets.
But now, while all this time has passed and while the offshore drilling market has been weak, what we've seen is a large amount of scrapping in the offshore-drilling space. I've been through this movie once before in the supertanker business in the early to mid-80s, and there are 2 things that are going on simultaneously.
Number one, we're seeing that demand is going down, and we're also seeing that rigs are being laid up. And as they get laid up and as companies don't have the funds to maintain and invest in those rigs, they deteriorate sitting on the water, as they do, a highly corrosive environment. And after a few years of that, our rigs become more and more expensive to reactivate. So my guess is that over the next several years, we're going to -- if oil prices don't improve and if activity does increase -- does not increase significantly, we will see more rigs scrapped, no longer in the market. And then at some point in time, the supply -- the demand curve will change, there will be more demand for rigs and, bingo, there won't be enough supply. And before you know it, rates will go up again. So my view is that there will be, at some point in time, a change in the marketplace.
Going back to my $2 comment, I mentioned that because Diamond Offshore is consolidated with Loews and so its earnings show up in our net income numbers. And the mention of $2 was simply a reflection of the fact that even though those profit and loss numbers may be significant within Loews that the total value of our investment, according this -- to Mr. Market, is less than $2 per Loews share."

Loews is having a much good quarter than the numbers might indicate with our largest subsidiary CNA contributing positively to our results.CNA is continuing to see solid growth in rate, which increased about 6% across",1033,"Thank you, Mary, and good morning. Loews is having a much good quarter than the numbers might indicate with our largest subsidiary CNA contributing positively to our results.
CNA is continuing to see solid growth in rate, which increased about 6% across the PNC business. Even as rate increased with tension remained in line with past quarters [indiscernible] 83%.
The business also increased 10% over the last year's third quarter, while higher rates and new business growth are already flowing through net written premiums, which are up about 8% compared to the prior year, the full positive impact will take time to be reflected in earnings premium.
Additionally, the third quarter is our -- is the time when CNA reviews its long-term care bulk of business.
For the first time since 2015, CNA's assumptions were unlocked, resulting in a third quarter after-tax charge of CNA of $170 million. The chart predominantly relates to expectations for lower interest rates in both the short and long term. As a reminder, this is a GAAP charge that has no impact on statutory capital.
Also this charge was partially offset by a $44 million after-tax release from CNA's long-term care claims reserves.
As of my custom, every quarter I pick a few key topics to talk about. This quarter, I'd like to focus on capital allocations and the growth prospects for several of our subsidiaries. Loew's typically allocated capital at the holding company in 3 ways:  share repurchases; investing in our subsidiaries; and acquiring new subsidiaries. Over the past 5 years, we've allocated capital using all 3 of these levers. As anyone who follows this note, stock buybacks are a primary capital allocation tool and a significant means of creating shareholder value at Loews.
In 2014, Loews had 30% more shares outstanding than at the end of this quarter. In 2018, Loews spent a little over $1 billion to repurchase about 20 million of its shares. So far in 2019, we spent about $725 million to repurchase approximately 14.5 million shares. That means that over the past 22 months, we've repurchased over 10% of our outstanding float. As you might imagine, we believe these purchases will prove to be accretive for long-term Loews shareholders.
Our second capital allocation leverage is investing in our subsidiaries, the businesses and industries we know best. Loews Corporation recent investments in Loews Hotels provide good illustration of this lever.
Since 2014, the parent company has supported Loews Hotels growth with an investment of $820 million, and has received over 80% back from the hotel company for a net investment of nearly [ $140 million ] through the end of the third quarter of 2019.
During this period of expansion and development, Loews Hotels has grown its adjusted EBITDA from $123 million in 2014 to $228 million in 2018.
Loews Hotels continues to focus on its strategy of attracting group business, as well as developing properties near demand generators, such as sports stadiums and the Universal Orlando Theme Parks. In pursuing the strategy, the Hotel company has found its niche as a developer, owner and operator. Since most of its competitors are not able to fulfill all 3 of these functions, Loews Hotels has a unique sweet spot has a partner for municipalities and developers, it has the capacity to co-invest and provide meaningful input of the design and development of new construction, and to manage the hotels operations upon completion.
As the portfolio, hotels continues to grow through ground up development. It will take time for these investments to produce a noticeable return as development cost, preopening expenses and ramp up periods for each new hotel somewhat obscure initial results.
Our third level for capital allocation is adding another leg to the [indiscernible] stool. In 2017, we acquired Consolidated Container Company for approximately $1.2 billion, consisting of $600 million in cash and $600 million of debt at the CCC level. This acquisition gave Loews our toehold in the packaging industry. Over the past 2 years, CCC has added 6 tuck-in acquisitions, all of which were funded at the CCC level. These acquisitions added scale at extremely attractive post-synergy multiples and increased CCC's presence in higher growth pharmaceutical segments.
It's worth noting that Loews does not frequently acquire subsidiaries. And given the sky high valuations in today's market, I don't see that changing. Multiples have moved higher as a private equity world has become accustomed to easy money. Low interest rates, leading to cheap and readily available debt financing, it makes levered acquisitions possible, even at the specific multiples, again that we are unwilling to play. 
Now I want to talk deeply about growth prospects of CNA environment.
At CNA remains very bullish, both on the fundamentals of the insurance industry and on CNA's growth trajectory, which is fueled by the strength of the team that they have put together. CNA will continue to focus on maintaining and improving its strong underwriting culture, recruiting and retaining top talent, leveraging technology and expanding distribution.
These steps will enable CNA to capitalize on its organic growth opportunities.
If you talk to Dino Robusto, CNA's CEO, he'll tell you that there's plenty of room for organic growth.
The focus for the time offshore is quite different. The company has less occupied with growth and more occupied with managing its liquidity. Diamond continues to concentrate on controlling its cost structure, strengthening its balance sheet and building is something that work.
Even as diamond has kept its foundation solid. It continues to develop processes innovation that make it more efficient and a value-added partner for the customers. Finally last year, we begin making more detailed information available on our website for that our subsidiaries strategy, and mid-to long term prospects for growth.
And response to your request, we have updated and reposted these presentations for CCC, CNA, Diamond Offshore and Loews Hotels, all now ready by their respective CEOs and leadership teams.
We're happy to provide these virtual investor date style, presentations, and we would encourage you to listen to them and reach out to us if you have any questions.
And without further -- any further ado, I'll hand the call over to David Edelson, Loew's CFO"
285930,639815141,1842347,"Loews Corporation, Q3 2019 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2019",2019-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Loews Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Jim. Good morning, everyone. For the third quarter of Loews reported net income of $72 million or $0.24 per share, down from $278 million or $0.88 per share in last year's third quarter.Page 13 of our earning supplements sets forth a key quarter",1280,"Thanks, Jim. Good morning, everyone. For the third quarter of Loews reported net income of $72 million or $0.24 per share, down from $278 million or $0.88 per share in last year's third quarter.
Page 13 of our earning supplements sets forth a key quarterly drivers. A quick summary of the quarter.
CNA accounted for most of the year-over-year decline in net income, largely due to the strengthening of its long-term care active life reserves. CNA's property casualty results also reflected in modest reserve charge this year compared to a meaningful reserve release in Q3 of last year.
Importantly, however, underlying P&C underwriting results of CNA continued to show improvement.
[indiscernible] contribution was essentially flat with the prior year, where its contributions from Diamond and Loews Hotels were down for reasons I'll explain shortly.
Parent company investment income showed a nice year-over-year quarterly increase, moving namely by better returns on equities and short-term investments.
Now for more detail.
CNA's after-tax earnings contribution was $96 million, down from $300 million in Q3 of 2018. Let me start by focusing on the positive, which has continued progress in CNA's core P&C business.
The underlying combined ratio is 94.6, the same as last quarter and almost 1 point better than full year 2018. Net written premium was up 8% in the quarter and rate was up almost 6%.
It was a typically a heavy quarter for catastrophe losses, CNA incurred only 1.8 points of cat losses compared to 2.6 points in last year's third quarter and 3.7 points for full year 2018.
The year-over-year comparison for P&C, however, was hurt by a modest adverse prior year development compared to meaningful favorable prior year development in last year's third quarter. This adverse development was driven by legacy [indiscernible] legacy master exposures in commercial and healthcare and specialty.
Several other lines in commercial and specialty, however, including surety and management liability, posted reserve releases during the quarter.
Absent the impacts of prior year development in both periods, CNA's after-tax P&C underwriting income increased 33% from Q3 2018 to Q3 2019. CNA completed its review of its long-term care reserves this past quarter. As a reminder, CNA's GAAP long-term care reserves have 2 components, future policy benefits reserves, commonly referred to as active life reserves, as well as claims and claims adjustment expense reserves.
During the quarter, CNA strengthened its active life reserves by $216 million pretax and released $56 million pretax from its claims and claims adjustment expense reserves. To put these numbers in perspective, as June 30, 2019, CNA had over $9 billion of GAAP active life reserves and almost $3 billion of GAAP claims reserves.
CNA assesses the adequacy of its GAAP long-term care active life reserves annually by performing what's known as a growth premium valuation for GPV. In the GPV, management uses its current best estimate at real assumptions to calculate required reserves. If the required reserves exceeds recorded reserves and unlocking occurs and active life reserves are increased based on the current that -- on the current best estimate assumptions. CNA, as Jim said, CNA last unlock its LCC active life reserves at year-end 2015. The company subsequently conducted reviews of these reserves in each of 2016, 2017 and 2018 and concluded that no unlocking was necessary.
In this year's third quarter, when CNA applied its current best estimate actual real assumptions to its LTC active life reserves, the result was an approximate $400 million increase in acquired reserves.
The interest-rate environment caused CNA to lowered its assumed future new money rates and thus, it's discount rate. While there were gifts and takes with respect to other actual real assumptions, such as morbidity, persistency and premium rate actions, lowering the discount rate drove the unlocking.
Given that CNA at $182 million of margin and its active life reserves before the review, this $400 million reserve increase resulted in a $216 million pretax strengthening of CNA's active life reserves.
Note that this is a GAAP reserve charge and does not impact CNA's statutory long-term care reserves.
The strengthening of the active life reserves and the release in the claims and claims adjustment expense reserves taken together reduce Loew's net income by $112 million in Q3.
Recall that in last year's third quarter, CNA booked a reserves release that added $21 million to our net income.
CNA has disclosed more information about its long-term care business and its quarterly investor presentation, which can be found on its IR website.
In summary, CNA's underlying P&C results were healthy, but it's contribution to our Q3 results was hurt by the interest-rate driven LTC active life reserve charge and the modest adverse prior year development in P&C.
Turning to Diamond Offshore. Diamond contributed a net loss of $48 million in Q3 2019 as compared to a net loss of $27 million last year, reflecting the continued difficult conditions in the after drilling markets.
Contract drilling revenues declined 14%, while Diamond's contract drilling expenses increased 7%. Revenue earning days were actually up 14% because of more than offset by a 24% decline in average daily revenue earned.
The drivers of the revenue decline were rigs working at lower dayrates as well as shipyard to of the company's high expect drillships, which had previously been earning dayrates well above current market.
As a reminder, Diamond incurred the constant legal settlement in last year's third quarter, which reduced our net income in that quarter by $8 million.
Boardwalk's net income contribution was basically flat year-over-year at $29 million. As revenue declines from contracts explorations and restructuring were more than offset by revenues from growth projects recently placed into service.
Operating margins declined somewhat, however, in part due to the timing of maintenance and expenses.
Loews Hotels had a noisey third quarter, as it contributed $3 million to our net income in Q3, down from $11 million in last year's third quarter. There were 2 main reasons for the year-over-year decline in net income contribution. The first was this substantial disruption caused by the threat of hurricane Dorian, which caused widespread cancellations at the company's properties in Orlando and Miami Beach.
And the second were preopening expenses incurred in connection with properties under development, including properties in Orlando, Kansas City and Arlington, Texas.
As Jim said, and I'd remind you, that was so much hotel development activity taking place, the company's underlying earnings will continue to be masked by preopening and startup costs.
Loews Hotels adjusted EBITDA, which is disclosed in our quarterly earnings supplement also declined year-over-year. The hurricane related destruction of the company's Florida properties was a major factor. Additionally, 3 properties were divested since last year's third quarter with 1 property leading the chain altogether, and 2 becoming managed only hotels.
Despite what appears to be a weak quarter, Loews Hotels continues to expand its footprint and post improved results at many of its properties.
Turning to the parent company. Pretax investment income was $36 million, up $31 million from the prior year's third quarter, driven by returns on equities and short-term investments. 
During Q3 2019, we received $111 million of dividends from our subsidiaries, $85 million from CNA and $26 million from Boardwalk.
We repurchased 3.4 million shares during the third quarter at an aggregate cost of $168 million.
Repurchased an additional 1.8 million shares since quarter-end for about $90 million.
We have repurchased 15 million shares during 2019 for just over $730 million, representing almost 5% of our shares outstanding at year-end 2018.
Loews ended the quarter with $3.5 billion in parent company cash and investments with cash and equivalents accounting for 75% of the portfolio. Let me now turn it back to Mary"

So CNA selected some of the best and the brightest within the company to run the business as a business. Actively managing it from every angle. They looked it from operations, claims, actuality and more. The goal was to aggressively mitigate the risk and to manage the liability. Changing the mindset from it being a run off business to our an active business has been critical in this whole process.
So the new team set about not giving a deeper understanding of the business, not just to [indiscernible] but every factor of the business. This understanding has led the team to identify opportunities to mitigate the risks, such as more supportable rate increased filings and offerings to policyholders that benefit them and also enabling CNA to reduce risk.
I truly believe that CNA's actual understanding of its lock of business is much deeper than it has ever been. Just 2 years ago, CNA moved to what's called first principles reserving and that give it the ability to slice and dice the block much more deeply than they previously could. One huge advantage of the company's actual advances has been ability to support ratings increases with much more targeted and credible data, including data from over 100,000 claims [indiscernible] that the company has already process. When I take a look at the assumptions made in the company's last unlocking and 2015 compared to the current unlocking, what I see on that is a business that is actually pretty reasonably predictable in the medium-term. I don't want to diminish the long-term tail risk but overly medium-term all block of businesses performed basically in line with our expectations with a major exception of interest rates.
Here are some facts that I find compelling. So towards the end of 2015, total claims paid [indiscernible] 2% lower than expected, our active policy count is 5% lower than expected and the total claim count during that period is slightly lower than expected. These broad measures help to define the risk in the block, and they were all predicted quite accurately in the context of a 5-year timeframe. So what CNA got wrong was the interest rate in the spread environment, a problem that's being addressed this quarter. So while I understand there's a lot of noise around the various long-term care blocks, what I have seen firsthand at CNA is that with the right data with the management focused and with the appropriate resources thrown at the problem, these blocks are more predictable than I think most outsiders have come to believe."

Loews had a much better quarter than the numbers might indicate with our largest subsidiary CNA contributing positively to our results.CNA is continuing to see solid growth in rate, which increased about 6% across the",1023,"Thank you, Mary, and good morning. Loews had a much better quarter than the numbers might indicate with our largest subsidiary CNA contributing positively to our results.
CNA is continuing to see solid growth in rate, which increased about 6% across the P&C business. Even as rate increased, retention remained in line with past quarters at 83%. New business also increased 10% over the last year's third quarter. While higher rates and new business growth are already flowing through net written premiums, which are up about 8% compared to the prior year, the full positive impact will take time to be reflected in earned premiums.
Additionally, the third quarter is our -- is the time when CNA reviews its long-term care book of business. For the first time since 2015, CNA's assumptions were unlocked, resulting in a third quarter after-tax charge at CNA of $170 million. The charge predominantly relates to expectations for lower interest rates in both the short and long term. As a reminder, this is a GAAP charge that has no impact on statutory capital. Also this charge was partially offset by a $44 million after-tax release from CNA's long-term care claims reserves.
As of my custom, every quarter I pick a few key topics to talk about. This quarter, I'd like to focus on capital allocation and the growth prospects for several of our subsidiaries. 
Loews typically allocates capital at the holding company in 3 ways:  share repurchases; investing in our subsidiaries; and acquiring a new subsidiary. Over the past 5 years, we've allocated capital using all 3 of these levers. As anyone who follows us knows, stock buybacks are a primary capital allocation tool and a significant means of creating shareholder value at Loews. In 2014, Loews had 30% more shares outstanding than at the end of this quarter. In 2018, Loews spent a little over $1 billion to repurchase about 20 million of its shares. So far in 2019, we've spent about $725 million to repurchase approximately 14.5 million shares. That means that over the past 22 months, we've repurchased over 10% of our outstanding float. As you might imagine, we believe these purchases will prove to be accretive for long-term Loews' shareholders.
Our second capital allocation lever is investing in our subsidiaries, the businesses and industries we know best. Loews Corporation's recent investments in Loews Hotels provide a good illustration of this lever. Since 2014, the parent company has supported Loews Hotels' growth with an investment of $820 million, and has received over 80% back from the hotel company for a net investment of nearly $140 million through the end of the third quarter of 2019. During this period of expansion and development, Loews Hotels has grown its adjusted EBITDA from $123 million in 2014 to $228 million in 2018.
Loews Hotels continues to focus on its strategy of attracting group business as well as developing properties near demand generators, such as sports stadiums and the Universal Orlando theme parks. In pursuing this strategy, the hotel company has found its niche as a developer, owner and operator. Since most of its competitors are not able to fulfill all 3 of these functions, Loews Hotels has a unique sweet spot. As a partner for municipalities and developers, it has the capacity to co-invest and provide meaningful input on the design and development of new construction and to manage the hotels' operations upon completion.
As the portfolio of hotels continues to grow through ground-up development, it will take time for these investments to produce a noticeable return, as development cost, preopening expenses and ramp up periods for each new hotel somewhat obscure initial results.
Our third level for capital allocation is adding another leg to the proverbial stool. In 2017, we acquired Consolidated Container Company for approximately $1.2 billion, consisting of $600 million in cash and $600 million of debt at the CCC level. This acquisition gave Loews our toehold in the packaging industry. Over the past 2 years, CCC has added 6 tuck-in acquisitions, all of which were funded at the CCC level. These acquisitions added scale at extremely attractive post-synergy multiples and increased CCC's presence in higher-growth pharmaceutical segments.
It's worth noting that Loews does not frequently acquire subsidiaries. And given the sky-high valuations in today's market, I don't see that changing. Multiples have moved higher as the private equity world has become accustomed to easy money. Low interest rates, leading to cheap and readily available debt financing, make levered acquisitions possible, even at these precipitous multiples, again that we are unwilling to play. 
Now I want to talk briefly about growth prospects of CNA environment.
At CNA, we remain very bullish, both on the fundamentals of the insurance industry and on CNA's growth trajectory, which is fueled by the strength of the team that they have put together. CNA will continue to focus on maintaining and improving its strong underwriting culture, recruiting and retaining top talent, leveraging technology and expanding distributions. These steps will enable CNA to capitalize on its organic growth opportunities. If you talk to Dino Robusto, CNA's CEO, he'll tell you that there's plenty of room for organic growth.
The focus for Diamond Offshore is quite different. The company is less occupied with growth and more occupied with managing its liquidity. Diamond continues to concentrate on controlling its cost structure, strengthening its balance sheet and building its revenue backlog. Even as Diamond has kept its foundation solid, it continues to develop process innovations that make it more efficient and a value-added partner for its customers. 
Finally, last year, we began making more detailed information available on our website about our subsidiaries strategies and mid- to long-term prospects for growth. In response to your request, we have updated and reposted these presentations for CCC, CNA, Diamond Offshore and Loews Hotels, all narrated by their respective CEOs and leadership teams.
We're happy to provide these virtual investor day-style presentations, and we encourage you to listen to them and reach out to us if you have any questions.
And without further -- any further ado, I'll hand the call over to David Edelson, Loews' CFO."

For the third quarter, Loews reported net income of $72 million or $0.24 per share, down from $278 million or $0.88 per share in last year's third quarter.Page 13 of our earnings supplement sets forth the key",1285,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. For the third quarter, Loews reported net income of $72 million or $0.24 per share, down from $278 million or $0.88 per share in last year's third quarter.
Page 13 of our earnings supplement sets forth the key quarterly drivers. A quick summary of the quarter.
CNA accounted for most of the year-over-year decline in net income, largely due to the strengthening of its long-term care active life reserves. CNA's property and casualty results also reflected in modest reserve charge this year compared to a meaningful reserve release in Q3 of last year. Importantly, however, underlying P&C underwriting results at CNA continued to show improvement.
Boardwalk's earnings contribution was essentially flat with the prior year, where its contributions from Diamond and Loews Hotels were down for reasons I'll explain shortly.
Parent company investment income showed a nice year-over-year quarterly increase, moving mainly by better returns on equities and short-term investments.
Now for more detail.
CNA's after-tax earnings contribution was $96 million, down from $300 million in Q3 2018. Let me start by focusing on the positive, which is continued progress in CNA's core P&C business. The underlying combined ratio was 94.6%, the same as last quarter and almost 1 point better than full year 2018. Net written premium was up 8% in the quarter and rate was up almost 6%.
In what is typically a heavy quarter for catastrophe losses, CNA incurred only 1.8 points of cat losses compared to 2.6 points in last year's third quarter and 3.7 points for full year 2018. The year-over-year comparison for P&C, however, was hurt by a modest adverse prior year development compared to meaningful favorable prior year development in last year's third quarter. This adverse development was driven by legacy [indiscernible] exposures in commercial and healthcare and specialty.
Several other lines in commercial and specialty, however, including surety and management liability, posted reserve releases during the quarter. Absent the impacts of prior year development in both periods, CNA's after-tax P&C underwriting income increased 33% from Q3 2018 to Q3 2019. 
CNA completed its review of its long-term care reserves this past quarter. As a reminder, CNA's GAAP long-term care reserves have 2 components, future policy benefits reserves, commonly referred to as active life reserves, as well as claims and claims adjustment expense reserves. During the quarter, CNA strengthened its active life reserves by $216 million pretax and released $56 million pretax from its claims and claims adjustment expense reserves. To put these numbers in perspective, at June 30, 2019, CNA had over $9 billion of GAAP active life reserves and almost $3 billion of GAAP claims reserves. CNA assesses the adequacy of its GAAP long-term care active life reserves annually by performing, what's known as a, gross premium valuation for GPV. In the GPV, management uses its current best estimate actuarial assumptions to calculate required reserves. If the required reserves exceed recorded reserves, an unlocking occurs and active life reserves are increased based on the current best estimate assumptions. CNA -- as Jim said, CNA last unlock its LTC active life reserves at year-end 2015. The company subsequently conducted reviews of these reserves in each of 2016, 2017 and 2018 and concluded that no unlocking was necessary.
In this year's third quarter, when CNA applied its current best estimate actuarial assumptions to its LTC active life reserves, the result was an approximate $400 million increase in acquired reserves. The interest rate environment caused the CNA to lower its assumed future new money rates and thus, it's discount rate. While there were gives and takes with respect to other actuarial assumptions, such as morbidity, persistency and premium rate actions, lowering the discount rate drove the unlocking. Given that the CNA had a $182 million of margin in its active life reserves before the review, this $400 million reserve increase resulted in a $216 million pretax strengthening of CNA's active life reserves.
Note that this is a GAAP reserve charge and does not impact CNA's statutory long-term care reserves.
The strengthening of the active life reserves and the release from the claims and claims adjustment expense reserves taken together, reduce Loews' net income by $112 million in Q3. Recall that in last year's third quarter, CNA booked a claims reserves release that added $21 million to our net income.
CNA has disclosed more information about its long-term care business in its quarterly investor presentation, which can be found on its IR website.
In summary, CNA's underlying P&C results were healthy, but it's contribution to our Q3 results was hurt by the interest rate-driven LTC active life reserve charge and the modest adverse prior year development in P&C.
Turning to Diamond Offshore. Diamond contributed a net loss of $48 million in Q3 2019 as compared to a net loss of $27 million last year, reflecting the continued difficult conditions in the offshore drilling market.
Contract drilling revenues declined 14%, while Diamond's contract drilling expenses increased 7%. Revenue earning days were actually up 14%, but this was more than offset by a 24% decline in average daily revenue earned. The drivers of the revenue decline were rigs working at lower day rates as well as shipyard time for 2 of the company's high-spec drillships, which had previously been earning day rates well above current market.
As a reminder, Diamond incurred the cost of a legal settlement in last year's third quarter, which reduced our net income in that quarter by $8 million.
Boardwalk's contribution to our net income was basically flat year-over-year at $29 million. As revenue declines from contract expirations and restructuring were more than offset by revenues from growth projects recently placed into service.
Operating margins declined somewhat, however, in part, due to the timing of maintenance expenses.
Loews Hotels had a noisy third quarter, as it contributed $3 million to our net income in Q3, down from $11 million in last year's third quarter. There were 2 main reasons for the year-over-year decline in net income contribution. The first was the substantial disruption caused by the threat of Hurricane Dorian, which caused widespread cancellations at the company's properties in Orlando and Miami Beach. And the second were preopening expenses incurred in connection with properties under development, including properties in Orlando, Kansas City and Arlington, Texas.
As Jim said, and I'd remind you, what with so much hotel development activity taking place, the company's underlying earnings will continue to be masked by preopening and startup costs.
Loews Hotels' adjusted EBITDA, which is disclosed in our quarterly earnings supplement, also declined year-over-year. The hurricane-related disruption at the company's Florida properties was a major factor. Additionally, 3 properties were divested since last year's third quarter with 1 property leaving the chain altogether, and 2 becoming managed-only hotels.
Despite what appears to be a weak quarter, Loews Hotels continues to expand its footprint and post improved results at many of its properties.
Turning to the parent company. Pretax investment income was $36 million, up $31 million from the prior year's third quarter, driven by returns on equities and short-term investments. 
During Q3 2019, we received $111 million in dividends from our subsidiaries, $85 million from CNA and $26 million from Boardwalk.
We repurchased 3.4 million shares during the third quarter at an aggregate cost of $168 million. Repurchased an additional 1.8 million shares since quarter end for about $90 million. We have repurchased 15 million shares during 2019 for just over $730 million, representing almost 5% of our shares outstanding at year-end 2018.
Loews ended the quarter with $3.5 billion in parent company cash and investments with cash and equivalents accounting for over 75% of the portfolio. 
Let me now turn it back to Mary."

We are impressed by the operational discipline that they've brought to the business, and we're also impressed by their efforts to mitigate the risk of this business. The quarter's reserve unlocking, which was caused by the current interest rate outlook, it doesn't change our view in any way.
Let me step back and give you a bit of history. About 1 dozen years ago, the CNA management team decided that while the long-term care block of business is in runoff, it still needs to be vigorously and strategically managed. So CNA selected some of the best and the brightest within the company to run the business as a business, actively managing it from every angle. They looked it from operations, claims, actuarial and more. The goal was to aggressively mitigate the risk and to manage the liability. Changing the mindset from it being a runoff business to an active business has been critical in this whole process.
So the new team set about gaining a deeper understanding of the business, not just actuarially but every factor of the business. This understanding has led the team to identify opportunities to mitigate the risks, such as more supportable rate increase filings and offerings to policyholders that benefit them while also enabling CNA to reduce risk.
I truly believe that CNA's actuarial understanding of its block of business is much deeper than it has ever been. Just 2 years ago, CNA moved to what's called first principles reserving, and that gave it the ability to slice and dice the blocks much more deeply than they previously could. One huge advantage of the company's actuarial advances has been the ability to support ratings increases with much more targeted and credible data, including data from over 100,000 claims that the company has already processed. When I take a look at the assumptions made in the company's last unlocking in 2015 compared to the current unlocking, what I see on that is a business that is actually pretty reasonably predictable in the medium term. I don't want to diminish the long-term tail risk but over the medium term, our block of businesses performed basically in line with our expectations with a major exception of interest rates.
Here are some facts that I find compelling. So since the end of 2015, total claims paid are 2% lower than expected, our active policy count is 5% lower than expected and the total claim count during that period is slightly lower than expected. These broad measures help to define the risk in the block, and they were all predicted quite accurately in the context of a 5-year time frame. 
So what CNA got wrong was the interest rate and the spread environment, a problem that's being addressed this quarter. So while I understand there's a lot of noise around the various long-term care blocks, what I have seen firsthand at CNA is that with the right data, with the management focused and with the appropriate resources thrown at the problem, these blocks are more predictable than I think most outsiders have come to believe."

Loews had a much better quarter than the numbers might indicate, with our largest subsidiary CNA contributing positively to our results.
CNA is continuing to see solid growth in rate, which increased about 6% across the P&C business. Even as rate increased, retention remained in line with past quarters at 83%. New business also increased 10% over the last year's third quarter. While higher rates and new business growth are already flowing through net written premiums, which are up about 8% compared to the prior year, the full positive impact will take time to be reflected in earned premiums.
Additionally, the third quarter is our -- is the time when CNA reviews its long-term care book of business. For the first time since 2015, CNA's assumptions were unlocked, resulting in a third quarter after-tax charge at CNA of $170 million. The charge predominantly relates to expectations for lower interest rates in both the short and long term. As a reminder, this is a GAAP charge that has no impact on statutory capital. Also this charge was partially offset by a $44 million after-tax release from CNA's long-term care claims reserves.
As of my custom, every quarter I pick a few key topics to talk about. This quarter, I'd like to focus on capital allocation and the growth prospects for several of our subsidiaries. 
Loews typically allocates capital at the holding company in 3 ways:  share repurchases; investing in our subsidiaries; and acquiring a new subsidiary. Over the past 5 years, we've allocated capital using all 3 of these levers. As anyone who follows us knows, stock buybacks are a primary capital allocation tool and a significant means of creating shareholder value at Loews. In 2014, Loews had 30% more shares outstanding than at the end of this quarter. In 2018, Loews spent a little over $1 billion to repurchase about 20 million of its shares.
So far in 2019, we've spent about $725 million to repurchase approximately 14.5 million shares. That means that over the past 22 months, we've repurchased over 10% of our outstanding float. As you might imagine, we believe these purchases will prove to be accretive for long-term Loews' shareholders.
Our second capital allocation lever is investing in our subsidiaries, the businesses and industries we know best. Loews Corporation's recent investments in Loews Hotels provide a good illustration of this lever. Since 2014, the parent company has supported Loews Hotels' growth with an investment of $820 million, and has received over 80% back from the hotel company for a net investment of nearly $140 million through the end of the third quarter of 2019. During this period of expansion and development, Loews Hotels has grown its adjusted EBITDA from $123 million in 2014 to $228 million in 2018.
Loews Hotels continues to focus on its strategy of attracting group business as well as developing properties near demand generators, such as sports stadiums and the Universal Orlando theme parks. In pursuing this strategy, the hotel company has found its niche as a developer, owner and operator. 
Since most of its competitors are not able to fulfill all 3 of these functions, Loews Hotels has a unique sweet spot. As a partner for municipalities and developers, it has the capacity to co-invest and provide meaningful input on the design and development of new construction and to manage the hotels' operations upon completion.
As the portfolio of hotels continues to grow through ground-up development, it will take time for these investments to produce a noticeable return, as development cost, preopening expenses and ramp up periods for each new hotel somewhat obscure initial results.
Our third level for capital allocation is adding another leg to the proverbial stool. In 2017, we acquired Consolidated Container Company for approximately $1.2 billion, consisting of $600 million in cash and $600 million of debt at the CCC level. This acquisition gave Loews our toehold in the packaging industry. Over the past 2 years, CCC has added 6 tuck-in acquisitions, all of which were funded at the CCC level. These acquisitions added scale at extremely attractive post-synergy multiples and increased CCC's presence in higher-growth pharmaceutical segments.
It's worth noting that Loews does not frequently acquire subsidiaries. And given the sky-high valuations in today's market, I don't see that changing. Multiples have moved higher as the private equity world has become accustomed to easy money. Low interest rates, leading to cheap and readily available debt financing, make levered acquisitions possible, even at these precipitous multiples, a game that we are unwilling to play. 
Now I want to talk briefly about growth prospects of CNA environment.
At CNA, we remain very bullish, both on the fundamentals of the insurance industry and on CNA's growth trajectory, which is fueled by the strength of the team that they have put together. CNA will continue to focus on maintaining and improving its strong underwriting culture, recruiting and retaining top talent, leveraging technology and expanding distributions. These steps will enable CNA to capitalize on its organic growth opportunities. If you talk to Dino Robusto, CNA's CEO, he'll tell you that there's plenty of room for organic growth.
The focus for Diamond Offshore is quite different. The company is less occupied with growth and more occupied with managing its liquidity. Diamond continues to concentrate on controlling its cost structure, strengthening its balance sheet and building its revenue backlog. Even as Diamond has kept its foundation solid, it continues to develop process innovations that make it more efficient and a value-added partner for its customers. 
Finally, last year, we began making more detailed information available on our website about our subsidiaries strategies and mid- to long-term prospects for growth. In response to your request, we have updated and reposted these presentations for CCC, CNA, Diamond Offshore and Loews Hotels, all narrated by their respective CEOs and leadership teams.
We're happy to provide these virtual investor day-style presentations, and we encourage you to listen to them and reach out to us if you have any questions.
And without further -- any further ado, I'll hand the call over to David Edelson, Loews' CFO."

Page 13 of our earnings supplement sets forth the key quarterly drivers, a quick summary of the quarter.
CNA accounted for most of the year-over-year decline in net income, largely due to the strengthening of its long-term care active life reserves. CNA's property and casualty results also reflected in modest reserve charge this year compared to a meaningful reserve release in Q3 of last year. Importantly, however, underlying P&C underwriting results at CNA continued to show improvement.
Boardwalk's earnings contribution was essentially flat with the prior year, whereas contributions from Diamond and Loews Hotels were down for reasons I'll explain shortly.
Parent company investment income showed a nice year-over-year quarterly increase, driven mainly by better returns on equities and short-term investments.
Now for more detail.
CNA's after-tax earnings contribution was $96 million, down from $300 million in Q3 2018. Let me start by focusing on the positive, which is continued progress in CNA's core P&C business. The underlying combined ratio was 94.6%, the same as last quarter and almost 1 point better than full year 2018. Net written premium was up 8% in the quarter and rate was up almost 6%.
In what is typically a heavy quarter for catastrophe losses, CNA incurred only 1.8 points of cat losses compared to 2.6 points in last year's third quarter and 3.7 points for full year 2018. The year-over-year comparison for P&C, however, was hurt by a modest adverse prior year development compared to meaningful favorable prior year development in last year's third quarter. This adverse development was driven by legacy [ masteroid ] exposures in commercial and healthcare and specialty.
Several other lines in commercial and specialty, however, including surety and management liability, posted reserve releases during the quarter. Absent the impacts of prior year development in both periods, CNA's after-tax P&C underwriting income increased 33% from Q3 2018 to Q3 2019. 
CNA completed its review of its long-term care reserves this past quarter. As a reminder, CNA's GAAP long-term care reserves have 2 components: future policy benefits reserves, commonly referred to as active life reserves; as well as claims and claims adjustment expense reserves. 
During the quarter, CNA strengthened its active life reserves by $216 million pretax and released $56 million pretax from its claims and claims adjustment expense reserves. To put these numbers in perspective, at June 30, 2019, CNA had over $9 billion of GAAP active life reserves and almost $3 billion of GAAP claims reserves. CNA assesses the adequacy of its GAAP long-term care active life reserves annually by performing what's known as a gross premium valuation, or GPV. 
In the GPV, management uses its current best estimate actuarial assumptions to calculate required reserves. If the required reserves exceed recorded reserves, an unlocking occurs and active life reserves are increased based on the current best estimate assumptions. CNA -- as Jim said, CNA last unlocked its LTC active life reserves at year-end 2015. The company subsequently conducted reviews of these reserves in each of 2016, 2017 and 2018 and concluded that no unlocking was necessary.
In this year's third quarter, when CNA applied its current best estimate actuarial assumptions to its LTC active life reserves, the result was an approximate $400 million increase in required reserves. The interest rate environment caused the CNA to lower its assumed future new money rates and thus, its discount rate. 
While there were gives and takes with respect to other actuarial assumptions, such as morbidity, persistency and premium rate actions, lowering the discount rate drove the unlocking. Given that the CNA had a $182 million of margin in its active life reserves before the review, this $400 million reserve increase resulted in a $216 million pretax strengthening of CNA's active life reserves.
Note that this is a GAAP reserve charge and does not impact CNA's statutory long-term care reserves.
The strengthening of the active life reserves and the release from the claims and claims adjustment expense reserves taken together, reduce Loews' net income by $112 million in Q3. Recall that in last year's third quarter, CNA booked a claims reserves release that added $21 million to our net income.
CNA has disclosed more information about its long-term care business in its quarterly investor presentation, which can be found on its IR website.
In summary, CNA's underlying P&C results were healthy, but its contribution to our Q3 results was hurt by the interest rate-driven LTC active life reserve charge and the modest adverse prior year development in P&C.
Turning to Diamond Offshore. Diamond contributed a net loss of $48 million in Q3 2019 as compared to a net loss of $27 million last year, reflecting the continued difficult conditions in the offshore drilling market.
Contract drilling revenues declined 14%, while Diamond's contract drilling expenses increased 7%. Revenue earning days were actually up 14%, but this was more than offset by a 24% decline in average daily revenue earned. The drivers of the revenue decline were rigs working at lower day rates as well as shipyard time for 2 of the company's high-spec drillships, which had previously been earning day rates well above current market.
As a reminder, Diamond incurred the cost of a legal settlement in last year's third quarter, which reduced our net income in that quarter by $8 million.
Boardwalk's contribution to our net income was basically flat year-over-year at $29 million. As revenue declines from contract expirations and restructuring were more than offset by revenues from growth projects recently placed into service.
Operating margins declined somewhat, however, in part, due to the timing of maintenance expenses.
Loews Hotels had a noisy third quarter, as it contributed $3 million to our net income in Q3, down from $11 million in last year's third quarter. There were 2 main reasons for the year-over-year decline in net income contribution. The first was the substantial disruption caused by the threat of Hurricane Dorian, which caused widespread cancellations at the company's properties in Orlando and Miami Beach. And the second were preopening expenses incurred in connection with properties under development, including properties in Orlando, Kansas City and Arlington, Texas.
As Jim said, and I'd remind you, what with so much hotel development activity taking place, the company's underlying earnings will continue to be masked by preopening and startup costs.
Loews Hotels' adjusted EBITDA, which is disclosed in our quarterly earnings supplement, also declined year-over-year. The hurricane-related disruption at the company's Florida properties was a major factor. Additionally, 3 properties were divested since last year's third quarter, with 1 property leaving the chain altogether, and 2 becoming managed-only hotels.
Despite what appears to be a weak quarter, Loews Hotels continues to expand its footprint and post improved results at many of its properties.
Turning to the parent company. Pretax investment income was $36 million, up $31 million from the prior year's third quarter, driven by returns on equities and short-term investments. 
During Q3 2019, we received $111 million in dividends from our subsidiaries, $85 million from CNA and $26 million from Boardwalk.
We repurchased 3.4 million shares during the third quarter at an aggregate cost of $168 million. We purchased an additional 1.8 million shares since quarter end for about $90 million. We have repurchased 15 million shares during 2019 for just over $730 million, representing almost 5% of our shares outstanding at year-end 2018.
Loews ended the quarter with $3.5 billion in parent company cash and investments, with cash and equivalents accounting for over 75% of the portfolio. 
Let me now turn it back to Mary."

We are impressed by the operational discipline that they've brought to the business, and we're also impressed by their efforts to mitigate the risk of this business. The quarter's reserve unlocking, which was caused by the current interest rate outlook, it doesn't change our view in any way.
Let me step back and give you a bit of history. About 1 dozen years ago, the CNA management team decided that while the long-term care block of business is in runoff, it still needs to be vigorously and strategically managed. So CNA selected some of the best and the brightest within the company to run the business as a business, actively managing it from every angle. They looked it from operations, claims, actuarial and more. The goal was to aggressively mitigate the risk and to manage the liability. Changing the mindset from it being a runoff business to an active business has been critical in this whole process.
So the new team set about gaining a deeper understanding of the business, not just actuarially, but every factor of the business. This understanding has led the team to identify opportunities to mitigate the risks, such as more supportable rate increase filings and offerings to policyholders that benefit them, while also enabling CNA to reduce risk.
I truly believe that CNA's actuarial understanding of its block of business is much deeper than it has ever been. Just 2 years ago, CNA moved to what's called first principles reserving, and that gave it the ability to slice and dice the blocks much more deeply than they previously could. 
One huge advantage of the company's actuarial advances has been the ability to support ratings increases with much more targeted and credible data, including data from over 100,000 claims that the company has already processed. 
When I take a look at the assumptions made in the company's last unlocking in 2015 compared to the current unlocking, what I see on net is a business that is actually pretty reasonably predictable in the medium term. I don't want to diminish the long-term tail risk, but over the medium term, our block of businesses performed basically in line with our expectations, with a major exception of interest rates.
Here are some facts that I find compelling. So since the end of 2015, total claims paid are 2% lower than expected, our active policy count is 5% lower than expected and the total claim count during that period is slightly lower than expected. These broad measures help to define the risk in the block, and they were all predicted quite accurately in the context of a 5-year time frame. 
So what CNA got wrong was the interest rate and the spread environment, a problem that's being addressed this quarter. So while I understand there's a lot of noise around the various long-term care blocks, what I have seen firsthand at CNA is that with the right data, with the management focused and with the appropriate resources thrown at the problem, these blocks are more predictable than I think most outsiders have come to believe."

Loews had a much better quarter than the numbers might indicate, with our largest subsidiary CNA contributing positively to our results.
CNA is continuing to see solid growth in rate, which increased about 6% across the P&C business. Even as rate increased, retention remained in line with past quarters at 83%. New business also increased 10% over the last year's third quarter. While higher rates and new business growth are already flowing through net written premiums, which are up about 8% compared to the prior year, the full positive impact will take time to be reflected in earned premiums.
Additionally, the third quarter is our -- is the time when CNA reviews its long-term care book of business. For the first time since 2015, CNA's assumptions were unlocked, resulting in a third quarter after-tax charge at CNA of $170 million. The charge predominantly relates to expectations for lower interest rates in both the short and long term. As a reminder, this is a GAAP charge that has no impact on statutory capital. Also this charge was partially offset by a $44 million after-tax release from CNA's long-term care claims reserves.
As of my custom, every quarter I pick a few key topics to talk about. This quarter, I'd like to focus on capital allocation and the growth prospects for several of our subsidiaries. 
Loews typically allocates capital at the holding company in 3 ways:  share repurchases; investing in our subsidiaries; and acquiring a new subsidiary. Over the past 5 years, we've allocated capital using all 3 of these levers. As anyone who follows us knows, stock buybacks are a primary capital allocation tool and a significant means of creating shareholder value at Loews. In 2014, Loews had 30% more shares outstanding than at the end of this quarter. In 2018, Loews spent a little over $1 billion to repurchase about 20 million of its shares.
So far in 2019, we've spent about $725 million to repurchase approximately 14.5 million shares. That means that over the past 22 months, we've repurchased over 10% of our outstanding float. As you might imagine, we believe these purchases will prove to be accretive for long-term Loews' shareholders.
Our second capital allocation lever is investing in our subsidiaries, the businesses and industries we know best. Loews Corporation's recent investments in Loews Hotels provide a good illustration of this lever. Since 2014, the parent company has supported Loews Hotels' growth with an investment of $820 million, and has received over 80% back from the hotel company for a net investment of nearly $140 million through the end of the third quarter of 2019. During this period of expansion and development, Loews Hotels has grown its adjusted EBITDA from $123 million in 2014 to $228 million in 2018.
Loews Hotels continues to focus on its strategy of attracting group business as well as developing properties near demand generators, such as sports stadiums and the Universal Orlando theme parks. In pursuing this strategy, the hotel company has found its niche as a developer, owner and operator. 
Since most of its competitors are not able to fulfill all 3 of these functions, Loews Hotels has a unique sweet spot. As a partner for municipalities and developers, it has the capacity to co-invest and provide meaningful input on the design and development of new construction and to manage the hotels' operations upon completion.
As the portfolio of hotels continues to grow through ground-up development, it will take time for these investments to produce a noticeable return, as development cost, preopening expenses and ramp up periods for each new hotel somewhat obscure initial results.
Our third level for capital allocation is adding another leg to the proverbial stool. In 2017, we acquired Consolidated Container Company for approximately $1.2 billion, consisting of $600 million in cash and $600 million of debt at the CCC level. This acquisition gave Loews our toehold in the packaging industry. Over the past 2 years, CCC has added 6 tuck-in acquisitions, all of which were funded at the CCC level. These acquisitions added scale at extremely attractive post-synergy multiples and increased CCC's presence in higher-growth pharmaceutical segments.
It's worth noting that Loews does not frequently acquire subsidiaries. And given the sky-high valuations in today's market, I don't see that changing. Multiples have moved higher as the private equity world has become accustomed to easy money. Low interest rates, leading to cheap and readily available debt financing, make levered acquisitions possible, even at these precipitous multiples, a game that we are unwilling to play. 
Now I want to talk briefly about growth prospects of CNA environment.
At CNA, we remain very bullish, both on the fundamentals of the insurance industry and on CNA's growth trajectory, which is fueled by the strength of the team that they have put together. CNA will continue to focus on maintaining and improving its strong underwriting culture, recruiting and retaining top talent, leveraging technology and expanding distributions. These steps will enable CNA to capitalize on its organic growth opportunities. If you talk to Dino Robusto, CNA's CEO, he'll tell you that there's plenty of room for organic growth.
The focus for Diamond Offshore is quite different. The company is less occupied with growth and more occupied with managing its liquidity. Diamond continues to concentrate on controlling its cost structure, strengthening its balance sheet and building its revenue backlog. Even as Diamond has kept its foundation solid, it continues to develop process innovations that make it more efficient and a value-added partner for its customers. 
Finally, last year, we began making more detailed information available on our website about our subsidiaries strategies and mid- to long-term prospects for growth. In response to your request, we have updated and reposted these presentations for CCC, CNA, Diamond Offshore and Loews Hotels, all narrated by their respective CEOs and leadership teams.
We're happy to provide these virtual investor day-style presentations, and we encourage you to listen to them and reach out to us if you have any questions.
And without further -- any further ado, I'll hand the call over to David Edelson, Loews' CFO."

For the third quarter, Loews reported net income of $72 million or $0.24 per share, down from $278 million or $0.88 per share in last year's third quarter.Page 13 of our earnings supplement sets forth the key",1287,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. For the third quarter, Loews reported net income of $72 million or $0.24 per share, down from $278 million or $0.88 per share in last year's third quarter.
Page 13 of our earnings supplement sets forth the key quarterly drivers, a quick summary of the quarter.
CNA accounted for most of the year-over-year decline in net income, largely due to the strengthening of its long-term care active life reserves. CNA's property and casualty results also reflected in modest reserve charge this year compared to a meaningful reserve release in Q3 of last year. Importantly, however, underlying P&C underwriting results at CNA continued to show improvement.
Boardwalk's earnings contribution was essentially flat with the prior year, whereas contributions from Diamond and Loews Hotels were down for reasons I'll explain shortly.
Parent company investment income showed a nice year-over-year quarterly increase, driven mainly by better returns on equities and short-term investments.
Now for more detail.
CNA's after-tax earnings contribution was $96 million, down from $300 million in Q3 2018. Let me start by focusing on the positive, which is continued progress in CNA's core P&C business. The underlying combined ratio was 94.6%, the same as last quarter and almost 1 point better than full year 2018. Net written premium was up 8% in the quarter and rate was up almost 6%.
In what is typically a heavy quarter for catastrophe losses, CNA incurred only 1.8 points of cat losses compared to 2.6 points in last year's third quarter and 3.7 points for full year 2018. The year-over-year comparison for P&C, however, was hurt by a modest adverse prior year development compared to meaningful favorable prior year development in last year's third quarter. This adverse development was driven by legacy [ masteroid ] exposures in commercial and healthcare and specialty.
Several other lines in commercial and specialty, however, including surety and management liability, posted reserve releases during the quarter. Absent the impacts of prior year development in both periods, CNA's after-tax P&C underwriting income increased 33% from Q3 2018 to Q3 2019. 
CNA completed its review of its long-term care reserves this past quarter. As a reminder, CNA's GAAP long-term care reserves have 2 components: future policy benefits reserves, commonly referred to as active life reserves; as well as claims and claims adjustment expense reserves. 
During the quarter, CNA strengthened its active life reserves by $216 million pretax and released $56 million pretax from its claims and claims adjustment expense reserves. To put these numbers in perspective, at June 30, 2019, CNA had over $9 billion of GAAP active life reserves and almost $3 billion of GAAP claims reserves. CNA assesses the adequacy of its GAAP long-term care active life reserves annually by performing what's known as a gross premium valuation, or GPV. 
In the GPV, management uses its current best estimate actuarial assumptions to calculate required reserves. If the required reserves exceed recorded reserves, an unlocking occurs and active life reserves are increased based on the current best estimate assumptions. CNA -- as Jim said, CNA last unlocked its LTC active life reserves at year-end 2015. The company subsequently conducted reviews of these reserves in each of 2016, 2017 and 2018 and concluded that no unlocking was necessary.
In this year's third quarter, when CNA applied its current best estimate actuarial assumptions to its LTC active life reserves, the result was an approximate $400 million increase in required reserves. The interest rate environment caused the CNA to lower its assumed future new money rates and thus, its discount rate. 
While there were gives and takes with respect to other actuarial assumptions, such as morbidity, persistency and premium rate actions, lowering the discount rate drove the unlocking. Given that the CNA had a $182 million of margin in its active life reserves before the review, this $400 million reserve increase resulted in a $216 million pretax strengthening of CNA's active life reserves.
Note that this is a GAAP reserve charge and does not impact CNA's statutory long-term care reserves.
The strengthening of the active life reserves and the release from the claims and claims adjustment expense reserves taken together, reduce Loews' net income by $112 million in Q3. Recall that in last year's third quarter, CNA booked a claims reserves release that added $21 million to our net income.
CNA has disclosed more information about its long-term care business in its quarterly investor presentation, which can be found on its IR website.
In summary, CNA's underlying P&C results were healthy, but its contribution to our Q3 results was hurt by the interest rate-driven LTC active life reserve charge and the modest adverse prior year development in P&C.
Turning to Diamond Offshore. Diamond contributed a net loss of $48 million in Q3 2019 as compared to a net loss of $27 million last year, reflecting the continued difficult conditions in the offshore drilling market.
Contract drilling revenues declined 14%, while Diamond's contract drilling expenses increased 7%. Revenue earning days were actually up 14%, but this was more than offset by a 24% decline in average daily revenue earned. The drivers of the revenue decline were rigs working at lower day rates as well as shipyard time for 2 of the company's high-spec drillships, which had previously been earning day rates well above current market.
As a reminder, Diamond incurred the cost of a legal settlement in last year's third quarter, which reduced our net income in that quarter by $8 million.
Boardwalk's contribution to our net income was basically flat year-over-year at $29 million. As revenue declines from contract expirations and restructuring were more than offset by revenues from growth projects recently placed into service.
Operating margins declined somewhat, however, in part, due to the timing of maintenance expenses.
Loews Hotels had a noisy third quarter, as it contributed $3 million to our net income in Q3, down from $11 million in last year's third quarter. There were 2 main reasons for the year-over-year decline in net income contribution. The first was the substantial disruption caused by the threat of Hurricane Dorian, which caused widespread cancellations at the company's properties in Orlando and Miami Beach. And the second were preopening expenses incurred in connection with properties under development, including properties in Orlando, Kansas City and Arlington, Texas.
As Jim said, and I'd remind you, what with so much hotel development activity taking place, the company's underlying earnings will continue to be masked by preopening and startup costs.
Loews Hotels' adjusted EBITDA, which is disclosed in our quarterly earnings supplement, also declined year-over-year. The hurricane-related disruption at the company's Florida properties was a major factor. Additionally, 3 properties were divested since last year's third quarter, with 1 property leaving the chain altogether, and 2 becoming managed-only hotels.
Despite what appears to be a weak quarter, Loews Hotels continues to expand its footprint and post improved results at many of its properties.
Turning to the parent company. Pretax investment income was $36 million, up $31 million from the prior year's third quarter, driven by returns on equities and short-term investments. 
During Q3 2019, we received $111 million in dividends from our subsidiaries, $85 million from CNA and $26 million from Boardwalk.
We repurchased 3.4 million shares during the third quarter at an aggregate cost of $168 million. We purchased an additional 1.8 million shares since quarter end for about $90 million. We have repurchased 15 million shares during 2019 for just over $730 million, representing almost 5% of our shares outstanding at year-end 2018.
Loews ended the quarter with $3.5 billion in parent company cash and investments, with cash and equivalents accounting for over 75% of the portfolio. 
Let me now turn it back to Mary."

We are impressed by the operational discipline that they've brought to the business, and we're also impressed by their efforts to mitigate the risk of this business. The quarter's reserve unlocking, which was caused by the current interest rate outlook, it doesn't change our view in any way.
Let me step back and give you a bit of history. About 1 dozen years ago, the CNA management team decided that while the long-term care block of business is in runoff, it still needs to be vigorously and strategically managed. So CNA selected some of the best and the brightest within the company to run the business as a business, actively managing it from every angle. They looked it from operations, claims, actuarial and more. The goal was to aggressively mitigate the risk and to manage the liability. Changing the mindset from it being a runoff business to an active business has been critical in this whole process.
So the new team set about gaining a deeper understanding of the business, not just actuarially, but every factor of the business. This understanding has led the team to identify opportunities to mitigate the risks, such as more supportable rate increase filings and offerings to policyholders that benefit them, while also enabling CNA to reduce risk.
I truly believe that CNA's actuarial understanding of its block of business is much deeper than it has ever been. Just 2 years ago, CNA moved to what's called first principles reserving, and that gave it the ability to slice and dice the blocks much more deeply than they previously could. 
One huge advantage of the company's actuarial advances has been the ability to support ratings increases with much more targeted and credible data, including data from over 100,000 claims that the company has already processed. 
When I take a look at the assumptions made in the company's last unlocking in 2015 compared to the current unlocking, what I see on net is a business that is actually pretty reasonably predictable in the medium term. I don't want to diminish the long-term tail risk, but over the medium term, our block of businesses performed basically in line with our expectations, with a major exception of interest rates.
Here are some facts that I find compelling. So since the end of 2015, total claims paid are 2% lower than expected, our active policy count is 5% lower than expected and the total claim count during that period is slightly lower than expected. These broad measures help to define the risk in the block, and they were all predicted quite accurately in the context of a 5-year time frame. 
So what CNA got wrong was the interest rate and the spread environment, a problem that's being addressed this quarter. So while I understand there's a lot of noise around the various long-term care blocks, what I have seen firsthand at CNA is that with the right data, with the management focused and with the appropriate resources thrown at the problem, these blocks are more predictable than I think most outsiders have come to believe."
